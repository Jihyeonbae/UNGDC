      "I consider it a great honour and privilege to share with you the opportunities and responsibilities of the United Nations on this momentous occasion. This world Organization embodies the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of the world for peace, prosperity and prospects of a better and more fruitful life, It is our task to reaffirm and to help realize the aims and purposes which are expressed in the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations with a degree of eloquence that only the urgent desire of a generation which had suffered the scourges of two world wars could formulate. It is for us, the representatives of Members of the United Nations, never to become oblivious to the sufferings and experiences which created the urgent desire to pursue the aims and the purposes of the United Nations. We must solemnly rededicate ourselves every day in discharging our functions. We must pledge ourselves to serve humanity. We must persist in our efforts in searching for ways and means of preserving peace. We must promote and safeguard the freedom of individuals and nations and relieve the stark poverty and conditions of starvation which unhappily is the lot of a great segment of the human race.\n",
      "In order to accomplish these ends, we must push forward the cultural, economic and social development of the under-developed areas of the world through the aid and assistance of the United Nations in all its phases. In the realization of these aims and objectives, happily the moral duties of the peoples of the United Nations, for which their collective conscience acts as their guide, coincides with their collective practical self-interest.\n",
      "Peace with freedom is the prime requisite and the essential and critical condition for nations as well as for individuals in order that they may fully develop their mental, moral and physical potentialities and resources for producing good and desirable results. Only in a world political atmosphere which is free from suspicion, tension and fear of international conflicts and struggles can the fullest development of human and material resources of any nation, and especially of the lesser developed nations, be achieved. It is the solemn duty of the Member nations and their representatives here to search and find ways and means of allaying suspicion and fear among nations and to restore confidence in the ability of this Organization to preserve peace and promote freedom â€” the necessary conditions for the alleviation of misery, poverty, ignorance and disease in this world.\n",
      "Peace and security must be established on the firm foundations of equality and justice, No self-serving formula of established interests should obscure the issue of the aspirations of the peoples for individual freedom and national independence. In our search for peace, no differences in ideologies or political and economic doctrines, ho differences in faiths and professed beliefs should be allowed to stand in the way. The dangers are so great that no failure can be admitted. The very survival of the human race is at stake. The survival of the human race must have precedence over any narrow national aspirations or ideological issues. We must persist in our hope and work during the session of the General Assembly for the adoption of effective measures to reduce suspicions and fears among nations. We must promote the realization of the aspiration for personal freedom and national independence of the peoples who are still deprived of those basic elementary human rights. We must formulate and adopt effective measures to preserve peace. We must provide favourable conditions for the fullest utilization of technical assistance and find the funds so necessary for development in the under-developed areas of the world.\n",
      "I am sure that our collective dedicated efforts will move aside the apparent mountains of obstacles which seem to lie in the way. I am sure that with our collective dedicated efforts, even in this seventh session of the General Assembly we may be able to take important steps towards the realization of our noble and useful goals.\n",
      "It is my privilege to express to you, Mr. President, the congratulations of the Afghanistan delegation on your election, which was so justly and unanimously voted by this Assembly. It is also my privilege to extend to my fellow representatives the greetings of the Royal Afghan Government, as well as its sincerest wishes for the success of the current session of the General Assembly.\n",
      "Our attachment to the United Nations and its Charter and principles and our complete adherence to the principles of human rights and self-determination of the peoples not only are based on ideological grounds but also result from our long experience as a free and small country in the controversial events of modern history. We believe that the peace of the world can be secured only on those bases, and we are certain that our future prosperity depends on peace. In saying that, we are not posing as moralists but, on the contrary, are in all humility expressing our conviction that our fellow Member States are as attached to those principles as we are.\n",
      "The attitude of the Afghanistan delegation at previous sessions of the Assembly has been inspired by those principles, and that will continue to be the case during the current session. This attitude is not characterized by any kind of opposition towards any country or group of countries, or by any idea which is different from the basic ideal of the United Nations that is, that there should be no distinction among Member States based on geographical considerations.\n",
      "This world has been the scene of tremendous evolution in the last twelve years. The nationalist movements of the African and Asian continents have been as natural as those of the European and American continents during the last century. Thus, if we have supported those movements, it has been only on the basis of an objective appreciation of that fact and because of our sincere desire that the problems of the world should be settled by mutual understanding and goodwill, and not by violent reactions and bloodshed. We likewise follow the same line today, without an antagonistic or fanatical feelings towards any other country.\n",
      "The independence of the Federation of Malaya and its admission to the United Nations constitute one of the best examples, not only of the justification of the rightful aspirations of a great nation but also of the generous gesture and appreciation of a great Power, the United Kingdom. Both of them are to be sincerely congratulated, and their examples should be followed in similar cases.\n",
      "We realize that the United Nations has had its difficulties and that present world problems are considered from many perspectives. We also realize that human problems are very complicated, that national political and economic problems play their role, and that each individual problem cannot be regarded in complete detachment from the currents of world problems. Notwithstanding these difficulties, however, there is no reason why we should not appreciate more the normal evolution of the world.\n",
      "Fortunately, we realize that this great Organization, through the zeal of its eminent Secretary-General and its devoted officials, has gone forward along the path traced for it twelve years ago. This is a cause for hope and an evidence of progress; and we believe that through our devotion and adherence to the principles and spirit of the Charter we shall gradually overcome many other difficulties.\n",
      "Our optimism is based on the consciousness of the peoples of the world that, if we are to have peace, there is no alternative but ultimately to identify our respective policies with the spirit of the Charter. Each and every one of us is convinced that another war would bring nothing but the complete annihilation of all that is good, worth-while and beautiful in life - and perhaps of life itself.\n",
      "We Afghans have no other ambition that to preserve our freedom and to try to ensure the prosperity of our own people in order that they may live as a modern nation in this world. We are attached to our traditions and our spiritual legacy as well as to our Constitution, which is the spontaneous outgrowth of the nature of our own country. We are trying to preserve them, and we are ready, as we have always been, to defend our freedom and integrity - and not only by words. Fortunately, the stability of our position and the sincerity of our neutrality have been tested and proved in the last fifth years, and especially during the two world wars. To develop and modernize our country we need the support and assistance of more developed countries, and we are grateful to receive such aid.\n",
      "We greatly appreciate the technical assistance we have received from the United Nations; we appreciate it for its own value, as well as for the opportunity it has given us for closer co-operation with this world Organization.\n",
      "Afghanistan believes in the peaceful settlement of international differences and problems, great or small. We have tried in the past, with success, to settle many of our own problems through direct negotiations, the use of good offices, the advice and technical help of our friends, and other peaceful means of conciliation. We are trying now, and shall try in the future, to settle our other problems  by the same means, on the basis of objective, unprejudiced consideration and the principles of right and justice.\n",
      "In our view, as regards all problems of the world where conflicts arise, the ultimate reference of the unsettled problems should be, if ether conciliatory means of settlement fail, to the United Nations and the International Court of Justice. We have many important problems on our agenda this year which will be debated during the present session. The future of the world and the preservation of international peace depend on them. We hope, like everyone here, that those problems will find a satisfactory and just solution in the spirit of the United Nations Charter. To that end we are prepared to contribute in our modest way to facilitating such a solution.\n",
      "Before using this opportunity to make a statement on behalf of the Government of Afghanistan, I must say that the intervention of the Afghan delegation in the general debate is not merely for the purpose of following a practice which is almost customary on this occasion.\n",
      "We represent a small nation which is confronted with great problems of its own, and which is concerned with all international problems. The fulfilment of our aspirations and the solution of our problems depend not only on our own efforts but on international peace and co-operation. Therefore, we find it more essential than anybody else to voice our views in the United Nations, an Organization dedicated to the cause of peace and co-operation among nations. We shall not take the time of the General Assembly except to make a few general remarks about the international problems before the Assembly and to acquaint our colleagues with the principles that govern our policy and the spirit with which we shall approach these problems at a time when we find ourselves most concerned about the prevailing tension in different parts of the world.\n",
      "Having considered the agenda of this session, and having in mind the prevailing world situation, we know that the present session is one of the most important sessions in the history of the United Nations, not only because we are confronted with problems of great importance and significance, but also because of the undeniable fact that most of these problems are in their most important stage.\n",
      "It is essential that special consideration be given to the standing problems which have appeared repeatedly on the agenda of the General Assembly. We may face recent difficulties with a sense of consolation, and we may cherish a hope that these problems will be solved when they are dealt With by the United Nations. But in regard to problems which we have not been able to solve for many years, we should admit that we will not be in a position to seek excuses or cherish much hope if they are not approached in a more realistic and constructive manner at this session of the General Assembly. It cannot be denied that the solution of these long-standing problems would prevent new situations from arising and would pave the way for better understanding and more constructive international co-operation in areas where such co-operation has hitherto been hampered by the existing political differences.\n",
      "While we say this, we must add that due to the circumstances prevailing in different parts of the world, we cannot slur over the fact that the lack of a better understanding at this session might nullify the efforts made by the United Nations at previous sessions in connexion with certain problems, efforts which in certain cases could even have been considered constructive achievements.\n",
      "To give expression to our concerns, we are compelled to say that the situation in the Middle East, despite the efforts made at the emergency special session of the General Assembly, is still a source of anxiety and perplexity which cannot be ignored by the General Assembly. We are looking forward to a note of encouragement in the report of the Secretary-General, but we do not think that the resolution [1237 (ES-III)] adopted at the emergency special session is adequate to deal with the real causes of anxiety and tension in this area. The serious problems of this most important part of the world cannot be met successfully unless further effective measures are considered by the United Nations with the co-operation of the Arab States. My delegation stated its views on this issue at the emergency special session. The spirit of understanding demonstrated by the Arab States during that session was a source of great encouragement, not only to my delegation, which had expressed the wish that our friends in the Middle East would demonstrate such a spirit, but also to all Members of the United Nations and to people all over the world.\n",
      "The development of events in Algeria is most discouraging. The analysis of this situation, from our point of view confronts us with two disappointing facts. The first fact is that there is war in Algeria. The second fact is that the General Assembly resolution, adopted without any opposition, has not been implemented so as at least to create a basis for hope of a peaceful solution of this problem.\n",
      "It is a matter of regret if an unopposed resolution of the General Assembly does not receive the consideration of Member States. The results are more alarming than ever before.\n",
      "We sincerely hope that the parties concerned will realize even at this late hour the grave consequences involved in a careless consideration of this problem, which is already an issue of a \"hot\" war between two peoples who have every chance of being close friends, being bound by bonds which can be considered lasting ties between nations, in an age which is \"the age of the fulfilment of the aspirations of peoples and the end of Rule by Force\".\n",
      "We cannot think of any people who would be more capable of understanding the Algerian problem than the great people of France, with whom we have always had most friendly relations, a state of affairs which we have always kept in mind in the consideration of all matters, including the question of Algeria, and which we should always like to preserve.\n",
      "While the questions of Cyprus and West Irian remain unresolved, we are receiving alarming news from the Far East. It was a source of encouragement, however, when agreement was reached on holding the ambassadorial talks which have begun in Warsaw. We do hope that a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan problem will result from these direct negotiations. Whatever the outcome may be, the spirit and the quick decision of the parties concerned to negotiate should be appreciated. We hope that the same spirit will come to the assistance of the parties directly concerned with the problems of West Irian and Cyprus.\n",
      "We still note that the stubborn and unjust policies of certain Powers continue in the face of the struggle of millions of people for their natural and legitimate right to independence and their exercise of the right of self-determination. In cherishing these aspirations, these people are no longer alone, as these are the common aspirations of all freedom-loving people and of all those who realize that the peace and security of the world cannot be achieved unless the fundamental right to national Independence is recognized for all peoples and nations.\n",
      "These common aspirations have been expressed repeatedly by the people of Asia and Africa and have been supported by the majority of the peace-loving nations of the world Inside and outside the United Nations. We wish to state that the Afghan delegation will follow its traditional policy of support of these peoples and will dedicate all its efforts to the cause of the self-determination of all peoples and nations.\n",
      "We note that the use of force is still in process. Actions and measures destroying stability and disturbing the balance of power in different areas are persistently prevailing and are being initiated in a careless manner. These are' all matters which should receive the serious consideration of the General Assembly.\n",
      "The important question of economic, social and cultural development of the less advanced areas of the world is one which should receive the consideration it fully deserves. Millions of people in the world are engaged in the difficult task of improving the economic, social and cultural conditions which, in most cases, were imposed upon them by unjust politics and unpleasant events of the past. Afghanistan is one these countries. Therefore we perhaps are in a position to realize more than anyone else the sufferings of these people, for we have learned much from the bitter experiences of the state of war during the last two centuries, which most happily resulted in the preservation of our independence but most unhappily imposed upon us the present economic and social conditions. While we wish to express our real appreciation of United Nations co-operation in this area, we would urge the Assembly to take more effective measures in this direction.\n",
      "Among the unfortunate factors which have hindered the achievement of satisfactory results in this field is the regrettable competition among nations in the arms race and the lack of confidence which has been standing in the way of disarmament and, consequently, in the way of the advancement of human progress and the maintenance of peace and security.\n",
      "The obstacles preventing the peaceful uses of new energies for the purpose of achieving a better life for the people of the world are an Integral part of this great impediment to the fulfilment of the common aspirations of man.\n",
      "No small nation can make a greater contribution than to give expression to its concern on the question of disarmament, as it is a matter which cannot be solved except by the good intentions and the realization of the responsibilities of the big Powers. Nevertheless, it remains a source of great anxiety for all peoples everywhere. We hope that no effort will be spared to achieve satisfactory progress in this field and that this matter will be examined with concern for the welfare of humanity only and without regard to political differences and considerations of strategic positions.\n",
      "We believe that an agreement on principles on this issue would contribute greatly to peace and stability in the world and, by lessening international tension, would pave the way for further steps which could be taken in the direction of peace and prosperity,\n",
      "We should share the anxiety of all the people of the world concerning the destructive harm, known and unknown, resulting from radiation caused by nuclear tests, harm which can effect the health and happiness of mankind. In the light of scientific reports, we would find it almost impossible to understand why all nations would not immediately try to reach an agreement on this question. Since the achievement of these goals depends solely on the establishment of understanding and mutual confidence, the necessity of paying urgent consideration to ways and means of making it possible for nations to live in peace is obvious. Basing our views on the important consideration of the Interrelationship of all these matters, we shall support any measures which will create more amicable relationships out of which peace and prosperity could grow.\n",
      "References have been made recently to the possible creation of a United Nations peace force. My Government, having the utmost confidence in this Organization and hoping that the United Nations becomes increasingly effective as an Instrument of peace, believes that this idea requires most careful study, particularly in the prevailing international atmosphere. We feel that we should be most careful in our deliberations on this issue, because any hasty or half-considered measures in this field would involve dangers that might affect the Organization directly.\n",
      "While we are not prepared to go into the details of this matter at the present stage, we find it essential to mention that in any case the United Nations should deal with it only at the proper time and after thorough examination of the desirability of establishing such a force. The way for a thorough consideration of this matter can be paved only by greater efforts to be undertaken by the United Nations through the Secretary-General.\n",
      "We believe, in view of all these serious problems which confront the world, that there is only one place to seek a betterment of the conditions, and that place is the United Nations. It is not for one delegation to decide how great the responsibility of the United Nations is, and we should like to see that fact realized by all of us.\n",
      "It is our understanding that we are here with a spirit and a determination to practise tolerance, to make it possible for nations to live together in peace with one another as good neighbours and to unite their desire and their strength to ensure human brotherhood. Our purposes are set out in the Charter to which we all adhere.\n",
      "Our gatherings in the past, as we believe, have been useful and effective substitutions for war. Our presence here expresses our willingness to discuss, to negotiate and to compromise with each other. Our duty is to make this greatest international democracy of all time a working reality, for the purpose of securing universal justice and equality. Our prestige and success depend on our respect for fundamental human rights, the dignity of the individual, and that of peoples and of nations. This understanding will be the basis of any policy that the Afghan delegation adopts during this session of the General Assembly; Our Interest in the discussions of international affairs will not be limited to those things which affect us directly.\n",
      "While we do not believe that, when discussing the relations between peoples and nations, geographical distances deserve sole consideration and while we realize that these distances are mere fictions carried over from earlier days, we attach great importance to the common cultural heritage, common aspirations and mutual bonds of cordial and neighbourly relations which we share with friendly nations in our own part of the world.\n",
      "While we adhere firmly to our own ideology, we do not oppose any other ideology. We believe not only in the United Nations but in a united world within the United Nations, a principle which does not permit us to favour the existence of any arrangement or organization which would divide peoples and nations of the world into two or more opposing camps, or policies which would harm the principle of universality of this Organization.\n",
      "While we are not opposed to the unity of nations in small or large peaceful groups, dedicated to making more effective contributions towards world peace and security, we do not favour the existence of any blocs or any military alliances, which have proved or will prove to be a possible source of International tension or lack of confidence between the nations of the world.\n",
      "To give a true expression to the policy of my Government in this connexion, I should immediately add that we have never criticized and we never shall criticize the policies of any Government, nor shall we question what they consider to be the right path in the direction of their interests, but we do hope that all paths of individual or collective policies will lead towards the only true goal, the interest of mankind as a whole. This we believe is the true spirit of the  Charter of the United Nations, which we shall keep in mind during the discussion of all questions which arise before this General Assembly.\n",
      "It is with great faith and a deep conviction In the Principles and Purposes of the United Nations that we greet the thirteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I say this with full awareness of the criticism made of the activities of this Organization, the doubts in the minds of certain sections of the public in almost every country, and the confusion about the effectiveness of the efforts of the United Nations, particularly in the political field. This confusion has emanated partly from the fact that, while the activities of the United Nations in the economic, social and cultural fields are not well known to the public, they have been overshadowed by the heavy clouds of international tension and constant threats to peace and security, enhanced mostly by those who have power over the media of information and propaganda.\n",
      "We have stated at previous sessions of the General Assembly, and we should like to state again, that our only ambition is to promote the economic, social and cultural conditions in our country and try to become a useful member of the family of nations. We wish to maintain our friendship with all nations of the world, and to achieve our alms in an atmosphere of co-operation, understanding and peace. We wish the fulfilment of this common aspiration for all nations everywhere.\n",
      "Our approach to all questions will be guided by our impartial and independent judgement of international affairs, and our decisions will be made on the merits of the cases which are presented for our consideration. We are doing this with unalterable determination, in spite of a realization of all the difficulties and complications which the solution of human problems always involves. We are aware of all the difficulties which quite normally would confront any gathering of eighty-one nations, but we feel confident that we can still hope and that we can still avoid disappointment.\n",
      "I speak for a small country, Afghanistan, which enjoys friendly relations with all countries. Our peaceful policy is derived from our deep conviction that peace and friendship between peoples and nations are the only conditions in which we can live and work for a better future.\n",
      "Our friendly relations with those with whom we share the same ideology and way of life is a natural outcome of our aspirations. Our friendly relations with those whose ideology and way of life are different from our own are based on our belief in the principle of peaceful and friendly co-existence among peoples and nations of the world. It should be a matter of regret for all of us that we live in a divided world. In this divided world, however, we are associated with one and only one alliance, and that is the United Nations.\n",
      "Our intervention in the general debate is not merely to follow a customary practice, but it derives from the necessity of giving expression to the unbiased, impartial and independent voice of a small country. Whose experiences of the past, conditions of the present and aspirations for the future are typical of all small and particularly less-developed countries.\n",
      "The fourteenth session of the General Assembly is convened on an important occasion. Important statements have already been made. In all these speeches, a deep desire for peace has been most strongly emphasized. It is a most hopeful reality that the desire for peace is universal, knowing no ideological or political borders.\n",
      "Mr. BelaÃºnde, the distinguished President of the fourteenth session of the (General Assembly, in his opening statement [795th meeting] expressed the hope that this General Assembly would go down in history as the \"Assembly of peace\". As a representative of a small country I wish to associate my delegation with the hopes he cherished.\n",
      "Realizing that peace is in the custody of the big Powers, it is good to see that certain efforts are being made for lessening international tension. These efforts are a great source of encouragement to all peoples of the world, particularly those of the small countries. Not many events have been so warmly welcomed as have the direct contacts made by leaders of the big Powers. From this, one can derive the true meaning of the aspirations of the people of the world. We only hope that all those on whose wisdom the future of the world depends will be guided in their thoughts, their approach and their actions by unselfishness and a sense of responsibility, not only in their own interest, but in the interest of mankind as a whole.\n",
      "No peace, in our opinion, without the full protection of all rights and interests and the fulfillment of the legitimate aspirations of all peoples and nations of the world is peace. On all occasions this is the greatest and the most natural concern of the small countries, for the expression of which there is no better time or place than the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n",
      "However, we must say that we are not happy that certain issues which are not on the agenda of the General Assembly at this session have been brought up in the general debate. This has engendered a fear of the continuation of the cold war at a time which was hoped to be a turning-point towards its termination. We sincerely desire that such attempts will not be followed, and that our deliberations in this session will be positive and Constructive and will influence the international situation in bringing the cold war to an end.\n",
      "No small country can do more than express its concern over the regrettable international situation. Some representatives have stated, and correctly, that the contribution to the solution of world-wide problems by small countries is necessarily a modest one. However, we think that the voice of small countries in a democratic gathering of nations established on the principle of equality is not less than any other voice.\n",
      "We admit that there are small Powers and big Powers, small countries and large countries, but we do not believe that there is anything like a small or large nation. All nations are equal in their dignity and in their rights, not only here in the United Nations under its Charter, but everywhere and at all times. Therefore we hope that all small countries will realize more than ever their position, particularly here in the United Nations, and will exercise their right to make this Organization work for the welfare of humanity through their independent judgement of all world affairs.\n",
      "We are confident that with all the concern demonstrated by the big Powers about the welfare of the small countries, particularly those in under-developed areas, these efforts of the small countries will be most welcome. It is with this hope that we would like to state our views before the General Assembly.\n",
      "We have carefully studied the introduction to the annual report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization [A/4132/Add.1] particularly the part dealing with the role of the United Nations. We do not wish to express any disagreement with his interpretation of the role of the United Nations in the face of the developments and activities concerning international problems. We do not disagree, because under the circumstances it is a wise interpretation. But we shall not refrain from saying that we would have wished the circumstances to be different, so that this Organization could play its full and rightful role in the peaceful solution of all international problems.\n",
      "To be satisfied that a certain activity does not go so far as to abolish the aims of the Charter of the United Nations is not enough. What is required is the strengthening of the United Nations by increasing the confidence of Member States in the organization so that they will consider it the best place for the negotiation of all international problems with a view to reaching agreements which will have the support and consent of all nations.\n",
      "In an age when no nation remains unaffected by any event in any part of the world, it is wrong to think that international problems could be the concern only of a group of nations and not of a world organization, such as the United Nations, dedicated to their Solution.\n",
      "Processes exclusive of the United Nations can hardly be considered fully consistent with the aims and purposes of the Charter. It is not only the question of such processes which should be considered, but their results and consequences. These concern the small countries, which, with their deep faith in the United Nations, can place their hopes and their confidence only in this Organization. Therefore, it is not very easy to accept as a general rule that the extraorganizational solution of problems of world-wide interest concerning humanity as a whole can be definitely or completely free from implications which would impair the position of the Organization in principle,\n",
      "Those who have the practical solution of the problems in their custody are obviously not in a weaker position within the United Nations, particularly if their desire to put themselves in a better position to solve a problem is in complete harmony with the aims of the Charter and the interest of the world as a whole.\n",
      "One of the most important questions which directly concerns the small countries is the question of a United Nations stand-by force. This question was raised in the general debate during the thirteenth session, and it has been touched upon in this session. We stated [755th meeting] that we had utmost confidence in the United Nations, and expressed the hope that it would become increasingly effective as an instrument of peace. But, we added that the question of a United Nations force required more careful study, particularly in the prevailing international circumstances, and that we should be most cautious in our deliberations on this issue, because any hasty measures in this area would involve dangers that would affect the Organization directly. This point of view of the Afghan Government remains unchanged.\n",
      "Moreover, we stated that the United Nations should deal with this matter only at the most proper time and after a thorough examination of the desirability of the establishment of such a force. In the course of the year, we have been convinced by the prevailing international atmosphere that the proper time has not yet arrived. Therefore we are not in a position to commit ourselves to the approval of this idea at the present stage.\n",
      "It is encouraging that the way for a fresh start in dealing with the disarmament question seems not to be considered closed. We hope that the General Assembly at its present session will express itself on the best method of this fresh start, paying more attention to the anxieties of all nations.\n",
      "Except for a hot war which will bring destruction to all, the cold war is obviously the greatest source of anxiety from which the small countries suffer more than anyone else. The continuation of the cold war, therefore, means the continuation of this suffering for us. The arms race does not only affect the economic and social progress of the small countries, but in the field of nuclear competition the small countries, which have almost no means of protection, are more exposed to the dangers which threaten the world as a whole. Therefore the question of disarmament is of much more importance to us in the termination of the cold war and the strengthening of hopes for a lasting peace.\n",
      "The Afghan delegation welcomes the spirit of the proposals advanced [A/4219] for complete disarmament by the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. We think these proposals are basic and comprehensive, and we hope that their serious consideration by the United Nations will pave the way for more fruitful discussions on this long-standing, problem, which has a direct bearing on world peace and security. We hope that all States will judge the problem on its merits only, and will consider these proposals as an encouraging basis for the negotiation of this highly important and vital problem. The Afghan delegation would also wholeheartedly welcome any other initiative that would bring about a complete disarmament as soon as possible, or that would facilitate a general agreement on this most important question in all its aspects.\n",
      "While it is gratifying that the nuclear Powers have announced that the ban on the testing of nuclear weapons will be extended, it is regrettable that the complete cessation of nuclear tests has not been agreed upon. We hope that the General Assembly at its present session will emphasize the necessity of agreement on this point without any delay. The idea of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons should receive the strong support of all nations of the world, and should not be conditional upon anything, including a general agreement on disarmament, even in its most ideal form. The humanitarian aspect of the problem should not be overshadowed by the political differences which, however great they may be, are too small when compared with the importance of the preservation of the human race.\n",
      "We strongly support the appeal of the African nations for the prevention of the intended atomic tests in the Sahara. This question is not only a source of anxiety for the people of Africa, but for the majority of the population of the world, and should be most seriously considered by the United Nations.\n",
      "The penetration of man into outer space and the use of outer space only for peaceful and scientific purposes should be approached with a universal outlook, which is not possible unless all developments are the sole concern of the United Nations.\n",
      "No Member of the United Nations, having a deep conviction inâ€™ the right of peoples and nations to independence, can strike a happier note in this General Assembly than to speak of the progress made toward independence in the Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories of Africa. We are looking forward to seeing the new States occupy their rightful place in the community of sovereign nations.\n",
      "This happiness, however, is a mere flash of light on the horizon of the lives of many peoples, which has been darkened for centuries by the deprivation of peoples and nations of their legitimate right to independence. The real day of happiness bas not yet dawned, and indeed cannot, until all peoples and nations, whose aspirations for independence are suppressed in many ways and forms, achieve their goal, and colonialism is abolished in all its forms, wherever it exists.\n",
      "The contribution already made by the new Member States in the United Nations leaves no doubt that the independence of the dependent peoples is not only the recognition of the highest aspirations of man for freedom from domination, but also that it benefits the peoples of the world as a whole. The unjust policies of certain countries must inevitably give way to the legitimate rights of the people for self-determination and independence.\n",
      "Gratification has been voiced for the solution of the Cyprus problem. We would like to associate ourselves with this expression. The solution of the Cyprus issue is an example of a constructive approach to complicated problems in the United Nations. The efforts made by the parties in this direction should be highly appreciated.\n",
      "We hope that a satisfactory solution of the West Irian question will follow as soon as possible,\n",
      "It is most regrettable, however, that the developments in connexion with the solution of the Algerian problem are still most discouraging. To most of us it should be surprising enough that while we hear lofty voices of peace, and hear of the desire to end the cold war, no encouraging concern has been expressed about the Algerian people and the hot war which continues there. The constructive approach of many Members of the United Nations has not received the unanimous support it deserves.\n",
      "We do understand the difficulties with which ye are confronted on certain problems, but it is regrettable to see that situations of greater importance are sometimes overshadowed, while attention is forcefully drawn to comparatively minor issues. The adoption of such a policy by an individual country in its own interest might be understandable, but is most discouraging when not abolished by an Organization like the United Nations, particularly on a matter of hot war. We hope that in this General Assembly where attempts made to thaw the cold war have been highly praised, more attention will be paid to ending the hot war in Algeria.\n",
      "The recent statement of policy made in Paris by the President of the French Republic has attracted the attention it deserves all over the world. We are confident that it will also receive the consideration of the Algerian leaders who have been so bravely fighting for the cause of independence of their country. Afghanistan has always supported the right of peoples and nations to self-determination and to independence everywhere., In this case also, we hold the same opinion. But we must add that the desire of the Algerian people for independence is clear, and their determination has been declared by the rightful leaders of Algeria. We do not think that the Solution of the Algerian problem should be based solely on the declaration of intentions by France. Whatever measures to be taken should be dependent on peaceful negotiations between France and the rightful leaders of Algeria, with a view to reaching a complete understanding on the restoration of an honourable peace and the realization of the legitimate rights of the Algerian people to decide their own destiny.\n",
      "In these considerations the United Nations should fully realize its responsibilities. We' should remind the General Assembly of the many outstanding examples of political arrangements after the Second World War, where the fate of peoples and nations has been at stake. We are particularly alarmed about Such situations when they arise because similar examples exist in our own part of the world.\n",
      "One of the most dangerous ways of solving such problems is through the partition of countries and their division, or the annexation of territories without the free consent of the people themselves. Such methods have always given rise to difficulties in the future which have damaged peaceful and friendly relations between peoples and nations. I do not think that there is any necessity to enumerate these examples. But we would like to state clearly that in the consideration of the Algerian question this point should not be ignored.\n",
      "Negotiations cannot be fair and just unless they are without restrictions and conditions, and in harmony with the dignity and honour of the parties concerned. It would, be most unrealistic to think that a war could end peacefully by ignoring one of the parties in the dispute. It will be premature to go further into this matter at the present stage, but we would like to state that the people of Algeria, who have struggled so bravely for their independence, will have our full support in the United Nations when this question is discussed.\n",
      "We have been deeply impressed by the concern shown for the welfare of under-developed countries by all those who are in a position to continue their assistance through international co-operation for the promotion of economic and social conditions in these areas. As a representative of a small country in a less developed area, however, it is our duty to draw the attention of the Members of the General Assembly to the fact that the appreciation of these gratifying statements has not been completely free from certain anxieties.\n",
      "Certain forms of international co-operation, being a direct result of political and military pacts and alliances, have caused serious tensions in these areas. We want to make it clear that we do not wish to criticize any policies of any individual country or group of countries in any respect, but it should not be left unsaid that when other countries are affected by such policies, they are forced to give expression to their anxieties in the interest of peace and the maintenance of friendly relations between peoples and nations. This becomes more important when we see that even some international bodies have also been affected by such policies.\n",
      "The impact of such policies, influenced by favouritism, has affected the progress of the less developed countries to a great extent, and has already disturbed the balance of positions among the countries of the region. It has damaged the principle of justice and. even equitable distribution of assistance to meet greater and more urgent needs in the case of certain countries. It has diverted the attention of these countries from concentration on the promotion of their economic and social conditions, in the direction of unnecessary measures forced upon them to meet the threats to their security with which they have been confronted.\n",
      "There is no doubt that the work of the United Nations in the economic and social fields, which is so often obscured by the political aspects of its activities, has taken on a new significance. The realization of the importance of the development of under-developed countries has led to intensified activity. But still the needs of the under-developed countries are enormous while the means at their disposal are so limited.\n",
      "The United Nations Technical Assistance Programme is rendering great service. The recently established Special Fund is making a good beginning on a new co-operative venture that holds out great promise for the future. However the need of less developed countries for a capital development fund is not yet realized. It is hoped that a capital development fund will be established soon, as this is the missing link in the chain of international financial organizations dedicated to economic and social progress.\n",
      "The increasing area of under-development is an additional cause for concern. The most needy countries are likely to be most affected by the new tasks the United Nations will have to undertake in new areas, unless additional resources are found. It should be noted that the sources of aid, old and new, seem to ameliorate conditions in countries which have already made great strides toward advancement, while the most needy countries find it difficult and sometimes even impossible to meet the terms of assistance. Thus while some countries forge ahead, others meet increasing problems in gaining assistance.\n",
      "On his return from a visit to various countries in Asia, the Secretary-General noted that although some improvement had been realized, the economic progress in under-developed countries was painfully slow. We deem it necessary to say that the examples of improvement are not a great source of encouragement, especially in view of the insufficiency of the response to the requirements of the under-developed countries and the lack of a sense of urgency in meeting these needs.\n",
      "The recent trips of the Secretary-General to many countries in various continents constituted one of the most useful undertakings of the United Nations, leading toward a correct understanding of real situations, particularly in the less developed countries. We hope that the Secretary-General will continue his policy of direct contact with the Member States, and that he will receive the co-operation of Governments on matters which will bring about more fruitful conditions for all. However, as long, as the present difficulties are not met, one can hardly hope that the goals of the organizations set up for these purposes can be achieved.\n",
      "The sincerity of all those countries whose delegations have expressed their interest in the promotion of conditions in the under-developed areas is appreciated, but more understanding of the points of view which can truly be presented by those who represent these under-developed countries is required.\n",
      "It is the small under-developed country which suffers most under the prevailing situation. Afghanistan is one of these small countries. Our backward condition, unlike most countries in our part of the world, is not the result of domination by others, but is the outcome of years of war against domination in defence of freedom, which has been preserved at all costs, particularly the cost of development.\n",
      "Our pride in this achievement is not lessened by the economic conditions in which we find ourselves today. We are determined to give the same energies now, if we are left at peace, to our economic and social development as we did to our political independence. It is a part of our determination to accept only the assistance which is truly devoted to the betterment of conditions within our country, free from any other considerations whatsoever. It is for this reason that the United Nations assistance is so desired, and the strengthening of this Organization has become our most sincere desire.\n",
      "The difficulties which confront the United Nations are great, but the hope of the peoples of the world is surely strong enough to overcome them. We hope that in this General Assembly, in the consideration of the reports that the Assembly will receive in these fields, due attention will be paid to these issues.\n",
      "In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to state that it is a great privilege to take this opportunity to associate myself with those representatives who have congratulated you on your election as President of the fourteenth session of the General Assembly, and above all, we wish that the hope you expressed as President of the General Assembly will be fulfilled, and that this Assembly will go down in history as the \"Assembly of peace\".\n",
      "At the outset, Mr. President, allow me to extend to you my sincere congratulations on your election to the important and responsible post of the Presidency of the present session, and to wish you success in achieving the aims and purposes of the Charter, for which the General Assembly has been convened.\n",
      "It is a source of great pleasure for us that the inauguration of this session has been marked by a most important and historic event, the increase in the membership of the United Nations. I wish once again to extend the sincere welcome of the Afghan people and Government to the representatives of these fourteen nations and, through them, to their peoples and Governments.\n",
      "With the increased number of Members the Organization is approaching the ideal of universality. We hope that this forum of independent voices of mankind will be completed soon through the attainment of independence by the dependent peoples, and that it will lead to the realization of a united, free world in the true sense. It is our fervent hope that the Organization will thus become a power strong enough to overcome the difficulties confronting mankind, in the interest of humanity, on the basis of justice and equality, and for the preservation of a peace founded upon the legitimate rights of individuals and nations.\n",
      "In this connexion we believe that the right of the People's Republic of China to its rightful place in the United Nations should be implemented without any further delay. This belief does not emanate only from the fact that China is our neighbour, and that we have diplomatic relations with China. It is based also upon the fact that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing the Chinese people. The exclusion of this great nation from the United Nations is in no way in the interest of the Organization, and is in fact a denial of the principle of universality of the United Nations.\n",
      "The meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations is certainly the most important international event. At this session special interest has been demonstrated by the Member States in the solution of the great problems confronting the Organization, and therefore the occasion is more momentous. The significance of such an occasion calls, before everything else, for an increased sense of responsibility and an unselfish attitude and approach which would be in the interest of mankind; The occasion can bring about a great many constructive and fruitful results, but failure to use such an opportunity for constructive ends could lead to most discouraging consequences.\n",
      "In the face of the threat-to humanity, the shifting of blame from one side to another will neither shift the responsibility for unfavourable consequences nor save anyone from the destructive results which will be ultimately universal.\n",
      "Our failures in the past, outside the United Nations, should in no way deprive us of cherishing the hope that this Organization, set up for peaceful negotiations, will provide everyone with the means of better understanding, particularly the big Powers, who can better hear the cry of humanity for peace and prosperity. These failures have been rightly deplored, but, welcoming the most important and indeed greatly significant fact that the United Nations is the ultimate repository of world problems, we hope for the peaceful solution of even the most complicated problems.\n",
      "There are many issues before us â€” all of them the great concern of the United Nations and all its Members â€” which will be discussed by the General Assembly in due course. At this stage, however, I shall confine myself to a few most urgent points.\n",
      "I speak strictly for a small, peace-loving country, with a most impartial and independent position in international affairs, having the deepest conviction in the United Nations, the only alliance to which we belong under its Charter, where our record is well known, and our friendship with all cannot be questioned. We are confident, therefore, that our views will be considered in the most friendly spirit in which we express them.\n",
      "The greatest and most natural concern of the small countries is the prevailing international tension and the continuation of the \"cold war\". There is no doubt that the lessening of international tension, mostly caused by ideological differences and political interests, is in the custody of the big Powers. In the United Nations, however, that division greatly concerns the small countries which comprise the majority. The responsibility of these countries, therefore, cannot and should not be underestimated, either by themselves or by the big Powers. Not only are these countries desirous of making a positive contribution to the cause of peace, but they are capable of doing so and we hope that they will give to the Assembly the benefit of their independent judgement of world affairs.\n",
      "In our opinion, the most urgent task before the Assembly, in the present circumstances, is to concentrate on the Ways and means of eliminating the fundamental causes which have created the international problems and on the factors which have delayed their solution, rather than to attempt the solution of the problems directly, without the preparation of a healthy atmosphere which could mean the end of the cold war. There is obviously no other way than to address, on behalf of the General Assembly, an urgent appeal to the big Powers to enter immediately into peaceful negotiations to this end.\n",
      "Each day brings with it further proof that peaceful coexistence among peoples and nations is imperative. The failure to recognize this fact would lead to a complete deterioration of the international situation, with grave and even disastrous consequences. The United Nations is in itself the highest expression that mankind has given to this principle, after suffering from disastrous experiences. Therefore, the failure of the United Nations to implement this principle would be the greatest source of discouragement to all peace-loving peoples of the world.\n",
      "The only position from which it will be possible to realize the peaceful aspirations of man and the security and prosperity of the world is the position of mutual confidence among all, particularly among those who otherwise could choose the, position of strength. While it is certain that the opportunity provided by this session can be used for greater results, the least that can be expected is that everything should be done to avoid further deterioration of the international situation. The solution of the problem of disarmament depends solely on the confidence of the big Powers in each other and on their good will towards humanity. The importance of the issue to the small countries, however, is in no way diminished by this consideration.\n",
      "Last year when the question came before the General Assembly, we stated that we welcomed the proposals advanced for complete disarmament by the Government of this Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which were referred to as basic and comprehensive. We stated also that we would welcome wholeheartedly any other initiative, regardless of its source, which would lead in the direction of disarmament.\n",
      "The proposals of the United States do not differ in principle from the course directed to general and complete disarmament. Therefore there is a great margin of agreement on the basic issues. It is encouraging that the leaders of the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have expressed their willingness to resume negotiations. This is greatly appreciated. The achievement of this goal will not only answer the expectations of the smaller countries' in the United Nations but will respond to the aspirations of millions of people who await the fruitful results of this important gathering.\n",
      "We adhere to our view that, in any measures that may be taken, the importance of the consideration that the goal should remain total disarmament, under effective international control and inspection, should be stressed, and at the same time practical steps, particularly in the field of nuclear weapons, should not be further delayed.\n",
      "The question of disarmament is essentially and primarily the responsibility of the United Nations. This fact is iso recognized by the big Powers. It can he said with hope that the General Assembly could succeed in taking certain measures which would compensate for the failure of efforts that have been made outside the United Nations.\n",
      "We adhere also to our view that a world without arms would be a new order in the life of nations. In any new order, the secure position of the small countries themselves is of utmost importance to us. We highly appreciate the references to the effect that as a result of disarmament more assistance would be available to the under-developed areas of the world, but we would like to add immediately that, although our needs are enormous, our primary concern continues to be the maintenance of peace and security, the only condition in which the under-developed countries can hope for the fulfilment of their desire for a better life. We believe that, as long as the domination of one nation by another is not abolished in all its forms, neither the abolition of arms, nor economic assistance on any scale will complete the happiness to which man is entitled by his right to independence and dignity.\n",
      "This session of the General Assembly, at which we have admitted a great number of independent States, offers us a unique opportunity to concentrate our efforts on the realization of the aspirations of the dependent peoples. The progress made in this field is encouraging but by no means satisfactory. No one can rightly be content as long as there are dependent peoples in this world. The policies of certain countries must inevitably give way to the right of self-determination and independence for these peoples.\n",
      "The situation in connexion with the problem of Algerians â€” one of these peoples â€” is most deplorable. It would be unnatural to speak of ending the cold war, and express no concern over the hot war continuing in Algeria. The deliberate delay in the peaceful solution of this problem, on the part of the French Government, is most alarming. It will be a matter of great regret if certain major issues, like the Algerian issue, are overshadowed by other problems merely because those problems have arisen more recently. We hope that the General Assembly will give high priority, at this session, to the consideration of the Algerian problem in the light of the most discouraging new developments and that it will take appropriate measures to implement Its resolutions, recommendations and hopes for a peaceful solution of the question. We hope that this year, which has been referred to as the year of Africa, will have in it the dawn of the independence of Algeria, without which the African horizon will remain clouded by colonialism.\n",
      "The Algerians have agreed to a solution based on the right of self-determination, a right which the French had accepted in principle. We maintain high hopes that the legitimate aspirations of all peoples will be realized, and we are happy to see that the triumph of self-determination, without which peace cannot be maintained, is a real source of pride for foe peoples of the United Nations. But this pride cannot be fully enjoyed if it is recognized in certain cases and denied in others,\n",
      "The most disturbing events in the Republic of the Congo, now a Member State, have been the concern of the United Nations in more than one respect. We supported the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its emergency session [1474 (ES-IV)], with the hope that the assistance of the United Nations, in the light of the experiences gained by the Organization since its involvement with the problems of this young State, would serve the purpose of stability and of law and order in this unhappy country. In any measures that may be taken in this connexion, we would Stress the fact that all the Members of the Organization should give the utmost consideration to the significance of United Nations prestige, which is so directly involved.\n",
      "The constructive contribution of the independent African States in this matter is undoubtedly of special significance. The countries of Asia have always, in the spirit of solidarity among African-Asian nations, demonstrated their concern over the situations in the African continent and have contributed to the cause of the peoples of Africa. We hope that, before long, the people of the Congo will be able to have the representatives of their rightful Government participating in the United Nations.\n",
      "References have been made to the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the Middle East, a region to which Afghanistan belongs. The expression by these countries of their desire for friendly relations is a source of satisfaction to us. No country has ever been more ready to respond to the call of friendship and neighbourly relations than Afghanistan. We have followed, and shall follow, this policy as the fundamental basis of our international relations with all countries, particularly with our neighbours. In this connexion, however, I should add that the elimination of differences cannot be achieved except by serious efforts, through peaceful negotiations, for the solution of the problems which have caused friction between the countries of this region.\n",
      "We wish to maintain good and friendly relations with all our neighbours, and therefore we sincerely respond to the spirit of amity voiced here by the distinguished representative of Iran [870th meeting].\n",
      "We have studied the annual report of the Secretary-General [A/4390 and Add.1], containing many important ideas, all of which, as I said at the beginning, can be taken up by the General Assembly at the proper stages of its work. There is one point, however, to which I should like to refer now, and that is the question of the development of the under-developed countries. The views of Afghanistan on this matter have been made known in the General Assembly and also in the Economic and Social Council. The responsibility of the United Nations in this connexion, regarding the new areas of under-development, has been rightly recognized. But special consideration as to its effect on other areas of responsibility is required.\n",
      "): It is not to follow a customary practice but rather to express a real feeling that I wish to congratulate you on your election, Mr. President. The unanimous vote of the General Assembly is recognition of your high qualifications and the esteem your person deserves as one in whom such confidence can be placed for the fulfilment of a task which is particularly important in the prevailing circumstances.\n",
      "We were deeply impressed when on assuming your duties as President of the General Assembly you expressed the feelings of the Members of the United Nations on the tragic and untimely death of Mr. Dag Hammarskjold. I have already associated myself with the tribute you paid to his memory, but at this particular moment I ask your permission to allow me to convey the heartfelt sorrow and sympathy of His Majesty the King, the Government and the people of Afghanistan to the Members of the General Assembly, the members of the Secretariat and to Mr. Hammarskjold's family and Ms friends.\n",
      "This message of condolence is also extended to the Swedish Mission to the United Nations and to all those who are related to the devoted members of the United Nations Secretariat who died with the Secretary-General in the line of duty. It is an expression of our deep respect for men who have died serving the cause of peace, the ultimate goal of mankind, for the achievement of which the United Nations is the only existing human institution.\n",
      "This session of the General Assembly is being held at a critical moment in international affairs. The threat to peace is no longer a fear of war as we have known it in the past. The situation is pregnant with the fear of total destruction. The world is no longer confronted with events which might one day become a source of great anxiety to humanity. We are now faced with a concrete situation in which mankind is living in the shadow of war. This is not an imagined fear, for the possibility of war has been explicitly recognized here by those nations powerful enough to make the possibility a tragic reality.\n",
      "In such circumstances it is not proper for any responsible individual â€” and it is even less proper for any assembly of nations â€” to spend one moment on anything but the most serious efforts to prevent a further deterioration of the situation.\n",
      "My delegation is particularly disturbed by the attitude demonstrated by the big Powers in their statements during this session: while fully realizing the dangers involved in the present undesirable development of international affairs and while strongly expressing their desire for peace, they have explicitly spoken of the might and power at their disposal. We found that most alarming because the very demonstration of force can well lead to the provocation of its implementation.\n",
      "Admitting that the weak and the powerless do not have effective means of bringing about tangible results, the small countries which make up the majority of the population of the world and the majority of voices in this Organization cannot be deprived of at least one right that they still possess. That is to initiate a course of consideration and action in the General Assembly at this session. These countries should demand from the powerful countries a pledge to refrain from any action that would create or increase the possibility of the use of force in any circumstances. While one might agree with those who think that such a demand by the weak for such a pledge from the powerful might not serve any practical purpose, one cannot possibly agree that such a demand for such a pledge is not most essential. In our view, that is the first task of this session of the General Assembly.\n",
      "The second task in the prevailing circumstances should be the realization that while all of us recognize the existence of many important problems with which the United Nations should deal, it is very urgent that the major political problems of the world, on the solution of which depends the possibility of solving other problems, should receive the immediate attention of the General Assembly during this session. There are ninety-one items on the agenda of this session. The fact that these items have been included in the agenda is sufficient recognition of their importance. At the same time, however, every one of us realizes that a constructive solution to most of these issues is not possible without the creation of the kind of atmosphere which can be expected to prevail only if the efforts of the United Nations are concentrated on the major world problems. There are certain items the discussion of which intensifies international tension and the cold war, which is gradually becoming warmer. My delegation would therefore wish that the General Assembly, having recognized the importance of the items by including them in the agenda, would, in dealing with the problems, reach an understanding temporarily to defer a discussion of them until it had dealt with the major problems, within the limits of a careful analysis of the possibilities at its disposal. That, of course, applies only to the controversial political items.\n",
      "In our view, the major problems confronting the world are the following: the discontinuance of the cold war and the lessening of international tension, and the substitution therefore of peaceful coexistence and international co-operation; the discontinuance of the arms race, and the institution of general and complete disarmament; the discontinuance of war and bloodshed where they exist at present and particularly the war and bloodshed that has resulted from colonial aggression, through negotiations; and the settlement of the situation in Berlin â€” although this last question is not yet on the agenda of this session. Those are the major problems confronting the world. To them should be added the problem of concentrating our efforts on solving the situation that has arisen as a result of the sudden death of Mr. Dag Hammarskjold and the problem of the structure of the United Nations. The representation of China in the United Nations is of course basic to a solution of the latter issue.\n",
      "I have no intention of elaborating at this stage of the general debate on these or other problems that will be discussed during this session â€” partly because our views on them are known, and basically, because we shall have a chance to express ourselves on them when they come up for discussion.\n",
      "I hope that our basic views on how to approach the present unfortunate situation in international affairs are clear to our colleagues. As a small country, we have no force behind the thoughts we have expressed except our good intentions, derived from our aspirations for peace, and our expectation that the Members of the Assembly, especially the peace- loving small countries, will take note of the seriousness of the situation and seek ways and means which would secure the interests of humanity as a whole. We do not wish to insist that our own way of thinking be generally accepted, but we do insist that if the United Nations is to serve the cause of world peace each Member of it should consider, the interests of the entire world as paramount in the present crisis. Only by such breadth of vision can the United Nations make that constructive contribution to the solution of world problems for which this Assembly has been convened.\n",
      "Before concluding, I would like to express our general views on one point which should be recognized as the most urgent task of this session, namely the question of how to meet the situation in which this Organization finds itself in the absence of a Secretary- General. Being well aware of the complexity of the matter in the prevailing circumstances and hoping that an agreement will be reached at the end of the current negotiations, it is our considered opinion that it is far from desirable for anyone to insist upon any controversial position on this matter. Unless full agreement is reached, no hurried measures should be allowed to be taken in the name of urgency. While the urgency of the matter should be emphasized, the lasting interest of the United Nations as an effective world organ for international harmony should not be sacrificed as a result of a psychologically disturbing situation which can easily mislead us and can bring about more difficulties. We cannot allow ourselves to fail to search thoroughly the avenues of an agreement satisfactory to all. In our view, it is better not to make a final decision on this matter in the rush imposed upon us by certain difficulties with which we admit we are confronted. An interim arrangement has been suggested. The Afghan delegation favours this view in principle. Any provisional arrangement which would bring about a unanimous understanding will be acceptable to my delegation. In the case of disagreement, we shall take a stand in the face of the compelling circumstances which we should not like to foresee at this stage.\n",
      "There is, however, an exceptional urgency realized by all of us as to the responsibilities of the\n",
      "United Nations in connexion with the situation in the Congo. To meet this particular urgency, the Afghan delegation thinks that in the case of a disagreement on the matter of filling the post of the Secretary- General on a temporary basis, with a clear understanding that this temporary arrangement will not affect final positions, it would be more advisable to try to reach an agreement on a provisional arrangement that would enable the United Nations to function effectively in the performance of its responsibilities in the Congo only.\n",
      "The creation of such an authority, under the direction of the Security Council, should be considered possible, while at the same time the Security Council should be continuously seized of finding a solution, as soon, as possible, in the interest of the Organization, for filling the post of the Secretary-General.\n",
      "The guiding principle in: our thoughts is a stronger United Nations emerging from the present crisis. This goal cannot be achieved without the tolerance, patience and understanding needed for securing full support of all Members of the United Nations for any decision.\n",
      "In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that if the United Nations is expected to be able to fulfil ,\\ts primary task for the cause of peace, every individual Member of the Organization should avoid a hostile attitude in the interest of the restless and troubled world. The United Nations, to which we belong and in which we have the deepest conviction, is not meant to invite the cold war into the already shaking Organization, or to send the cold war out to the already shivering world.\n",

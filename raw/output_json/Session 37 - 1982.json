        "file_text": "I wish to join with the leaders of other delegations in paying a \ntribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Kittani, who distinguished \nhimself throughout last year in his efforts on behalf of the \nAssembly. I am also honoured to be accorded the privilege on behalf \nof my country to congratulate Mr. Hollai on his election to the \npresidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I \noffer him my delegation's fullest support in the tasks which lie \nahead of him.\nNever in the history of its existence has the Assembly convened \nagainst such a background of pervading universal gloom. Unemployment \nfigures I the industrialized countries are assuming proportions \ntraditionally associated with developing countries: 10.1 per cent in \nthe United States and a similar figure in the European Economic \nCommunity. Every month that passes witnesses thousands more people \nbeing cast on to the heap of the unemployed with no prospect of jobs, \nno means of maintaining their standard of living and little means of \nensuring the well-being of their families. Many marvel every day that \nthere have not been widespread violent reactions in the streets; \nothers expect those reactions to erupt at any time if this \nall-consuming recession continues unabated.\nAnd while unemployment in industrialized countries reaches the level \nnormally linked with developing countries, the ranks of the \nunemployed in poor States are swelling to record volumes. Only an \nimmunity to suffering born of generations of deprivation keeps some \ndeveloping States from explosion.\nA blanket of misery has been cast upon the world: it has spared no \ncountry and it has brought many to the brink of disaster. This misery \ncan only be measured in human terms-for it knows nor colour, nor \nreligion, nor nationality. It grips many millions in developed \ncountries who must struggle to survive on State support and many more \nmillions in poor countries who must suffer with no support at all.\nIn the 1930s, when mankind experienced a global economic recession \nsuch as the one we now face, the economists called it \\\"the Great \nDepression\\\". It was the forerunner of a terrible war which brought \neven greater human suffering than had obtained before it. As \nconditions currently exist in the world, it would not be too \nfar-fetched for some to contemplate wars, however limited, as a \nsolution to the current economic crisis. Indeed some are already \nadvocating the Keynesian theory that military spending will create \njobs, increase public demand and stimulate economic growth.\nIn these troubled times, the global community should be able to spam \nthe irrationality of the warmongers and turn instead to the United \nNations for a sane and sensible direction. The words spoken in the \nAssembly by the world's leading personalities should invoke in \nmankind a spirit of hope and a sense of optimism for the future. But \nwe are yet to hear those words. We are yet to hear an attempt at \ndialogue between the two super-Powers; we are yet to hear an attempt \nat peace between warring neighbours in the Middle East; we are yet to \nhear nations climb down from their nationalistic pedestals to the \ntable of peaceful discussion for the benefit of all mankind. What we \nhave heard is a discourse of the deaf; a mouthing of prearranged \nstatements with no interest in response or reply. Statements have not \nbeen made for the benefit of other nations, let alone the world; they \nhave been made for political mileage in national capitals.\nIn that context the report of the Secretary- General on the work of \nthe Organization is both important and timely, for its summons us to \nrecall the principles of the Charter and to review the Mechanisms of \nthe Organization in order to make this body strong, not sterile; \ndecisive, not dilatory; functional, not ornamental. It warns us that \nin a world fraught with tension and peril the United Nations is \nindispensable. The Secretary-General's report has identified a number \nof important ways in which the effectiveness of the United Nations \ncould be improved and enhanced, particularly in regard to collective \ninternational security. Therecommendations, especially the call for a \nmeeting of the Security Council at the highest possible level to \ndiscuss the problems of the United Nations, should be given the \nsupport of all Member States. In my view, part of the agenda of that \nmeeting should be consideration of how much more effective the United \nNations might be if we ended the veto system provided for the \npermanent membership of the Security Council. The concept of a veto \nwas developed at the end of the Second World War when a few nations \nheld dominion over many. But surely the results of a war, in whose \ncreation the majority of the world's people played no part, should \nnot continue to advise the procedures of the Security Council on an \neverlasting basis.\nIn his report the Secretary-General has himself said that \n\\\"allegations of partisanship\\\" have been used by some Member States to \njustify side-tracking the Security Council. He has called on us to \n\\\"take such matters with the utmost seriousness and ask ourselves what \njustifications, if any, there are for them and what can be done to \nrestore the Council to the position of influence it was given in the \nCharter\\\".\nThere is no doubt that there exists among Member States a genuine \nfear that in certain circumstances members of the Security Council \ncould act in a partisan manner. In fact recent history has shown that \nthe veto has been used to safeguard narrow national interests in \ndefiance of world opinion and the decisions of the Assembly. The use \nof the veto in such a manner does not inspire confidence in the \nSecurity Council.\nIn this context my delegation contends that the most effective action \nthat can be taken to restore the Council to the position of influence \nwhich the Charter intended for it is to end the veto system and to \ndemocratize the process of decision-making.\nEven as I state my delegation's position I am sadly aware that it has \nlittle chance of becoming a reality, for those that hold power seldom \nrelinquish it willingly. None the less that is precisely why I state \nit, for the attention of the Organization and other international \norganizations must be focused on their collective impotence to \nmeaningfully address the problems of the world while the will of s \nfew dominates the aspirations of the many.\nAs we consider the issues about which the many in the Organization \nhave been concerned, we are struck by the dismal record of failure \nwhich confronts us. Let us first examine efforts in the Assembly to \nbring about change in the global economic arrangements. Although 1981 \nwas the date set for the completion of global negotiations on trade, \nenergy, raw materials, development finance and monetary issues, the \nfew have ensured that this body has failed to produce agreement even \non the procedures for such negotiations. Discussion on the global \nnegotiations has been shunted from the thirty-sixth to the \nthirty-seventh session of the Assembly. While this delaying game has \nbeen played in the United Nations the prospects for growth and \ndevelopment in poor countries have been diminished by similar actions \nin other international organizations. At the recent joint meeting of \nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank group in Toronto \nthe few ensured that an urgent call by the Group of 24 for an \nincrease in the Fund's quotas of not less than 100 per cent would be \nignored. Equally, efforts to persuade donors to the International \nDevelopment Association to improve their contributions in view of the \nAssociation's vital importance to poor countries met with only \npartial success.\nDeveloping countries have not only been denied the opportunity to \ndiscuss a framework for an international economic system based on the \nfundamentals of social justice and equality; they have also \nexperienced a reduction in the quantum of badly needed assistance.\nOfficial development assistance from the Western industrialized \nnations decreased by 4 per cent in real terms in 1981. Official \ndevelopment assistance from the Eastern European countries, including \nthe Soviet Union, is of course selective, and these countries have \nyet to show any interest in the international dialogue on aid, though \nthey are active participants, to their own benefit, in the process of \ntrade.\nOnly a few nations provided more than 0.7 per cent of their gross \ndomestic product, which this body established as a desirable minimum, \nin the form of assistance. Those countries have the gratitude of the \ndeveloping world; they deserve the respect of the international \ncommunity as a whole. They are Denmark, France, the Netherlands, \nNorway and Sweden, from Europe, and Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the \nUnited Arab Emirates, three major donor countries that are members of \nthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which gave 3.02 \nper cent of their gross national product in 1980.\nIt is true that by providing aid in the volume that they have those \ndonors have greatly assisted poor third-world States which are the \nworst victims of the current recession. But those donors have also \nrendered a service to the global community, especially the rich, for \nthe third world countries are now the biggest market for the goods of \nthe industrialized nations. For instance, one in every 18 jobs in the \nUnited States is in manufacturing for the third world. In such \ncircumstances it is in the interests of all, including the \nindustrialized nations, for third world States to survive. For if we \nare unable to purchase goods produced by the developed States they \nwill lose many more millions of jobs, and that may be the trigger for \nthose violent reactions which have not yet erupted in the streets.\nI have already mentioned our failure to advance the global \nnegotiations and the reduction of aid to developing countries as \nsetbacks to a prosperous global economy. Let me now add \nprotectionism. The protectionism practiced by some developed States \nis the short-term answer to the problems of adjustment raised by the \ncurrent recession. It is believed in some capitals that by shutting \nout the goods of developing countries local production will be \nstimulated to the benefit of the national economy.\nThe evidence against that argument is now well known. Indeed recent \nstudies have shown that between\nand 1977 protectionist measures imposed by the United States on goods \nimported from Latin America and the Caribbean resulted in a loss to \nconsumers of $1,250 million for carbon steel, $1,200 million for \nfootwear, $660 million for sugar, $400 million to $800 million for \nmeat, and $500 million for television sets-a total of $4 billion for \nthese five items. The cost to the consumer for every job protected \nwas more than $50,000 per year. I submit that the national economy \ndid not benefit in the long run.\nIn this time of disarray in the world economy it is crucially \nimportant to establish an international trading system in which the \ndeveloping countries are accorded a fair and equitable place. \nTherefore we call on Governments represented in the Assembly to \napproach the GATT Ministerial Meeting in November with the will to \nreturn to a set of agreed principles and rules applying to all \ninternational trade and providing a recognizable and ordered \nframework within which it can grow. Therein, we believe, lies the \nbasis for promoting a sound world economy.\nFailure to achieve change in global economic arrangements is not the \nonly example of the -Assembly's resolve to right wrongs being \nthwarted. South Africa is yet another burning example.\nSouth Africa continues to be a running sore upon the face of this \nearth. The inhuman system of apartheid has gone beyond excess in its \nbrutality against the black majority. The iniquities of its regime \ncontinue to mock the authority of this body. And what is \nreprehensible about the success of the South African regime is that \nPretoria has received tacit support from many large transnational and \nsome of the very Governments which sit in this Hall.\nMany will plead that, although they have a connection with South \nAfrica, they decry and bemoan the system is simply an excuse, for \nthey are as aware as we are, though perhaps not as painfully, that \nany support given to Pretoria serves only to strengthen the regime \nand intensify its atrocities.\nThose atrocities are now legion: the permanent imprisonment of South \nAfrican blacks for the crime of believing that they have a right to \nbe free; the sentencing to death of young men because they fought to \nwrest their country from minority control; the dumping of hundreds of \nthousands of black South Africans in hastily created Bantustans in \norder to deprive them of citizenship in the land of their birth.\nWe do not appear to have much chance of addressing the problem of \nSouth Africa in the comprehensive manner which it demands if we are \nunable to compel Member States to comply with our resolutions. We do \nnot appear to have much chance of isolating the virus of South \nAfrica, when a Committee established by the General Assembly in to \ndraft an international convention against in sports is unable to \npresent an agreed convention six years later.\nBut we must continue to try, for what is happening in South Africa is \na mark against all mankind, an assault on our decency, violence to \nour world as human beings. It requires every Government represented \nin the Assembly to support efforts to uphold creative ways in which \nthe wrongs in South Africa can be put right. Not least amongst our \nefforts must be the full implementation of Security Council \nresolution 435 (1978), which establishes the framework for the \nindependence of Namibia. The freedom of the people of Namibia must no \nlonger be blocked by the perpetrators in Pretoria of the wicked \nsystem of apartheid must it be delayed by any attempt to link it with \nthe withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. The independence of the \nNamibian people is just, justified and justifiable; it should not be \nused to serve the national interests of other countries. I wish I \ncould point to the Middle East as an area where the United Nations \nhas been effective, for if this were true thousands of lives would \nhave been spared, cities would have been saved from ruin, and \nmillions of dollars would have been channelled into improving rather \nthan destroying societies. Unfortunately, the principles of the \nCharter have been flagrantly disregarded and resolutions of the \nSecurity Council have been wilfully ignored. Consequently, the people \nof the Middle East, who have suffered so agonizingly long, have found \nno respite from the pain of war.\nThe recent massacre in the Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut was a \ncold-blooded and brutal act of barbarism. It goes beyond merely \nepitomizing the tragedy of the Middle East; it adds a new dimension \nto the horrors of the confrontation. Lebanon has become the bleeding \nheart of the world. Its anguish is shared in every man's conscience. \nThis country deserves the urgent support of the international \ncommunity to bind its wounds, restore its national pride and \nreconstruct its economy. The Israeli forces could now be helpful to \nthat process if they were to withdraw immediately from Lebanese \nterritory.\nThe tragedy of Lebanon points once again to the manner in which some \nnations are willing to bypass the United Nations and to disregard its \npeacekeeping roles. The fact that a search for a solution to the \nMiddle East problems is going on and that a peace-keeping force is in \nLebanon without the involvement of the Security Council considerably \ndilutes the worth of the Organization. It makes small countries like \nmine wonder about the purpose of coming here at a cost we cannot \nafford, when the United Nations is dismissed by those who are its \ngreatest power- brokers.\nCentral to the issue which has wrought such catastrophe in the Middle \nEast is the Fight of the Palestinian people to self-determination and \ntheir further right to a land of their own in the West Bank and Gaza. \nThese legitimate rights of the Palestinian people must be satisfied, \nand my Government will steadfastly support every initiative to secure \nthose rights for the Palestinian people, while recognizing that \nIsrael also has a right to exist securely within agreed and \nrecognized boundaries. In any event, as my country has opposed \nacquisition of territory by force in our own Latin America and \nrecently in the South Atlantic, so we oppose similar acts of \naggression in the Middle East. The conflict between Iraq and the \nIslamic Republic of Iran is another instance of the United Nations \nbeing ignored. This two-year military engagement has also cost many \nthousands of lives. It has been particularly savage, with \nprisoners-of-war on one side being slaughtered in contravention of \ntheir rights as prisoners. We appeal to both countries to renew their \ncommitment to the Charter and to end this bloody conflict, by \ncomplying with Security Council resolutions 514 (1982) and 522 \n(1982). In doing so, they would ease the suffering of both their \npeoples, who have been the greatest losers in the confrontation.\nOne cannot help but wonder how many thousands of lives would have \nbeen saved, how much destruction averted and how much real \ndevelopment achieved had the Assembly's work on disarmament positive \nresults rather than unmitigated failure. Much was expected from the \nsecond special session devoted to disarmament held earlier this year, \nparticularly as tension heightened in so many parts of the world. Not \nleast among those who had high expectations of the disarmament \nsession were hundreds of thousands of young people all over the \nworld. This summer they openly demonstrated in major cities, \nincluding here in New York, the seat of the United Nations. The \nprotests of this generation against the continuous, unrelenting \nstockpiling of weapons have broken out like a rash. It is a rash of \nresistance, an epidemic of health in an otherwise unhealthy world. \nMany of those young people associate the failure to halt the arms \nrace with the ineffectiveness of the Assembly, for in the creation of \nthe United Nations did not Governments enshrine in the Charter a role \nfor collective security? Did they not promise mankind to make the \nworld a safe place in which to live? Did they not extend the hope of \nan enduring respite from the horrors of war?\nA generation has come to maturity with conventional wars and the \nthreat of nuclear war still menacing their lives. They are not \ncontent that it should remain so. They want a broader, more \ncomprehensive response from Governments, and it is obvious that such \na response must be practical steps to arrest the arms race and to \ndevise a system of collective security which demands of each nation a \ncommitment to the protection of mankind as a whole.\nThe arms race competes with development objectives. It not only robs \nthe productive process of resources, it also deprives humanity of the \nfunds needed to improve the quality of life. It not only creates \ninternational tension, it stagnates national economies.\nThere are shocking statistics available to all who would pay \nattention. Funds allocated for technical assistance to all developing \ncountries for the next five years are less than will be spent on \nweapons in the next five days. Developing countries received \napproximately $20 billion in assistance from industrialized nations \nlast year; this year the United States alone will spend $18 billion \non exploring the military uses of outer space. Total military \nspending' last year was $700 billion. That sum totals more than the \nentire income of 1,500 million people living in the 50 poorest \ncountries.\nWe should all consider what those funds would mean to the quality of \nlife in developing countries if a portion were released for \ndevelopment assistance. Moreover, the rich nations should consider \nwhat effect the release of such funds would have on the productive \nsectors of their own economies, on jobs for their own young people \nand on health care for their old.\nMy delegation was pleased to see a report this week that the chairmen \nof the biggest corporations in the United States, including many of \nthose that count on the Pentagon for their business, have called for \na cut in military spending. Although their objective may be confined \nto narrow national concerns in the United States, it is at least an \nacknowledgement by a powerful group that military spending is not \nsacrosanct.\nA halt to the arms race has become a matter for urgent global action in the cause \nof mankind's survival. The Assembly would fail to satisfy the noble \nideals for which the United Nations was established if we turn a deaf \near to the eloquent calls for peace and a halt to the arms race that \nhave echoed so profoundly across so many continents.\nThe depression of the 1930s and the Second World War were followed by \nunprecedented international co-operative efforts to reconstruct the \nworld economy. The international economic order, which was \nestablished as a result of those efforts, can no longer cope with the \nrealities of the 1980s, but the efforts which attended its creation \nare worthy of emulation. For it is a similar kind of international \neffort which our global community requires today, one which includes \ncountries of the North and South, the East and West.\nSuch an effort must have as its goal a vision of how the world could \nbe if there were a will by Governments to make it so. It should be a \nvision which acknowledges the pluralistic nature of our societies, \naccepts the inevitability of our economic interdependence and \nresolves that our children should inherit a peaceful and prosperous \nplanet.\nThe Assembly is in a unique position to help mankind establish that \nvision, for the conditions outside this building-in the cities and \nrural dwellings of our many countries-demand urgent change. It is a \ntask which should be embraced with alacrity, for future generations \nwill judge us harshly if, despite our recognition of a need to act, \nwe sacrifice long- term global well-being for short-term national \ngains. Antigua and Barbuda stands committed to help make such a \nvision a reality.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like at \nthe outset to congratulate you warmly, Sir, on \nyour election to the high post of President of \nthe thirty- seventh session of the General \nAssembly and to assure you of our full \nco-operation and support. Having known you \npersonally for a long period of time and being in \na position to appreciate your outstanding \nqualities, I am confident that under your most \nable leadership the Assembly will conduct \nfruitful deliberations and that it will \nsuccessfully pursue the many important issues \nwhich are pending before it. In paying a \nwell-deserved tribute to you on this occasion, I \nrecall the excellent relations we maintain with \nyour country, Hungary.\n2.\tAt the same time I should like to express \nour sincere feelings of appreciation to your \npredecessor, Mr. Kittani of Iraq, for the \nexemplary way in which he presided over the \ndeliberations of the thirty-sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly and the resumed and special \nsessions.\n3.\tAlmost four decades ago, following the \ndeliberations at Dumbarton Oaks, representatives \nof 50 countries assembled in San Francisco to \ndraft the Charter of the United Nations, an \norganization which was established with the \nobjective of saving future generations from the \nscourge of war. As a culmination of man's \nhistoric yearning for peace and justice and \nhaving just witnessed the ravages of the Second \nWorld War, the founding fathers manifested a new \nspirit of unity and co-operation in their noble \npursuit of upholding mankind's lofty ideals of \npeace, freedom and justice.\n4.\tAs we approach the fortieth anniversary \nof the United Nations, the peoples of the world \nwould naturally expect us to renew our commitment \nto the letter and spirit of the Charter, which \nshould guide our thoughts, our deliberations and \nabove all our actions. A total, unequivocal and \nunconditional commitment by all States to the \nprinciples enshrined in the Charter would \nundoubtedly contribute to the strengthening of \nthe effectiveness of the United Nations which is \nso much needed, particularly as regards the \nparamount goal of promoting international peace \nand security.\n5.\tIt is in this spirit that the Republic of \nCyprus is participating in the deliberations of \nthe thirty- seventh session of the General \nAssembly. We strongly believe in the United \nNations and, in spite of its present weaknesses, \nwe trust that the day will come when its \nprinciples will prevail all over the globe. We \nregard the principles of the Charter as the \ncornerstone of our political credo and the main \nshield of our security, for we hold that the only \nassurance of peace and survival is freedom and \njustice.\n6.\tBeyond the pledges of dedication, \nhowever, each new session also gives an \nopportunity to take stock of the world situation. \nThe attention of the world community is focused \non the major problems which are debated here, \nespecially in these days when international peace \nand security are in serious jeopardy owing to the \nconfrontations and hostilities which we have \nwitnessed this year. The situation is grim and \nthe prospects ominous. Never before since the \ncoming into existence of the United Nations has \nthe world slid into such a predicament.\n7.\tWe are in the midst of such a depressing \ndeterioration of the world political and \neconomic situation that the possibility of \ngeneral conflagration looms menacingly on the \nhorizon. Detente is not nowadays a feature in the \ninternational situation. It is the opposite that \nnow prevails. We are living in a world \ncharacterized by continuous insecurity and \ncrises, where the use of force is the order of \nthe day. And what is even worse is that \naggression, violation of human rights and \nterrorism remain unpunished and unremedied \nbecause of the failure of the Members of the \nUnited Nations, and in particular those that are \nmembers of the Security Council to give the \nCouncil the necessary means for the enforcement \nof its resolutions. The failure of the United \nNations to deal effectively with world problems \ncauses a serious crisis of confidence which \nerodes the very usefulness of the organization.\n8.\tThe remarks of the Secretary-General in \nhis report on the work of the Organization are \nvery pertinent, he said:\n\\\"Certainly we have strayed far from the Charter \nin recent years. Governments that believe they \ncan win an international objective by force are \noften quite ready to do so, and domestic opinion \nnot infrequently applauds such a course. The \nSecurity Council, the primary organ of the United \nNations for the maintenance of international \npeace and security, all too often finds itself \nunable to take decisive action to resolve \ninternational conflicts and its resolutions are \nincreasingly defied or ignored by those that feel \nthemselves strong enough to do so. Too frequently \nthe Council seems powerless to generate the \nsupport and influence to ensure that its \ndecisions are respected, even when these are \ntaken unanimously. Thus the process of peaceful \nsettlement of disputes prescribed in the Charter \nis often brushed aside. Sterner measures for \nworld peace were envisaged in Chapter VII of the \nCharter, which was conceived as a key element of \nthe United Nations system of collective security, \nbut the prospect of realizing such measures is \nnow deemed almost impossible in our divided \ninternational community. We are perilously near \nto a new international anarchy.\\\"\n9.\tThe dismal performance of the \ninternational community in the execution of its \nduty to respect and honour the Charter is \nportrayed very aptly and clearly by that \nstatement of the Secretary-General. And although \nthe findings of all of us, as set out in speeches \nbefore the Assembly, are identical with the \nconclusions of the Secretary-General, those who \nwield power do not appear to be willing to take \nthe necessary remedial action.\n10.\tThat crisis of confidence was recently \nfurther accentuated by the failure of the twelfth \nspecial session, the second special session \ndevoted to disarmament, to call a halt to the \never-escalating arms race, and to conform to the \ndirectives of the Pinal Document of the Tenth \nSpecial Session of the General Assembly for the \ncreation of an effective collective international \nsecurity system, concurrently with disarmament. \nThe Final Document is emphatic and clear in \nasserting that \\\"Genuine and lasting peace can \nonly be created through the effective \nimplementation of the security system provided \nfor in the Charter of the United Nations and the \nspeedy and substantial reduction of arms and \narmed forces\\\".\n11.\tIt has all along been our position that \ndisarmament cannot be achieved in isolation, \nwithout simultaneously setting into motion the \nsystem of international security through the \nUnited Nations. Only after collective security \nestablishes confidence and States are no more \nvictims of aggression, can disarmament be \neffectively dealt with. Such confidence is at \npresent lacking and, as a result, the arms race \ncontinues unabated. The world lives constantly \nunder the threat of a holocaust. Mankind is \nconfronted with new, more sophisticated and more \ndestructive weapons, posing an unprecedented \nthreat of annihilation and extinction.\n12.\tThe colossal amounts laid out on \narmaments is an additional important element of \nstrain and also a continuous drain on the \neconomies of nations. A considerable part of \nmankind, living under conditions of deprivation \nand starvation, is compelled to watch helplessly \nwhile vast amounts and resources are diverted to \nthe accumulation of deadly nuclear weapons. Thus \nwe have the paradox of man adopting and fostering \nthe means of destruction in his effort to survive.\n13.\tThe nuclear arms control talks between \nthe two super-Powers, which were resumed last \nweek in Geneva following their two-month summer \nrecess, justifiably attract the attention of all \npeoples in all continents, for upon their outcome \nlies to a considerable extent the greatly \ndesired return to detente and consequently to the \nsecuring of conditions for the peaceful solution \nof international problems. Their success would be \na major contribution to peace. That is why Cyprus \njoins all peace-loving countries in urging that \nthe utmost effort be exerted for their success.\n14.\tThe present bleak picture dictates that \nthe state of world affairs cannot and should not \nremain unchecked. It has consistently been the \nposition of Cyprus that the Security Council \nshould be given the means for enforcement action \nfor the maintenance of peace and security through \nthe availability of a United Nations force, as \ncalled for in Article 43 of the Charter. Such a \ndevelopment would act as a catalyst to the arms \nrace and would make the decisions of the United \nNations binding in a real sense. We have \nmaintained all along that we should concentrate \nnot merely on the adoption of resolutions and \ndeclarations, but also \u2014which is certainly more \nimportant\u2014on their implementation. This is an \nabsolute necessity if the United Nations is to \nperform the task entrusted to it by humanity. Let \nus listen to the voice of our Secretary- General \nand commence without further delay the process \ntowards remedying the situation. If we fail to do \nso, we will not be doing our duty and the very \nfuture of the United Nations will be at stake, \nwith the net result that anarchy and chaos will \ncontinue increasingly to prevail in the world \ninstead of the rule of law and the principles of \nthe Charter.\n15.\tRecent debates on the question of \nPalestine and Lebanon brought to the foreground \nand demonstrated in a crude and tragic way the \ninability of the Organization to fulfill its \nparamount responsibility of maintaining \ninternational peace and security. Ten Security \nCouncil resolutions went unheeded whilst the \ntragic siege of Beirut and the indiscriminate \nbombing and shelling were going on. The \nOrganization stood literally helpless while the \nPalestinians were targeted for extinction.\n16.\tIn expressing my deep concern in this \nrespect, I made a proposal for the convening of a \nspecial session of the General Assembly to deal \nwith the question of the implementation of United \nNations resolutions. Developments since then, as \nboldly and clearly elaborated upon in the report \nof the Secretary-General, have strengthened my \nconviction that it is imperative that the General \nAssembly should, as a matter of urgency, consider \nthis question in depth with the aim of producing \ndefinite and positive results. While repeating my \nproposal for a special session, for which \nconsultations may commence, I today propose \nformally the inclusion in the agenda of this \ncurrent session of a separate item entitled \n\\\"Implementation of the resolutions of the United \nNations\\\" and I have instructed the delegation of \nCyprus So enter immediately into appropriate \nconsultations in this respect. I urge the General \nAssembly to accept the inclusion of this item and \nto attach to it the importance it deserves. I am \nconfident that a full and constructive debate on \nthis item will result in setting in motion the \nproper process for finding the right answer to \nthis extremely serious and outstandingly \nsignificant issue.\n17.\tThe contradictions between the \nexpectations of mankind and the performance of \nthe United Nations are also illustrated by the \nabsence of any meaningful progress in the \nNorth-South dialogue for a more equitable \ndistribution of wealth. It would not be an \nexaggeration to say that ours is a civilization \nof opulence and abundance and at the same time of \nfamine and deprivation, a civilization of \\\"haves\\\" \nand \\\"have nots\\\". While about a tenth of the \npopulation of developing countries is exposed to \nstarvation, a quarter suffers from malnutrition \nand the rest lives in deprivation and \ndestitution, others can spend lavishly and live \ncomfortably. The International Meeting on \nCo-operation and Development, held at Cancun in \n1981, unfortunately failed to remedy that \ndisparity and socio-economic injustice.\n18.\tThe perpetuation of the North-South \ndichotomy, of the highly unbalanced distribution \nof wealth, not only is a stigma on our \ncivilization but also poses considerable \nobstacles to any efforts to deal with related \npolitical issues confronting the world.\n19.\tInterdependence, which is one of the main \ntraits of the political and economic \ninternational life of today, reinforces the need \nto define the content of the new international \neconomic order and of reaching an acceptable \nagreement. Our commitment to international peace \nand security and to the uniform progress of \nmankind makes us even more determined to work \nresolutely towards the establishment of the new \ninternational economic order.\n20.\tThe failure to get the global round of \nnegotiations off the ground so far is \ndisappointing. Despite the fact that certain \nareas of agreement have been identified, it has \nnot proved possible to reach agreement on basic \npre-conditions. But I repeat: we all share a \nresponsibility towards mankind, towards future \ngenerations. We cannot let them down. And the \nresponsibility of those who can afford to make \nconcessions to ensure the success of this \nobjective is even heavier. We must redouble our \nefforts, brushing aside the disappointments and \nbitter experiences of the past, and strive even \nharder for success. It is neither simple nor easy \nto reach solutions based on principles. On the \nother hand, only such solutions will be lasting \nand effective.\n21.\tOnce again we reiterate our belief that \nthe principles of non-alignment are becoming \neven more relevant today than when they were \nfirst formulated and disseminated. In the light \nof the realities of today's international \nsituation, the principles of non-alignment \nprovide small countries with the foundation upon \nwhich they can build a structure of positive \nrelationships with all countries without being \ndrawn into bloc rivalries.\n22.\tCyprus, one of the founding members of \nthe movement, is today, 21 years later, proud to \nnote that non-alignment has contributed \npositively to the promotion of peace and to the \nprevalence of the principles of justice and \nfreedom. The role of the non- aligned movement in \ninternational affairs has been consolidated and \nthere can be no question as to its significance. \nIn fact, the purposes of non-alignment as regards \ndetente and the peaceful solution of \ninternational problems and its goals of freedom, \njustice and lasting peace in the world are the \npurposes and goals of mankind. We Shall \nconsistently follow the policy of non-alignment \nand shall continue actively to participate in the \nefforts and the activities of the movement as we \nhave been doing since its inception.\n23.\tEqually, I wish to stress the \nsignificance of the continuation of the \nConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe \nand the application of all the principles and \nprovisions of the Helsinki Final Act, to which \nCyprus reaffirms its commitment. Together with \nthe other neutral and non-aligned countries of \nEurope, we are doing our utmost for the success \nof the follow-up Conference to be reconvened in \nMadrid in November, which will substantially \ncontribute to genuine detente in Europe and will \nenhance the prospects of peace throughout the \nworld.\n24.\tThe Middle East crisis continues, \nconfounded and bedeviled as never before, and it \nwill not be solved without the withdrawal of \nIsrael from all the territories it has occupied \nsince 1967 and without the solution of the \nPalestinian question with the participation on \nan equal footing of the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization [PLO], the sole, legitimate \nrepresentative of the Palestinian people. We \nhold the view that the Middle East problem is one \nof the most serious problems facing the world \ntoday and threatening international peace, and at \nits core is the Palestinian question. The \ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people to \ndignity and freedom must be recognized. And the \naspirations of the Palestinians to the creation \nof an independent and sovereign Palestinian State \nmust be realized.\n25.\tThat has been our consistent and \nprincipled position on the Middle East and we \nshall keep striving within the context of the \nUnited Nations, along with the other members of \nthe non-aligned movement to contribute to a just \nand lasting solution to that problem. It was in \nline with this brotherly solidarity with the \npeople of Palestine, Lebanon and the Syrian Arab \nRepublic and the non-aligned movement that we \nacted as host from 15 to 17 July in Nicosia tothe \nExtraordinary Ministerial Meeting of the \ncoordinating Bureau of Non-Aligned Countries on \nthe question of Palestine. In the same spirit, \nCyprus participated in the Ministerial Committee \nformed at that meeting which had a number of \nconstructive contacts aimed at the promotion of \nthe rights of the people of Palestine.\n26.\tWe reaffirm our full support for the \nsovereignty, independence, territorial integrity \nand unity of much- tormented Lebanon. The \nabhorrent massacre of Palestinian civilians, \nwomen and children, has appalled and brought \nunparalleled shock to our people and has \nunderlined the need for effective measures for \nthe protection of all the population in Lebanon.\n27.\tThe war between Iraq and the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran continues unabated, causing much \nloss of life and property to two countries in the \nnon-aligned movement. This is another tragic \nexample of the inability of the Organization to \nmeet its primary objectives of maintaining peace \nand security and ensuring the peaceful settlement \nof disputes between States.\n28.\tThere is hardly any other issue in \ninternational relations in regard to which the \nworld community has been able to arrive at a \nhigher level of understanding and agreement than \nthe imperative need for the elimination of all \nforms of racial discrimination and in particular \nof its worst manifestation, namely, the odious \ndoctrine of\tYet this abhorrent doctrine is \nstill alive, and so are other practices of racial \ndiscrimination, emanating either from internal \noppression or from foreign aggressive designs. \nSouth Africa, most notably, persists in its \ndefiant attitude towards the United Nations by \nflouting and ignoring the decisions of the \nOrganization, by denying every single tenet \nembodied in the Charter and by failing to respect \nthe basic principles of the equal rights of \nindividuals and the self-determination of peoples \nwithout distinction as to race, religion or sex.\n29.\tI wish to reiterate once again our \nsolidarity with the people of South Africa, and \nindeed all oppressed peoples under colonialist \nregimes and foreign domination who continue to \nstruggle for freedom, equality and justice. We \nalso reiterate our whole-hearted support for the \npeople of Namibia and express our conviction that \ntheir just struggle will succeed. To this end it \nis necessary that Security Council resolution 435 \n(1978) be strictly and urgently implemented as a \nwhole, to enable the people of Namibia to take \nits rightful place as an independent State. We \nalso voice again our solidarity with the \nfront-line States in southern Africa and condemn \nSouth Africa's acts of aggression against those \ncountries, which are shouldering a major part of \nthe struggle for the eradication of the evil of \n\tMf.\n30.\tDespite the formidable achievements and \nthe concerted efforts continuously exerted to \nbring about decolonization, there are still \nterritories under colonial or neo-colonial rule. \nI take this opportunity to declare once again \nthat Cyprus fully supports all the efforts of the \nUnited Nations for the eradication of the last \nvestiges of colonialism in various parts of the \nworld, as well as for the adoption of measures \naimed against the revival of colonialism.\n31.\tIn that context I would mention the case \nof Western Sahara, where the principle of \nself-determination has not yet been applied. \nContrary to the numerous General Assembly \nresolutions on this subject, the Sahraoui people \nhave not yet been allowed to exercise their \ninalienable rights.\n32.\tI do not propose to refer specifically to \nthe many other cases of destabilization, \nconflict, dispute and Confrontation which are \nscattered all over the globe. The increase in \ntheir number, extent and intensity simply points \nto the fact that man's future is in the balance.\n33.\tPerhaps in no other United Nations \nactivity do we observe such a degree of \ndiscrepancy between the resolutions we adopt and \nthe realities we witness as in the Held of human \nrights. It is really frustrating and saddening to \nnote the ever-increasing gap between rhetoric and \nreal human attitudes and action. Even more \nsaddening is the helplessness or passivity with \nwhich the international community watches mass, \nflagrant and horrible violation of basic human \nrights and fundamental freedoms, unable or \nunwilling to do anything decisive and effective \nabout it. That is why we should concentrate on \nways and means to ensure effective and strict \nrespect for human rights. That is why we should \nwelcome and strongly support the trend which has \nappeared in recent years towards conventions \nwhich have a built-in machinery for the \nimplementation of their provisions. The \nInternational Convention on the Elimination of \nAll Forms of Racial Discrimination and the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political \nRights  are such cases, and they must be followed \nby others.\n34.\tCyprus has consistently supported the \nneed for all to collaborate in the establishment \nof a new world information and communications \norder based, inter alia, on the free circulation \nand wider and better balanced dissemination of \ninformation, guaranteeing the diversity of \nsources and free access to information. We \nmaintain that it is imperative to change the \ndependent status of the developing countries in \nthe field of information and communication, which \nis an integral part of the development process.\n35.\tWe salute the agreement reached on the \nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,' \ndespite some negative votes, after eight years of \nintensive consultations and negotiations, to \nwhich Cyprus made its modest contribution. The \nimportance of this achievement can hardly be \nover-emphasized. It marks the advent of a new era \nin which the nations of the world, old and new, \nrich and poor, from the entire political \nspectrum, have agreed to set the rules that \nshould govern the use and exploitation of the \nresources of our common heritage in the seas and \noceans. The successful completion of the \nConvention, which also regulates the many other \naspects of the law of the sea, enhances the \nprospects for international co-operation and \nmakes a very necessary contribution to the \nprestige of the United Nations.\n36.\tThe problem of Cyprus continues to be one \nof the most serious international problems, \nthreatening peace and security in the sensitive \narea of the eastern Mediterranean. This situation \nis yet another example of the inability of the \nUnited Nations to act by implementing its own \nresolutions. Eight years have elapsed since \nTurkish troops invaded Cyprus and occupied more \nthan 36 per cent of its territory; eight years of \nagony, after the devastation and pillage, in \nwhich all human rights have been and continue to \nbe violated by Turkey; eight years of the crude \nact of occupation.\n37.\tCyprus has come through many tribulations \nduring its proud 7,000-year history but has never \nbefore experienced such a sinister operation: an \noperation whereby the occupation is coupled with \nthe systematic attempt to change the demographic \ncharacter of the occupied part; an operation \nwhereby the indigenous population of the occupied \nterritory was savagely ousted from its \nbirthplace. A birthplace does not belong to any \ngiven generation of people. It is perennial in \ncharacter; it belongs to history. So the \naggression of Turkey against Cyprus is not only a \npresent-day violation of sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity: it is also a sacrilegious \ntrespass on one of the oldest recorded histories \nof the world. The Turkish aggression and \noccupation brought upon Cyprus many scars which \ncannot be healed as long as the violation of our \nsovereignty and territorial integrity persists, \nas long as the Turkish army of occupation is on \nour territory.\n38.\tEight years have elapsed and we are still \ntrying to trace the fate of more than 1,600 \npersons, missing since the invading forces set \nfoot on Cyprus. In spite of unflagging efforts, \nin spite of a number of resolutions adopted by \nthe Assembly, no progress has been made on this \npurely humanitarian issue. We call upon the \ninternational community to make its voice heard \nmore clearly and loudly in Ankara, so that a \nworkable arrangement may be achieved to trace in \na proper manner the fate of the missingpersons.\n39.\tI stand at this rostrum once again to \nconvey to the Assembly the protest of the people \nof Cyprus at the continued Turkish occupation \nand, in general, at the contemptuous way in which \nTurkey has been treating the resolutions of the \nUnited Nations on the question of Cyprus, and to \nreiterate our demands for their strict and full \nimplementation. The words of the \nSecretary-General in his report, which still \nreverberate in this Hall, were really scathing \nand severely censorious of those who failed to \ncomply with United Nations resolutions and of \nthose who try \\\"to win an international objective \nby force\\\".\n40.\tThe facts with regard to Cyprus are well \nknown to the Assembly. Although we are victims of \naggression and occupation, we have mustered all \ngood will in the quest for a lasting solution and \npermanent peace. The intercommunal talks, which \nhave been going on in Cyprus for a long time, \nhave produced no results of any substance due to \nthe intransigent and negative attitude of Turkey. \nIt is incumbent upon the international community, \nand particularly those who possess the necessary \ninfluence, to make Turkey remove its forces of \noccupation from, and abandon its sinister designs \nagainst, Cyprus and comply fully with the \nresolutions of the United Nations.\n41.\tTogether with my assurances that we for \nour part shall continue to strive hard for a \npeaceful solution in conformity with the \nresolutions of the United Nations, I must \ncategorically state once again that under no \ncircumstances shall we accept the results of the \ncrime committed against Cyprus or any solution \nwhich directly or indirectly might lead to the \ndivision and partition of Cyprus or amount to the \nabandonment of the inherent rights of the people \nof Cyprus, such as the right of the refugees to \nreturn to their homes and properties. We envisage \na completely independent, sovereign, \nterritorially integral, federal, united, \ndemilitarized and non-aligned Republic of Cyprus, \nin which all citizens, whether Greek Cypriots or \nTurkish Cypriots or Maronites or Armenians or \nLatins, will be able to enjoy fully their human \nrights and fundamental freedoms and co-operate \nfor a happy and prosperous future in peace and \nfreedom for generations to come. Our aspiration \nis to turn Cyprus Rom a place of conflict into a \nplace of peace, something which would be a \nsignificant contribution to the cause of \ninternational peace and security. We aspire to \nturn Cyprus into a bridge of understanding and \nco-operation between three continents.\n42.\tI have no doubt whatsoever that, if \nforeign intervention and interference cease and \nthe unity of the country and the people is \nrestored, there would be no problem which could \nnot be overcome. In a genuine desire to ensure \nlasting peace in our much tormented country, I \nput forward some time ago the proposal for the \ntotal demilitarization and disarmament of \nCyprus. I declared that we would be prepared to \nagree to the stationing in the Republic of Cyprus \nfor as long as necessary, of an international \nUnited Nations police force which would supervise \na united mixed Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot \npolice force composed in accordance with the \npopulation ratio. I reiterate once again my \nproposal. The Greek Prime Minister, Mr. \nPapandreou, offered to withdraw\nfrom Cyprus the small Greek contingent stationed \nunder the 1960 Treaties, provided, of course, \nthat all the Turkish troops are withdrawn, in \nwhich case Greece would be prepared to pay for \nthe additional expenses for an increased \ninternational force of the United Nations. We \nsupport this generous proposal of the Greek Prime \nMinister, which was set out before the Assembly \nagain in the statement of the Minister for \nForeign Affairs of Greece [//f%\n43.\tThe time has really come for the \ninternational community to act resolutely in \norder to give effect to its own verdict in regard \nto Cyprus. This unacceptable situation cannot go \non indefinitely. It is because of the lack of any \nprogress towards a solution of the Cyprus problem \nand because of Turkey's continuous disregard of \nthe relevant United Nations resolutions that we \nhave asked for a new debate on Cyprus by the \nGeneral Assembly in an effort to employ ways and \nmeans and take any steps and measures necessary \nto promote the implementation of the relevant \nUnited Nations resolutions. I call upon the \nAssembly to act effectively so that a potential \nsource of danger can be removed in the interests \nof peace and international security and for the \nsake of the most sacred principles for which the \nUnited Nations stands.\n44.\tI fervently hope that mankind will come \nto its senses before it is too late, before the \n\\\"international anarchy\\\" to which the \nSecretary-General referred in his report becomes \na way of life on this planet with all the grave \nimplications this would entail for the very \nsurvival of humanity. We trust that, under the \nguidance of the United Nations leadership, a new \nmentality will prevail and that, with the full \nsupport and co-operation of each and every Member \nState, a new era will dawn, not of anarchy and \nconflict, but of peace, justice and \ninternational legal order in accordance with the \nprinciples of the United Nations. To this noble \nobjective we for our part pledge our dedication \nand full support.\n"

        "file_text": "118.\t  Taking part in the general debate as it comes to an end may be a disadvantage, in that one may say things that have already been said and therefore be boring. However, what is important is not to try to be novel but, rather, to reaffirm our belief in principles that we hold dear and to state precisely our position with regard to the state of the world.\n119.\tThe annual session of the General Assembly is a high point in the lives of people throughout the world. It concerns everyone, through their delegations, not simply the illusion but the reality of taking part in the management of the world, through dialog, conciliation and the sharing of the ideals of peace, justice, freedom and progress.\n120.\tIt is in that spirit that the People's Republic of the Cong< peaks today, thus contributing to the ennobling and lofty work whose purposes and principles are clearly set out in the Charter.\n121.\tBefore going any further, I should like to say how glad my country is that Mr. Hollai is presiding over the current session. His unanimous choice by the General Assembly was not only a well-deserved tribute to his country, the Hungarian People's Republic, a friend of the people's Republic of the Congo, but also proper appreciation of his qualities and merits, which are in keeping with his responsibilities in his own country and our happy memories of him when he so worthily represented Hungary at the United Nations. It is a pleasure for me to extend to him the sincere congratulations of the Congolese delegation. We also express our appreciation to Mr. Kittani, our friend and the President's predecessor, for the brilliant way in which he discharged his duties as President of the thirty-sixth session and the second special session devoted to disarmament. I also have particular pleasure in repeating my country's warmest congratulations to Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who has been Secretary-General for almost a year now, and who has devoted himself to his work with the conviction and dedication that we know him to possess.\n122.\tThe human race is living through one of the most turbulent eras of its existence. We have all said this, and we are constantly concerned about it. We must see that matters do not get out of hand. We must stop the dangerous trend of the world's progressing in accordance with a logic that would crush the human race by plunging it into chaos, blindness, confrontation and war.\n123.\tOur international conscience must eliminate the use of force and must condemn those who wish to take advantage of their strength to trample on the law. Arbitrary action cannot be the basis of the law in this world unless the human race abandons its desire for progress and admits that it is retrogressing.\n124.\tWhen the Zionist State of Israel sweeps through a whole country to invade, attack and destroy a sovereign State and massacre its population; when racist South Africa elevates apartheid into a government doctrine, pillages neighboring independent States, oppresses and slaughters black people blithely and with impunity, then we feel we have been thrown back into the dark night of barbarism and savagery, totally divorced from our own age and from a conscience that only yesterday, with astonishing strength, fought the war against Nazism and other attacks on mankind.\n125.\tAt a time when many attempts are being made to challenge the liberation and self-determination movements of the peoples, it is clear that the deprived world, the poor world, the world that is struggling for survival and freedom, needs more than ever before a more effective, more dynamic and stronger Organization. In Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America there is a trend now to challenge independence won at such cost and to deny freedom. The retrograde imperialist forces are competing with one another, with utter contempt for international law and \nmorality, to see who can best strengthen the last bastions of colonialism and racism, employing every method available to them to ensure their control of those regions and their natural resources.\n126.\tIn Africa, the exploitation and enslavement imposed from outside the continent is a matter of increasing concern to us.\n127.\tOur first thought is of the gallant people of southern Africa who have been thus ravished; their sufferings are our sufferings; the Congolese people feel deeply all the frustrations and horrors imposed on them so unjustly.\n128.\tThe odious regime of apartheid continues to push horror and barbarism beyond imaginable limits. No morality or law can stop it; in the name of a doctrine that dares not say what it really is, in the name of we know not what law, the racists of Pretoria are committing acts of aggression and invading the front-line States because they believe they can do so with impunity.\n129.\tThe United Nations has condemned the complicity of the industrialized countries, without which Mr. Botha and his assistants would be powerless.\n130.\tWill mankind continue much longer to let itself be duped? Can we allow such a situation to continue? The international community surely has a duty to consider urgent measures to impose and apply the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination. The Congo believes that the peoples of southern Africa will inevitably triumph over oppression and enslavement, for the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination is an achievement of the human race, and this achievement remains irreversible. It is the sacred duty of the peoples of southern Africa to sacrifice everything, even their lives, to ensure the exercise of their right to freedom and independence. The international community must demonstrate full and effective solidarity with these peoples in their struggle.\n131.\tThe fact that we are hoping for independence for Namibia in 1983 should not permit us to forget to place the Namibian problem in its proper context. The future of that country is a matter for the Namibian people and SWAPO, its sole and authentic representative. That has been sufficiently demonstrated by the heroic struggle waged so valiantly for so many years and by the great sacrifices made. The procrastinations of the countries in the contact group, the various deals delaying this long awaited outcome, are pure and simple violations of the right of peoples to self-determination. The terms of resolution 435 (1978) must be respected; there can be no bargaining away or amendment of its terms. The United Nations, as the international organization which has set itself among other objectives that of ensuring the inalienable rights of the peoples, must not tolerate such violations.\n132.\tThe situation in northwest Africa, specifically in Western Sahara, must be viewed in the light of that same principle of self-determination. The question of Western Sahara is one of decolonization, and it must be seen as such; any distortion, any policy of annexation or of military occupation amounts to the crushing, the mutilation, the destruction of a people. I am glad\n(hat the United Nations has avoided any such injustice by its recognition many years ago of the right of the Sahraoui people to self-determination. My country is pleased that it is one of the 60 or so States that have recognized the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic, thus recognizing its sovereignty in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations. Therefore any discussion of this problem, any reference to some past happening is merely an attempt to camouflage other designs that the Organization could not countenance. The question of Western Sahara is clear, and there is no room for ambiguity. The occupying forces that are waging this destructive war against a peaceful people should listen to the voice of the heart and the mind instead of continuing with this dangerous and reprehensible adventurism.\n133.\tMy country endorses the call for the reconstruction of Chad, a friendly sister country, tom by civil war. But that reconstruction requires the reconciliation of the people of the country, without distinction of race, religion or political view. It also means that there must be no foreign intervention.\n134.\tI cannot refer to the tragedy in Lebanon, and the massacre in Beirut, without feelings of deep emotion. Each one of us can visualize those savagely mutilated bodies piled up under the rubble of recently bombed buildings. It is horror institutionalized; the extreme of barbarism; terrible scenes, anathema to the modem age, but revealing in more ways than one the true nature of that regime that has been condemned and, because of its repeated evil deeds, has now been outlawed by the civilized nations of the world. Not content to pillage by annexation and occupation, the Israeli Zionists are diabolically pursuing the peaceful Palestinian people even into exile. For Israel it was a question of weakening at whatever cost the PLO and its leadership in order to master the situation and impose its will in the Middle East.\n135.\tThe Congo pays a tribute to all the members of the Security Council for having spoken in frank and unmistakable terms, in the language of truth, without exception condemning Israel for its crimes in Lebanon. It is highly desirable that that condemnation lead to positive action, that is, the recognition of the Palestinian people and their national rights, in particular the right to return to their homeland.\n136.\tMy country's position on the Palestinian issue is well known. The recent events in Lebanon are one stage in a vast plot against the Palestinian people, and they prove once again that our analysis of the situation is the correct one. Peace in the Middle East requires a just settlement of the Palestinian problem. No solution that does not involve the Palestinian people and its sole authentic representative, the PLO, can be effective or lasting. We reaffirm the right of the Palestinian people to national existence and the restoration of its inalienable and inviolable rights. Neither weapons nor mass destruction can ever force the Palestinian people to abandon their sacred right, their dignity as a people.\n137.\tI should like to say once again to those gallant people of Latin America, who are struggling for the free exercise of their right to self-determination, that the people of the Congo support them.\u2003\n138.\tI should also like to reaffirm the brotherly solidarity of my country with the peoples of Kampuchea and Viet Nam in their tireless efforts, under their respective Governments, to achieve national reconstruction after so many years of war and destruction.\n139.\tThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in its legitimate struggle for the peaceful reunification of its great homeland of Korea, also merits our respect and esteem.\n140.\tI have so far been dealing with matters of decolonization, the free exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination, because my country believes that full and final decolonization is a prerequisite for the promotion of peace and relationships favorable to development and co-operation.\n141.\tThe profound crisis in the world economy and the inability of the world to apply the necessary remedies give rise in our various States to reactions of self-preservation and protectionism as a result of which the gap between North and South is widening.\n142.\tWe are going through a difficult time; everywhere our economies are finding it impossible to keep pace with events. All the reports submitted, whatever economic body they come from, including the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, emphasize the danger into which the world is rushing.\n143.\tSuch a danger should make us stand by and support each other, but how many hopes have been dimmed by the ambitions of some and the egoism of others? The United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris in 1981, aroused more hope, as did the meeting at Cancun, which offered some possibility of a resumption of the indispensable North-South dialog. But unfortunately this is the hour of disenchantment. Global negotiations within the United Nations on the definition of the new rules that should govern international economic relations have reached a serious impasse.\n144.\tThe industrialized countries seem to be dealing with the crisis by means of a few palliatives, but the third world countries are weaker and they are increasingly exposed. They are bearing the burden of the economic in-adaptability and anachronisms in a way that is not really justified. The constant reduction in aid, the increase in the food deficit, the limits on access to technology, the deterioration in the terms of trade, and an accumulation of similar handicaps, constitute but one aspect of the ills that afflict us.\n145.\tAll these factors urge us to move toward a worldwide dialog, because we believe in the interdependence of the countries of the world. But we seem to be bogged down in the negotiations for the establishment of a new framework for international economic relations. This should make us think about our current practice and devise more flexible and effective formulas. The establishment of regional subgroups such as those recommended for Africa in the Lagos Plan of Action and the search for ways of redefining all our regional economic policies could, we feel, constitute a first approach. However, such a\nprogram can be carried out only in an international context of peace and security.\n146.\tThe Congolese people are peaceful people. We jealously defend our freedom and concentrate on the tasks of development. Our people believe that everything possible must be done to ensure better understanding between peoples and individuals. The unbridled use of force can never be accepted, nor can threats or intimidation become the rules of international life, or selfishness, hatred or prejudice dominate relations between nations, for that would spell our doom.\n147.\tAgainst the background of the tension and international confrontation prevailing in the world today, the morality and the ethic of nations must be something other than simple complacency or acceptance, indifference to the violations of international law, attacks on the freedom of individuals and peoples, the destruction of innocent lives civilizations and the heritage of man. Rather, more than ever before, we must show extreme vigilance, constant mobilization, solidarity that knows no frontier and clear-sightedness.\n148.\tInternational peace and security, of course, depend on many factors. These include, in particular, specific measures which will lead to real disarmament. I made this point in my statement last June at the twelfth special session [9th meeting], the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. It is unfortunate that that session did not live up to our hopes and enable us to take important steps forward.\n149.\tBut the debates did convince us of the need to continue our discussions with the vision of establishing among all members of the international community relations based on trust, mutual respect and the recognition by all Member States of the right of each people to choose its national institutions in freedom, to independence, to security and to peace.\n150.\tWe have faith in the future, faith in man and his creative ability, his intelligence and his wisdom. But our faith cannot be a blind faith; it must be supported by constant efforts made by everybody to prevent a catastrophe.\n151.\tWe believe that it is possible to avoid a third world war by signing strategic arms limitation agreements and establishing conventions and agreements that would link the nations of the world together through non-aggression pacts.\n152.\tWe also believe that it is possible to find some area of agreement among nations to overcome the economic crisis, working for a new international economic order by replacing the present rules of competition by co-operation and co-development.\n153.\tLastly, we believe it is possible to reduce distrust among nations and political systems and to prevent confrontations becoming inevitable by working towards peaceful coexistence.\n54. The work of peace, detente and co-operation among nations is a great humanitarian effort, and individuals, nations and peoples that contribute to this deserve our admiration. International bodies such as the United Nations which devote all their energies to this deserve our full support. We should like to\npay a tribute once again to Mr. Hollai for his contribution to the work of this session.\nOrganization of work."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it gives us great satisfaction that the President of this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly is a representative of Hungary, a nation which has succeeded in preserving its identity in all circumstances.\nMr. Secretary-General, the international community has conferred upon you the highest and most sensitive of its responsibilities in these perilous days. We must therefore all share with you the commitment of our time: peaceful, just and productive coexistence. In facing the challenge of today's unsettled world, I offer you the solidarity of my country.\nMexico sees in the United Nations the best and highest international forum, where it is possible to hope for rationality in the overwhelming presence of the absurd. Since the unparalleled ignominy of the Second World War this has been the only setting in which arguments can be adduced in the light of reason and law to prevent a new conflict that very probably would be our last. It represents the only way to give new impetus to the endeavours of civilization.\nIf these words seem exaggerated to us today, if the dramatic tone strikes us as anachronistic, let us ponder the fact that less than 40 years have passed since the end of that war. Let us recall that it was preceded, and in fact brought on by, an economic depression and that the despair caused by that serious setback proved to be an evil counsellor of peoples and Governments. Let us remember that before absurdity and death took over there was a slow and gradual debasement of reason and of life itself.\n\nThe symptoms are ominous. In recent years we have drifted far from the principles that gave birth to this Organization, in large measure because of the attitude of those who think they can achieve their objectives through the use of force and disregard of the law. They fail to realize that in abandoning the processes of the rational solution of controversies or disputes they bring us all closer to the abyss of violence and anarchy.\nToday there is no region that can regard itself as immune from crisis. The tragic conflicts of the South Atlantic and the Middle East bear witness to this. Some areas of the world are in great turmoil. I refer to those where the arrogance of their leaders is imposed on the historical demands of their peoples. We share the indignation and shame of those who, in the face of genocide practised by former victims of genocide, are now protesting against a vile crime that is an affront to mankind. Repetition of the worst excesses of the war has also revived the atmosphere of ignominy and the heavy burden of fatal foreboding.\nWe note with concern that pressure is being brought to bear on the Members of the United Nations in order to sway their votes. The results that are sometimes achieved indicate the vulnerability of many countries. The negotiating mechanisms prevailing in some agencies of the system raise doubts as to whether they are at the service of those who created them or whether they are inspired by true respect for the sovereignty of States.\nMexico has always been active in and committed to the United Nations, not with the idea that it may be the last resort for the prevention of total destruction but because it is the best means available to us to halt the process that could lead to such an outcome.\nThis makes it essential to bring together the two fundamental areas of negotiation for which the world is waiting: that which will lead to detente between the two super-Powers and that, which will reorganize relationships among countries with different levels of development. The two conflicts, between East and West and North and South, have, we would repeat, crucified all mankind. Only through a convergence of both areas of negotiations can there be established a new international order, one that includes the process of political decolonization and the fundamental challenge facing international society - economic decolonization. Both types of decolonization are changes attesting to the most profound potential of a human being the attainment of his own dignity.\nMexico's traditional adherence to and promotion of the principles of the United Nations and its contribution to those two major areas of negotiation are well known; evidence of this is the Charter of the Economic Rights and Duties of States, the world energy plan, the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development, which was held at Cancun in October 1981 and the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America. \nWe have been unflagging in our efforts to give impetus to the development of international instruments to promote disarmament worldwide, particularly in Latin America.\nWe believe that the arms race and development are in competition with each other, not only as regards the utilization of available resources but also because they represent incompatible approaches: arrogance and inequality, which will lead to annihilation; or tolerance and co-operation, which would make progress possible for all. We know that the funds allocated for technical assistance to developing countries for the next five years amounts to less than will be spent on weapons in the next five days.\nEverything would indicate that the world economy is being sacrificed to the arms race. The great Powers are arming themselves even at the expense of their own standards of living, while their adversaries are doing the same. And they are dragging all mankind, which wants not weapons but progress, into this vortex.\nThus is created a Dantesque vicious circle. The greater the tension, the greater the concern for security; the greater the insecurity, the greater the arms expenditure; the greater the concentration of resources in armaments, the greater the impoverishment and social inequality and the greater the political radicalization and tension until the wheel of destruction starts its atavistic cycle all over again.\nThe strongest Powers may insist on imposing their will upon others and on taking advantage of the power imbalance, which favours them, to strengthen their aspirations to hegemony. But they will not thus subdue moral sensibility; nor will they quell revolution. They will succeed only in fanning the flames of the conflagration that uncontrolled can set fire to everything.\nThe practical ineffectiveness of the means of collective security is at the very core of armed conflict. Thus, for example, when a weak country is openly threatened by political pressure that is superior to its own strength and it realizes that it cannot rely on the United Nations for protection, it is reduced to the fateful choice between arming itself or being annihilated.\nAt the same time, when the international community is incapable of generating the minimum conditions needed for general progress, peoples have to choose between the wretchedness of abject subsistence and the harsh road of revolution. Such is the tragedy of Latin America today. Such are the prospects of most of the nations here represented.\nAt the present moment, rather than an appeal what is needed is a warning: the world is absolutely interdependent, and not one of its parts can be saved if the others are doomed.\nMexico has tirelessly collaborated in the other major area of negotiation, which is aimed at the establishment of a new international economic order. It proposed to the community of nations that it draft a document having legal status that would encompass the doctrine and basic rules of a new model of international relations \u0097 the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which was adopted by the General Assembly almost 10 years ago.\nMexico has recently demonstrated its willingness to commit itself to the struggle for justice and rational coexistence as regards not only global problems or remote conflicts but also issues that affect it very closely and for which it has taken risks and made sacrifices. This is evidenced by the proposal for a world energy plan made by an oil-exporting country during the oil boom and above all by effective co-operation in good times and bad with those countries neighbouring ours that lack such resources.\nI consider that the ideas and proposals we put forward in the energy plan are still valid and that it is possible to foster an orderly, progressive, comprehensive and just transition between two epochs of mankind the present one, in which the consumption of hydrocarbons predominates, and the future one, in which the development of new energy resources will have priority. The world energy plan is still a good method for the achievement of the new international economic order.\nEven during the present crisis Venezuela and Mexico have moved forward and set an example by reaffirming and renewing the San Jose Agreement to help the countries of Central America and the Caribbean by guaranteeing their supplies of oil and by creating soft loan funds for their development. The $700 million that Mexico alone has earmarked to date for that purpose is granted unconditionally and without distinction and equals the amount that the United States plans to allocate for the same region.\nOur willingness to commit ourselves is shown also in our efforts to enhance the possibilities for a negotiated settlement of the social and political conflicts of that same region, notwithstanding the many who would like us to feel threatened and thus be driven by fear to support repression. They forget that Mexico has already had its revolution, which it is continually consolidating, and so has no reason to be afraid of its people's desire for justice. We support and will continue to support detente and negotiated political settlements, with due respect for the parties concerned.\nBut Mexico's most constant concern and task in the international sphere is the transition to a new economic order.\nWe have stressed that the entire gamut of economic relations between the developing countries and the industrialized world must be transformed. Those relations have figured on the agendas of many international conferences, but the progress made has not been particularly encouraging. It was therefore our thought to convene a summit meeting of the main industrialized countries and a representative number of developing nations: The idea was for heads of State and Government, rather than negotiating topic by topic, to show their firm political will to take a qualitatively significant step in the stalled negotiations by acknowledging the need to seek this essential new order.\nMexico and Austria worked for more than a year and a half to make possible the Cancun summit meeting. As the process which was to lead to the global round of negotiations became increasingly bogged down, the meeting of the heads of State took on greater importance. We noted alarming indications of a world economic slowdown. Many .countries placed their hopes in Cancun, not because it might result in solutions, but because it was the only forum that could provide the political impetus necessary to revive a suspended process.\nThe meeting took place almost a year ago and was attended by 22 heads of State and Government, or their representatives.\nIn an attempt to replace prejudice with sound judgement, and to transform monologue into dialogue and subordination into solidarity, differing points of view regarding our present-day situation were expressed openly and with tolerance for the ideas of others.\nAt that meeting many of us stated that the lack of harmonious relations was making the world in which we live increasingly perilous for rich countries and implacable and cruel for poor countries. We maintained that progress for all should be a condition for the progress of each individually.\nThe tragedy of hunger was stressed, and strategies to increase food production and improve food distribution were discussed. The possibility of organizing a fair and balanced trade in raw materials and industrialized goods was set forth. It was not only petroleum markets and prices that were dealt with, but also ways of organizing the exploitation and use of energy sources and of alleviating the financial burden that oil purchases represent for developing countries.\nTragic paradoxes that we have been unable to resolve; were examined in Cancun: recession in the countries of the North, due to, among other things, the lack of a market for goods which are needed by the South but which it cannot purchase because of inadequate financing; liquid funds from the countries of the South that are placed in the North and then loaned to other countries of the South; and the persistence, and even the worsening, of monetary and financial practices which have proven time and again to be inadequate and ineffective, both in the South and in the North.\nFaced with such paradoxes, we maintained that financing the joint development of rich and poor countries was not only rational, but the only possible way to achieve a healthy world economy.\nWe acknowledged, and we say again today, that many of the problems of the South are of the South's own making; but there are other serious constraints that stem from its relations with the North. We see today that the likelihood of such constraints becoming fatal to the world economy has been rapidly increasing since we met at Cancun.\nMany things have changed since then. In recent years we have witnessed unprecedented hostility, rhetorical belligerence and lack of understanding between the super-Powers. In 1982 the world saw the outbreak and escalation of actual armed conflict in many areas. Such conflicts are irrational in every case and should be of serious concern to us, both because of their very existence and because of the relative ease with which they are coming about.\nWhat most concerns and affects the majority of countries, however, is the extremely serious deterioration of the international economy, particularly in the poor countries, where three quarters of the world's population lives and where the consequences of the crisis are felt in tragic measure.\nSteadily decreasing income due to the plunge in the prices of raw materials on the one hand, and higher interest rates and shorter terms of repayment on the other, are the two blades of the shears that threaten to slash the momentum achieved in some countries and to cut off the chances for progress in the others.\nIn fact it is generally recognized that the world is now in the throes of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Growth rates, both in industrialized countries and in the developing world are at the lowest levels recorded in recent decades. Rampant unemployment, endemic in poor countries, has now become widespread in the most powerful nations as well. All over the world, men and women who had jobs are losing them. The reduction of inflation achieved in certain countries through huge sacrifices in employment does not mean that the problem has been overcome. The brutal rise in interest rates over the last three years has not only created an intolerable burden for debtor nations, but has also given rise to speculation and a flight of capital which are uncontrollable and of unforeseen magnitude.\nThe events of the past few years have more than confirmed the need to tackle energy problems in a comprehensive manner and in close co-ordination with the other areas of the world economy. Petroleum sales abruptly shifted from a seller's to a buyer's market, which resulted in surpluses that have again caused prices to fall and have discouraged efforts to bring about a transition in the field of energy.\nThe disarray has been detrimental to the oil- producing countries and has been a victory for no one, since it is but another factor in the crisis. The decline in available financial resources caused by lower petroleum prices has led us from an unresolved energy crisis to a financial crisis that is deepening the recession and threatening the stability of the international monetary system.\nSpectres arise in this panorama, spectres which could seriously threaten the world if the present trend continues. The most dangerous of these threats is that the social pressures created by economic dislocations could reach the point of exploding. We should recall that developing countries have no so-called social- security and crisis-control systems such as those which exist in the developed world. We cannot afford, and therefore do not have, unemployment insurance or extensive public welfare programmes.\n\nA second spectre that appears to be dangerously near at hand is a North-South and North-North crisis in trade in both basic and industrial commodities. We all want to export more in order to solve our problems, and we all want to import less to avoid a drain on our foreign exchange reserves and our domestic markets. When the entire world is in the midst of a severe recession, the only exportable item is the crisis itself. If recession in industrialized countries continues to push down the prices of raw materials and to restrict the entry of manufactured goods from the South, both our problems and theirs will become more critical.\nThe favourable trade balance of the industrialized countries as a whole has become the major feature of the international economic order, with the exception of a period of less than 10 years of positive balances for some oil-exporting countries. It is therefore inevitable that the vast majority of developing countries have a negative trade balance.\nTo maintain the flow of trade in these circumstances necessarily implies the establishment of credit flows that would make it possible to pay the industrialized countries for goods and services. To sustain growth in the countries of the South and maintain employment in the countries of the North, the amount of such credit must continually increase; this is even more the case if the cost of the accumulated debt increases as a result of higher interest rates.\nReduced availability of credit for the developing countries has serious implications not only for those countries but also for production and employment in the industrial countries. Let us not continue in this vicious circle, since it could well be the start of a new Dark Ages, with no possibility of a Renaissance.\nHere we have a third threat. I refer to the serious problem of the lack of co-ordination in the international financial system. As everyone knows, several heavily indebted countries, among them Mexico, have recently been obliged to begin renegotiating their foreign debt.\nThis is a paradox that makes us reflect on the fact that the growth of many of the countries of the South is now being criticized by the very countries that made loans to them for that purpose and that are now haggling over extending the credit needed for continued growth, although only such growth will make it possible for the former countries to repay the latter and to buy from them.\nToday, Mexico and many other third world countries will be unable to comply with the payment schedule agreed upon in conditions quite different from those that now prevail.\nSuspension of payments is to nobody's advantage and nobody wants it. But whether or not this will happen is beyond the will and, thus, the responsibility of the debtors. Everyone must negotiate seriously, carefully and realistically. The international financial system consists of several parts: lenders, borrowers and guarantors; it is tied to those that produce and those that consume, those that buy and those that sell. It is everybody's responsibility and it must be shouldered by everybody. Common situations produce similar positions, with no need for conspiracies or intrigues. We developing countries do not wish to become vassals. We cannot paralyse our economies or plunge our peoples into greater misery in order to pay debt, the servicing of which has tripled without our participation or responsibility and the conditions of which were imposed upon us. We countries of the South are about to run out of chips; if we cannot stay in the game, it will end in defeat for everyone.\nI wish to be emphatic: we countries of the South have not sinned against the world economy. Our efforts to grow in order to conquer hunger, disease, ignorance and dependency have not caused the international crisis. A more immediate cause is the decision to arm, to fight force with force, dragging all the economies, directly or indirectly, towards this senseless objective.\nBut we can overcome the crisis.\nIt will be done more quickly if we can count on the rational support of the international financial community rather than reluctance or punishment for sins we have not committed.\nSuch support will be of benefit to both creditors and debtors, for we all belong to one world, in which, if we are all part of the problem, we are also part of the solution. We need foreign exchange to make payments and' purchases. Our opposite numbers also need to buy in order to make collections and sales. This is a healthy relationship which is to everyone's advantage. It is that simple.\nMexico is a good illustration of various North- South problems because of its dual situation as a country on the threshold of development and in its geographical location and because of the domestic and international prospects as regards its petroleum resources.\nIn recent years we have made every effort to meet the needs of our population by developing its great productive potential, in conjunction with the needs of the world economy and supported by substantial external financing. For four years we grew at a rate of over 8 per cent annually, we doubled our installed industrial capacity, we rose from eighteenth to fourth place among oil-producing countries, we tripled hydrocarbon production during that period and we undertook the urgent task of intensive social development, thereby generating more than 4 million jobs not only to absorb the existing unemployed but to provide work for new generations.\nThe greatest growth in our history was dramatically interrupted in 1981. Our plans, which had been programmed and budgeted for on the basis of four successive fiscal years, suddenly could no longer be financed because of a drop in the price of raw materials, including petroleum, and because of higher interest rates on the already contracted external debt, the cost of servicing which tripled. A pernicious sequence of inflation, devaluations and mounting prices and wages put a brake on our prosperity. In just three years the flight of capital became double the total of foreign investment in our country. Thus, because of the financial system and free exchange, facilitated by our proximity to the wealthiest country in the world, our reserves were exhausted. It is easy to say that, but for 70 million Mexicans who had begun to look forward to better times it is a brutal reality. Our way of being, of acting and managing our affairs, has been distorted in the news media, which have made us appear to the eyes of the world a country incapable of shaping its destiny and incompetent in administering its resources, so that the alternative would have to be our subordination to the ruthless ambition of outside Powers. Developing countries like Mexico have suffered countless such experiences. Many of our problems are made worse by tendentious reports which bring on the results they announce.\nAfter major attempts to correct this economic situation, my Government decided to attack the root of the evil and extirpate it once and for all. There was obviously an inconsistency between internal development policies and an erratic and restrictive international financial structure. A reasonable growth policy could not be reconciled with freedom to speculate in foreign exchange. We therefore established exchange control. Given our 3,000-kilometre border with the United States, exchange control can only function through a banking system that operates on the basis of the policies of its country and Government and not its own speculative interests and the fluctuations of international financial chaos. For that reason we have nationalized the banks. We have been a living example of what happens when that enormous, volatile and speculative mass of capital ranges over the world in search of high interest rates, tax havens and supposed political and exchange stability. It decapitalizes entire countries and leaves destruction in its wake. The world should be able to control this; it is inconceivable that we cannot find a formula that, without limiting necessary movements and flows, would permit regulation of a phenomenon that damages everyone. It is imperative that the new international economic order establish a link between refinancing the development of countries that suffer from the flight of capital and the capital that has left those countries. At least they should have the crumbs from their own loaves.\nIn the face of these dramatic realities, we are lectured about economic liberalism at all costs, which is not applied even in the countries that most passionately defend it. On the contrary, the danger of losing their national integrity has led many Governments among them, our own to intensify their economic reforms and to strengthen the role of the State in directing their national economies; these are cases of legitimate self-defence.\nMexico is open to negotiation in every sphere and every forum. We have the resources, tradition and historical background to reinforce the principles laid down by our social and popular revolution. We are sure that, as a country bordering both the North and the South, our fate is of concern not only to Mexicans but to all developing countries. To all of them I say that we must hold our heads high and stand together, today and always, in dignity and with our shared endeavours and our shared hopes.\nNever has the principle of sovereignty over natural resources and economic processes been more valid than now. The terms of the debased relations that we suffer could lead to the dissolution of sovereignty itself. The interference of transnational corporations, the growing concentration of financial facilities, the subordination of the banking systems to the great metropolitan cities, the massive outflow of capital and the imitation of models alien to our development endanger the very existence of States.\nAlthough its formal links have been broken, dependency persists, and the pattern of domination on which the colonial regime was founded has even been reinforced. The concentration of wealth and power increases, while vast regions of the world become ever more impoverished. In the present situation the machinery of international co-operation that we have devised has been useful in soothing some troubled consciences, but it has proved altogether incapable of solving the serious everyday structural problems.\nThe charges levelled by the countries of the South in this respect were accurate and far-sighted. In proposing a new order, we sought a profound institutional reform capable of rechanneling international economic relations. We should have liked to avoid the tremendous deterioration of recent years and to have eased the crisis. But it is never too late.\nThroughout history, major transformations usually occurred when there was no other course to take, which accounts for the distance that separates prophets from revolutionaries. Major ills call for major remedies.\nInternational economic relations should be reviewed judiciously and with a sense of commitment. Let us not look for culprits but, rather, find people who will take responsibility for the future. The tracing of the ultimate cause of our ills is a task for historians and research workers, not for political leaders.\nThe assumption of that immense task of political and economic integration requires a change in attitude. Until now ideological Manichaeism, which nurtures the hegemony of the great Powers, has prevailed.\nThere has been a tendency to impose the same system of the past, and in a tense dialectical relationship as yet unresolved, the doctrines and strategies of change have been in confrontation with vested interests, love of compromise for its own sake, and the conservative instincts of empires that never end. Therefore, the global economic negotiations must provide the opportunity to reconcile these opposing views in approaches compatible with the needs of the present. The necessity to convene these negotiations is urgent; they cannot be postponed.\nNor can the alleged dispute between the specialized agencies of the system and the sovereignty of the Assembly be put forward as an excuse for delaying the dialogue. All the United Nations bodies have been created by our sovereign decision; all of them function within a given legal framework, and are to be respected.\nThe justification for these international bodies is not to be found in the perpetuation of undesirable inequalities, but in the search for rational solutions to the crucial issues of our time \u0097 disarmament, collective security and development.\nThe United Nations was created in a different era and the Organization and its Members now find themselves at the crossroads. We have the forum we deserve and there is no other. If we do not know how to use it to overcome the crisis and establish a more equitable order, and above all one compatible with our times, there will be no further opportunity. Global negotiations should begin immediately, and they should be conducted thoroughly, with a serious intention of reaching agreement. World peace and security are threatened to an even greater extent today. We must safeguard them at all costs. Any solution or concession is preferable to the alternative. We cannot afford to fail. Something tremendous is at stake here, not only the heritage of civilization, but the very survival of our children, of future generations, of mankind itself.\nLet us make what is reasonable possible. Let us recall the tragic conditions in which the Organization was created and the hopes that we placed in it. The place is here and the time is now.\nLet us hope that the logical confrontations of pluralism, the understandable outbursts of dissidence, compounded by the frustration of impotence, and the unavoidable delays in negotiations do not nullify the highest good represented by the United Nations.\n\nLet us not resign ourselves to the United Nations becoming bogged down in formal procedures, while outside pressures are brought to bear to satisfy selfish interests unable to withstand the test of inclusion in an international legal order.\nWe are all part of this union. It is as strong as we wish to make it, particularly those who have the real power and therefore the ultimate responsibility. We have never created anything better or more efficient. Again and again I shall repeat what I have said here. This is the time to decide whether mankind belongs to the powerful or the powerful to mankind. That has never been truer than now. We shall know the answer here, and in the centuries to come people will bear witness to it.\n"

        "file_text": "81.\tIt is with great pleasure and \nsatisfaction that I extend to the President of \nthe General Assembly the congratulations of \nAustria on his election. We welcome him as the \nrepresentative of a country with which we enjoy \nclose neighborly human, cultural and historical \nties. Our two countries have demonstrated to the \nworld in a clear and tangible manner that \nfriendship and mutual tolerance can transcend \nideological and political boundaries.\n82.\tHis rich political and diplomatic \nexperience, long involvement with the work of the \nUnited Nations and well-known commitment to \ndialogue and compromise assure us that the \nGeneral Assembly will be guided in an objective \nand constructive manner.\n83.\tWe should also like to thank his \npredecessor, Mr. Kittani, who presided over the \nGeneral Assembly with particular tact and skill \nunder most trying circumstances.\n84.\tI further wish to seize this opportunity \nto express my gratitude to the Secretary-General \nfor his untiring work in his high office during a \nyear fraught with tension, crises and conflicts. \nWe are very grateful for his official visit to \nour country and for his support of Vienna's \nstatus as one of the three main United Nations \ncenters. We sincerely admire the courage and \nfrankness with which he has analyzed, in his \nfirst report on the work of the Organization, the \nstate of the world and of the United Nations. We \nagree completely with his conclusion that we are \nperilously near to a new international anarchy .\n85.\tThe thirty-seventh session of the General \nAssembly has been convened against the \nbackground of severe crises in international \nrelations. Rarely before has world peace been \nthreatened from so many sides. The conflicts in \nthe Middle East, the continuing armed \ninterventions in Afghanistan and Kampuchea, the \ncrises in Central America and in various parts of \nAfrica, the Falklands and the situation in Poland \nare only a few examples. The confrontation \nbetween East and West continues, the disarmament \nprocess and the North-South dialogue are \nstagnating, human rights violations and acts of \nterror proliferate and every new day brings more \nbloodshed and human suffering.\n86.\tHow can we break this vicious circle of \nviolence and destruction? Are we really condemned \nto impotence, passivity and frustration?\n87.\tThe difficulty with the present situation \nlies in the fact that we are faced with three \nclosely related global phenomena: a world \npolitical crisis, a world economic crisis and a \ncrisis of international organizations.\n88.\tToday more and more voices speak of the'' \nirrelevance of the United Nations. They denounce \nthe Organization's inability to live up to its \nmandate. The public continues to judge the United \nNations by its capacity to produce solutions to \nmajor conflicts. Too often they overlook the \nfruitful work done by the United Nations and the \nspecialized agencies in all fields of \ninternational co-operation. All important world \npolitical issues can be discussed at the United \nNations. The United Nations provides the \nframework for dealing with all major problems of \nmankind. Furthermore, for smaller States not \nprotected by alliances and dependent upon their \nown resources for their security, the United \nNations, despite all imperfections, remains the \nonly global forum where they can seek and hope to \nfind the support of the international community \nfor their legitimate concerns.\n89.\tThe United Nations is no more than the \ncollective will of its Members. It is far from \nbeing a world Government. Therefore we must not \nbe more critical of international organizations \nthan we are of States. The responsibility for a \nsolution to the three-fold global crisis lays not \nso much with international organizations as with \neach individual State. Finally, political \nmorality must also play a role in world politics. \nOne of the most important missions of the United \nNations is to uphold ideas and principles, even \nwhen so-called realities stand in their way. We \ntherefore firmly support all efforts to \nstrengthen the authority of the United Nations \nand that of the Secretary-General, the Security \nCouncil and the General Assembly.\n90.\tThe Secretary-General can count on the \nfull support of Austria in the implementation of \nhis proposals, in particular those concerning the \npreventive intervention of the Security Council \nin the early stages of international crises and a \nmore forthright role for the Secretary-General. \nWe also support his suggestions regarding the \nstrengthening of peace-keeping operations. As a \ncountry with traditional ties to the United \nNations peace-keeping system\u00f3more than 15,000 \nAustrian soldiers have so far served with the \nUnited Nations peace-keeping forces\u00f3we have a \nvital interest in this area.\n91.\tWe feel that all the considerations \nsubmitted to us by the Secretary-General are of \ngreat importance and crucial to the future of the \nOrganization. They should receive high priority \nand be pursued further, perhaps by a working \ngroup. Austria would be very happy to participate \nin any such endeavor.\n92.\tThe maintenance of peace is one of the \nmajor aims of our foreign policy. As President \nKirchschlager has repeatedly emphasized, peace \nbegins at home. Democracy and tolerance, human \nrights and social justice, conciliation and \nrenunciation of the use of force are the \nprinciples that must be implemented to guarantee \ndomestic peace. The Austrian Federal Government's \npolitical program is based on these principles.\n93.\tPeace at home is the prerequisite for \npeace among neighbors. At a time when \ninternational tension is increasing, Austria \nattributes particular importance to a \ngood-neighbor policy to improve and deepen \nrelations with its neighbors irrespective of \ntheir social' and political systems. We hope \ntherefore to contribute also to security and \nstability in Europe and in the world. Our \ngood-neighborly relations with Switzerland, \nLiechtenstein, Italy and the Federal Republic of \nGermany, which are all committed to a pluralistic \nand democratic system, as well as with Yugoslavia \nand Hungary, have developed along very positive \nlines. As a result of pragmatic efforts on both \nsides, there is now also reason to hope for \ncontinuous improvement in our relations with \nCzechoslovakia, which in 1981 were overshadowed \nby a number of problems.\n94.\tWith regard to Italy, our policy of \nestablishing good-neighborly relations with all \ncountries has been actively supported by the \nUnited Nation. General Assembly resolutions 1497 \n(XV) of 31 October 1960 and 1661 (XVI) of 28 \nNovember 1961 on the question of South Tyrol \nbrought about negotiations which in 1969 led to a \nnew framework of autonomy for South Tyrol.\n95.\tSince that time South Tyrol has \nundoubtedly obtained a significant amount of \nautonomy. Nevertheless certain problems remain \nunresolved. Some of these are of particular \nsignificance for the preservation of the South \nTyrolean ethnic group; in particular, the \nlanguage question and the autonomous section in \nBozen of the Administrative Court. Last year \nPrime Minister Spadolini gave assurances that \nhave not yet been carried out. The Austrian \nFederal Government wishes to express its firm \nexpectation that the measures already agreed upon \nin 1969 and not yet implemented will be carried \nout as early as possible and in close \nconsultation with the South Tyroleans. We do so \nin view of the quality of Austro-Italian \nrelations, the positive outcome of my talks with \nForeign Minister Colombo on 27 July of this year \nin Venice and the latest statement of the Italian \nGovernment, which has declared its determination \nto seek solutions acceptable to the ethnic \nminorities and to bring the entire matter to an \nearly conclusion. We hope that this will not \nremain a dead letter and that a settlement will \nbe achieved in the very near future. We cannot \nignore the fact that such a settlement has also \nbecome urgent considering the increasing anxiety \namong the South Tyrolean population.\n96.\tGood-neighborly relations are essential, \nbut they are not enough. We must see the world as \na whole. Austria is therefore making every effort \nto restore the policy which has been described by \nthe term detente and was so beneficial to \nAustria, Europe and the world. Of course, when we \nspeak of detente we do not mean a policy of \nappeasement but rather continuous efforts to \nachieve a modus vivendi for coexistence and \nco-operation.\n97.\tIn this connection the success of the \nMadrid follow-up conference to the Conference on \nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe would be of \ngreat importance. Austria, together with other \nneutral and non- aligned countries of Europe, has \nsubmitted a substantial and balanced draft final \ndocument which provides inter alia for the \nconvening of a conference on confidence-building \nand security-building measures in Europe. We \nbelieve that a positive result in Madrid on the \nbasis of these proposals would be in the interest \nnot only of detente in general but also of \nPoland, whose people have suffered such \ndeplorable set-backs in their development as a \nresult of the imposition of martial law. Austria \nunderstands the difficulty of Poland's problems \ntoday. Together we must find a way to revive \nPoland's economy. Federal Chancellor Kreisky has \nexpressed ideas for comprehensive action by East \nand West to help Poland overcome its enormous \neconomic difficulties.\n98.\tEfforts to achieve detente cannot and \nmust not be limited to one continent, detente \nmust be universal. In the age of interdependence \nand given the global dimensions of international \npolitics, Austria cannot and does not want to \ncontent itself with the role of a mere observer \nof world events. Every country's security depends \non the security of others. Security cannot be \nachieved against one another but only with one \nanother.\n99.\tAustria's position on the Middle East \nquestion is well known and has been repeatedly \npresented in detail before the Assembly. We \ncontinue to believe that the core of the problem \nis a just settlement of the Palestinian question \nWe see some encouraging signs: the joint \ndeclaration of the Arab States in Fez based on \nthe concept of mutual recognition; the statement \nof President Reagan of the United States; and the \ngrowing perception that the Palestinian question \ndemands a just settlement which respects the \nrights and interests of both sides. Austria \nwelcomes the United States President's initiative \nas an historic move. It also recognizes the \nimportance of the results of the Fez Summit \nConference and Mr. Brezhnev's statement of 15 \nSeptember 1982. We hope that a negotiating \nprocess will now be initiated and will finally \nlead to a balanced and lasting solution.\n100.\tAustria has followed the tragic events in \nLebanon with great concern. We deeply regret and \ncondemn the use of force, which has claimed \nthousands of human lives. We have strongly \ncondemned the continuing Israeli invasion of \nLebanon, which is causing inconceivable \nsuffering among the civilian population and \ngiving rise to new misery and new streams of \nrefugees. Another proof of the indiscriminate \nnature of the attacks of the Israeli army in \nLebanon is the shelling of the Austrian Embassy, \nwhich is located outside military target zones.\n100. Austria learned with horror and \nconsternation of the recent massacres of \nPalestinian men, women and children in the area \nof Beirut. We are deeply shocked by these \natrocities. At the seventh emergency special \nsession on Palestine. Austria had an opportunity \nto condemn this crime. Nevertheless, I would like \nto stress once again the necessity and the \nresponsibility of the United Nations to ensure a \nMl investigation and clarification of these \ncriminal acts. In a letter addressed to the \nPresident of the Security Council on 21 \nSeptember, proposed on behalf of the Austrian \nGovernment the establishment of an impartial and \nobjective investigation commission. We expect \nthat this proposal, which in the meantime has \nfound general support in the General Assembly in \nthe adoption of resolution ES-7/9, will be \nimplemented as early as possible.\n101.\tAustria feels strong solidarity with \nLebanon and its severely tried people. The \nwithdrawal of all foreign troops and the \nrestoration of the full sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of the country is an \nabsolute necessity. We hope that national \nreconciliation will be achieved in Lebanon, \nwhich will make possible the reconstruction of \nthat war-torn country. We will contribute as much \nas we can to the attainment of this goal.\n102.\tAustria continues to be concerned about \nthe fate of the Cambodian people, which has \nsuffered both tremendous human rights violations \nand foreign intervention. As President of the \nInternational Conference on Kampuchea, I feel a \nspecial responsibility in this regard. I had the \nopportunity to talk with the parties involved in \nthe conflict and to obtain a first-hand picture \nof the present situation in Cambodia. I see the \ninitiation of a dialogue between Viet Nam and the \nmembers of the Association of South-East Asian \nNations as a positive development. I have always \nbeen convinced that the Cambodian problem can be \nsolved only by a dialogue involving all parties. \nDialogue is important, but tangible results must \nfollow. The International Conference on Kampuchea \nhas created the framework for a comprehensive \npolitical settlement. The Declaration and \nresolution of the Conference should be viewed as \na package incorporating two key elements: the \ncomplete withdrawal of foreign troops from \nCambodia and a guaranteed the Cambodian people's \nright to self-determination. This implies the \npossibility freely to elect a Government. \nTherefore, no faction should receive any \nadvantage in those elections or be placed at any \ndisadvantage, and all outside influences must \ndefinitely be excluded. Internationally \ncontrolled elections alone must determine the \ncomposition of the future Government. This should \nbe the basis for the reconstruction of a free \nand independent Cambodia, free from outside \nintervention from any side and assured of its \nplace in a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality \nin South-East Asia. I appeal to all parties \ninvolved to make every effort to support the \ngoals of the International Conference on \nKampuchea in order to build a better future for \nthis long-suffering country.\n103.\tApart from all the political problems of \nCambodia, there is another issue of particular \nconcern: the gradual decay of the latest temple \ncity in the world, Angkor Wat. The present \npolitical situation must not prevent urgently \nneeded international rescue measures. The \nsplendid structures of Angkor Wat are part of the \ncommon heritage of mankind. New ways must be \nfound to rescue them. Granting UNESCO the right \nto intervene to save endangered cultural \nmonuments would be an appropriate approach. \nUNESCO's role in protecting the cultural heritage \nof mankind could be similar to that of the Red \nCress in the area of humanitarian protection.\n104.\tAustria remains convinced that the world \neconomic crisis, which particularly affects the \ndeveloping countries, can be overcome only by a \nmajor cooperative effort by industrial and \nraw-material- producing States to alleviate \npoverty in the third world. I am referring here \nto the proposal wade by Federal Chancellor \nKreisky at the International Meeting on \nCo-operation aid Development, held in October \n198i in Cancun. As one of the initiators of that \nmeeting, we hope that agreement can soon be \nreached to revive the North-South dialogue.\n105.\tOur commitment to human rights needs no \nreiteration. The figures creak for themselves. In \n1981 alone 35,000 refugees came to Austria. This \nyear, 1982, our expenditures on assistance to \nrefugees are expected to amount to about $100 \nmillion. On behalf of the Austrian Federal \nGovernment, I should like to thank sincerely \nthose countries which have helped by offering a \nnew home to many of these refugees. Austria will \ncontinue to care for people seeking assistance in \ndesperation. Despite economic difficulties, we \nconsider it a moral obligation, an essential \nelement of our humanitarian policy, to continue \nto offer a haven of freedom and a source of hope.\n106. Disarmament is a topic of the greatest \ninterest to the Austrian public and to me \npersonally. Austria, which is constitutionally \ncommitted to permanent neutrality, cannot remain \nindifferent in the face of the accelerating arms \nrace between East and West and in the third \nworld. In 1981 alone military expenditures \ntotaled $600 billion to $650 billion. And there \nis a trend towards these expenditures continuing \nto increase in the future. We are deeply \nconvinced that this tendency has to be reversed \nand that the vicious circle of mistrust and arms \nbuild-up must be broken our goal must be common \nsecurity, as stated in the Palme report:^ \nInternational security must rest on a commitment \nto joint survival rather than on a threat of \nmutual destruction.\n107. If we agree that military strength is no way \nto guarantee genuine and lasting security, the \nalternative can only be closer international \nco-operation. Cooperation creates confidence and \nmutual dependence, and both, in turn, strengthen \nsecurity. Developments in Western Europe since \nthe Second World War are proof of that fact. \nTraditional enemies have been brought together \ninto a comprehensive system of cooperation which \ntranscends the economic sphere and creates \nmanifold ties between peoples. As a consequence \nof Western European co-operation, shaped around \ninstitutions such as the European Community and \nthe Council of Europe, war among these nations \nhas become inconceivable today.\n108.\tThe Final Act of Helsinki constitutes a \nnew basis for co-operation and peaceful \ncoexistence. The historical experience of one \ncontinent is not necessarily transferable to \nothers, but I am convinced that the methods and \ninstruments of co-operation developed in Europe \ncould serve as models for other regions also.\n109.\tAnother threatening feature of the \npresent arms race is the fact that it is no \nlonger confined to earth alone; it is \nincreasingly being carried into outer space. \nDuring the last decade more than 1,700 military \nsatellites have been put into orbit. At least \nthree quarters of all the satellites in space are \nbeing used for military purposes. In view of the \ngrowing concern of the international community, \nthe Second United Nations Conference on the \nExploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space \nUNISPACE 82, which took place under my \nchairmanship in Vienna in August, recommended \nthat the General Assembly and the Committee on \nDisarmament give high priority to measures for \nthe prevention of an arms race in space.\n110. I appeal to all States to conclude \nagreements aimed at banning all weapons from \nouter space. I have already presented Austria's \nposition on all major aspects of this vital issue \nat the twelfth special session, the second \nspecial session on disarmament. Today I wish to \nemphasize just one point which, in our view, can \nbe of great significance for the reduction of \nmistrust, namely, the development of \ninternationally recognized mechanisms for the \nobjective establishment and evaluation of the \nstate of armaments at the regional, interregional \nand global levels. Austria has submitted a \nmemorandum on this matter to all Member States. I \nshould like to ask delegations to work with us on \nthe further development and elaboration of this \nproposal.\n111.\tLet us be frank: the second special \nsession on disarmament was a failure. We note \nthis with great disappointment. However, the \ndangerous world situation, the commitment to the \nsurvival of all and the increased awareness of \nworld public opinion force us to continue our \nefforts to achieve disarmament as a matter of \nabsolute priority. The goal of these efforts must \nremain a genuine balance at the lowest level, \ntaking into account all weapon systems and \nregions. In this connection we welcome the \nresumption of the Soviet-American negotiations in \nGeneva on intermediate-range nuclear forces and \nstrategic arms reductions.\n112.\tWorld crisis, the absence of peace and \njustice and the progressive militarization of \ninternational relations are the breeding ground \nfor new violence and terrorism. Terrorism, which \nwe condemn most firmly and for which there is no \njustification, must be repressed but it must also \nbe prevented. We must strike at the roots of \nterrorism wherever human rights are constantly \nviolated, wherever social injustice is \nperpetuated and wherever political convictions \ncannot be expressed in a democratic manner, the \nseeds of violence will grow. Violence breeds \nviolence and injustice breeds injustice.\n113.\tWhat can we do to prevent it? Every \ncitizen and every Government in the world bears \ndirect responsibility for peace at home and \nabroad. Our good example is the prerequisite for \npeaceful coexistence between individuals and \npeoples and for fruitful cooperation. It is only \nthrough co-operation that we shall be able to \nmeet the great challenges of our time: peace, \ndisarmament, respect for human rights, \ndevelopment, social justice and the elimination \nof violence and terrorism. We welcome all \nactivities, and particularly those of the peace \nmovements which aim to translate into reality the \nprinciples and goals of the Charter.\n114.\tPope John Paul II in his address at the \n17th meeting of the thirty-fourth session of the \nGeneral Assembly said:  I would like to express \nthe wish that, in view of its universal \ncharacter, the United Nations will never cease to \nbe the forum, the high tribune, from which all \nman's problems are appraised in trust and \njustice.  In the spirit of that statement, I \nshould like to express my earnest hope that the \nUnited Nations, to which there is no alternative, \nwill play an ever more important role in \nachieving a just and lasting system of world \npeace.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, at the outset I wish to extend to you my \nsincere felicitations on your unanimous ejection \nas President of the General Assembly. Your \nejection bears testimony to the recog\u00acnition and \nrespect that you enjoy as a diplomat of \noutstanding ability. Under your presidency, I am \ncon\u00acfident that the Assembly will be able to \ncomplete its work successfully and with \ndistinction. Your election is also an added honor \nto your country, with which Malaysia enjoys \nfriendly relations. In welcoming your election, I \nwish also to pay a sincere tribute to Mr. \nKittani, the outgoing President, on the \noutstanding manner in which he conducted the \nthirty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\n3.\tSince the General Assembly last met, the \ninterna\u00actional situation has not improved. On the \ncontrary, it has deteriorated even further. The \nworld continues to remain in the grip of crises \nof various kinds stemming from unresolved \npolitical and military con\u00acflicts, economic \nstagnation and recession, widespread poverty and \nprivation, and various inequities, all of which \nseem to defy solution. Through all this there is \ncontinued escalation of armaments, consuming \nenormous funds and resources and threatening \nmankind with destruction and possibly extinction. \nThe General Assembly, meeting against this \nbackdrop, must get the full backing of the \nMembers so as to reassert the authority of the \nUnited Nations and play a truly effective role.\n4.\tAs we look around us, we have to admit \nthat this time international law and order has \ntruly broken down. Might is now the only thing \nthat is right. Weak coun\u00actries like Afghanistan, \nKampuchea and Lebanon are trodden upon by this \nboots of invading armies as the rest of the world \nstands by. The economies of the poor nations are \nwrecked by recession resulting from man-made \npolicies in the powerful commercial and financial \ncenters of the world. The pleas of the poor are \nbut secondary subjects for discussion by the rich \nas they meet to plan their own world in places \nlike Cancun and Versailles. And in Lebanon, \nthousands of Palestinians are murdered in the \nname of security for the Israelis and their \ncohorts.\n5.\tThere was a time when the United Nations \nsent a multinational force to stop an invasion \nand it did in fact succeed. But now it is \nhelpless. Resolution after resolution is adopted \nby the various United Nations committees, but the \ninvasions, the atrocities and the economic \nbullying go on. The credibility of the United \nNations is indeed at its lowest ebb, and we who \nare weak and small live in real fear\u2014fear for our \nindependence, our well-being and even our lives.\n6.\tThe need to restore faith in the United \nNations is very pressing. The United Nations must \nregain its credibility. I should like to say that \ncountries like Malaysia must help to restore the \ntrust and confidence of the international \ncommunity in the Organization's ability to play a \nconstructive role in resolving problems and \ncrises and in maintaining world peace and \nstability, but that would be pure rhetoric. What \nis needed is the full backing of the powerful \nnations. They must revitalize the Organization \nwhich they created. They must breathe life into \nit by abiding by its decisions and lending it \ntheir weight.\n7.\tIn South-East Asia, the Kampuchean \nproblem continues to pose a threat to peace and \nsecurity. Three times the General Assembly has \ncalled for the total withdrawal of foreign forces \nand the exercise of self- determination by the \nKampuchean people. The International Conference \non Kampuchea laid down the principles for a \npolitical settlement of the problem. But again \nthose who are in a position to help achieve this \npolitical settlement have shown little concern \nfor the accepted norms of international practice.\n8.\tThe foreign military invasion and \ncontinued occupation of Kampuchea is a crime \nagainst the Kampuchean people and a threat to \nregional peace and security. It has brought in \nits wake big-Power rivalry into a region where \nfive peace-loving nations have agreed to a \nconcept of a zone of peace, freedom and \nneutrality. Members of the Association of South \nEast Asian Nations find in the Kampuchean problem \nan insurmountable obstacle to their cherished \ndream of a conflict-free neutral area.\n9.\tThe world must give serious attention to \nthe situa\u00action in Kampuchea before big-Power \nrivalry escalates into open confrontation, for \nwhen this happens, the United Nations will once \nagain be powerless to do anything. The Members of \nthe United Nations must act while there is still \ntime for them to do so. They must give their \nstamp of approval to the valiant coalition that \nhas been formed.\n10.\tIn consonance with the efforts for a \npeaceful settlement, Malaysia and ASEAN are \nextremely gratified with the agreement reached \namong the three resistance groups of Kampuchea to \njoin hands in the coalition in which His Highness \nPrince Sihanouk has assumed the presidency of the \nGovernment of Demo\u00accratic Kampuchea. The \ndetermination, wisdom and, above all abiding \nsense of patriotism of the three leaders, in \nstanding together to restore freedom and honor to \ntheir country, deserve our profound admiration. \nMalaysia welcomes this development, as it is a \npositive and important step towards the \nattain\u00acment of a political solution. Malaysia \nfeels honored for having been able on 22 June \n1982 to act as host during the historic signing \nof the declaration estab-lishing the coalition by \nHis Highness Prince Sihanouk, Mr. Son Sann and \nMr. Khieu Samphan. I am indeed happy about the \npresence and participation at this session of His \nHigh\u00acness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, President of \nDemo\u00accratic Kampuchea and the beloved leader of \nthe Kampuchean people. I hope that the Assembly \nwill respond appropriately and positively to his \nnoble cause. We await with keen anticipation his \ntriumphant return to Kampuchea to restore the \nfreedom and inde\u00acpendence of that country and the \nhonor and dignity of the Kampuchean people.\n11. In West Asia, the situation has also taken a \nturn for the worse since the thirty-sixth session \nof the General Assembly. Since the Palestinians \nwere evicted from their homeland, they have been \nforced to move from one refuge to another \ncountless times. Their rights us a people are \nstill being denied. They are not even treated as \nhumans, as the brutal massacres in Lebanon amply \ndemonstrate.\n12. We remember vividly the horrors of Belsen, \nDachau and other Nazi concentration camps of the \nSecond World War. We know of the sufferings of \nthe Jewish people then and the pogroms of \ncenturies past. We were appalled at those \natrocities. Nevertheless, nobody\u2014not even a \npeople that has suffered as much as the Jews \nhave\u2014has the right to inflict upon others the \nhorrors of Sabra and Shatila. The Palestinians \nand the Lebanese were not responsible for Belsen \nor Dachau. Has the international community lost \nits conscience that it could stand aloof while \nsuch horrors were perpetrated against the \nhelpless and the innocent? In order to assuage \nthe conscience of the anti-Semites, the land of \nthe Palestinians has already been taken away from \nthem to create a Jewish home-land. Must the \nPalestinians now be butchered and driven from \nrefuge to refuge? Must they also be exterminated? \nWe understand the conscience which bothers the \npeople that were once cruel to the Jews. We \nunderstand their need to make amends for their \npast misdeeds. But are we going to condone \nmassacres because we or, rather, the powerful \nnations of the world are unwilling to hurt the \nfeelings of the Jews? Some may think that the \nmassacres in the Sabra and Shatila camps will \nsatiate the Israelis and that they will go back \nto their Israel. This can only be a wrong \nassumption. Recent history has shown, and the \nIsraeli Prime Minister has admitted, that Israel \nnever really fought in self-defense. It attacks \nat the slightest provocation\u2014even imagined \nprovocation. The neighbors of Israel are going to \nbe under constant threat and again and again they \nwill be invaded, and atroc\u00acities committed \nagainst them. In the interest of Israeli \nsecurity, there will be no security for its \nneighbors. Can we accept that only the security \nof Israel is important and that its Arab \nneighbors have no right to security?\n13.\tIsrael is a bully. If it were any bigger \nor stronger, the world would not be safe. I \nshould therefore like to call upon the United \nStates, as the main supplier of weapons to \nIsrael, to reconsider its position. Those weapons \nare for nothing less than murder. Apart from its \nsystematic and premeditated use of lethal and \nsadistic weapons on occupied Palestine and Arab \nterritories, Israel continues to propagate the \nmyth of the non-existence of the Palestinian \npeople, thereby frustrating all peaceful efforts \nto find adjust and enduring settlement of the \nWest Asian conflict. Indeed, the lesson we have \nlearned from the Israeli invasion of neighbouring \nLebanon and the destruction of Beirut is that, if \nIsrael is not stopped, the West Asia problem will \nnot only continue but also escalate until we are \nall swallowed up in the conflagration. At this \npoint, I wish to pay homage to the valiant \nPalestinian freedom fighters for their \noutstanding qualities of fortitude, patriotism \nand courage in the face of overwhelming odds in \ntheir just struggle for their inalienable rights. \nI also take this opportunity to salute Chairman \nYasser Arafat for his statesmanship, foresight \nand courage in leaving Beirut in order to spare \nthe civilian population of that city continued \nIsraeli savagery. Unfortunately, the sacrifice \nmade by the Palestine Liberation Organization \n[PLO] has been in vain.\n14.\tMalaysia would also like to welcome the \ninitiative taken recently at Fez by the Arab \nleaders at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference, \nwhich reflects the reasonableness of their stand \nas much as their courage, statesmanship and, \nabove all, their reaffirmation of their \ncommitments to the Charter of the United Nations \nand to regional and international peace and \nsecurity. This initiative presents to the \ninterna\u00actional community a formula which will \nenable the Palestinians to return to their homes \nand freely exercise their God-given inalienable \nrights in their own home\u00acland, Palestine. The \nIsraelis have of course rejected the proposal \noutright. The world and the supporters of Israel \nmust prevail upon that habitually intransigent \ncountry to return to sanity and the ways of \ncivilization.\n15.\tIn Afghanistan, too, we continue to \nwitness another example of the blatant use of \nforce. There, too, we continue to find the misery \nand the travails of a people locked in an unequal \nstruggle to preserve their faith, national \nidentity and character, their sovereignty, \ndignity and freedom.\n16.\tIndeed, the situation within Afghanistan, \nand that of the 3.5 million refugees forced into \nexile in neigh\u00acbouring countries have given cause \nfor unprecedented anxiety, particularly for weak \nand small nations of the world. To these nations, \nthe continuance of the Afghan nationalist \nstruggle is crucial. It is incumbent on the \ninternational community to see that this struggle \nsucceeds.\n17.\tWe in Malaysia are fully committed to the \nrestora\u00action of the lawful rights of the Afghan \npeople, including their right to determine for \nthemselves their future, free from coercion, and \nto the return of the Afghan refugees to their \nhomes in safety and with honor.\n18.\tWe support the efforts of the \nSecretary-General in initiating indirect talks \nwith the parties concerned to find a political \nsolution consistent with the United Nations and \nresolutions of the Organization of the Islamic \nConference on the Afghan problem.\n19.\tIt is disconcerting that the war between \nIraq and Iran continues to rage. The conflict has \ngone on, far too long. It has taken a heavy toll \nin lives lost, in property destroyed, in wounds \ninflicted and in human misery. We must all \ntherefore apply ourselves earnestly to the task \nof reconciling the two countries in the interests \nof the peoples of those countries themselves and \nthose of the world at large. The fact is that \nthere can be neither victor nor vanquished in \nthis conflict.\n20.\tMalaysia enjoys close and cordial \nrelations with both Iran and Iraq and we \ntherefore implore them to cease fighting and to \naccept mediation and reconcilia\u00action so that an \nhonorable and enduring solution can be found.\n21.\tMy Government abhors South Africa's \ninhuman policy of apartheid. It is a travesty of \njustice and an affront to human dignity coupled \nwith the Pretoria regime's deliberate and \nprovocative armed incursions into neighbouring \nStates, constitutes a major cause of tension and \ninstability, not only in Africa, but throughout \nthe world. Malaysia will con\u00actinue fully to \nsupport the cause of the oppressed people of \nSouth Africa in their struggle for equality, \njustice and dignity, and against those who \nchampion human rights, or claim to do so, would \ndo better to condemn the Pretoria regime, and \ntreat it like the freak it is.\n22.\tAnother area of great concern to us is \nthe problem of drug abuse. The world community \nhas for a long time treated the drug problem as a \nsocial problem akin to poverty, slavery, child \nabuse and other social ills. In fact, drug \naddiction is all those social ills rolled into \none. The youths afflicted with this problem are \nmental slaves with deviant tendencies who are \nper\u00acmanently impoverished. The problem must be \ntackled at its source, and this can be done only \nif the United Nations acts positively. Failure to \narrest this spreading scourge will destroy whole \ngenerations to come.\n23.\tThe age of empires and imperial Powers is \npractically over, but the world has not as yet \nbecome a better place for the previously \ncolonized. There are many reasons for this, and \namong them is the banding together of the rich \nnations in order to maintain eco\u00acnomic dominance, \nwhich some say is actually a form of imperialism.\n24.\tWe in Malaysia are very much affected by \nthis. As a nation, we have tried to live within \nthe rules, formal and informal, which govern \neconomic relations between nations. We have even \nrefrained from nationalizing industries set up \nduring colonial days, which were engaged in \nliterally extracting wealth from our country for \nforeigners who frequently do not even know where \nMalaysia is, much less care for the well- being \nof its people. But our patience and sense of fair \nplay are being taxed to the limit by the market \nmanipulations abroad which, in effect, reduce our \npeople to the status of underpaid laborers. As a \nproducer of primary commodities like tin, rubber \nand palm oil, we are as much entitled to a fair \nreturn on our outlay as any producer of \nmanufactured goods in the developed countries. \nProducing these primary products is no longer \nmerely a question of having enough land or \nminerals and cheap labour. These days, expensive \ncapital outlay is needed to explore, extract and \ndevelop them, and also to do the required \nresearch and development. The indications are \nthat these costs and the technology required will \nincrease steadily in the years to come. Thus, \nmoney is needed, not merely for profits, but for \nfuture development, for our own income and for \nthe needs of the world.\n25.\tWhile the manufactured goods that we buy \nare priced according to the costs of production \nand marketing\u2014plus, of course, a hefty profit\u2014the \nprices of primary products seem to bear no \nrelation to any of those costs. They are priced \naccording to the whims and fancies of a host of \npeople who have nothing to do with their \nproduction. The various exchanges located in the \ndeveloped countries literally manipulate prices \nin order to make a profit for the brokers, the \ndealers, the speculators and others. These people \nmake money when the prices go up. They also make \nmoney when the prices come down. Therefore, it \nsuits them to cause a \\\"yo-yo\\\" effect in commodity \nprices. In addition, these exchanges are \nexclusive clubs, where the producers are unable \nto secure membership. The brokers and others who \ntrade on the exchanges are the same people who \nmake the rules, apply the rules and arbitrate. Is \nit any wonder that whenever their profits are \nthreatened they change the rules so as not only \nto save themselves, but to make a handsome profit \nas well?\n26.\tThat is the situation in the tin and \nrubber markets today. It has played havoc with my \ncountry's eco\u00acnomy. We have tried to reduce price \nfluctuations by having producer-consumer \nagreements, but this is an arrangement that taxes \nthe producers when prices are down but which \nbenefits the consumers when price trends are \nupwards. It is a case of \\\"heads I win, tails you \nlose\\\".\n27.\tAs if all that were not enough, the \nUnited States maintains a stockpile, ostensibly \nfor strategic \u2014meaning security\u2014reasons. We fully \nsupport the needs of the United States for \nstrategic reserves, but the administration of \nthat reserve is clearly not influenced by \nproblems of strategy. The stockpile is merely a \nrich nation's monopolistic weapon, used to \ndepress prices of commodities for the benefit of \nthe consumers.\n28.\tSuch is the fate of the producers of \nprimary commodities that they now have to sell \nthree to five times as much of their produce as \nthey did 20 years ago in order to buy the same \namount of manufactured goods from the developed \ncountries. In other words, the gap between rich \nand poor has widened by 300 to 500 per cent in \nthe last 20 years or so.\n29.\tMalaysia is trying to break the vicious \ncircle of the old commodity market system. We are \ntrying to set up a more suitable system which \nwill maintain reasonable prices while ensuring \nadequate supplies of tin and rubber to the world. \nTo that end, we have tried to form a viable and \neffective producers' asso\u00acciation. There is no \nintention to create a monopolistic situation. We \nknow full well that unreasonableness on our part \nwould result in reduced consumption and a switch \nto substitutes. We hope that producer countries \neverywhere will appreciate the need for this \nstrategy and participate in it.\n30.\tCommodity prices today arc at their \nlowest. We can blame the recession for that. But \nwhat we regret is that this recession is \nman-made. There is no shortage of supply, nor is \nthere a shortage of demand. Energy is plentiful \nand the level of technology is unprece\u00acdented^ \nhigh. Yet suddenly, no one wants to buy what only \nyesterday he could not get enough of. And those \nwho want to buy are without the necessary foreign \nexchange. Indeed, many poor countries have \nvirtually to sell their souls in order merely to \nsurvive.\n31.\tAs I have said, this world-wide \ndepression is man-made. It is made in the \npowerful countries by short-sighted people. \nForemost among the decisions that led to the \ndiminution of world trade is the increase in \ninterest rates. The high cost of money has \nreduced investments, shrunk inventories and \nstifled new business initiatives. Thus a lot of \ncommodities are floating around unsold and \nunsought, further depressing prices.\n32.\tTrue, some people have waxed rich in this \ndepression, but the price is high in terms of \nunem\u00acployment, bankruptcies and misery for the \npoor. The world's economy cannot go on like this \nfor long. There will be violence, riots and \nrevolutions; Governments will fall, and anarchy \nwill prevail. The longer the depression lasts, \nthe longer it will take to recover.\n33.\tAs this depression is man-made, man must \nunmake it too. The first need is the lowering of \ninterest rates, even if it causes slightly higher \ninflation. Secondly, the protectionism of the \nrich nations must be reduced if not done away \nwith altogether. If this cannot be done, at least \nthe protectionist policy should be made more \ndiscriminating. The developing nations should not \nbe subjected to any protectionist measures. This \nshould at least soften the impact of the \nrecession on them. The rich countries, too, would \nbenefit as the improved income of the poor would \nenable them to buy more manufactured goods. The \nworld has suffered enough from this depression. \nWe need action now. We need the reversal of \npolicies that are so obviously wrong. We should \nlike to appeal to those people who wield so much \npower to heed the needs of the world. Reverse the \npolicies you have made, and the world will \nremember you as saviors.\n34.\tThe participating Members of the United \nNations must congratulate themselves on the \nsuccessful conclusion of the Third United Nations \nConference on the Law of the Sea. The days when \nthe rich nations of the world could take for \nthemselves what\u00acever territory and resources they \nhad access to be over. Henceforth all the \nunclaimed wealth of this earth must be regarded \nas the common heritage of all the nations of this \nplanet. The seas and the sea-bed are undoubtedly \ngoing to be the source of wealth for the future. \nThere is no reason why the minerals and other \nresources now found on the exposed surfaces of \nthe planet will not be found in the sea-bed! The \nproblem is, of course, one of exploration and \nextrac\u00action. The high cost and the sophisticated \ntechnology required will be well beyond the \ncapacity of the poor nations. Unless they can \nhave a share as of right whenever this wealth is \nextracted ^ the gap between them and the rich \nnations going to widen even more. When finally \nthey do have the capacity, much of the readily \naccessible wealth will have been exhausted. It is \nto be hoped that, given the agreement on the law \nof the sea, the poor nations will get their fair \nshare.\n35.\tBut there remain certain areas in the \nworld which are not covered by any international \nagreement. According to present norms, \nterritories colonized by the old colonial Powers \nmust be decolonized\u2014that is, they must be \nreturned to the natives or the original \ninhabitants. United Nations concern on this issue \nis reflected in the permanent Special Committee \non the Situation with regard to the \nImplementation of the Declaration on the Granting \nof Independence to Colonial Countries and \nPeoples. However, there are still land areas \nwhich have neither natives nor settlers. There is \ntherefore no one to inherit the land and to set \nup viable governments should the claims of the \nmetropolitan Powers be given up. Because of this, \nlittle attention has been paid to these areas.\n36.\tIt is now time that the United Nations \nfocused its attention on these areas, the largest \nof which is the continent of Antarctica. A number \nof countries have in the past sent expeditions \nthere which have not limited themselves to mere \nscientific exploration but have gone on to claim \nhuge wedges of Antarctica for their countries. \nThose countries are not depriving any natives of \ntheir lands, and they are therefore not required \nto decolonize. But the fact remains that those \nuninhabited lands do not legally belong to the \ndis\u00accoverers, just as the colonial territories do \nnot belong to the colonial Powers. Like the seas \nand the sea-bed, those uninhabited lands belong \nto the international community. The countries now \nclaiming them must give them up so that either \nthe United Nations can administer those lands or \nthe present occupants can act as trustees for the \nnations of the world. At present the exploitation \nof the resources of Antarctica is too costly and \nthe technology is not yet available, but no doubt \nthe day will come when Antarctica can provide the \nworld with food and other resources for its \ndevelopment. It is only right that such \nexploita\u00action should benefit the poor nations as \nmuch as the rich.\n37.\tNow that we have reached agreement on the \nlaw of the sea the United Nations must convene a \nmeeting in order to define the problem of \nuninhabited lands, whether claimed or unclaimed, \nand to determine the rights of all nations to \nthose lands. We are aware of the Antarctic \nTreaty,' concluded by a few nations, which \nprovides for their co-operation for scientific \nresearch and prohibits non-peaceful activities. \nWhile there is some merit in this Treaty, it is \nnevertheless an agreement between a select group \nof countries and does not reflect 6he true \nfeelings of the Members of the United Nations or \ntheir just claims. A new international agreement \nis required so that historical episodes are not \nmade into facts to substantiate claims.\n38.\tAs I said at the beginning, the world is \ntoday beset by crises of various kinds. To \nbelieve otherwise would be to ignore the \nrealities before us. It is imper\u00acative that we \ntake cognizance of this fact and mobilize all our \nefforts to overcome these crises. We can do this \nif we choose to, or we can let the opportunity \nslip by. Never before has human ingenuity in \nscience and technology reached such a level of \ndevelopment as it has today. But we must use it \nwisely,not in pursuit of sophisticated weaponry \nfor purposes of war; we must instead harness it \nfor peaceful and beneficial uses for the common \ngood.\n39.\tIt is an imperiled world in which we are \nliving, and we must put it right at all costs. \nThis could come about if nations were willing \neffectively to implement past and future \nresolutions of the United Nations and related \nagencies, for this would not only help to restore \nthe international community's confidence in the \nUnited Nations but also contribute to the \nreso\u00aclution of the current conflicts and crises. \nI urge all Members of the Organization to give \ntheir fullest co\u00acoperation and all support \ntowards this end so that international peace, \nstability and security may be achieved.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a tradition at the United Nations for its \nMembers to gather at the General Assembly to \nreflect upon the manner in which they plan to \nshoulder the responsibilities incumbent upon them \nin guiding the fate of mankind. However, there is \nno doubt that such collective reflection can bear \nfruit only if it is pursued in the light of the \ngoals that have been set. This session, more than \nany other, is of great importance for the Central \nAfrican Republic in appreciating the efforts the \nOrganization has made out its mission.\nI am also very pleased, Mr. President, to convey \nto you and, through you, to the Assembly, the \nwishes for complete success from General Andre \nKolingba, President of the Military Committee of \nNational Reconstruction and head of State, who, \ntogether with the people of the Central African \nRepublic, has a profound trust and renewed faith \nin the Organization. It also gives me great \npleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on behalf of \nthe delegation it is my honor to head, on your \nimportant election to the presidency of the \nthirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\nYour great personal qualities will, I am certain, \nlead to the success of our work.\nI should like to address my sincere \ncongratulations to the outgoing President, Mr. \nKittani, for the dynamism, competence aid \nefficiency with which he guided the previous \nsession of the Assembly.\nIt gives me pleasure to renew my congratulations \nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, \nand to assure him that the Central African \nRepublic stands ready to support the efforts he \nis undertaking with fervor, conviction and \ncourage in the daily accomplishment of his tasks.\nLastly, my country wishes to express its \nappreciation to the former Secretary-General, Mr. \nKurt Waldheim, for his devotion to the cause of \nthe United Nations during his term of office.\nAlthough States with different social and \npolitical systems may experience certain problems \nin coexisting within the United Nations, it is \nnone the less true that such diversity clearly \ntestifies to the vitality of the Organization. \nAnd although some of those problems, by their \nvery nature, often constitute an outright \nchallenge, the imperatives of the well-being of \nmankind demand from us a concerted search for \nways and means of strengthening the \nOrganization's capacity to act. To that end, the \nUnited Nation: should not only be an instrument \nfor making the international political climate \nmore healthy, it should be, above all, an \ninstrument for economic and social development. \nThat twofold wish which, in the view of my \ndelegation, lies at the core of our concerns and \nforms the framework of United Nations doctrine, \nhas inspired the two themes of the message I have \nbeen entrusted to deliver to the Assembly for its \nconsideration.\nCreated at the outset as an instrument for \nimproving the international political climate, as \nit was of the common will of States that cherish \npeace and justice, the Organization has \nunfortunately been constant prey to the harsh \ndaily reality of intolerance and violence. In \nmany parts of the world, particularly in southern \nAfrica, the Middle East, South-East Asia and \nLatin America, the emergence of conflicts creates \nhotbeds of tension whose persistence is inimical \nto peaceful and fraternal coexistence.\nSome people even today, 22 years after the \nadoption of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) \ncontinue the struggle for their human dignity and \nfreedom. The distressing situation which prevails \nin southern Africa is a clear example of this.\nIn this connection, my (delegation believes that \nthe accession to sovereignty of territories still \nunder colonial and racist domination can only \npromote the universality of the Organization. \nTherefore, the improvement of the political \nclimate requires, first, the elimination of all \nforms of domination now existing in the world, \nwhich today are considered to be contrary to \ninternational morality. That is why the Central \nAfrican Republic believes that Namibia should as \nsoon as possible-and why should this not be in \n1983- accede to independence in accordance with \nthe spirit and letter of Security Council \nresolution 435 (1978).\nIn Lebanon and the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), \nin a period of less than four months this year, \nthe international community witnessed and \nremained powerless in the face of a tragedy most \nof whose victims were innocent people. In one \ncase there was aggression by force in an attempt \nto thwart the aspirations of a people, in \nflagrant violation of international rules; in the \nother case there was an express refusal to have \nrecourse to the principle of the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes.\nIn the case of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), \nmy country appeals to the good sense of the \ninterested parties to begin direct negotiations, \nif necessary with the participation and the good \noffices of the Secretary-General.\nRecent events in the Middle East can be described \nby only one word, horror. The massacres at Sabra \nand Shatila, despicable acts directed at women, \nchildren and the elderly, constitute nothing less \nthan the crime of genocide, which no country that \nsupports the ideals of the United Nations can \ntolerate. I wish to reiterate from this rostrum \nmy country's condemnation of that abject act \nwhich compounds other attempts by the State of \nIsrael to contain the just struggle of the \nPalestinian people, through the PLO, for \nself-determination. The life of wandering forced \non that people cannot continue. That is why my \ncountry continues to support Security Council \nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) as the \nbasis for an acceptable solution to the conflict \nin the Middle East.\nBecause the United Nations has been paralyzed and \nunable to act in that region at this critical \nstage, it has become more urgent than ever, as \nsuggested in the report of the Secretary-General \non the work of the Organization, to strengthen \nthe capacity of the Organization to accomplish \nits mission. The Central African Republic \nconsiders that it is necessary to restore to the \nSecurity Council its role as the guarantor of \ninternational peace and security and, \nfurthermore, to reconsider the mechanics that \ngovern its operation, because the important \nchanges that have occurred on the international \nscene since the San Francisco Conference, call \nfor the establishment of a balance in the \ndecision-making process.\nImprovement of the international climate, as I \nhave said, means, in the final analysis, the \nmaintenance of world peace and security.\n33. The United Nations, through the organ \ncompetent in that area, is frequently called upon \nin the case of a threat to peace. The \nunsatisfactory results of sessions devoted to \ndisarmament reduce the chances of consolidating \nand preserving peace. States continue to devote \nenormous sums to armaments, while two thirds of \nthe people of the world live in poverty. The \nstruggle for world supremacy, which is called \nhegemonism, is pursued inexorably, leading to the \nresearch into, manufacture, and qualitative and \nquantitative stockpiling of weapons of mass \ndestruction. This phenomenon, added to everything \ncovered by the key word \\\"deterrence\\\", seriously \ncompromises peace and security in many regions of \nthe world. That is why the Central African \nRepublic encourages all new initiatives designed \nto curb the arms race and help to improve the \ninternational climate.\n36. Although a sovereign State may freely choose \na given system, certain Powers continue to \ninterfere in their internal affairs, using the \nweapons of blackmail and threat. Are we to infer \nfrom that that the principles which govern \ninternational relations need be observed and \napplied only by the weak countries? That is the \nquestion my delegation wishes to put to the \nAssembly.\nBetween Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran, in \nWestern Sahara, in Democratic Kampuchea and in \nAfghanistan armed conflicts persist which \nthreaten peace in those regions of the world. \nNevertheless, the Charter commits nations to \nsettling their differences by peaceful means. We \nfirmly believe in the virtues of dialogue and \nappeal urgently to the various protagonists in \nthese conflicts to resort to it.\nWith regard to the Korean problem, the North- South joint communique \nof 1972 advocates direct negotiations between the \ntwo parties, free of all foreign interference. \nThat historic document, constitutes in the view \nof my delegation, a valuable basis on which to \nseek a just and lasting solution. The Central \nAfrican Republic welcomes the strenuous efforts \nmade by the parties to the conflict to lay the \nbasis for the constructive, fruitful dialogue \nwhich is so sincerely desired so that the \nquestion of their simultaneous admission to the \nUnited Nations can be considered again, without \nprejudice to the principle of reunification, in \nkeeping with the wishes of their peoples.\nThe present international situation gives no \ncause for optimism because the world political \norder is being challenged by another factor: the \nunequal development of the members of the \ninternational community. This is the second part \nof my message.\nThe United Nations should devote itself \nincreasingly to the economic and social \ndevelopment of Member States. Indeed, how can we \nnot be moved by the problems caused by the world \neconomic crisis, which is seriously affecting \nthird world countries? These include: increasing \nbalance-of-payments imbalances, the constant \ndeterioration in the terms of trade; the \nexcessive burden of their foreign debts; the \ninsecurity of their food supplies; and the \ndisorganization of the present monetary system. \nAll these factors, which indicate the \ninterdependence of States, should lead the \n\\\"haves\\\" to seek more actively, together with the \n\\\"have not\\\", new bases for a restructuring of \ninternational economic relations.\nOn the contrary, however, we are witnessing a \nvery marked re-emergence of protectionism, which \nseriously penalizes the countries of the South. \nThe illusion of the concept of the transfer of \ntechnology in turn compounds their \ndisillusionment. That is why we believe that the \n\\\"have\\\" States, in a spirit of solidarity, should \nfacilitate and support the United Nations in its \nefforts to establish a new international economic \norder.\nThese efforts clearly demonstrate the will of the \nOrganization, which is now engaged in \\\"economic \ndecolonization\\\". This will is reflected in the \nadoption of the Charter of Economic Rights and \nDuties of States the International Development \nStrategy for the Third United Nations Development \nDecade and the Substantial New Programme of \nAction for the 1980s for the Least Developed \nCountries.\nThe Central African Republic, which falls within \nthe category of least developed countries, would \nlike to see the \\\"have\\\" countries devote more \neffort and sacrifice to the implementation of \nthose measures, in order to establish \nco-operation between them and the developing \ncountries, to the mutual advantage of their \nrespective peoples.\nAs the Assembly is aware, there was a change of \nregime in the Central African Republic on 1 \nSeptember 1981. It should be recalled that the \nNational Army took power following dark years \nduring which the country was on the verge of ruin \nand security and peace were increasingly \nthreatened. As stated recently by the head of \nState, General Andre Kolingba, the Military \nCommittee of National Reconstruction set for \nitself four goals: the creation of conditions of \ngeneral mobilization through a resumption of \nwork; the reorganization of the State finances; \nthe restoration of a climate of confidence and \nguarantees of the security of property and \nperson; and economic recovery.\nThe highest priority was given to the correction \nof economic and financial imbalances. We \ntherefore reduced the budget deficit of the State \nby almost 30 per cent as compared with that of \nprevious years. That result was obtained as a \nresult of very severe limitations on certain \nexpenditures, a reordering in the area of \nearnings, a campaign to combat fraud and the \nfinancial sacrifices of State officials.\nThe reassurance of investors by restoring a \nclimate of confidence is one of the policies \nguiding the actions of the Military Committee for \nNational Reconstruction intended to bring about \nconditions for the economic recovery of the \nCentral African Republic.\nThe plan requires that other demands be met, \nincluding food self-sufficiency and growth \nthrough increased productive investments, both \npublic and private. However, our present \nfinancial situation does not yet enable us to \ntackle by our own efforts alone other vital \ntasks, such as the reconstruction of our road \nsystem and the creation of social and educational \nstructures. The co-operation of the international \ncommunity, which we hope will be increased, \nremains essential in that regard.\nThus the accomplishment of the mission that the \nMilitary Committee of National Reconstruction has \nset for itself has not been easy and continues to \nbe limited in terms of time and of objectives. To \nachieve the necessary results, the Military \nCommittee of National Reconstruction has only one \nweapon: dialogue, based on the concept the \nCentral African people has of the real democracy \nthat results from listening to the questions in \nthe hearts of the people. The Central African \nGovernment has a dynamic view of democracy, which \nmust take account of the developmental aspects of \nthe life of a people capable of reconstructing \nits national unity, which is a prerequisite for \ndevelopment.\nAs a land-locked country, the Central African \nRepublic has been subjected to serious \nconstraints. The Convention that has just been \nadopted a\u00a7 a result of the work of the Third \nUnited Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea \ncould make it possible for us to be provided with \nthe necessary trade facilities. That is the \nfervent hope of my country.\nWe wish to welcome once again resolutions 35/37 \nof 5 December 1980 and 36/206 of 17 December \n1981, in which the General Assembly calls upon \nall Member States, the specialized agencies and \nother economic and financial organizations to \ncontribute generously to the reconstruction, \nrehabilitation and development of the Central \nAfrican Republic, whose economic situation \nremains a matter of concern.\nOn behalf of the Central African people, the \nMilitary Committee of National Reconstruction and \nits President, General Andre Kolingba, I wish to \nthank from this rostrum all the States and \ninstitutions which, in spite of their own \ndifficulties, have shown a generosity which we \nvery much appreciate- My country is convinced \nthat this international solidarity, which is \nbased on human awareness, will continue to \nincrease.\nThe Central African Republic hopes, and indeed is \nconvinced, that the Member States, in spite of \nthis period of adversity that the world is \nexperiencing, will make the contributions \nnecessary to make the Organization an instrument \nfor the improvement of the international \npolitical environment and of economic and social \ndevelopment. The Secretary-General's report, with \nthe spirit of which we fully agree and to whose \nauthor we pay a tribute, is important because it \nconcurs in that idea. The unity and harmony of \nthe international community will certainly \nbenefit from it.\n"

        "file_text": "The members of my delegation and I deem it an honour and a privilege \nto have the opportunity of participating in the thirty seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. We bring representatives the warm \ngreetings of the Government and the people of Bangladesh. On behalf \nof the Bangladesh delegation and on my own behalf, I congratulate Mr. \nHollai on his unanimous election as President of the thirty seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. We are confident that his qualities \nof leadership and wealth of experience will be of immense value to \nthe Assembly in accomplishing its task. We offer him our co operation \nand support in fulfilling his heavy responsibility during the days \nahead. My delegation would like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate his predecessor, Mr. Kittani of Iraq, on his determined \nand energetic leadership not only during the thirty sixth session of \nthe General Assembly but also during the second special session \ndevoted to disarmament and the emergency special session on the \nquestion of Palestine. His patience and wisdom have been greatly \nappreciated by all of us. My delegation would also like to pay a \ntribute to the new Secretary General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, \nwho, within the short period since the assumption of his most \ndifficult responsibilities, has earned our trust and confidence for \nhis absolute dedication and impartiality. The Government of \nBangladesh congratulates him on his unremitting efforts and ceaseless \nendeavours in promoting the purposes and principles of the Charter. \nWe assure him of our fullest support for all his efforts aimed in \nthis direction. Bangladesh deeply mourns the passing of His Majesty \nKing Khaled of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In him the entire world \nhas lost an outstanding personality dedicated to the cause of peace \nand justice. Since its independence as a sovereign nation, Bangladesh \nhas made consistent efforts to work for the greater interest of the \ninternational community. The foreign policy of Bangladesh is based on \ntotal adherence to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. We see this world body as a unique instrument for \npromoting global peace and development based on justice and equity. \nWe greatly appreciate the candor with which the Secretary  General in \nhis report has brought to our notice the shortcomings of the \nOrganization. We in Bangladesh will support the Secretary General in \nall his efforts to make the United Nations an effective organization \nfor maintaining world peace and security. Bangladesh has chosen non \nalignment as the cornerstone of its foreign policy. We are committed \nto working tirelessly together with other peace loving nations of the \nworld to create an environment of peace in which people can harness \nall available resources to combat the scourge of poverty, hunger, \ndisease and illiteracy, thus achieving economic freedom without \nsacrificing political freedom. As at previous sessions this year, \ntoo, we have a long agenda and we are very conscious of the number of \ncrucial issues before us. We notice a progressive decline in the \ninternational situation. There is widespread use offence, the \ncontinuing existence of foreign occupation forces and acts of \naggression, total disregard for the principle of self determination, \nand flouting of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the \nSecurity Council. The situation prevailing in the Middle East remains \ndangerous and highly explosive, posing a serious threat to \ninternational peace and security. This state of affairs is due to the \npersistence of Israel in its flagrant denial of the inalienable \nrights of the Palestinian people, as recognized by the United \nNations. The latest Israeli holocaust in Lebanon has rendered the \nsituation in the Middle East more explosive than ever before. Along \nwith the peoples of all peace loving nations, we in Bangladesh have \nbeen stunned by the appalling act of inhuman massacre of a large \nnumber of innocent and unarmed Palestinian men, women and children in \ntheir camps in west Beirut. The Government of Bangladesh is of the \nview that the question of Palestine constitutes the core of the \nMiddle East problem. There can be no just and lasting peace in the \nMiddle East unless the Palestinian people can exercise their \nlegitimate rights, including the right to return to their homeland, \ntheir right to self determination and to establish a State of their \nown under the leadership of the PLO their sole and legitimate \nrepresentative, with Jerusalem as its capital. Further, the \ninadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force imposes an \nobligation on Israel to withdraw completely from all the territories \nit has occupied since 1967, including the Holy City of Jerusalem. Any \nsolution that fails to recognize these rights and realities will pose \na constant threat to peace and stability in the region. We are \nparticularly distressed at the continuing and self defeating armed \nconflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Bangladesh, \nas a member of the Islamic Peace Committee, has made sincere efforts \nto resolve that conflict peacefully. It is a great tragedy that \ndespite our collective efforts the war is still continuing. We should \nlike to make a renewed appeal to Iran and Iraq to stop this armed \nconflict forthwith and to resolve their differences through peaceful \nmeans. It is also extremely disheartening that the crises in \nAfghanistan and in Kampuchea remain unresolved. We should do \neverything possible to ensure the withdrawal of all foreign troops \nfrom those two countries and to ensure that the people in both those \ncountries are permitted to determine their own destinies without any \noutside intervention or interference. We firmly believe that peace is \npossible In southern Africa only through the transfer of power to the \npeople of Namibia. We appreciate the sustained mediatory efforts of \nthe five Western Powers in evolving an agreement on Namibia's \ntransition to independence under the control and supervision of the \nUnited Nations. It is the view of Bangladesh that peace and security \nwould be promoted through the creation of zones of peace in areas \nlike the Indian Ocean, South Asia and South East Asia, the \nMediterranean and other regions. Such zones would have to take into \naccount the interrelated aspects of eliminating the military presence \nof and threat from external Powers and the maintenance of security \namong the regional States. In this context, we support the convening \nof a conference in Sri Lanka next year as a step towards the \nimplementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of \nPeace. Bangladesh has also been making unrelenting efforts to promote \npeace and stability in the South Asian region through the creation of \na climate of trust, understanding and co operation on the basis of \nmutual respect for sovereign equality and non interference in the \ninternal affairs of other States. Taking into account our friendly \nrelations within our region with India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri \nLanka and Maldives, Bangladesh has proposed the creation of a \nregional co operation forum among those countries. Substantial \nprogress has been made towards the implementation of this proposal, \nand the necessary preparatory work is still under way for making the \nprocess self  sustaining and irreversible. It has also been decided \nto convene a meeting at the level of Foreign Ministers next year to \nlaunch the forum. We believe that our statement on global issues \nwould be incomplete if we did not say a few words about our national \nefforts to achieve a better living for our people. Mr. H. M. Ershad, \non assumption of the office of the head of Government of Bangladesh, \nclearly spelt out his Government's objectives: first, to bring \nmaximum benefit to the 90 million people of Bangladesh; secondly, to \nensure maximum participation by the people of the country through \nexisting political institutions and, thirdly, to create a simple, \nwell balanced administration capable of responding to the needs of \nthe people. In order to achieve these objectives, the Government of \nBangladesh has spelt out plan priorities, which are: self sufficiency \nin agriculture, population control, encouragement of the private \nsector, universal primary education and extensive and integrated \nrural development programmes, including health and social welfare. \nThese priorities and the decentralization of administration which has \nbeen initiated by the Government are designed to revitalize the \nsocial and economic activities and to lay the foundation of a new \nBangladesh. We are confident that these efforts by us at the national \nlevel will receive whole hearted support from the international \ncommunity. We in Bangladesh are therefore deeply concerned that the \ninternational situation has further deteriorated, generating despair \nand pessimism. The world economy is passing through a very serious \ncrisis threatening both the developed and the developing countries. \nThe second special session devoted to disarmament has met with \nmiserable failure, while armament expenditures continue to rise. The \ncrisis spots all over the world also continue to multiply. Our most \nimportant task therefore should be to address these problems in a \nconcerted and collective manner. The evolution of international \nsociety has made it manifest more than ever before that most problems \ntoday are interlinked and global in character. There can be no \npiecemeal solution. There can be no lasting peace so long as economic \nimbalances and injustices prevail. Peace is meaningless if it is not \naccompanied by development. To achieve a better world, mankind must \nhave both. While we strive for peace, our efforts for development \nshould not lag behind. Bangladesh strongly believes that the right to \ndevelopment is a human right and that equality of opportunity for \ndevelopment is as much the prerogative of nations as of individuals \nwithin nations. The present inequities of the world economic order, \naccompanied by the accelerated arms race, is therefore at the root of \nall world problems and one of the most significant obstacles to the \nrealization of both the right to development and the right to peace. \nAs the head of Government and President of the Council of Ministers \nof Bangladesh, Mr. H. M. Ershad, declared from this rostrum during \nthe twelfth special session and the second special session devoted to \ndisarmament, the three major challenges confronting mankind's \ncontinued progress and eventual survival are the arms race, \nunderdevelopment and the unlawful use of force in solving \ninternational disputes. Peace and development are indivisible and \nboth can be achieved to a large extent through effective disarmament. \nThe enormous resources that can be released through a well \nintentioned disarmament process would give a tremendous boost to the \ndevelopment efforts of the developing countries. In this period of \nresource difficulties, such diversion of resources is of crucial \nimportance. This point which we are making is not a new one and has \nbeen repeated many times in this forum as well as in others. \nUnfortunately, though, it has not been translated into reality by the \nparties concerned. We therefore urge everyone, big or small, to give \nthis idea serious thought, keeping in mind the question of the \nsurvival and progress of mankind as a whole. The annual military \nexpenditures of nearly $600 billion, which is more than 10 times the \namount now available for development assistance, is totally \nirrational. Such wasteful use of enormous amounts of the world's \nprecious limited resources is also clearly immoral when millions die \nof starvation and many more millions are struggling for their very \nsurvival. Bangladesh acceded to the Treaty on the Non  Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons as a demonstration of its total commitment to \ngeneral and complete disarmament. In view of the failure of the \nsecond special session on disarmament, we urge the super Powers and \nother militarily significant States to concert their efforts so as to \ncommence serious negotiations on a comprehensive test ban treaty as \nwell as a conventional weapon treaty. Work on the comprehensive \nprogramme of disarmament, which forms the core of the negotiations on \nthe reduction of armament, both nuclear and conventional, should be \nstarted inGeneva within the framework of the Committee on \nDisarmament. The failure of the Assembly at the second special \nsession on disarmament to produce a final document on the \ncomprehensive programme of disarmament should not be taken as an \nalibi to avoid the responsibility that devolves on the super Powers \nas well as other militarily significant countries. Bangladesh, in its \ntotal commitment to general and complete disarmament, has applied for \nmembership in the Committee on Disarmament and is ready to contribute \nto all future disarmament negotiations to be undertaken in the \nCommittee on Disarmament. The present world economic crisis is of a \nglobal nature. The interrelationship of issues and the \ninterdependence of the countries are so clearly established that \nisolated measures by any individual country or group of countries \ncannot solve the contradictions and difficulties that appear as a \nresult of profound structural imbalance. On the other hand, we agree \nwith the view that deterioration in the international economic \nsituation has in part been due to policies pursued in countries with \na preponderant weight in the world economy, as they have sought to \nsolve their problems on a national basis. The present state of crisis \ncan be overcome only through a global and concerted effort on the \npart of countries. Therefore we believe that a lasting improvement in \ninternational economic relations can be achieved only through a \nglobal dialogue a sincere, determined and imaginative co operation \nbetween the developed and the developing countries. It does not need \nreiteration that all nations have a stake in the recovery of the \nworld economy and should, therefore, engage themselves in a \npurposeful effort to address themselves to a world recovery programme \nand a restructuring the existing international economic relations. \nBangladesh believes that the present unjust international economic \nsystem requires structural reforms which could result only from a \ncomprehensive and integrated approach to the present international \neconomic issues through the participation of all countries in a round \nof global negotiations for the establishment of the new international \neconomic order. Bangladesh has, therefore, actively joined in all the \ninitiatives and efforts for the launching of global negotiations as \nenvisaged in General Assembly resolution 34/138. We earnestly hope \nthat in view of its importance to the economic development of the \nworld as a whole, it will be possible for us to launch the global \nnegotiations without further delay. Bangladesh will continue to make \nits humble contribution towards this effort in its capacity as \nChairman of the Group of 77. Before concluding, on behalf of the \nBangladesh delegation, I wish to assure you, Mr. President, and \nthrough you all the members of the Assembly that Bangladesh is \ndetermined to play a meaningful and constructive role in finding just \nand equitable solutions to the problems which face us today. It is \nour strong belief that, despite the frustrations of the past, the \nUnited Nations system is still the only organization which can bring \neffective peace, progress prosperity to our world. In order to \nachieve common objective, all the Members of the United Nations, big \nand small, must unite together to make this body more effective both \nin spirit and in action.\n"

        "file_text": "26.\tComrade President, I should like to take \nthis opportunity to congratulate you very \ncordially on your election to your high and \nresponsible office. I am particularly happy about \nthat because your country and the country that I \nrepresent have close and brotherly ties with each \nother. I wish you, as well as the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, every \nsuccess in the performance of your respective \nduties. At the same time we wish to convey our \nthanks to the President of the thirty-sixth \nsession, Mr. Kittani, for the great deftness and \nprudence with which he discharged his \nresponsibilities in an undoubtedly difficult \ninternational situation.\n27.\tThe present international situation must \ngive the peoples cause for profound concern. \nNever since the Second World War has peace been \nthreatened more seriously than today.\n28.\tThe policy of confrontation and arms \nbuild-up has affected all spheres of life. In \nmany countries, the state of the economy and, \nconsequently, the living conditions for millions \nof working people, have been rapidly \ndeteriorating, and unemployment and poverty have \ntaken on mass proportions. In situations like \nthat, as history has taught us, there is an \nincreasing temptation to seek a way out of the \ncrises that shake the capitalist system by \nembarking on military adventurism. It is commonly \nknown by whom wars have been instigated\u2014no matter \nwhere and when: by the same forces which today \nare engaged in an unbridled expansion of military \nmight and the fomenting of conflicts.\n29.\tSanctions boycott and trade war not only \nset the development of international economic \nrelations back dozens of years but also thwarts \nall efforts aimed at restructuring those \nrelations democratically and on the basis of \nequality. The protagonists of such a policy are \nout to undermine confidence and destroy all the \nbridges of co-operation built with great effort \nas a result of the policy of detente. Worse \nstill, they are sowing distrust, impeding or \npreventing political dialogue, causing strains in \nthe conduct of international negotiations and \ndisrupting the normal development of \ninternational relations.\n30.\tUnder the banner of anti-communism they \nare waging a crusade against all \nrealistically-minded forces in all spheres and by \nall means. And they stop at nothing to achieve \ntheir ends, not even the use of force, prohibited \nthough this is by the Charter of the United \nNations.\n31.\tWhat they are aiming at is hegemony and \nworld domination. And, while both of those goals \nare illusory, they are fraught with mortal \ndanger, for any attempt to achieve them in \npractice is bound to push the world closer to the \nabyss of a nuclear inferno.\n32.\tIt stands to reason, therefore, that \nmillions of people in all the continents are \njoining in the cry for peace and the instant \ncessation of the maniacal drive for arms. They \ncall for the continuance of detente, based on the \nbeneficial results attained in the 1970s, and \nthey expect the United Nations, too, to meet its \ngreat responsibilities in this context by playing \nits proper part in the preservation of \ninternational peace. The German Democratic \nRepublic subscribes to the view that it is \nnecessary to reinforce the protective and \npre-emptive ring of collective security which \nshould be our common shelter and the most \nimportant task of the United Nations.\n33.\tThe challenge flung down to all \npeace-loving mankind by those bent on \nmilitarization must be answered with firmness and \ndetermination. The United Nations has a clear \nobligation to contribute in all its spheres of \nactivity towards the development of peace\u00acful \nrelationships conducive to the welfare of the \npeoples. The Organization offers unique \nopportunities for States to come to terms with \none another. It is legitimate to expect all \nMember States to make use of those opportunities \nin the spirit of the Charter. Regrettably, those \nin certain quarters, including permanent members \nof the Security Council, have, especially in the \nmost recent past, been making attempts to exclude \nthe United Nations from the settlement of acute \nproblems and to shirk their moral and legal \nresponsibilities under the Charter. The efforts \nby the Secretary-General to strengthen the role \nand effectiveness of the Organization on the \nbasis of the Charter are therefore very timely.\n34.\tIt is the objective of the German \nDemocratic Republic to help ensure that all the \npossibilities provided by this thirty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly are used to stem \nthe danger of a nuclear war, end the arms race \nand achieve agreements on arms limitation and \ndisarmament; to put a stop to ideological \nsubversion and psychological warfare and ensure \nrenewed acceptance of constructive dialogue and \npeaceful coexistence as the dominant trend in \ninternational relations; to defuse international \ncon\u00acflicts and settle them in a lasting way, that \nis, on a just basis and by peaceful means; and to \novercome the politics of trade boycott and \ndestruction of treaty relations and promote ties \nof propitious and mutually advantageous \nco-operation among peoples.\n35.\tThe two mutually opposed trends \ndiscernible in international relations today \nmanifested themselves with particular clarity at \nthe second special session of the General \nAssembly devoted to disarmament.\n36.\tThe majority of States regard the removal \nof the danger of nuclear war as the highest \npriority in inter\u00acnational politics. The numerous \nproposals of the socialist countries are directed \nprecisely towards this goal. The solemn pledge of \nthe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics not to be \nthe first to use nuclear weapons is of historic \nsignificance. Could a more convincing \ndemonstration of good will and, indeed, \ndetermination to establish peace be imagined?\n37.\tIt is not sophistical arguments, but \nsimple yet effective steps such as this that will \nbanish the night\u00acmare of nuclear annihilation. \nThe unilateral under\u00actaking of the Soviet Union \ntestifies to the seriousness and continuity of a \npolicy which it has followed ever since its \nfoundation 60 years ago. It is a policy which is \ninherent in socialism and which inspires the \npeoples with hope and confidence at this time of \ntension also.\n38.\tTogether with the overwhelming majority \nof States and in keeping with the aspirations of \nall the forces of peace, the German Democratic \nRepublic calls upon the other nuclear-weapon \nStates to make analogous pledges. This would be \nunderstood and appreciated everywhere in the \nworld as a sign of genuine readiness to head off \nthe danger of war.\n39.\tSuch action would in fact be decisive in \ninitiating the adoption of joint measures to \nprevent the outbreak of nuclear war. \nUnfortunately, the necessary readiness is so far \nlacking. And, while many of the participants in \nthis year's special session on disarmament were \ntrying hard to identify ways of achieving \nconcrete disarmament measures, the members of the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization, just as they \ndid in Washington at the time of the first \nspecial session on disarmament, decided at their \nsummit in Bonn to strengthen their military \npotential even further. They are pushing ahead \nwith preparations for the deploy\u00acment of United \nStates medium-range missiles in Western Europe \nfrom 1983 on and speeding up the implementation \nof their long-term arms program. The line \nfollowed by a number of States at the second \nspecial session on disarmament reflected that \npolicy -small wonder, since those who on the \nPotomac River are busily adopting plans for the \nachievement of military superiority can hardly be \nexpected to agree at the same time on the East \nRiver to measures to outlaw war.\n40.\tAt the present session the General \nAssembly can draw on a large number of concrete \nproposals which were put forward by socialist and \nnon-aligned coun\u00actries at the special session on \ndisarmament. The German Democratic Republic feels \nthat there is a pressing need for the adoption \nwithout delay of measures to freeze nuclear \nweapons, put a compre\u00achensive ban on \nnuclear-weapon tests and prohibit the neutron \nweapon.\n41.\tAt the same time, it emphasizes that \ndoctrines on the feasibility of fighting, \nlimiting and winning a nuclear war are inhumane \nand hostile to the very concept oflife. Such \ndoctrines are designed to accustom the public to \nthe concept of nuclear war and war generally and \nto make it seem a legitimate means for achieving \npolitical ends.\n42.\tOn 8 February of this year it was decided \nin Washington to escalate further the build-up in \nthe chemical weapons field and to start the \nmanufacture of new systems, such as binary \nweapons. In the light of this development, an \ninstant and comprehensive ban on all types of \nchemical weapons is an imperative.\n43.\tThe German Democratic Republic advocates \nthe speedy drafting of a relevant convention \nalong the lines of the basic provisions of a \nconvention for the prohibition of the \ndevelopment, production and stock\u00acpiling of \nchemical weapons and on their destruction, \nproposed by the USSR at the second special \nsession on disarmament.\n44.\tOne point, though, should be stressed \nhere. The heavy responsibility for the \npreservation of peace forbids such negotiations \nbeing abused, for instance as an excuse to \nescalate the arms drive.\n45.\tIn my country, therefore, the public \nreacted with indignation when it was reported on \n20 July of this year that the United States had \ngone so far as to formalize its decision not to \nparticipate any more in the trilateral \ncomprehensive nuclear-weapon test ban talks in \nGeneva. The German Democratic Republic proposes \nto the General Assembly at this session to take a \nstep in the direction of spurring progress in the \nHeld of disarmament and arms limitation by \nreaffirming the political and legal duty of \nStates to negotiate on these vital issues for \nmankind in an honest manner and in good faith. \nAnd here I repeat something that has been said \nbefore: in our contemporary world, peace requires \nnot lip-service but actions which must be \nconcrete and have the support of all States.\n46.\tThe German Democratic Republic is open \nto, and will back up, any proposals, no matter by \nwhom provided only that they can help achieve \nsubstantive progress.\n47.\tFlourishing international economic \nco-operation is advantageous for all parties \ninvolved. It enhances international security \nbecause it is the basis of a shared interest in \ncalm and stable relationships. The start of \neconomic warfare, on the other hand, destroys not \nonly the fabric of international economic \nco-operation but it destroys the structure of \ninternational relations generally. The losers on \nthis policy of sanctions, which is contrary to \ninternational law, are, not least, those who \nare\u2014more or less compliantly\u2014helping to put it \ninto effect.\n48.\tIt is a task for the General Assembly to \nstimulate constructive co-operation in all areas, \nto combat neo- colonialist practices and to \nstrengthen the economic independence of States. \nIt is equally necessary to prevent colonialist \nexploitation, in whatever guise, being used to \nshift the burdens entailed by the arms build-up \nand the crises on to the peoples.\n49.\tNo forum is more suited than the United \nNations, by patient effort and on the basis of \nequality, to discuss and determine global \neconomic problems affecting the interests of all. \nLikewise suited for this would be the proposed \nround of global negotiations on international \neconomic questions.\n50.\tIt can, at the same time, be instrumental \nin the democratization of international economic \nrelations as provided for in the Charter of \nEconomic Rights and Duties of States adopted by \nthe Assembly in reso\u00aclution 3281.\n51.\tThe German Democratic Republic welcomes \nthe fact that the Third United Nations Conference \non the Law of the Sea this year has been able \nafter nine years of undoubtedly difficult \nnegotiations, to complete and adopt the \nConvention on the Law of the Sea.\n52.\tThe German Democratic Republic regards \nthe earliest possible signing and ratification of \nthe Con\u00acvention by all States as a duty which \nshould be fulfilled in the interests of \nstabilizing the rule of law on the oceans as well \nas for the sake of peaceful co-operation and \ndetente.\n53.\tThe consequences of the imperialist arms \nbuild\u00acup leave no region of our globe unharmed. \nIn Europe, detente and the proved policy of \nsearching for reason\u00acable compromises are to be \nreplaced by fomentation of tension and expansion \nof the whole range of means for waging cold war \nand a shooting war.\n54.\tHowever, the future of the European \npeoples, like that of all other peoples, can be \nmade secure only if military confrontation is \nlessened and the concept of a peaceful synthesis \nof interests accepted as the rationale of \npolitical action.\n55.\tA few weeks from now, the Madrid meeting \nof the Conference on Security and Co-operation in \nEurope is to resume its proceedings. The German \nDemocratic Republic believes that it will be both \nnecessary and feasible for that meeting to wind \nup its work with results that are aimed at \npreserving and reinforcing the basic elements of \nEuropean security and co-operation. My country is \na reliable partner in the steadfast pursuit of \nthat objective. That is why the German Democratic \nRepublic was quick to express support for the \ncall by the foreign ministers of Europe's neutral \nand non-aligned States that fresh efforts be made \nto ensure a successful conclusion of the Madrid \nmeeting. The convening of a conference on \nconfidence- building and security-building \nmeasures and disarma\u00acment in Europe is still the \nprimary task; in fact, it is a test of the \nreadiness of the participating States to carry on \nand lend fresh momentum to the process mapped out \nin the Final Act of Helsinki of 1975. Those who \nhave already shown that they have deserted the \nroad of Helsinki, no matter under what pretext, \nand who are bent on increasing the intensity of \ncon\u00acfrontation still further by provoking a \nfailure of the Madrid meeting, are taking a heavy \nresponsibility upon themselves.\n56.\tThe solemn signing of the Helsinki Final \nAct by the heads of State or Government of the \nparticipating countries came after years of \nnegotiations conducted with a great deal of \npatience. Time and again divergent interests had \nto be reconciled and mutually acceptable \nsolutions ironed out by way of consensus. Should \nall this hard work have been in vain, and should \nthis whole process, the fruitfulness of which has \nbeen recognized by the peoples, be sacrificed for \nthe selfish interests essentially of just one \ncountry?\n57.\tAttempts are being made to give the \nimpression that a conference as authoritative and \nrepresentative as that of Helsinki was an \neveryday affair. It is perhaps fit and proper to \nrecall the great input of effort in the 1970s, \nfor especially now in a time of acute \ninterna\u00actional tension much depends on whether, \nat the dividing line between the two social \nsystems and their military coalitions, peaceful \nco-operation, in accordance with the Helsinki \nFinal Act, that is co-operation in the interest \nof life itself, can continue.\n58.\tIn this context, the relationship between \nthe two German States is, no doubt, of \nsignificance. By working consistently for normal \nrelations between the two German States, on the \nbasis of the relevant agreements and in strict \nrespect for sovereignty and equality of rights, \nthe German Democratic Republic contributes \ntowards stable security on the European continent.\n59.\tThe meeting which the General Secretary \nof the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity \nParty of Germany and Chairman of the Council of \nState of the German Democratic Republic had with \nthe Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of \nGermany in December 1981 has confirmed the \naccuracy of the following conclusions. First, \nespecially in a time of political tension, the \nconduct of businesslike dialogue, based on the \npursuit of a peaceful synthesis of interests, is \nnot only necessary but also feasible. Secondly, \nif such dialogue is to yield results, it must be \nbased on the principle of sovereign equality and \non strict non\u00acinterference. Thirdly, if such \ndialogue is to benefit the people, the \ninterlocutors must focus their efforts on the \nparamount issue of our time\u2014the guarantee of \nlasting peace\u2014and, of course, political dialogue \npresupposes realism and a sense of proportion. \nFourthly, and finally, political dialogue also \nrequires the awareness of the parties that \ngood-neighborly relations cannot prosper in the \nshadow of new missiles intended for use in a \nnuclear first strike.\n\n61.\tIt would be of great significance for \nEuropean security-because of the resulting \nencouragement-if the Vienna Talks on Mutual \nReduction of Forces, Armaments and Associated \nMeasures in Central Europe could at last be \ncrowned with success. The German Democratic \nRepublic and the other socialist participants \nhave expressed readiness to reduce their forces \nin Central Europe and also their respective \nweaponry, on the basis of reciprocity. The NATO \ncountries object to that. As has been mentioned \nhere earlier, even unilateral advance concessions \nlike the withdrawal of 20,000 Soviet troops and \n1,000 tanks from the German Democratic Republic \nhave been answered by the other side with a \nbuild-up of its military potential and the \nannouncement of plans to move the United States \ntroops in the Federal Republic of Germany still \ncloser to my country's border, that is, to the \ndividing line between the Warsaw Treaty and NATO \ncountries.\n62.\tWhether in Vienna, Geneva or \nelsewhere-the proposals of the Western side are \ninvariably aimed at gaining unilateral military \nadvantages. This approach is a careless one, but \nignoring that attitude would be even more \ncareless.\n63.\tThe policy of strength and the \nintensified arms build-up have resulted in an \nexacerbation of interna\u00actional conflicts and \nencouraged aggressors to flout the right of \npeoples of self-determination.\n64.\tIn the Middle East, another sovereign \ncountry, Lebanon, has become a victim of the \naggressor. The Palestinian people and their \nlegitimate representative, the Palestine \nLiberation Organization [PLO], are to be \nphysically destroyed. It would be possible to put \na stop to the genocide in Lebanon, to the still \ncon\u00actinuing systematic extermination of the \nPalestinian people patterned after the worst \nFascist atrocities, quite simply by forcing \nIsrael to comply with the relevant United Nations \nresolutions. In actual fact, however, the \naggressor is receiving political and military \nsupport under an agreement on so-called strategic \nco-operation.\n65.\tIntrigues, lies, cynicism, brutality and \nterror -one would not believe it, but that is \nwhat makes up the internal posture of that \nregime. It is to be wel\u00accomed also that among the \nIsraeli people themselves more and more forces \nare speaking out against this. Israel's leaders \nand those who support them here also at the \nUnited Nations cannot by any means absolve \nthemselves from their guilt.\n66.\tThe German Democratic Republic demands \nthe immediate withdrawal of Israel's troops from \nLebanon and from all other occupied Arab lands. \nIts support is for the Palestinian people who, \nunder the leadership of the PLO, are fighting so \ncourageously for self-determination and the \nestablishment of a sovereign State of their own.\n67.\tThe latest pertinent proposals of the \nSoviet Union point out the path towards a lasting \nsolution of the Middle East conflict. They accord \nwith the points considered by the Arab States at \nthe Twelfth Arab Summit Conference in Fez to \nconstitute the elements for a comprehensive \nsettlement of the conflict.\n68.\tThe time has long been ripe for \ncompelling South Africa to end its illegal \noccupation of Namibia and to cease its aggression \nagainst Angola. AH relevant decisions of the \nUnited Nations, in particular Security Council \nresolution 435 (1978), must be complied with. At \nthe same time, it is necessary-and the majority \nof States in the Organization will watch \ncarefully- that effective steps be taken against \nall attempts to despoil the Nairobian people of \ntheir independence and their right to \nself-determination by means of neo-colonialist \nmaneuvers. The German Democratic Republic is \ncommitted to a policy of steadfast solidarity \nwith the South West Africa People's Organization \nand the Namibian people. As regards the People's \nRepublic of Angola, which is the target of \npersistent acts of aggression by South Africa, my \ncountry is maintaining close links with it in \naccordance with a treaty of friendship and \nco-operation.\n69.\tInside South Africa, the regime is \nintensifying its terrorism against the majority \nof the population Cannot be reformed. In the \ninterests of humanity and peace, its roots must \nbe tom out completely, so that it will disappear \nfor ever. This calls imperatively for the \nimmediate cessation of any kind of \nsupport-political, economic or military- extended \nto the South African regime by some Western \ncountries and transnational corporations.\n70.\tStates in the region of the Indian Ocean \nhave been making great efforts to achieve the \nestablishment of a zone of peace in that region. \nThe German Democratic Republic is committed to a \npolicy of promoting those efforts.\n71.\tOn the other hand, the expanding \nimperialist military presence, the greed for \nbases and the im\u00acperialist war against the \nDemocratic Republic of Afghanistan are making ^he \nsituation still worse. The convening of a \nconference on the Indian Ocean must not be \ndelayed any further if peace and security in that \nregion are to be strengthened.\n72.\tIn South-East Asia every attempt is being \nmade to call in question the right of the \nKampuchean people; to determine their own \npolitical status and to choose their own road to \ndevelopment. The methods employed range from \ndirect intervention and economic and political \npressure to the setting up of a so-called \ncoali\u00action Government ' outside the country. This \ncontrasts with the constructive proposals which \nthe States of Indo-China have made for \nstrengthening peace and co-operation in \nSouth-East Asia and which have our full approval.\n73.\tThe German Democratic Republic also \nsupports the proposals put forward by the \nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea for the \nsolution of the Korean question, including the \ndemand for the withdrawal of the United States \ntroops from South Korea.\n74.\tIn the Caribbean and in Central America, \non\u00acslaughts by imperialist forces on the freedom \nand independence of the peoples of that region \nare on the increase. In particular, a vote in the \nUnited States Senate of 11 August 1982, which is \ndesigned to open up possibilities for the use of \nmilitary force against socialist Cuba, a member \nof the non-aligned movement, has resulted in a \ndangerous deterioration of the situa\u00action in the \nregion and endangers world peace. The German \nDemocratic Republic supports the efforts and \nconstructive proposals by Cuba, Nicaragua and \nMexico, made with a view to normalizing the \natmo\u00acsphere in Central America and the Caribbean, \nand believe that they can lead to a more stable \npeace and enhanced security.\n73. As regards the conflict in the South \nAtlantic, the German Democratic Republic favors a \nsettlement based on the Charter of the United \nNations and the resolution adopted at the \nMinisterial Meeting of the Co-coordinating Bureau \nof Non-Aligned Countries in Havana in June 1982.\n76.\tThe German Democratic Republic reiterates \nonce again from this rostrum that it feels \nstrongly about the need to solve the question of \nCyprus in accordance with the Charter and the \npertinent United Nations resolutions aimed at \nmaintaining the independence, sovereignty, \nterritorial integrity and non-alignment of \nCyprus. Indispensable prerequisites for such a \nsettle\u00acment are the withdrawal of all foreign \ntroops from Cyprus and the cessation of all kinds \nof interference in the island country's internal \naffairs. A representa\u00active conference on Cyprus \nunder United Nations auspices could, no doubt, \nhelp pave the way to a life in peace for the \npeople of Cyprus.\n77.\tA world in which peoples can live \ntogether in peace needs the fostering and \npropagation of the great humanist ideas of \ninternational understanding. But warmongering and \nhatred against other peoples or races have \nalready reappeared and are once more poisoning \nthe international atmosphere. In fact, as a \nresult of the politics of threats and resort to \nforce, they find ever new breeding ground. If, as \nthe Charter requires, such Fascist and \nneo-Fascist activities imperiling world peace are \nto be brought to an end, as they must be in the \ninterest of peace, effective action by both the \nOrganization and its Member States individually \nis imperative.\n78.\tSo it is evident that the present \ninternational situation must worry the peoples. \nThe danger of a thermonuclear war which is facing \nmankind lends ever greater urgency to the task of \nimplementing the Soviet proposal to call a \nspecial series of meetings of the Security \nCouncil at the highest level.\n79.\tAll States will have to make a choice. To \nopt for the policy of peaceful coexistence is to \nmake a choice for life, for progress and for a \npeaceful future for man. This policy corresponds \nto the interests of the people of the German \nDemocratic Republic and they will not deviate \nfrom that course. The German Democratic Republic \nwill unswervingly continue the building of a \nsocialist society and make every effort within \nthe framework of the community of socialist \nStates to advance the cause of peace, detente and \ninternational co-operation.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, I should like to begin by congratulating you on your election to \nthe presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly \nand to offer you my best wishes in the tasks which lie ahead of you. \nI should like, too, to join other speakers who have expressed their \ngratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Kittani, for his \ndistinguished efforts on behalf of the Assembly. It also gives me \nparticular pleasure to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, who in \nhis first year in office has shown admirable flair and discretion in \ndischarging his responsibilities. His dedication and integrity are \nbeyond praise. He has already brought the Organization much credit. \nThe United Nations could not be in better hands.\n\n165.\tThe maintenance of peace, the development of friendly \nrelations between States, the promotion of social and economic \nprogress and of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms \nthrough international co-operation-these are the noble purposes for \nwhich, under the Charter, the United Nations exists. Once more we \nmust assess how far those purposes have been achieved; we must \nexamine the problems facing the world community, and see how better \nto realize our joint purposes. These purposes are by no means \nexclusively political, and neither, of course, are the problems. The \ndaily lives of all our peoples are just as much affected by the \ndecisions we take and the progress we can make on economic, social, \nhumanitarian and commercial issues. The United Nations has rightly \ninvolved itself in such questions as agricultural productivity, \nenergy and food programmes and population control. These are issues \nto which Britain attaches great importance, as we do to international \neconomic matters, such as the role of the financial institutions and \nthe avoidance of protectionism and trade wars.\n\n166.\tI do not intend today to deal comprehensively with all the \nproblems that confront us. That would make my speech intolerably \nlong. I would also be repeating much of what the Foreign Minister of \nDenmark said at the 8th meeting in the name of the European Community \nand its member States. I propose to concentrate today on questions of \npeace and war. This year we have little cause for satisfaction, and \nnone for complacency. The world is no more peaceful than it was 12 \nmonths ago. On the contrary, new conflicts have arisen-several of \nthem. Old ones have worsened. Since the last session of the General \nAssembly thousands of innocent lives have been lost. Hundreds of \nthousands have been forced from their homes to swell the growing \nflood of refugees. Countless others have witnessed the destruction of \ntheir property and livelihood. Who is responsible for this misery and \nwaste on such an enormous scale? I do not think that the blame can be \nlaid in any way at the door of the United Nations system as such. The \nCharter remains as valid today as when it was drawn up almost 40 \nyears ago. Nor does the fault lie in the way in which the organs of \nthe United Nations are constituted.\n\n167.\tThe fault lies with us, the Member States. The \nSecretary-General, in his report on the work of the Organization, has \ndrawn attention to the need for us to re-examine the way in which we \nuse the system we have inherited. I warmly endorse his thesis. We \nhave received his proposals with respect and will study them with \ncare. The Secretary-General has also emphasized the fundamental need \nfor Member States to recommit themselves to the Charter. Clearly, the \nsystem cannot perform the tasks which the founders gave it when there \nis so widespread a tendency for Member States to flout the \nobligations they have assumed under the Charter. Time and again we \nencounter the depressing fact that if a State is determined to resort \nto force or to violate international law it is virtually impossible \nto stop it. Wars arise not because of any failing on the part of the \nUnited Nations system but because national ambitions and rivalries \nprove stronger than respect for the principles of international law \nand the Charter. The impotence of the United Nations in these \ncircumstances may seem to historians in the next century to be one of \nthe more extraordinary facts of contemporary international life. I \nknow that the Secretary-General is determined to do what he can to \nimprove the record. We for our part will do all we can to help him. \nThe first step must be to discard preconceptions and self-serving \nanalysis, and to look again at the roots of the problem.\n\n168.\tWhat are the principles of the Charter whose violation is at \nthe heart of so many of our conflicts? First and foremost is the \nrequirement in Article 2 of the Charter to settle disputes by \npeaceful means and to refrain from the unlawful use of force. As the \ndrafters of the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of \nInternational Disputes, which is to be considered at this session \nand, we hope, approved,^ have so aptly put it, neither the existence \nof a dispute nor the failure of a procedure to settle it peacefully \ncan justify the use of force by any of the parties to it. Otherwise, \nin a world where there are such disparities between nations, the \nstrong will inevitably batten on the weak and we shall all be subject \nto the law of the jungle.\n\n169.\tBy extension of the same principle, terrorism, too, must be \nrooted put. Terrorists can only discredit the causes for which they \nclaim to work. We will always listen to civilized advocacy. But \nterrorism means the massacre of innocent people. Bombs planted in \ncrowded restaurants, airline passengers held hostage or sprayed with \ngunfire, diplomatic personnel assassinated-this can be condoned by no \none. The international community should unite to condemn terrorists \nand bring them to justice. To make exceptions is to spread the \nscourge.\n\n170. I therefore urge all those that have not already done so to sign \nand ratify the Hague/ Montreal and Tokyo? Conventions concerning the \nsafety of civil aviation and the Conventions against the taking of \nhostages and on crimes against internationally protected persons. And \nI hope that those that have signed and ratified those Conventions \nwill do their utmost to carry them out.\n\n171.\tA second basic principle of the United Nations is respect for \nhuman rights, entrenched since 1948 in the Universal Declaration to \nwhich we all subscribe. Respect for the Declaration is easy. What \nremains is for us to ensure that its provisions are observed. That is \nfar harder. In many countries the spirit and the letter of the \nDeclaration are persistently and deliberate^ ignored. In recent years \nthe United Nations has made some limited progress in developing its \nability to respond to such situations. But all too often its \nresponses have been and remain pitifully inadequate.\n\n172.\tAnother of the basic principles is self-determination. It is \na principle whose implementation has preoccupied the Organization and \ninformed its proceedings ever since its inception. The right of all \npeoples to self-determination is enshrined in the two International \nCovenants on Human Rights and underlined in such important United \nNations documents as the Declaration of Principles of International \nLaw concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in \naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations. Indeed, the United \nNations has long since come to regard self-determination as not just \na principle but an inalienable right.\n\n173. Self-determination is therefore fundamental to British foreign \npolicy. Thanks to our recognition of this right in regard to our own \ndependencies, nearly 50 members of the General Assembly have taken \ntheir places here. Never in the whole history of the world has there \nbeen such a massive transfer of power, voluntarily and deliberately \nundertaken. The legacy of our imperial past is not bitterness or \nsuspicion, but friendship and co-operation.\n\n174. The achievements of the British in decolonization since the last \nwar have been our expression and application of the principle that we \nhave long supported in other parts of the world. To take one example, \nearly in the nineteenth century, Britain recognized the struggle of \nthe newly emerging Latin American nations for independence. We stood \nby them and gave them support. We were among the first to realize the \njustice of their aspirations, and we laid a basis of friendship and \nmutual respect which has persisted to this day.\n\n\n175.\tThe example of Latin America showed the world that respect \nfor self-determination was the right and natural way to discharge \ncolonial responsibilities. Next year is the bicentenary of Simon \nBolivar, and I should like to pay a tribute to him and to the nations \nwhich he brought to birth. Our relations with the countries of Latin \nAmerica which reflect that history have been and remain of great \nimportance to us.\n\n176.\tThis last year, Britain itself has been involved in a major \nconflict, a conflict which we and our fellow members of the Security \nCouncil tried strenuously to avert. On 1 April 1982 the President of \nthe Council, in the name of all its members, appealed to Britain and \nArgentina to exercise the utmost restraint. Britain responded \npositively to that appeal. The response of Argentina was a military \ninvasion of the Falkland Islands. Following an authoritative \ndetermination by the Security Council the next day that Argentina's \ninvasion of the Falklands had created a breach of the peace, and a \nmandatory demand by the Council in its resolution 502 (1982) that \nArgentina withdraw, we went to every conceivable length to avoid \nhaving to resort to force in self-defence.\n\n177.\tThe Security Council thus sought first to deter Argentina \nfrom aggression and then to induce it to withdraw. The efforts of the \nUnited Nations-the efforts of the Security Council and of the \nSecretary-General himself-to achieve a peaceful settlement had the \nfull, active and whole-hearted support of the British Government. \nThey failed through Argentine obduracy.\n\n178.\tThroughout our campaign to repossess the Islands, we took \nimmense care to act strictly within the framework of the Charter, at \neach point reporting our actions to the Security Council. The force \nwe used in self-defence under Article 51 was the minimum necessary to \nremove Argentina's occupying forces. We made it clear that in so \nacting we were showing our absolute determination to implement to the \nfull our obligations towards the populations of our dependent \nTerritories under Article 73. We will not be deflected from that \ndetermination and I make that quite clear.\n\n179.\tBy liberating the people of the Falklands from alien \ndomination, we were also standing up for the right of a small but \nauthentic people to determine how they should be governed and how \nthey should live. Our tragic losses in men and ships were \nconsiderable, but we were able to prove that in some cases, given the \nwill and the courage and the professionalism required, aggression \ndoes not pay.\n\n180.\tThe Argentine invasion took place when negotiations in good \nfaith were actually in train between Britain and Argentina. We were \ntalking round the table with the Argentines at the time. Suddenly and \nbrutally they decided upon a military invasion. That flagrant \nviolation of the principles of the non-use of force and the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes has radically altered the situation. It will \nbe difficult indeed to revive our confidence in Argentine intentions. \nIt will take a long time. Why, even now, has Argentina not accepted \nthe definitive cessation of the hostilities which it so mistakenly \ninitiated? Is it not for Argentina to prove that it has renounced any \nthought of using force? Is it not for Argentina to demonstrate \nrespect for the right of self-determination, including the right of \nthe Falklanders? Will Argentina now abide by the principles of the \nUnited Nations and the precepts of international law? Those are the \nquestions which must be answered if confidence is to be rebuilt.\n\n181.\tBut the Falklands dispute, though it loomed large for \nBritain, is far from being the only example of defiance by Members of \nfundamental United Nations principles. It is certainly far from being \nthe most costly in lives. The region which has suffered most from war \nover the past year has undoubtedly again been the Near and Middle \nEast.\n\n182.\tThe Israeli invasion of Lebanon has been horrifyingly \ndestructive and has taken a terrible toll of innocent life. Israel \nhas legitimate security concerns, but the operation undertaken \nagainst Lebanon went far beyond the requirements of Israeli security \nand was pursued in defiance of the explicit demands of the Security \nCouncil. Force was used disproportionately and relentlessly, and in \nthe process the Lebanese people and Palestinian civilians have paid a \ncruel price. It does not require much imagination to realize the \nbitterness and resentment they must feel.\n\n183.\tAt the heart of the issue is the Palestinian people's right \nto self-determination and their aspiration for a land of their own in \nthe West Bank and Gaza. Only by reconciling that right with Israel's \nright to a peaceful existence within its own borders will there be a \nlasting end to this appalling conflict. I believe -and we must \ncertainly hope-that a significant proportion of people in Israel and \nthe Arab world are now convinced that war is not the answer and are \nprepared to compromise for peace. Experience does not encourage us \nhere, but the proposals put forward by President Reagan and by the \nArab heads of State have created a new opportunity and a new outlook \nfor negotiations which none of us can afford to see wasted. The \nchoice lies with the peoples of the region but they are going to want \nand to need all the help the rest of us can give them.\n\n184.\tThe conflict between Iran and Iraq has equally been ruthless \nand bloody. It has cost many thousands of lives. Obviously it has \nseriously endangered the stability of a crucial region of the world \nvital to the interests of many countries outside. Surely by now both \nsides must accept that further conflict is fruitless. As so often in \nwar, both sides have been the losers. To prolong the conflict will \nonly increase the suffering of their own peoples.\n\n185.\tAlthough the Middle East has recently held the main focus, we \nmust not forget that the same principles are involved in other areas. \nIt is now nearly three years since the Soviet Union mounted its \nmassive military invasion of Afghanistan. The General Assembly has \nthree times cried out for the self-determination of the Afghan people \nto be respected, cries which have been cynically ignored by the \nSoviet Union. No one knows how many people have been killed; no one \nknows how many villages have been destroyed or how much the lives of \ninnocent people have been disrupted. All those facts are suppressed, \nand people can well understand why. What we do know is that some 3 \nmillion refugees have fled their country, imposing an enormous burden \non its neighbours. Pakistan's impressive and generous handling of \nthis problem deserves our admiration. We also know that the Afghan \npeople continue to resist the imposition by Soviet arms of a regime \nthey do not want. What a crime against humanity war is, and what a \nblot upon our collective record.\n\n186.\tThen, in Kampuchea, an unrepresentative regime is also kept \nin power by the armed forces of its larger neighbour; in this case \nthe invader was Viet Nam. The regime was imposed by military invasion \nmore than three years ago. All the efforts of the United Nations and \nthe neighbouring countries of the Association of South-East Asian \nNations-which we have whole-heartedly supported-have so far failed to \nmove the Vietnamese from their insistence on maintaining by force in \nKampuchea a regime to suit their own interests. The recent formation \nof a coalition of Kampuchean resistance forces could prove a \nsignificant step towards a comprehensive political solution based on \nself-determination, and we wish it well. As in the case of \nAfghanistan, Britain will continue to work with every other \nfreedom-loving country for a just solution to this dispute and to \nensure that these continuing injustices are not forgotten.\n\n187.\tAnd the same is true concerning Poland. As a European country \nBritain has been profoundly concerned with events in Poland. The \nstruggle in that unhappy country may on the face of it seem to some a \ndomestic problem. But of course it is far more than that. This time \nlast year the Polish people were seeking peacefully to liberalize and \nreform their society under a regime that was originally imposed on \nthem from outside-and incidentally, with no consultation and no \nreference to their rights of self-determination. Since then, with \nfull Soviet encouragement and support, the Polish regime has taken \ndeliberate steps to crush the hopes of the people for a freer and \nmore just society. No freedom-loving person, no true democrat, no one \nwith any feeling for human rights can fail to be concerned that a \nwave of oppression has once again swept across that long-suffering \ncountry and its valiant and noble people. We shall continue to call \non the Polish authorities to fulfil their undertaking to return to \nthe path of renewal and reform, and we shall continue to urge and \npress the Soviet Union to allow the peoples under their tutelage to \ndevelop in ways more in accordance with their natural traditions and \naspirations and. in accordance with the principles of the Charter of \nthe United Nations.\n\n188.\tBy contrast it is a relief to be able to record that in one \nof the world's major disputes progress has been made recently towards \na settlement based on a Security Council resolution. I am glad that \nBritain, as a member of the contact group, has been able to \ncontribute towards progress over a settlement in Namibia. For \nprogress there has undoubtedly been. Although it is premature to \nassume that the many obstacles in the path of Namibian independence \nwill all be overcome, it is not, I think, too much of hope that the \npeople of Namibia may soon have the opportunity to determine their \nown future and to do so in elections held under United Nations \nsupervision. If a solution can be achieved in this way in Namibia it \nwill indeed be a success to chalk up for persistent and patient \ndiplomacy backed by the United Nations. I should like to pay a \ntribute to the constructive way in which the parties to the dispute \nand the front-line States have approached these lengthy and delicate \nnegotiations.\n\n189.\tA settlement in Namibia, if it can be added to that in \nZimbabwe, would provide further proof that the complex problems of \nthat troubled region of Africa can be solved through peaceful means \nrather than conflict and violence. There is no need for further lives \nto be lost. We hope for peaceful evolution within South Africa itself \nand the emergence there of a form of government based on the consent \nof the South African people as a whole.\n\n190.\tI should also like to welcome signs of progress in another \nregion where the United Nations has long been directly involved, \nnamely Korea. We are encouraged by the positive attitude to contacts \nwith the North shown by the Government of the Republic of Korea. This \nshould contribute to the prospects for a lasting solution to the \nKorean question based on genuine understanding.\n\n191.\tThere are many Member States which are not directly involved \nin any of the problems I have touched on. But there are some \ninternational issues which affect us all. One of them is disarmament. \nI want to say that the British Government remains fully committed to \nthe pursuit of realistic, balanced and verifiable arms control and \ndisarmament measures in both nuclear and conventional forces which \nwill promote peace with freedom and security at a lesser cost.\n\n192.\tThe second special session on disarmament did serve to \nconcentrate the minds of world leaders on this subject. But it was a \nforum for stimulus and review, not negotiation. The straight talking \nand the hard work has to be done in the negotiations taking place \nelsewhere, in talks on strategic arms, intermediate-range nuclear \nforces, mutual and balanced force reductions and chemical weapons.\n\n193.\tBritain's principal purpose, the principal purpose of the \nUnited Nations, is peace. In the absence of a world-wide will for \npeace, it can be achieved only if each and every member of the \ninternational community respects the principles of the Charter. All \nMembers of the United Nations bear a heavy responsibility to remember \nthat it is an organization designed to preserve the peace. To use it \nas a forum for ideological rhetoric is to undermine the respect in \nwhich it should be held and to diminish its capacity to fulfil its \npurpose.\n\n194.\tI referred earlier to the importance my Government attaches \nto international economic co-operation. Our record speaks for itself. \nI wish that that were true of all who orate on the subject in this \nHall. To say that this co-operation presents a moral challenge is not \nnew. But the concept gains force in face of the current painful \nrealities of the world economy, with growth barely visible, inflation \na persisting plague, and unemployment still rising. For developed \ncountries these problems have been serious; for developing countries \nthey can be devastating.\n\n193. So today it is more than ever in the mutual interest of \ndeveloped and developing countries to pull together. Renewed stable \ngrowth in the world economy, the balanced and reciprocal development \nof world trade, the social and economic well-being of the developing \ncountries, especially the low-income countries, are in the general \nand the particular interest alike. Cur conviction that current \nproblems need to be tackled positively is underlined by the United \nKingdom's strong support for IDA and the recent release of our third \ninstalment for the sixth replenishment of IDA, our continuing support \nfor an open world trading system, our resistance to protectionist \nmeasures, and our maintenance of a high level of official development \nassistance and essential private capital flows. I fully associate \nmyself with the remarks of the distinguished Foreign Minister of \nDenmark, who spoke at the 8th meeting on behalf of the 10 member \nStates of the European Community. North-South matters require a \ncontinuing commitment from all of us.\n\n196.\tBritain's foreign policy is firmly based on respect for the \nprinciples which I have been talking about today. We sha31 continue \nto strive for the maintenance of peace, acid we shall work for that \nwith all our friends and allies in all parts of the world, in this \nsearch for peace there is no place for make-believe or deceit. Unless \nwe face up to the issues involved in each conflict and in each \ndisagreement squarely, unless we decide to face them together with a \nwill to resolve them without recourse to violence or war, we will \nnever be successful.\n\n197.\tSo let us go forward from here now, with dedication and \nrealism, to work together for the peace which the billions and \nbillions of people we here represent long for.\n"

        "file_text": "Comrade President, I should like most cordially \nto congratulate you on your election to the \nimportant post of President of the thirty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly and wish you \nevery success in your important work. It is a \nparticular pleasure for me to welcome in your \nperson a representative of the Hungarian \nPeople's Republic with which the People's \nRepublic of Bulgaria maintains relations of \nfraternal friendship and co-operation in the \ninterests of both peoples and of peace and \nsocialism. The Bulgarian delegation also wishes \nto express its warmest greetings to the \nSecretary-General. We should like to assure him \nof our readiness to afford him every co-operation \nin the discharge of his most responsible task.\n40.\tThe focus of attention of the \nthirty-seventh session of the General Assembly \nis once again the cardinal issue of eliminating \nthe threat of a destructive nuclear war, the \ncessation of the arms race and the elimination of \nsources of international tension, and this is \nonly natural. In accordance with its goals and \npurposes the Organization has always given pride \nof place to the most important problems of the \nday. At this time the prevailing view is\u00f3and this \nhas been corroborated by the whole course of the \nwork at this session\u00f3that there is now in fact no \nmore urgent or immediate humanitarian problem \nthan concern for the preservation and \nconsolidation of peace throughout the world, \nwhich is in keeping with the interests of all \npeoples. It is being called for by all the \npeoples of our planet:\n41.\tHowever, we must note with considerable \nconcern that over the past year the situation in \nthe world has continued to deteriorate and is \nbecoming ever more explosive. A nuclear \ncatastrophe has become a serious and real threat. \nThe arms race is being stepped up. In practice, \ntalks on a number of issues have been \nparalyzed\u00f3issues which are so vitally important \nfor peace and security. Other issues have been \nmarking time for years.\n42.\tThe policy of sanctions and diktat is \nundermining international economic co-operation \nand having the most adverse effect on political \nrelations among States.\n43.\tThere still survive existing sources of \ntension. What is more, they are being exacerbated \nand becoming ever more dangerous to universal \npeace and new ones are constantly being added.\n44.\tIn the Middle East, the wounds inflicted \non Lebanon by a barbarous act of aggression are \nstill fresh. The world was shocked by the crimes \nof the ruling Tel Aviv circles. Such crimes would \nof course have been impossible without support \nfrom their powerful strategic ally. Flouting the \nCharter and United Nations resolutions, Israel \nhas destroyed thousands of innocent Lebanese and \nPalestinians. The height of shameless behavior by \nthese contemporary vandals was reached in the \nmass slaughter of defenseless women, children and \nthe elderly in Palestinian camps.\n45.\tI should like from this lofty rostrum to \nstate that the Government of the People's \nRepublic of Bulgaria and the entire Bulgarian \npeople most vigorously condemn what was nothing \nless than an act of genocide.\n46.\tThe racist regime in South Africa has \nbeen stepping up its aggressive action\u00df against \nneighbouring sovereign States. It is continuing \nillegally to occupy Namibia, the people of which, \nunder the leadership of the South West Africa \nPeople's Organization [SW/4PO], has for years now \nbeen valiantly fighting to exercise its right to \nse -determination and independence. Yet Pretoria \nand its protectors continue their efforts to \ncircumvent the decisions of the General Assembly \nand the Security Council and to link the question \nof Namibia's independence with pre-conditions \nwhich constitute flagrant interference in the \ninternal affairs of the sovereign State of Angola.\n47.\tTension s are growing in Latin America \nand in the Caribbean. Political and economic \npressure is being exerted upon Cuba, Nicaragua \nand other States, whilst threats to use military \nforce are being openly voiced.\n48.\tAn objective analysis of the facts \nconfirms unequivocally that this critical \nsituation in international relations has been \nbrought about by the actions of the most \nreactionary imperialist forces\u00f3primarily certain \ncircles in the United States. Having rejected the \npolicy of detente, they have embarked on a course \nof sharp acceleration of military preparations \nand over- armament, the aim of which is clear: to \nupset the approximate military and strategic \nbalance between the Soviet Union and the United \nStates and between the Warsaw Pact and the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization [M47Y3], and to \nachieve military superiority and hegemony on a \nglobal scale. In pursuit of their ambitions they \nare heading for an all-out confrontation with the \ncountries of the socialist community.\n49.\tThe use of force has always been an \nattribute of the policy of imperialism. \nCharacteristic features of its present \nmilitaristic course arc its markedly provocative \nnature, its growing aggressiveness and its \nincreasing reliance on nuclear weapons as an \ninstrument of policy. As a result of this, \ncertain concepts and doctrines are being \nofficially proclaimed which allow for the \npossibility of launching a \\\"first nuclear \nstrike\\\", waging a \\\"limited nuclear war\\\" or a \n\\\"protracted nuclear war\\\". These concepts and \ndoctrines are reflected in the large-scale \nprogrammes for the general strengthening of the \nmilitary might of the United States and NATO, for \na drastic build-up of strategic offensive weapons \nand of nuclear and conventional armaments. \nEveryone is aware of the plans to deploy United \nStates medium-range missiles in Europe. If those \nplans were to materialize, the threat of \noutbreak of a nuclear conflict would increase \nmany times over. Moreover, NATO's program for \nnuclear rearmament, which envisages increasing \nits arsenals by thousands of weapons, plus \nammunition, is also under way. New types of \nnuclear and other means of mass destruction, such \nas neutron and binary chemical weapons, are being \nmanufactured and space military systems are being \ndeveloped. Efforts are being made to drag States \nfrom various parts of the world into \nimperialism's orbit of military preparations.\n50.\tIn contradiction to agreements reached, \nto the Helsinki Final Act and the legal and moral \nnorms of inter state relations, there has been an \nintensification of crude attempts to interfere in \nthe domestic affairs of socialist countries and \nto create obstacles to their development. Those \nresponsible intend to use economic sanctions and \nrestrictions on trade with them.\n51.\tThe \\\"crusade\\\" against the countries of \nthe socialist community, as its initiators call \nit, includes psychological warfare, as well as \npolitical and material support for \ncounter-revolutionary and subversive acts; it has \nas its objective the destruction of socialism as \na socio-political system and ideology. History \nsince 1917 provides examples of a series of such \nplans. Their ill-fated end is well-known.\n52.\tThe hegemonistic actions of imperialism \nagainst the developing countries are being \nstepped up, especially against those countries \nwhich are fighting for their national and social \nliberation and are unwilling to succumb to \nforeign diktat, defending their right to \npolitical and economic independence against those \nwhich are rich in natural resources or are \nstrategically situated.\n53.\tIt is hard to find a region which the \nUnited States has not claimed as a sphere of its \n\\\"vital interests\\\", arrogating to itself the right \nto \\\"defend\\\" those \\\"interests\\\" by all possible \nmeans, including the use of force. We all know \nwho is maintaining tension in many parts of the \nworld by dispatching military armadas and rapid \ndeployment forces, by setting up military bases \nin close proximity to the borders of socialist \nand other democratic countries, We all know who \nis interfering in the internal aRairs of \nsovereign States and is supporting reactionary \nand dictatorial regimes in a number of countries.\n54.\tThis policy of seeking a position of \nstrength breeds an atmosphere of particular \ntension, impedes political, economic, cultural \nand other ties, strains relations among States \nand, in effect, poses a strong threat to world \npeace and security.\n55.\tThe outcome of the battle, however, can \nby no means be decided in favor of militarism and \nhegemonism. The threat of war is. real; yet war \nis not inevitable. Peace is threatened but is not \ndoomed. It can and must be preserved. There are \nforces in the world which are doing a great deal \nto stand up to the policy of aggression and are \nhonorably carrying out their peaceful mission in \nthe name of life and progress. The countries of \nthe socialist community are in the vanguard of \nthose forces. A significant role is being played \nby the majority of non-aligned countries and \nthose Western States which cherish peace and \nvalue the fruits of detente. This powerful front \nof peace relies on the will of all peoples to \nlive in peace, as evidenced by the \nunprecedentedly large-scale anti-war movement.\n56.\tTrue to their principled and consistent \nforeign policy, the People's Republic of Bulgaria \nand the other countries of the socialist \ncommunity are guided by their firm conviction \nthat there is no more vital task than that of \nguaranteeing the peaceful development of mankind. \nProceeding from this position they consider it \ntheir supreme duty to continue, through concerted \nand vigorous actions, doing everything possible \nin order to avert a nuclear war and to eliminate \neven the very threat of it. This means putting an \nend to the arms race and proceeding to real \ndisarmament in the field of nuclear and other \nweapons of mass destruction, as well as in the \nfield of conventional weapons; it means \nrestoring, continuing and deepening the process \nof detente; it means strengthening confidence \namong countries; it means consistent and patient \nconcerted efforts, through negotiations, to \nachieve a solution to the problems which \nundermine international security and to create a \npropitious climate for a direct dialogue between \nthe East and the West, to solve the problems of \ndeveloping countries and promote international \nrelations on the basis of the principles of \npeaceful coexistence among States of different \nsocial systems.\n57.\tEvidence of the readiness of the \nsocialist countries to work for the cause of \npeace and security is their initiatives and \nproposals.\n58.\tThis goal was served by the peace program \nof the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It \nwas served by the decision of the Soviet Union \nnot to be the first to use nuclear weapons. Were \nthe other nuclear Powers to assume the same \nobligation, that would in practice be tantamount \nto the banning of nuclear weapons and reducing to \na minimum the possibility of nuclear conflict. \nThat cause is further served by the proposal to \nconclude a world treaty on the non-use of force \nin international relations. It is also served by \nthe proposal that the governing bodies of NATO \nand the Warsaw Treaty make declarations to the \neffect that the spheres of operation of those \nalliances would not be extended to include Asia, \nAfrica and Latin America. It is served by the \nproposals put forward from this rostrum two days \nago to accelerate the elaboration and signing of \na treaty for the complete and general prohibition \nof nuclear-weapon tests, to declare a moratorium \non all nuclear explosions, including those for \npeaceful purposes and to declare the destruction \nof peaceful nuclear facilities, even by \nconventional weapons, as tantamount to an attack \nwith nuclear weapons. We support the inclusion of \nthese items in the agenda of this session of the \nGeneral Assembly.\n59.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria greatly \nappreciates the contribution made by the \ncountries of the non-aligned movement to the \nsolution of the acute problems facing the world \ntoday. We will continue to expand our \nco-operation with the non-aligned countries in \nthe struggle against imperialism, for the \nstrengthening of peace and security, for \ndisarmament and detente, for restructuring \ninternational economic relations on a just and \ndemocratic basis, for consolidating the \nindependence and sovereignty of the newly \nindependent States and for eradicating the last \nvestiges of colonialism, as well as those of \nneo-colonialism and apartheid.\n60.\tWe respect the positions of those Western \nstatesmen and heads of Government who are well \naware that a nuclear war, no matter how well its \nstrategists might plan it or by what name they \nmight call it, will recognize neither frontiers \nnor neutrality and that such a war would be sheer \nmadness and would mean the end of human \ncivilization. One concrete expression of \npolitical realism and common sense is the \nDeclaration on the Prevention of Nuclear \nCatastrophe adopted at the thirty-sixth session \nof the General Assembly, which emphasizes that \nStates and statesmen that would be the first to \nuse nuclear weapons would commit the gravest of \ncrimes against humanity.\n61.\tIt is our profound conviction that the \nsafeguarding of peace can and must be the \nconcern of all. Only through a steadfast struggle \nwith the united efforts and the concerted \ndecisive actions of all progressive forces which \npossess enormous potential, can peace be \nguaranteed on a lasting and reliable basis. As \nTodor Zhivkov, General Secretary of the Central \nCommittee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and \nPresident of the State Council of the People's \nRepublic of Bulgaria, recently stated:\n\\\"Nothing must prevent all parties, organizations, \nmovements and individuals conscious of how grave \na peril to mankind a nuclear war can be from \nfinding their place and playing a fitting role in \nthe struggle for peace and against the nuclear \nthreat.\\\"\n62.\tWe reaffirm our position that there is no \nother road to solving any international problem \nthan the road of negotiations. The 1970s have \nproved that, given the presence of goodwill and \nrealism and with strict respect for the principle \nof equality and the equal security of countries, \nit is possible, although not without difficulty, \nto reach important international agreements on \neven such extremely complex questions as the \nlimitation of strategic arms. Of course what I \nhave in mind are not talks that would serve to \nscreen the arms race, but rather a businesslike \nand frank dialogue that could lead to concrete \nand positive results. The People's Republic of \nBulgaria has always been in favor of such an \napproach, and it will continue to support it.\n63.\tSuch fundamental present-day issues as \npeace and security must always be approached with \na sense of high responsibility. My country is of \nthe opinion that negotiations currently under way \nshould be intensified so that they may achieve \nconcrete results, and it is our hope that the \nMadrid meeting will successfully complete its \nwork and adopt a decision to convene a conference \non confidence-building measures and disarmament \nin Europe. For this purpose a constructive \napproach on the part of all participating States \nis needed. The same holds true for the talks on \nthe reduction of armed forces and armaments in \nCentral Europe, and particularly for the Soviet- \nAmerican negotiations on limiting nuclear weapons \nin Europe and on limiting and reducing strategic \narms.\n64.\tIn our view, every possible effort should \nbe made to eliminate sources of tension. It is \nimperative to reach a comprehensive, just and \nlasting solution to the Middle East problem as \nsoon as humanly possible. It is our view that the \nplan put forward by Leonid Ilych Brezhnev, with \nwhich the basic provisions of the plan that \nemerged from the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference \nin Fez coincide, provides all necessary measures \nfor eliminating that dangerous hotbed of tension. \nThe People's Republic of Bulgaria supports the \nidea of convening an international conference on \na comprehensive settlement of the Middle East \nproblem, with the participation, on an equal \nfooting, of all the parties concerned, including \nthe PLO, the sole legitimate representative of \nthe Arab people of Palestine.\n65.\tWe have repeatedly called for an end to \nthe war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of \nIran and for solving the disputes between the two \ncountries through peaceful means.\n66.\tMy country reiterates its position of \nprinciple on the settlement of the Cyprus \nquestion in the interests of both the Greek \nCypriots and the Turkish Cypriots while \npreserving the independence, territorial integrity \nand the policy of non-alignment of the Republic \nof Cyprus.\n67.\tWe are in favor of granting full \nindependence to Namibia in compliance with the \ndecisions of the United Nations.\n68.\tThe vital interests of the peoples of \nSouth-East Asia require that we recognize \nexisting political realities, that an end be put \nto the interference by the imperialist and \nhegemonist forces in the internal affairs of \nthose peoples and that the attempts being made to \npit them against one another be brought to a \nhalt. What the peoples of the region need is \npeace, stability and co-operation. The \nconstructive proposals of the three countries of \nIndo-China\u00f3the socialist Republic of Vie' Nam, \nthe Lao People's Democratic Republic and the \nPeople's Republic of Kampuchea\u00f3are designed to \nachieve that very goal, and it is for that reason \nthat we fully support them.\n69.\tEfforts should be continued to turn the \nIndian Ocean into a zone of peace in accordance \nwith United Nations decisions.\n70.\tWe support the proposal of the Democratic \nPeople's Republic of Korea for the peaceful and \ndemocratic reunification of Korea.\n71.\tWith regard to the problem that has \narisen in the South Atlantic and which, its \nessence, is one of decolonization, in our view a \njust solution should be sought through \nnegotiations in accordance with the resolutions \nof the General Assembly.\n72.\tIn stressing the important role of the \nUnited Nations in the maintenance of peace and \nthe strengthening of security throughout the \nworld, we support the proposal of the \nSecretary-General f*n the convening of a meeting \nof the Security Council at the highest level to \nconsider ways and means of enhancing its \neffectiveness in the interests of attaining the \nobjectives of the Organization.\n73.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria has \nalways pursued and will continue to pursue a \npolicy of peace, mutual understanding and \nco-operation among all nations. By way of \nexample, I would mention the program of the \nTwelfth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party \nfor enhancing detente and promoting \ngood-neighborly relations in the Balkans, and \nalso the proposal of President Todor Zhivkov with \nregard to turning the Balkan peninsula into a \nnuclear-weapon- free zone, which is consonant \nwith the purposes of the United Nations.\n74.\tThe international situation urgently \ndemands active efforts and concrete actions from \nall of us to eliminate the nuclear threat halt \nthe arms race, extinguish hotbeds of tension, to \nguarantee international security and a tranquil \nfuture for the peoples, and to ensure peace \nthroughout the world. I wish to assure the \nAssembly that the People's Republic of Bulgaria \nwill continue to make its contribution to the \nefforts of the United Nations to ensure the \nachievement of these objectives.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for me to address my warmest \ncongratulations to Mr. Hollai, on my own behalf \nand on behalf of my delegation, and to express my \ngreat satisfaction that he is presiding over the \nthirty seventh session of the General Assembly. \nIn choosing him, the Assembly was inspired by his \ngreat qualities and his particularly outstanding \ndiplomatic career. The General Assembly is also \npaying a tribute thereby to the dynamic work done \nby his country, the People's Republic of Hungary, \nwithin the United Nations. My country has close \nrelations of friendship and cooperation with his \ncountry. It will thus be understood that the \ndelegation of Guinea Bissau fully associates \nitself with this confirmation by the General \nAssembly of his great abilities and his excellent \nknowledge of international affairs and is happy \nat the prospect of cooperating with him in \nseeking solutions to the many problems in \ninternational relations. I should like to express \nappreciation to Mr. Hollai's predecessor, Mr. \nKittani, for the dedication, wisdom and great \nability he has demonstrated in the past year. His \ntireless efforts and constant work in the United \nNations enabled us to achieve satisfactory \nresults in our struggle for peace during a \nparticularly turbulent period in international \nlife. I take this opportunity also, on behalf of \nmy country, the Republic of Guinea Bissau, to \ncongratulate Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar on his \nelection to the high office of Secretary General. \nI am the more happy to do so because this is the \nfirst time that I have spoken from this rostrum, \nand I should also like to express to him my great \nappreciation of the tremendous contribution he \nhas made to solving the many conflicts and \nproblems which threaten international peace and \nsecurity.\nI should also like to say to him that the \nGovernment of the Republic of Guinea Bissau \ngreatly appreciates the excellent report he has \nsubmitted to us. In our view, this report \nconstitutes a real innovation in that it \ncourageously and lucidly reflects the main \nconcerns of the international community as a \nwhole.\nThe Secretary General proposes in his report a \nconcrete and objective approach to improving the \nstructures and operation of the Organization and \nhe also suggests measures to strengthen the \nUnited Nations and to make it a truly universal \norganization in which all peoples and countries \nof the world without distinction will be able to \nplay their role in the struggle of mankind to \npreserve peace and development. The Government of \nthe Republic of Guinea Bissau will make every \neffort to help in the attainment of these \nobjectives. This session of the Assembly is \ntaking place at a particularly tense time. \nViolence, war, disdain for the principles set \nforth in the Charter, systematic violation of the \nmost basic rules governing international \nrelations, the genocide of thousands of human \nbeings and considerable material damage, as well \nas innumerable other problems, provide a \nthreatening background to our debate. In this \nHall we have heard the echoes of the world's \noutrage at the atrocities committed in Lebanon by \nthe Israeli army. The international community has \nexpressed its feelings of absolute revulsion at \nthe massacre of Palestinian refugees in the Sabra \nand Shatila camps. The General Assembly, in \ndevoting an emergency special session to those \ntragic events, which are a grim reminder of the \ndarkest days of modem history, wished thus to \nexpress its outrage and to condemn this barbarous \naction and the authors of it. Israel, in allowing \nthe massacre of thousands of Palestinian refugees \nand creating the conditions whereby that shameful \nact of genocide could take place, made itself \nanswerable to international public opinion for \none of the most odious crimes against humanity. \nThe invasion of Lebanon and the mass bombings of \nwest Beirut clearly showed the world that Israel, \nin its craze for power, was capable of the worst \naggression to establish a climate of terror in \nthe region and remove the Arabs once and for all \nfrom their land. But Israel should have learned \nthe lessons of history, quiterecent history. The \nsuffering imposed on the heroic Palestinian \npeople, far from weakening them, has shown their \ntrue strength, courage, determination and \npolitical maturity. It is political maturity \nwhich, without any doubt, confirms the \nrepresentativeness of the PLO as a national \nliberation movement which embodies the profound \naspirations of the fraternal Palestinian people \nas a whole and guides their fight for freedom. I \nshould like to pay a glowing tribute to the \nleadership of the PLO, and particularly to its \nChairman, Yasser Arafat, for the courage, \nvitality and irrepressible determination which \nthey have demonstrated in their struggle in the \nface of the institutionalized terrorism of the \nState of Israel and despite the disproportion in \nthe methods used by the two sides. The people and \nGovernment of Guinea Bissau reaffirm their \nunwavering solidarity with and total support for \nthe fraternal Palestinian people in their \nlegitimate struggle for the exercise of their \nnational rights, including their inalienable \nright to exist and to create their own State. \nRecognition of Namibia's right to independence, \nwhich we have been demanding for many years and \nfor which the Namibian people, under the \nleadership of SWAPO, their sole legitimate \nrepresentative have made innumerable sacrifices, \nhas once again been jeopardized by the delaying \ntactics of the racist regime of South Africa. It \nis high time that the authors of the United \nNations plan for the settlement of the Namibian \nproblem reacted more forcefully to the \nMachiavellian policies of Pretoria, which wishes \nto keep Namibia indefinitely dependent on South \nAfrica. The Namibian people, Africa, will never \naccept a constitutional system which would \nperpetuate the existence of a puppet \nadministration acting in the economic and \ngeopolitical interests of the racist apartheid \nregime. This must be understood and remembered. \nPretoria's intransigence and its manifest \ndetermination to wreck the plan for the \nsettlement of the Namibian question, thus \njeopardizing the principles of Security Council \nresolution 435 (1978), should lead its allies to \nbe realistic and recognize that a moribund \ncolonialist regime can never guarantee their long \nterm interests. The insecurity in which the \nracist regime of South Africa maintains the \nsouthern pail of the African continent and its \nrepeated acts of aggression against the People's \nRepublic of Angola, the People's Republic of \nMozambique and the other frontline States must \nlead the international community to shoulder its \nresponsibilities more effectively and pay greater \nattention to the war which persists in the \nPeople's Republic of Angola because of the \noccupation of part of its territory by the racist \napartheid regime. It is wrong and even dangerous \nto think that this is an innocuous problem, \nbecause it is in fact the People's Republic of \nAngola that is bearing the brunt of the \ncommitment although it was made by all the States \nMembers of the United Nations to give the \nnecessary aid to the SWAPO fighters in their just \nstruggle for the independence and dignity of the \nNamibian people. It is also tolerable to see \ncertain countries trying to link the question of \nNamibian independence to the presence of \ninternationalist Cuban troops in the People's \nRepublic of Angola. Such an attitude constitutes \nin reality interference in the internal affairs \nof a sovereign State and is contrary to the right \nof every State freely to choose its \nsociopolitical system and to determine in full \nsovereignty its domestic and foreign policy. The \nheads of State of African countries where \nPortuguese is spoken rejected this approach to \nthe problem at their last summit meeting, in \nPraia, in September, and declared their \nunwavering solidarity with the Namibian people \nand the Angolan and Mozambican peoples in their \njust struggle to preserve their national \nindependence and defend the sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of their States. That \nmeeting also provided the Republic of Guinea \nBissau with an opportunity to reiterate, along \nwith the other fraternal participants, its total \nsupport for the fighters of the ANC in their \nheroic struggle to ensure respect for the most \nelementary human rights and for the establishment \nof a democratic regime in the Republic of South \nAfrica. The complete liberation of Africa is a \nprerequisite for its development. This is why \nindependent African States as a whole have \nundertaken to make their contribution to the \ncomplete decolonization of Africa. The \nOrganization of African Unity has since its \ncreation always provided a political framework \nfor this historic commitment. Most African \nStates, today Members of the United Nations, \nderived the political strength necessary for \nensuring victory in their national liberation \nstruggles from the cardinal principles of the OAU \ncharter, which its members are determined to \nrespect scrupulously. This explains the \npolitical, material and diplomatic support which \nthey have enjoyed from the States members of that \ncontinental African organization. The present \ndifficulties facing the OAU derive from the \nimperative need for all independent African \nStates to show by their actions the commitment \nthat they have entered into to struggle against \nall forms of domination and to support the \nstruggle of all peoples for self determination \nand independence. Guinea Bissau is in favour of \nthe emancipation of peoples and supports their \nnational liberation struggle because we intend to \nremain faithful to the commitments we have freely \nentered into, the very basis of the Organization \nthat we all belong to. The right of peoples to \nself determination, recognized by the \ninternational community as a whole, remains the \nguiding principle of our foreign policy. In \nrecognizing the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic \nand in supporting its legitimate struggle for the \nrecognition of its sovereignty, we are guided by \nUnited Nations principles and decisions and \nacting with the strictest respect for the ideals \nof the founders of the OAU. The African peoples, \nin their struggle to regain their rightful place \nin the concert of nations and recognition of the \nrole they can play in international affairs, have \nacquired the political maturity to settle their \nown problems for themselves. In our view, the \ncurrent problems of the OAU are serious but not \ninsurmountable. The African States are aware of \nthe need to preserve their continental \norganization, which, despite many obstacles, has \nmanaged to deep its unitary character and to \nmobilize its energies to achieve the noble \nobjectives of national liberation and of \ndevelopment. We believe that with the good will \nof all its members the OAU will be able to find a \nsolution to its current difficulties, a solution \nthat is based on the principles set forth in its \ncharter and takes into account the higher \ninterests of African peoples. I am convinced that \nthose principles will guide the efforts by the \nOAU Mediation Committee to find a peaceful \nsolution to the disputes between some OAU \nmembers. I should like to speak also about the \nsituation prevailing in the Horn of Africa, where \nthe OAU and the international community must take \nurgent action to create a climate propitious to \nnegotiations between the parties to the conflict. \nMy country has always believed in negotiations as \na means to the peaceful settlement of disputes \nbetween States. That is why we urge the \nGovernments of the Comoros and France to continue \ntheir efforts to find a swift solution to the \nproblem of Mayotte and thus enable it to rejoin \nthe Comoros. Similarly, we support the efforts by \nthe Democratic People's Republic of Korea to \nensure the peaceful reunification of the Korean \nhomeland and we call on the international \ncommunity to create a climate propitious to the \nnegotiations that are indispensable in that \nregard. We have repeatedly expressed our deep \nconcern over the tragic situation in East Timor, \nwhich was thoroughly analysed at the latest \nsummit meeting of Portuguese speaking heads of \nState. We must note today that, despite the \ncommitments entered into by the United Nations to \nrestore the usurped rights of the Maubere people, \nno progress has been made since the thirty sixth \nsession of the General Assembly. The Maubere \npeople continues to suffer from the horrors of \noppression and the annexation of their national \nterritory by the Indonesian occupying forces. The \nSecurity Council, immediately following the \nIndonesian aggression, unequivocally condemned \nthat action, which was contrary to the principles \nset forth in the Charter and to the rules of \ninternational law, and it remains seized of this \nquestion, which can be solved only with strict \nrespect for the right of the Maubere people to \nself determination and independence, in \naccordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 \n(XV). Thus the Republic of Guinea Bissau welcomes \nthe statement by the Government of Portugal\u2014the \nadministering Power of East Timor\u2014 that it will \ndo all it can to ensure that this objective is \nachieved; indeed, the whole international \ncommunity should join in this. We reiterate our \nunwavering solidarity with the Maubere people in \ntheir just struggle, led by their vanguard \nmovement, FRETILIN, the Frente Revolucionario de \nTimor Leste Independente. Despite renewed efforts \nby the Secretary General and the international \ncommunity to find a negotiated settlement to the \nproblem of Cyprus, no real result has yet been \nobtained. We therefore once again express our \nconcern over the persistence of this problem and \nour hope that urgent action will be taken to \nbring the positions closer together and to enable \nthe Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus to \nlive together in peace, understanding and harmony \nand to safeguard the independence, the \nterritorial integrity and the nonaligned \ncharacter of Cyprus. Nonalignment, as the \nAssembly knows, is the comers tone of the foreign \npolicy of the Republic of Guinea Bissau. My \nGovernment therefore supports the efforts of the \nnonaligned movement to present its unity and \ncohesion, the only way to ensure its ability to \ntake action to promote the maintenance of \nnational peace and security. We thus feel it \nnecessary, taking into account the particularly \nserious international political situation today, \nto reaffirm the fundamental principles of the \npolicy of nonalignment, especially the principles \nof nonintervention and peaceful settlement of \ndisputes. In this context we therefore repeat our \nappeal to our brothers in Iraq and the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran to find a negotiated settlement \nto the dispute between them, in the interest of \ntheir respective peoples, of the Organization of \nthe Islamic Conference, of the nonaligned \nmovement and of the international community as a \nwhole. The many conflicts and tensions that have \nbeen mentioned here could certainly be avoided or \nsettled if the various members of the \ninternational community implemented the \nfundamental principles of noninterference in the \ninternal affairs of States, nonintervention and \npeaceful settlement of disputes. The situation in \nSouth East and South West Asia is of great \nconcern to Guinea Bissau. In our opinion it is \nessential, in order to preserve peace and \nstability in those regions, to begin a process of \nnegotiations where the spirit of understanding \nand the interest of the peoples concerned prevail \nand thus to create the atmosphere indispensable \nto the exercise by each people of those regions \nof the right freely to decide its future and to \nsafeguard its sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity, free from outside interference. In our \nopinion, there should be the same approach to \ninternational relations in regard to the \nsituation in Central America and the Caribbean. \nThe current crisis in international relations is \nto a large extent the result of the continuing \natmosphere of distrust among States and the \nfrenzied arms race and its consequences and \nlogical implications, such as the increase in \nmilitarized areas, in military bases, and in the \nproduction and the acquisition of increasingly \nsophisticated and destructive weapons. It is \nclear that the final, comprehensive solution to \nthe problems of disarmament, enabling us to do \naway with the serious threats hanging over the \nworld, cannot depend on only a few members of the \ninternational community, however powerful they \nmay be economically and militarily on the world \nscene. We believe, along with the overwhelming \nmajority of the international community, that the \ndesired solution can come only through concerted \naction by all the countries of the world. The \nworsening of the world economic crisis is the \nlogical result of structural disparities and of \nthe continuing inequality and inequity in \ninternational economic relations. The spirit of \nmultilateral economic cooperation, which in the \nfirst decades after the Second World War was one \nof the great hopes of the international \ncommunity, and of the developing countries in \nparticular, is today seriously weakened. It is \nclear that this tendency is contrary to the \nobjectives set forth in the Declaration and the \nProgramme of Action on the Establishment of a New \nInternational Economic Order and in the \nInternational Development Strategy for the Third \nUnited Nations Development Decade his phenomenon \nhas serious consequences such as cronic deficits \nin the balance of payments of the developing \ncountries and the continuing deterioration in \nterms of trade. The limits and the difficulties \nwith regard access by third world countries to \ninternational financial markets and to the \nrequired technology, the increasing constraints \nplaced on financial and technical aid are \nadditional problems facing the developing \ncountries. The use of concepts such as \ngradualism, selectivity and differentiation by \nthe developed countries in trade relations with \nthe developing ones constitutes an obstacle to \nthe promotion of the economic development of the \nlatter and further complicates the payment of \nexternal debt servicing and the meeting of import \nneeds in food, energy and manufactured products. \nIn this context therefore there is an imperative \nneed, both for the developing countries and for \nthe industrialized countries, that the process of \nglobal negotiations be made more dynamic. The \nRepublic of Guinea Bissau, which belongs to the \ngroup of least developed countries, is not spared \nthe harmful effects of the present international \neconomic situation. The new policy of development \nadvocated by our Government is intended primarily \nto reduce such effects by using all international \nand external means available to promote the \ndevelopment of all the economic sectors, \nparticularly agriculture, and to promote \ndiversification and an increase in production so \nas to ensure food self sufficiency The imbalance \nin Guinea Bissau's balance of payments, the \nincrease in its foreign debt, heavy inflation, \nthe consequences of the constant increase in the \nprice of manufactured goods and fuel, the fall in \nthe prices of its exports as a result of the \ndeterioration of the terms of trade and its \nincreased dependence on foreign aid are major \nproblems facing Guinea Bissau and they justify \nthe measures taken by the Government within its \nnational development strategy. In that framework, \na programme for economic and financial \nstabilization has been drawn up, arrangements \nalso having been made for the holding of a \nconference of prime lenders during the first half \nof 1983 aimed at encouraging implementation of a \nfour year socioeconomic development plan. The \ninternational community through its agencies and \ninstruments must shoulder its responsibilities \nwith regard to the deterioration in the world \neconomic situation and the constant increase in \ninequalities between the developed and the \ndeveloping countries, in order to ensure the \nenjoyment by all peoples of the right to \ndevelopment. Interdependence among the nations of \nthe world makes this an important step, one \ncalling for the struggle of humanity as a whole \nto preserve its common values. It is in that \ncontext that we include the concept of mankind's \ncommon heritage, developed during the Third \nUnited Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, \nand appreciate the adoption by a large majority \nof the international community of the Convention \non the Law of the Sea which formally establishes \nan international legal order and defines, among \nothers, the regime of the high seas, oceans and \nsea beds. We hope that all countries will join in \nthe signing of the Convention when it is opened \nfor signature this year in Jamaica, thus \nconferring upon that important legal instrument \nits universal scope. These are the few points \nthat it wanted to make at this time. The agenda \nshows once again, by the number and relevance of \nits items, the gravity of the international \nsituation. I cannot mention every item. However, \nthe scope of the debate held since the beginning \nof our deliberations clearly states the \ndetermination of States Members of the United \nNations to help solve them all. The measures \nadvocated are many, as are the means available to \nus to preserve international peace and security. \nWe must just work together to achieve results. In \naddressing the Assembly every year, we bring with \nus the determination of the Government of the \nRepublic of Guinea Bissau to work tirelessly to \nseek solutions to the problems affecting \ninternational relations. Thus, we should once \nagain like to express our firm conviction that \nthe survival and progress of humanity depend on \nthe efforts that the States Members of the United \nNations will make to implement the decisions \ntaken by the Organization and on their commitment \nto respect the principles set forth in the \nCharter to which they voluntarily subscribed.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, Sir, I should like to con\u00acgratulate \nyou on your election to the presidency of the \nthirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\nWe hope that the current session will be crowned \nwith success under your presidency. I also wish \nto thank Mr. Kittani for his contribution as \nPresident of the thirty-sixth session.\n76.\tOn this occasion each year we gather here \nto review major world issues of the day. We are \nall concerned about the changes in the world \nsituation as a whole and we all follow the \ndevelopments in various countries. Before I \nproceed to elaborate on China's views on current \nworld affairs, I would like to say something \nabout a recent event of major importance in the \npolitical life of the Chinese people.\n77.\tAs representatives know, the Communist \nParty of China held its Twelfth National Congress \nin Bering earlier last month. This Congress was \nan important milestone in the history of the \nPeople'  Republic of China. It summed up our \nexperience in achieving great successes over the \npast six years. A grand program for China's \nsocialist modernization was put forward and new \ncentral leading bodies of the party were elected. \nChina now enjoys political stability and unity \nand its economy is growing steadily. It has \nentered a new era in its efforts to create a new \nsituation in all fields of socialist \nmodernization. Under the leadership of the \nCommunist Party, the Chinese people are \ndetermined to make gigantic efforts on the basis \nof self-reliance in order to achieve, step by \nstep, modernization in industry, agriculture, \nnational defense and science and technology \nbefore the turn of the century and transform \nChina into a culturally advanced and highly \ndemocratic socialist country. We intend to blaze \na path of our own and build socialism with \nChinese characteristics. We know that this is \ngoing to be an arduous task and will be no plain \nsailing. But we are fully confident of achieving \nour goal and of the bright future of our country.\n78.\tIn his report to the Twelfth National \nCongress of the Communist Party of China, the \nGeneral Secretary of the Central Committee, \nComrade Hu Yaobang, has given a comprehensive and \nprofound explanation of China's foreign policy. \nWe adhere to an independent foreign policy. In \ndeveloping relations with other coun\u00actries, we \nare always guided by the five principles, namely, \nmutual respect for sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity, mutual non-aggression, \nnon-interference in each other's internal \naffairs, equality and mutual benefit, and \npeaceful coexistence. More particularly, we will \nunite with countries of the third world and join \nhands with all other countries and forces working \nfor peace to combat hegemonism and maintain world \npeace.\n79.\tOur independent foreign policy proceeds \nfrom the fundamental interests of the people of \nChina and the world as a whole. The founding of \nthe People's Republic of China has removed the \nsocial causes of China's submission to foreign \naggression and those of any possibility that \nChina might commit aggression abroad. In the 33 \nyears of the People's Republic, we have shown by \ndeeds that China never attaches itself to any big \nPower or group of Powers, nor yields to pressure \nfrom any big Power. We Chinese people cherish our \nown independence and sovereign rights, which we \nwon only after protracted struggles. We are \nfirmly opposed to hegemonism. At the same time, \nwe declare to the whole world that under no \ncircumstances will China seek hegemony.\n80.\t8C. In our international relations we \nhave always abided by the five principles of \npeaceful coexistence. Conforming to these \nprinciples, our Government has established \nco-operative relations of peace and friendship \nwith a great number of coun\u00actries in the past \nthree decades and more, and settled many boundary \nquestions and other issues left over from \nhistory. In the future we will continue to be \nready to solve outstanding issues in our \nrelations with some countries on the basis of the \nsame principles. The Chinese Government is \nwilling to develop normal relations with any \ncountry as long as it truly respects China's independence, \nsovereignty and territorial integrity, abides by \nthe principles of equality, mutual benefit and \nmutual respect, and demonstrates by actual deeds \nrather than hollow words that it is not hostile \nto China and does not threaten China's security.\n81.\tOur modernization program is based on the \nprinciple of independence and self-reliance. At \nthe same time, we will continue to adhere firmly \nto our policy of opening to the outside world. We \nare ready to develop trade ties, economic \nco-operation and scientific-technological \nexchanges with all countries on the basis of \nequality and mutual benefit.\n82.\tThe people of all countries eagerly \ndesire peace. China's modernization program can \nbe realized only in an international environment \nof enduring peace and stability. In the common \ninterests of the people of the world, we are \nready to work together with all peace-loving \ncountries and peoples for the main\u00actenance of \nworld peace and international security and for \nthe advancement of the cause of human progress.\n83.\tThere are many pressing issues of \nuniversal concern on the agenda. Allow me to \nstate here the basic position and views of the \nChinese delegation.\n84.\tFirst, on the question of maintaining \nworld peace and international security. The \ninternational scene is far from being relaxed, \nbut has become more turbulent and tense during \nthe past year. While wars of aggression against \nKampuchea and Afghanistan have not ceased in \nAsia, naked and savage aggression against the \nLebanese and Palestinian peoples has been going \non without let-up in the Middle East. In southern \nAfrica, the racists are wantonly carrying on \nbrutal repression, military occupation and armed \nprovocations. In Latin America, outside \nintervention has exacerbated the turmoil in the \nCaribbean region. Even the hitherto relatively \ncalm South Atlantic has witnessed a war of the \nstrong bullying the weak. Wrangling over the \ndeployment of intermediate- range nuclear weapons \nhave intensified the military confrontation in \nEurope. Faced with a continued economic \nrecession, the developed countries are trying \nhard to shift the consequences of their economic \ncrises on to others. This has badly hurt the \ndevel\u00acoping countries and added to their economic \nwoes. Stalemate on the question of global \nnegotiations has seriously hampered the \nimprovement of North- South relations. \nDisarmament is another issue of universal \nconcern. Here again, no progress could be made, \nowing to the intensified arms race between the \nsuper-Powers. The recent second special session \non disarmament has been a disappointment. In \nshort, while the hitherto unresolved old issues \nof the world have become more complicated, new \nproblems keep cropping up on the horizon. One \ncannot but feel bravely concerned and disturbed \nabout the present international situation.\n85.\tThe menace to the peace and security of \nthe world today originates mainly from \nimperialism, hegemonism and colonialism. The \nquest for hegemony by the super-Powers and the \nresultant global rivalry between them are the \nmain source of the unrest and turmoil in the \nworld. In their contention for spheres of \ninfluence and world supremacy, the super-Powers \nhave accelerated the expansion of their armaments \nand stepped up their strategic deployment. They \nhave openly or covertly subjected other countries \nto their aggression, intervention or control by \ndirect or indirect use or threat of force. While \nthe focus of their global strategies remains in \nEurope, the developments in recent years indicate \nthat the main sphere of con\u00actention between the \nsuper-Powers is in the third world. This fierce \nrivalry has constantly rocked the world and \nincreased the danger of a world war. Therefore, \nthe overriding task of the people of the world is \nto combat hegemonism and maintain international \npeace. The heroic struggles waged by the peoples \nof Afghanistan, Kampuchea and southern Africa and \nby the Arab people against aggression demonstrate \nthat the people can, by means of unremitting \nstruggle, upset the super-Powers' strategic plans \nand land the aggressors in deeper and deeper difficulties. \nWe are convinced that so long as the people of \nthe world are truly united and wage resolute \nstruggles, world peace can be preserved.\n86.\tSecondly, on the question of safeguarding \nthe independence and the right to existence of \nnations. Word peace and security can be \nmaintained only if the rights to independence and \nexistence of nations are firmly safeguarded. \nThese two aspects cannot be separated. The \nquestion of Afghanistan and the question of \nKampuchea have not yet been settled and have \nagain been included in the agenda of the current \nsession. This is because the Soviet Union and \nSoviet-supported Viet Nam have continued to \nsubject Afghanistan and Kampuchea under their \nrespective military occupation and refused thus \nfar to withdraw their aggressor troops there from.\n87.\tNot long ago, the three Kampuchean \npatriotic forces resisting Vietnamese aggression \nagreed among themselves and formed the Coalition \nGovernment of Democratic Kampuchea headed by \nPrince Norodom Sihanouk. This Government enjoys \nthe support of the Kampuchean people as well as \ninternational recog\u00acnition and endorsement. This \nis an encouraging major development in the \nKampuchean situation. The Kam\u00acpuchean people have \npersevered and won important victories in their \nwar of resistance against Vietnamese aggression, \nthus landing the aggressors in a deepening \nquagmire. In order to extricate itself from this \npredicament, Hanoi has resorted to trickeries. It \nhas launched a new \\\"peace offensive\\\" designed to \nsoften and divide the international forces \nopposing Viet\u00acnamese aggression against \nKampuchea. Viet Nam is the aggressor in Kampuchea \nand the menace to the peace and security of \nSouth-East Asia, and yet it has fabricated a \nso-called China \\\"threat\\\" in an attempt to divert \npublic attention and spread confusion. But this \nis completely futile. The five countries of ASEAN \nand the great majority of the States Members of \nthe United Nations emphatically call for the \nimplemen\u00actation of the relevant resolutions of \nthe General Assembly and the Declaration of the \nInternational Conference on Kampuchea,  which \ndemand the total withdrawal of Viet Nam's \naggressor troops from Kampuchea so that the \nKampuchean people may build a peaceful \ndemocratic, neutral and non-aligned State of \nnational union free from any outside \ninterference. This demand is fully justified. \nSince the question of Kampuchea has resulted from \nViet Nam's armed aggression, there can be no \ngenuine settlement of this question until Viet \nNam withdraws all its aggressor troops from \nKampuchea. Any \\\"political solution\\\" that accepts \nthe status quo created by Viet Nam's aggression \nat the expense of Kampuchea's independence and \nsovereignty would be contrary to the Charter of \nthe United Nations and the norms of international \nrelations and, therefore, are inadmissible.\n88.\tThe same applies to the question of \nAfghanistan. The Afghan people have not been \ncowed by their formidable enemy, but have fought \nvaliantly under the sacred banner of safeguarding \ntheir national inde\u00acpendence and have frustrated \nthe aggressors' cherished plan of bringing the \nwar to a quick conclusion. Soviet armed \naggression against Afghanistan constitutes a \ngross violation of the Charter of the United \nNations and a grave threat to peace in Asia and \nthe world. None of the pretexts put forward by \nthe Soviet Union to justify its continued \npresence in Afghanistan is tenable. We maintain \nthat the resolutions adopted at three consecutive \nsessions of the General Assembly calling for the \nwithdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan \nmust be strictly implemented. The Soviet Union \nmust unconditionally pull out all its troops from \nAfghanistan. The Afghan people should be allowed \nto determine their own destiny free from any \noutside interference. Afghanistan must regain the \nstatus of an independent and non-aligned State. \nThat is the only feasible way to settle the \nquestion of Afghanistan.\n89.\tThe situation in Lebanon has aroused \nserious world-wide concern during the last few \nmonths. How the Lebanese situation and the \nPalestinian question are treated involves respect \nfor a State's independence, sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity and recognition of a \nnation's rights to existence and \nself-determination. This is also a question \nbearing on peace in the Middle East and \ninternational security as a whole. The Israeli \naggressors have flagrantly invaded and occupied \nlarge tracts of Lebanese territory and attempted \nto wipe out the Palestinian revolutionary armed \nforces. They perfidiously entered Beirut again \nand savagely massacred Palestinian and Lebanese \ncivilians. The United States cannot shirk its \nresponsibility for this since it has always \nshielded and abetted the Israeli aggressors. \nChina joins all other countries in voicing strong \ncondemnation of the acts of aggression and the \ninhuman atrocities committed by the Israeli \nauthorities. We firmly support the Palestinian, \nLeba\u00acnese and other Arab peoples in their \nstruggle against Israeli aggression and expansion.\n90.\tThe question of Palestine is at the core \nof the Middle East issue. Although the \nPalestinian people have suffered a temporary \nsetback, their forces will never be wiped out \nbecause they are fighting for a just cause. The \nPLO is recognized by more than 100 coun\u00actries as \nthe sole legitimate representative of the \nPales\u00actinian people. Any proposal or formula \ndesigned to exclude the PLO from the settlement \nof the Middle East question would be wrong and \nunworkable. The plan put forward at the Twelfth \nArab Summit Confer\u00acence, held recently in Fez, \nprovides a good basis for a fair and reasonable \nsettlement of the questions of Palestine and the \nMiddle East. In our view, to achieve peace in the \nMiddle East, Israel must evacuate the Arab \nterritories it has occupied since 1967, including \n.Jerusalem; the Pales\u00actinian people must regain \ntheir national rights, including the right to \nreturn to their homeland, the right to \nself-determination and the right to establish \ntheir own State; and the rights to independence \nand existence of all countries in the Middle East \nshould be respected.\n91.\tThe most urgent task now is to stop \nIsrael's aggression against Lebanon. The United \nNations and all the countries and peoples that \ncherish peace and uphold justice should act \npromptly and take effective measures to compel \nIsrael to withdraw all its troops from Lebanon \nimmediately and unconditionally.\n92.\tIn southern Africa, with the backing and \ncon\u00acnivance of a super-Power, the South African \nauthorities have intensified their racist \npolicies. They have continued their illegal \noccupation of Namibia and made repeated armed \nprovocations against and military incursions into \nneighbouring countries, thereby posing a direct \nthreat to the security and stability of the \nregion. People are deeply concerned about the \nsituation in southern Africa and, in particular, \nabout the inde\u00acpendence of Namibia, which will \naffect the historical process of the final \nliberation of the entire African continent. We \nmaintain that, in accordance with the relevant \nresolutions of the United Nations, Namibia should \nimmediately achieve genuine national independence \non the basis of territorial integrity and \nnational unity; South Africa's apartheid system \nshould be completely abolished; and the \ninternational community should apply effective \ncomprehensive sanctions against the South African \nauthorities. The Chinese people firmly support \n-the just struggle of the African people, \nparticularly the Namibian and South African \npeople, until they win final victory,\n93.\tThe military conflict over the Malvinas \nIslands earlier this year also aroused general \nconcern. The question of the Malvinas Islands \nremains unsolved despite the termination of the \nwar. It is a reminder that although the cause of \nnational liberation has won great victories \nthroughout the world in the post-war period, the \nprocess of decolonization has not yet been \ncompleted. We support the request of Argentina \nand other Latin American countries for \nconsideration of the question of the Malvinas \nIslands at the current session of the General \nAssembly. Argentina's claim to sovereignty over \nthe Malvinas Islands should be respected by the international \ncommunity. Together with other third-world \ncountries, we sincerely hope that the parties \nconcerned will seek a just and reason\u00acable \nsolution to this question by peaceful \nnegotiations.\n94.\tI would now say a few words about the \nKorean question. The Democratic People's Republic \nof Korea has made important contributions towards \na reason\u00acable settlement of the Korean question \nand the maintenance of peace in East Asia and the \nPacific region. The Chinese Government firmly \nsupports the positive proposals put forward by \nthe Government of the Democratic People's \nRepublic of Korea for the independent and \npeaceful reunification of Korea. We firmly \nsupport President Kim 11 Sung's proposal for \nestablishing a democratic confederal republic of \nKoryo. We always hold that in order to achieve a \npeaceful settlement of the Korean question the \n\\\"United Nations Command\\\" must be dissolved \nimmediately in accordance with resolution 3390 B \n(XXX) adopted at the thirtieth session of the \nGeneral Assembly, all United States military \nforces must be withdrawn from South Korea, and \nthe Korean Armistice Agreement should be replaced \nby a peace agreement through negotiations between \nthe parties concerned.\n95.\tThirdly, I turn to the subject of the \neconomy and development of the third-world \ncountries. At present, many third-world countries \nare faced with deepening economic difficulties. \nCertain m or developed countries have tried to \nshift their own economic difficulties onto the \nthird-world countries and have cut back their \ndevelopment assistance, thus further straining \nNorth-South economic relations. The developing \ncountries have pressed for the launch\u00acing of \nglobal negotiations with a view to improving \nNorth-South relations and establishing a new \ninter\u00acnational economic order. The General \nAssembly has long since adopted a resolution \npertaining to this question and the Group of 77 \nhas also put forward a reasonable draft \nresolution. AH this has provided a constructive \nbasis for launching global negotiations as soon \nas possible. The Inter\u00acnational Meeting on \nCo-operation and Development, which held at \nCancun in October 1981, gave expres\u00acsion to the \ncommon desire of the great majority of nations \nfor the launching of global negotiations. At the \nmeeting, Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang gave clear- \ncut support to the demand of the third world for \nthe establishment of a new international economic \norder. Owing to obstruction by a major Power, no \nagreement on the launching of global negotiations \nhas yet been reached. This state of affairs has \ncaused deep disap\u00acpointment and resentment among \ndeveloping coun\u00actries and also among quite a few \ndeveloped countries.\n96.\tThe international community faces the \nimportant task of improving North-South economic \nrelations through global negotiations. The \neconomies of all countries are closely \ninterrelated. The developed countries cannot \nachieve economic growth without the rich \nresources, vast markets and economic prosperity \nof the developing countries. All countries, \nwhether rich or poor, North or South, must abide \nby the principle of equality and mutual benefit \nif they are to carry out fruitful economic \nexchanges and co-oper\u00acation. The existing \nunreasonable, unfair and outdated international \neconomic order must be restructured. The \ndeveloped countries' economic aid to the \ndevel\u00acoping countries conforms to their own \ninterest and is by no means charity. This has \nbeen recognized by more and more far-sighted \npeople in the West. We hope that at the current \nsession the Assembly will surmount obstacles and \nmake real progress towards the launching of \nglobal negotiations.\n97.\tWhile striving to improve North-South \nrelations, the third-world countries also exert \ngreat efforts to promote \\\"South-South\\\" \nco-operation among them\u00acselves. The developing \ncountries have industrious people, rich natural \nresources and a vast market.\nthey share the common objective of developing \ntheir national economies. There are unlimited \npotentials for developing inner-third-world \nco-operation. This will be highly beneficial. \nThis kind of co-operation is an important means \nfor the developing countries to strengthen their \nself-reliance both individually and collectively. \nIt also has the vital strategic role of help\u00acing \nto break down the existing inequitable \ninternational economic relationship and replace \nit with a new inter\u00acnational economic order.\n98.\tThe restructuring of the old \ninternational economic order is a demand of the \ntimes which the third-world countries are bound \nto raise after they have won political \nindependence. Political independence cannot be \nconsolidated or sustained without economic \nindependence. Regardless of all the obstructions \nfrom imperialism and hegemonism, the third-world \ncountries will persist in the just struggle to \nrestructure the old international economic order \nuntil final victory.\n99.\tThe emergence of the third world in the \ninter\u00acnational arena after the Second World War \nis an event of primary importance of our time. In \nrecent years the numerous countries of the third \nworld, united in a common struggle, have \neffectively defended their national independence \nand State sovereignty and made major \ncontributions towards restructuring the old \ninternational economic order as well as \nmaintaining international peace and security. \nTheir joint struggle has, to a great extent, \nchanged the situation in which the super-Powers \ncould arbitrarily manipulate the destiny of the \nworld. Events show that unity means strength. We \nare convinced that so long as we third-world \ncountries can seek a reasonable settlement of our \nown differences and disputes through peaceful \nconsultations in a spirit of mutual understanding \nand accommodation and of seeking common ground \nwhile reserving the differences, and so long as \nwe can close our ranks and work for our common \ncause, we will be better able to control our own \ndestiny and promote the progress of world \nhistory. As a member of the third world, China \nwill continue to play its part by further \nexpanding its friendly co-operation with other \nthird-world countries and peoples.\n100.\tFaced with increasing troubles and \nturmoil on the world scene, one is entitled to \nexpect that the United Nations will uphold \njustice and play a greater role in maintaining \nworld peace and inter\u00acnational security and in \npromoting the  growth of the world economy. \nHowever, events over a period of time indicate \nthat the role of the United Nations has been \neroding. This is chiefly because certain \ncountries have abused their veto power, bypassed \nthe United Nations on a number of issues or \nrefused to implement its resolutions.\n101.\tIn his report on the work of the \nOrganization, the Secretary-General has pointed \nto the problems and difficulties confronting the \nUnited Nations and has made some suggestions to \nuphold the principles of the Charter which merit \nour consideration. We appreciate and support the \nefforts of the Secretary- General and also hope \nthat certain permanent members of the Security \nCouncil will show a more co-operative approach. \nWe believe that, provided the over\u00acwhelming \nmajority of the Member States make com\u00acmon \nefforts to uphold the Charter and wage a resolute \nstruggle against any force that jeopardizes world \npeace and international security, the \nOrganization will not disappoint the people of \nthe world, but will perform its noble duty of \nmaintaining world peace and pro\u00acmoting human \nprogress, thereby fulfilling the historic mission \nentrusted to it.\n"

        "file_text": "  Sir, I would ask you to transmit to Mr. Hollai, \nPresident of the General Assembly, the greetings \nof my country, together with our best wishes for \ncomplete success in the conduct of the work of \nthis session of the General Assembly, a success \nassured by his prestige and experience in the \nOrganization. I also greet the Secretary-Genera), \nwho comes from our Latin American region, elected \nlast December to the elevated responsibility that \nthe international community has entrusted to him, \nfor the furtherance of peace and the \nstrengthening of the United Nations. I also wish \nto place on record our profound gratitude to and \npraise for Mr. Kittani, the esteemed President of \nthe thirty-sixth session. His efforts during the \nprolonged work of the thirty- sixth session will \nalways be recalled as an example of selfless \ndevotion to the cause of the United Nations.\n138.\tWorld problems have worsened considerably \nin the midst of an atmosphere laden with growing \ntension, constant collective insecurity, \naggressions that are neither punished nor stopped \nand an acute inter\u00acnational economic crisis. The \nworld panorama has darkened over the past year as \na result of the dangers that confront peace, \nwhile the measures adopted by the Organization to \nalleviate this state of tension and insecurity \nhave not brought about the expected results. The \nrealization of the noble purposes of the United \nNations has, as at no time before, eluded the \nreach of the peoples, who anxiously contemplate \nthe permanent weakening of the resolutions of the \nGeneral Assembly and the non-implementation of \nthe decisions of the Security Council. Let us \nrecall that mankind put its trust and its hope in \nthe United Nations in order to for save \nsucceeding generations from the scourge of \nwarfare . If the Organization shows itself \nineffectual in attaining that objective, the \nperspectives will become increasingly distressing.\n139.\tFor that reason, Ecuador urgently appeals \nto the Governments of Member States, and \nprin\u00accipally to the great Powers, to act in \ncompliance with their responsibilities and \ndisplay the political will needed to give \nsubstance to the measures adopted by the \nOrganization. That political will is an essential \nrequirement for the restoration of a climate of \ninter\u00acnational understanding and the removal of \nthe dangers that loom over the future of mankind.\n140.\tTo face up to those perspectives, Ecuador \ncomes to this new session to reaffirm its \nposition of adherence to the basic principles of \nits international policy, outstanding among which \nare those relating to the sovereign equality of \nStates, non-intervention, the rejection of the \nthreat or use of force in international \nrelations, the non-recognition of territorial \nconquests obtained by force, the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes, international \nco-operation, respect for human rights, and the \nrejection of racial discrimination, apartheid, \ncolonialism and neo colonialism.\n141.\tThe joint declarations of the President \nof Ecuador and the Presidents of Brazil, \nVenezuela and Colombia on the occasion of the \nvisits made in the course of 1982 by the \nEcuadorian President to those brother countries, \nas well as the declaration signed by nine heads \nof State from Latin America and Spain on the \noccasion of the recent transfer of power in \nColom\u00acbia, reaffirm adherence to those principles \nand indicate the guidelines of Ecuador's \ninternational  policy.\n142.\tIn the firm belief that peace is possible \nonly through the observance of those fundamental \nprin\u00acciples of the legal system of the United \nNations, Ecuador continues to call for the \nimmediate withdrawal of foreign forces from \nterritories that do not belong to them, in \nAfghanistan as well as in Lebanon and all of the \nMiddle East, and in Cyprus, Kampuchea, Namibia or \nany other territory where forces of occupa\u00action \nare to be found.\n143.\tEcuador has condemned the aggression \nagainst Lebanon as well as the execrable \nmassacres of hun\u00acdreds of Palestinians that \nrecently occurred in west Beirut, and it has \nrequested that an appropriate investi\u00acgation be \nmade in order to determine responsibilities. It \nhas demanded the immediate withdrawal of the \ninvading forces as well as the cessation of \nhostilities in order to put an end to the loss of \nhuman lives and the destruction of that martyred \ncountry. The Lebanese people must remain free \nfrom any foreign interference so that they may \ndecide their own destiny in a sovereign and \ndemocratic manner and so that their intrinsic and \ninalienable right to live in peace is respected. \nSimilarly, Ecuador reiterates the basic need to \nfind a solution to the problem of the Palestinian \npeople, who have the right to establish \nthemselves in their own territory, a right to \nself-determination and a right to participate on \nan equal footing with the other countries of the \nregion in international negotia\u00actions aimed at \nfinding a just, definitive and compre\u00achensive \nsolution to this serious situation.\n144. In this respect, Ecuador has considered with \ninterest the new proposals aimed at the full \nrecognition of the basic rights of the \nPalestinian people and the need to give effect to \nUnited Nations decisions, particularly those of \nthe Security Council. In fact, and in accordance \nwith the latter, the search for practical \nmeasures that would meet the just claims of the \nPalestinians and reaffirm respect for the \nsovereignty, political independence and \nterritorial integrity of all States in the region \ncontinues to be the urgent aim of the \ninternational community in the Middle East.\n145.\tEcuador lives within a democratic system \nwith full respect for human rights and \nfundamental freedoms as laid down in its \nConstitution and in relevant international \ninstruments. My country upholds the need for \nuniversal respect for human rights without the \nselectivity as to their violations that leads to \ncovering up in certain regions what is criticized \nin others. It also maintains that it is proper \nfor each State member of the international \ncommunity to report of its own accord and in such \ninternational forums as this on the observance of \nthose rights within their borders.\n146.\tIn this regard, the Constitutional \nPresident of Ecuador, Mr. Osvaldo Hurtado, stated \nat the opening of the session of the Ecuadorian \nParliament this year that\nfor ... the Government has scrupulously respected \npublic freedoms in such a manner that it can \nproudly report that in the course of the past \nyear no act tending to limit them has occurred. \nThe political parties, the trade unions, the \nchambers of commerce and the information media \nhave been given the widest guaranty\u2019s for the \nexercise of their activities.\n147.\tThe Charter of Conduct signed at Riobamba \nin 1980 by the Presidents of the countries of the \nAndean Group, as well as Panama, Costa Rica and \nSpaing reaffirms the commitment by which respect \nfor human, political, economic and social rights \nconstitutes a fundamental norm for the internal \nconduct of States, and notes that joint action in \nthe defense of such rights does not violate the \nprinciple of non-interven\u00action. It also \nreiterates the need to promote the settle\u00acment of \ndisputes among the countries of the Andean Group, \nor between them and third parties, by peaceful \nmeans, and it provides for a subregional and \nregional process which, inspired by the premises \ncontained in the 1974 Ayacucho Declaration/for \nconstitutes an effective contribution to general \nand complete disarm\u00acament and thus makes it \npossible to release resources for economic and \nsocial development.\n148.\tThe multiple world problems and the \ndisputes of every kind that exist in various \nregions, including those of a territorial \ncharacter, seriously affect world peace and \nsecurity and are consequently of interest to the \ncommunity of nations.\n149.\tIn the specific case of the American \ncontinent, the territorial problems that sail \nexist in Central and South America which, we \ncould assert, involve almost all States of the \nregion, hamper the co-ordination of an \ninternational policy that would make it possible \nto attend to a)l existing problems and to obtain \nthe co-operation required to solve them.\n150.\tThere exists a serious territorial \nproblem between Ecuador and Peru, dating back to \nthe time when our peoples acceded to independent \nlife. The problem was aggravated when, by force \nand by the occupation of Ecuadorian territory, \nthe Protocol of Rio de Janeiro  was imposed on \nus, By virtue of which Ecuador was deprived of \nthe Amazonian territories to which my country is \nentitled in accordance with unimpeachable legal \ntitles.\n151.\tEcuador has always advocated and will not \ncease to seek a peaceful and honorable solution \nof justice and equity to that problem, one that \nrecognizes its Amazonian rights. That is why it \nrenews from this rostrum its invitation to Peru \nt& lend its loyal and effective participation to \nestablishing as soon as possible the climate \nindispensable for understanding between the two \ncountries and for the initiation, as soon as such \na design is consolidated, of negotiations aimed \nat the earliest and definitive solution of the \ndispute that separates them, without conditions \nthat might prejudge the results of the \nnegotiations and with the assistance of the \ncountries that are most closely linked to the \npreservation of peace and the search for harmony \nbetween the parties. This neces\u00acsary atmosphere \nfor negotiation has been seriously disturbed by \nthe warlike events of January and Feb\u00acruary 1981 \nand by other later incidents, but the full \nre-establishment of such an atmosphere is \nhampered above all by the acts of appropriation \nof the territories under dispute that Peru has \nsince that time been intensifying and by which it \nis attempting to pass off the territorial dispute \nit maintains with Ecuador as having been resolved \nin favor of its own unilateral pretensions.\n152.\tAs a result, I reiterate the reservation \nthat Ecuador expressed before the Assembly at the \n31st meeting of the thirty-sixth session with \nregard to its rights of territorial sovereignty \nover the undefined border zone extending to the \neast of the Condor Range to the effect that \nwhatever acts and works Peru may have carried \nout, as well as those it is currently undertaking \nand those it may undertake in future, in no case \nwill Ecuador agree to the sitting of the \nlandmarks that Peru claims in that Range, which \nis not mentioned as a border line in any \ninstrument between the two countries, not even in \nthe so-called Rio Protocol that was imposed upon \nEcuador in 1942 after the armed invasion of 1941 \nand under conditions that included the occupation \nof part of its territory.\n153.\tAs a country of the Amazon region, \nEcuador fulfils its role under the Treaty of \nAmazonian Co-oper\u00acation among the eight countries \nwhose territory makes up the water basin of the \ngreat river that was discov\u00acered by the \nexpedition organized in the sixteenth century \nfrom Guayaquil and Quito.\n154.\tBecause of its vocation for peace, \nEcuador has supported all disarmament resolutions \nat past sessions of the General Assembly, in \nparticular those resolu\u00actions calling for nuclear \ndisarmament and for the prohibition of nuclear \ntests. We must reiterate our total condemnation \nof the unbridled arms race\u2014if only because of a \nbasic instinct for the preservation of human life \non our planet, which belongs as much to the \nnon-nuclear as to the nuclear countries. We have \nsupported resolutions calling for the \nreallocation of the astronomical sums spent for \nmilitary purposes worldwide to be used for the \ndevelopment of the poor countries, a development \nwhich is essential for the establishment of the \nnew international economic order. In that \nconnection, we have enthusiastically supported \nthe inclusion in the agenda of the additional \nitem concerning the relationship between \ndisarmament and development.\n155.\tOn the other hand, we deplore the lack of \npolitical will on the part of the great Powers, \nwhich prevented the General Assembly at the \nsecond special session devoted to disarmament \nfrom even ratifying the points agreed on during \nthe first such special session.\n156.\tThere are, of course, other important \nfactors that have to be taken into account in the \nmaintenance of peace and the promotion of the \nintegral development of nations, such as the \nelimination of economic aggression and of theillegal \nexploitation of natural resources belonging to \nother peoples, the changing of unfair terms of \ntrade, and the elimination of all kinds of \ncoercive measures.\n157.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Law \nof the Sea highlighted the evolution of one \naspect of international law, which began 30 years \nago with the Santiago Declaration, in which \nEcuador, Chile and Peru proclaimed sovereignty \nand jurisdiction over the sea along their coasts \nto a distance of 200 miles. That legal position \nhas become universal. The new law of the sea \nrecognizes wide-ranging and specific rights of \nsovereignty of the coastal States over the \nnatural resources in the adjacent waters, on the \nsea-bed and in the subsoil thereof in that \n200-mile zone. The recognition that the sea-bed \nbeyond the limits of national jurisdiction \nconstitutes the common heritage of mankind is \nalso an irreversible victory. Much has been \ngained. But further progress is necessary to \nachieve definitive protection of all the rights \nof peo\u00acples which, like that of Ecuador, have \nbeen exercising their rights over their seas \nwithout violating any of the norms of \ninternational law.\n158.\tSimilarly, in the face of the \nunacceptable claim by the space Powers that it is \nthe right of the first occupant to place \nsatellites in geostationary orbit, Ecuador has \nmaintained that the special rights of the \nequatorial countries must be recognized for the \nbenefit of the developing world and in view of \nthe determina\u00action to keep outer space an area of \npeace and co-oper\u00acation for scientific and \ntechnical progress in the service of all mankind, \nand especially the developing countries, was \nreaffirmed in the Declaration of Equatorial \nStates, which met at Quito in April of this year. \nEcuador will continue to maintain that position.\n159.\tDisarmament is closely linked with the \npeaceful settlement of international disputes, \nwhich is an element essential to understanding \namong countries and the strengthening of world \npeace and security. In every forum of which it is \na member\u2014international, regional and \nsubregional\u2014Ecuador advocates peaceful \nsettlement. All disputes between States, both \npresent and future, must be settled solely by \npeaceful means, without interference and without \nanything being imposed from outside. We therefore \nmaintain that the United Nations must redouble \nits efforts in this regard.\n160.\tOur country has accordingly supported the \ndraft Manila Declaration on the Peaceful \nSettlement of International Disputes,  designed \nto strengthen and make more effective the system \nof the peaceful settle\u00acment of disputes between \nStates, in accordance with an initiative, in \nwhich Ecuador took part from the beginning, in \nthe Special Committee on the Charter of the \nUnited Nations and on the Strengthening of the \nRole of the Organization. We have also pointed \nout the advisability of establishing a body \nempowered to co-operate with the parties to a \ndispute in the search for a peaceful settlement \nat the request of any of them, so that full use \nmay thus be made of the possibilities afforded by \nthe Charter for that purpose.\n161.\tAmong the increasingly important forums \nin which Ecuador participates is the non-aligned \nmove\u00acment, which it joined over a year ago, \nalthough it had endorsed the principles and \npolicies of the movement ever since the Belgrade \nmeeting of 1961, because of our wishes for the \nconsolidation of peace and inter\u00acnational \nco-operation, in accordance with Ecuador's \nforeign policy, which is independent, and free \nfrom any influence, with respect for ideological \npluralism, and seeks to maintain friendly \nrelations with all coun\u00actries. For the sake of \nadequately coordinating the foreign policies of \ncountries with the greatest historical, political \nand cultural affinities, the President of Ecuador \nhas proposed that the Foreign Ministers of the \nLatin American countries join together in a \ncom\u00acmittee on co-ordination, which would be an \nessential step in strengthening Latin American \nunity and soli\u00acdarity. At the subregional level, \nEcuador is an active participant in the \nintegration process among the Andean countries \nwhich are parties to the Cartagena Agreement.\n162.\tThe International Development Strategy \nwas conceived in response to the new approach of \na world of co-operation, and to promote a new \nstage of global economic growth which would \nbenefit all and which would accentuate the \nactivities and benefits of peace in relation to \nthe many development tasks which involve the \nfulfillment of the world's needs in the fields of \neducation, health, housing, productivity, sources \nof energy, transport and communications. \nConsequently, Ecuador trusts that, in the \nAssembly, the political will which is \nindispensable for the pro\u00acgress of the global \nnegotiations will be forthcoming form the \nindustrialized countries and that a system of \nworld economic relations will be arrived at \nreflecting the principles of equity, sovereignty, \nequality, inter\u00acdependence and co-operation among \nStates that are the basis of the new \ninternational economic order. We cannot watch \nwith indifference the increasingly serious \nbroadening of the gaps that separate the  poor \ncoun\u00actries from the rich countries, with respect \nto access to the sources of capital and to \nmarkets, and to the transfer of technology, while \ninflation and unemploy\u00acment afflict the whole \ninternational community, the harshest effects \nbeing felt by the weakest.\n163.\tThe Charter of Economic Rights and Duties \nof States must be effectively implemented in \norder to establish just and equitable bases for \ninternational economic relations. To that end it \nis also necessary to revitalize the Economic and \nSocial Council, a principal organ of the United \nNations, where the crucial questions of our time \nshould be debated. The Council should contribute \nto consolidating and making more coherent the \nwhole system of specialized agen\u00accies, \ndevelopment funds and operative programmes \ncreated and consolidated over the past three \ndecades. It must also follow up the resolutions \nof the General Assembly as well as those of the \nCouncil itself and of its Commissions. This \ncovers the major part of the work of the United \nNations, since 80 per cent of the activities of \nthe system are in the economic and social fields.\n164.\tIn this respect, it is appropriate to \nmention that the Committee on Information, \ncreated by the Assembly, has succeeded in \nadopting by an admirable and encouraging \nconsensus 42 recommendations [see <4/37/2/, para. \n9/], which we hope the General Assembly will \nendorse. They include an appeal to the powerful \nworld communications media to back up the efforts \nof the international community to ensure global \ndevelopment, and in particular the efforts of the \ndeveloping countries to achieve their own \neconomic, social and cultural development.\n165.\tWhile the global negotiations are going \non, Member States will have to prepare plans and \nprojects, as well as train personnel, with the \nsupport of oper\u00acational programmes such as UNDP, \nwhose charac\u00acteristics of universality, \nformulation of programmes by Governments and \nfinancing by voluntary contributions as well as \nits 32 years' experience all combine to make it \nthe ideal instrument to meet the real needs of \nworld development. That is why its activities \nmust be trebled, which is possible if the major \ncountries respond to the General Assembly's \nappeals to increase their con\u00actributions by 14 \nper cent. Ecuador, for its part, has done so. The \ndeveloping countries have made a significant \nincrease in their contributions, and there is \ngrowing South-South co-operation in the economic \nand technical fields. The world multilateral \nsystem of technical co-operation and \npre-investment is the most commendable, because \nof its political independence, its objectivity, \nits flexibility and its experience. We reject any \nattempt to orient it towards the governing of the \nprogrammes of some States by others, which would \nbe intolerable.\n166.\tTogether with technical co-operation and \npre- investment, which link the transfer of \ntechnology with economic development, from \ninvestment to productivity, trade must be an \ninstrument of justice between countries, through \nagreement on equitable prices and theelimination \nof discriminatory barriers. It is also necessary \nto stress the multilateral process of trading, \nbecause this contributes to the preservation of \nthe independence of peoples and prevents the \nanachronistic exploitation and dependence which \noften accompany bilateral aid. All this must \ncontinue to be considered in international \nforums, so that exports from developing countries \nmay earn a fair remuneration and maintain sources \nof employment for the inhabitants of those \ncountries. It is to be hoped that the forthcoming \nsession of UNCTAD will result in new approaches, \nunderstandings and decisions which will ensure \nthe dynamics of development for the countries of \nthe third world.\n167.\tAlthough Ecuador is not a contracting \nparty to GATT, it has always been interested in \nits activities, since GATT's main objective is \nthe reduction of barriers to international trade \nand the preparation of rules which will enable it \nto be regulated according to equitable and just \nterms. However, GATT has not yet succeeded in \nsolving the problems which affect the trade of \nthe developing countries, such as quantita\u00active \nrestrictions and the increased protectionist \nmeasures which are applied to the products of \nwhich the developing countries are major \nexporters.\n168.\tWe have expressed our concern about the \nsuggested ways of differentiating between \ndeveloping countries in granting preferential \ntreatment, since the concept of graduation, which \nthe countries granting the preferences seek to \nintroduce, is incompatible with the basic norms \nof the generalized system of preferences. Ecuador \nhas spoken of the advisability of examining a \nsystem of safeguards under conditions and on the \nbasis of criteria that are mutually agreed and \nare supplemented by a multilateral mechanism of \ncontrol and monitoring. The forthcoming GATT \nministerial meeting will be an opportunity to \nreach concrete agreements which may allow GATT to \nachieve its essential objective of the attainment \nof shared benefits.\n169.\tA regrettable, anachronistic colonial \ncase arose this year in the South Atlantic\u2014that \nof the Malvinas Islands, where an \nextra-continental Power mounted a \ndisproportionate punitive expedition, with the \nsupport of other great Powers, to deny the \nArgen\u00actine Republic's right of sovereignty. \nEcuador, which maintained its anti-colonialist \nposition before, during and after that warlike \nepisode, has rejected the use of force and has \nrecalled that the principle of uti possidetis \njuris of 1810 is the basis, of the territorial \nreality of the American countries which gained \nindependence from the Spanish Crown. Ecuador has \nreaffirmed its adherence to the Declaration on \nthe Granting of Independence to Colonial \nCountries and Peoples, adopted as General \nAssembly resolution 1514 (XV), paragraph 6 of \nwhich clearly states:\nAny attempt aimed at the partial or total \ndis\u00acruption of the national unity and the \nterritorial integrity of a country is \nincompatible with the pur\u00acposes and principles of \nthe Charter of the United Nations.\nIt should not be forgotten that the islands are \nlocated on the continental shelf of Argentina and \nwithin the security zone established by the \nInter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance.\n170.\tThere is a dispute, and it must be solved \nby diplomatic means. In this connection, Ecuador \nsupported the request for the inclusion of the \nquestion of the Malvinas as an additional item in \nthe agenda of the present session submitted by 20 \nForeign Ministers of Latin American countries and \nHaiti so that negotiations between the Argentine \nRepublic and the United Kingdom may be carried \nout within the framework of the United Nations \nand as soon as possible.\n171.\tThat historic Treaty strengthens the \nvigorous unity of the Latin American peoples, \nfounding mem\u00acbers of the United Nations and heirs \nto an ancient juridical tradition which has \nstrengthened interna\u00actional law and contributed \nsignificantly to the forma\u00action of the United \nNations and of various regional organizations, as \nthey themselves have acknowledged.\n172.\tBecause our country owes to the Liberator, Simon Bolivar, the \nculmination of its political inde\u00acpendence and \nthe defense of its territorial integrity, the \nPresident of Ecuador has proclaimed as the Year \nof the Bicentenary of the Liberator the period \nfrom 24 July 1982 to 24 July 1983, at which time \nthe bicentenary of this great world figure of \nfreedom and international understanding will be \ncelebrated. Ecuador, together with the other \nBolivarian countries, that is, the Andean Group \nand Panama, will co-operate fully in the \nwell-deserved tribute to be paid within the \nUnited Nations to the universal thinking of \nBolivar.\n173.\tWhen in 1822 Bolivar, as President of \nColombia, proposed to the Governments of Buenos \nAires, Chile, Mexico and Peru that they should \nconstitute an assembly of confederated countries, \nhe envisioned that this would lay the legal \nfoundation between the American Republics and \nwould come to serve as a counsel in common \ndangers, a faithful interpreter of public \ntreaties whenever difficulties arise and, \nfinally, as a conciliator of our deferences .\n174.\tThese are additional reasons, revitalized \nthrough the San Francisco Charter, upon which \nEcuador relies to reiterate its full trust in the \nUnited Nations and to urge it once again to \nintensify its efforts to attain the purposes and \nobjectives of the greatest legal instrument of \nour time.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I am pleased to join in the expressions of pleasure at \nyour election. Your brilliant record makes you well qualified to \noccupy your lofty post and skilfully to conduct our complex \nproceedings. I am also very pleased that a Latin American has been \ncalled upon to be the Secretary-General. His fame is well earned. His \nelection not only crowns a life devoted to the common good and to \nharmony among nations but also heralds a new current sweeping through \nLatin America which suggests that the people of our area will play a \nmore fruitful, vigorous, Imaginative and co-operative part \nrepresented in world affairs, particularly in the United Nations. \nWhat the Secretary-General has accomplished in a short time is new \nand encouraging. His report on the work of the Organization speaks \ndirectly of matters of high importance with clarity and precision, \nand it contains sharp, frank and very valuable observations.\nThe leadership provided by the Secretary-General goes precisely in \nthe direction that my Government feels the United Nations should move \nin. In order to restore much of the faith in the Organization which \nhas been lost, especially that of the common man of the Member \nStates, the United Nations must participate more directly and in a \nmore decisive and inventive manner in order to prevent serious \nconflicts and to resolve them when the violence which has been \nunleashed requires that we reiterate in a dramatic manner the \ncommitment to peace with States made when they signed the Charter.\nViolence makes it impossible to achieve peace by means of persuasion, \ngood offices and mediation. Member States must make a special effort, \nbased on good faith and corresponding deeds, to see that the \nmachinery provided by the Charter is used to prevent and resolve \nconflicts. Moreover, they have a duty to; do so, a legal and moral \nduty. Repeated failure to respect the purposes of the Charter only \ncauses profound disenchantment with the United Nations at precisely \nthe time when action by the Organization is needed to moderate the \nconduct of its Members. Those Members seen to be in the grip of \natavistic forces that have stigmatized the twentieth century. But the \ntwentieth century should be remembered as one of the most significant \ncenturies in the history of mankind because of its dazzling \nachievements, which should be used to move man forward in the \nconstant, ceaseless effort to reach a higher level and to live in \npeace.\nMy Government is aware, of course, of the difficulties which stand in \nthe way of the achievement of this goal, especially at the present \ntime, which is dominated by exacerbated nationalism instead of by the \nnoble, visionary, universalist purposes and principles of the United \nNations. There can be no doubt that each and every one of us must \nmake an effort, an outstanding effort, to halt the devastating wave \nof violence which has shaken the world, in spite of the existence of \nan impressive system of international organizations, the center of \nwhich is the United Nations, devoted to the promotion of \ninternational harmony.\nTo some extent the peoples of the world are being deceived when they \ndisregard the United Nations in the frontal assault on war, guerrilla \nwarfare, terrorism, torture and foreign intervention in the internal \naffairs of States. Also, the peoples of the world are in fact being \nthwarted when the United Nations is not allowed to stop repression of \ndemocratic movements which seek changes in unjust economic and social \nstructures by peaceful electoral methods.\nViolations of human rights, violations of civil, political, economic, \nsocial and cultural rights must receive priority attention by the \nUnited Nations. More vigorous action is needed, for we have gone \nbeyond the stage of mere declarations which proclaim and define those \nrights and now an effort must be made, realistically and with a keen \nsense of urgency, to perfect and put into practice the international \ninstruments which have been created to promote the fundamental \nfreedoms of every person everywhere.\nIn this connection it is fitting to stress one of the most impressive \nof the revolutions that have occurred in the past three decades, but \none which has gone largely unnoticed by the majority of the peoples \nof the world. I am referring, of course, to the fact that it has \nfinally been recognized that the individual is a subject of \ninternational public law and can resort to the appropriate \njurisdictional bodies on human rights when domestic means of \nprotection have been exhausted, do not exist, or have serious \nimperfections. Within the United Nations, the Human Rights Committee \nmust be strengthened and, above all, the Optional Protocol to the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must be \nratified. Both instruments must be signed and ratified by all Members \nof the United Nations, because that would benefit the man in the \nstreet in all nations and be a victory of far-reaching consequences.\nThe average citizen of the nations represented here trusts the good \njudgment of those who govern to ensure the well-being to which he is \nentitled, but which he may not obtain because he is not aware of the \nnew machinery which could be used and cannot bring pressure to bear \non his Government to abide by the commitments entered into when it \nsigned the Charter. Human rights were not in the Charter, then the \nOrganization of United Nations, it should be remembered, are \nindissolubly linked, their primary characteristic, which makes it \ndifferent from any other organization created before 1945 and which \nmakes it possible for it to fight against the scourge of war.\nWe must take a similar stand on other international instruments \nrelating to the protection of human rights, such as the International \nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, \nin particular\tand also the procedures used by the Commission on \nHuman Rights, of which Costa Rica is a member, must be improved. The \nCommission must be freed from political interests and influences \nwhich all too frequently disrupt and even obstruct its work and \nthereby prejudice the interests of the thousands of individuals who \nlook to that body as a last resort to protect them from arbitrary \naction by their rulers.\nThe Government of Costa Rica applauds the decision to convert the \nDivision on Human Rights into a Centre and we think that this is a \ndecision that reflects a desire better to protect and defend all \nfreedoms by perfecting existing instruments and designing new ones on \nthe basis of experience. For example, before assuming my present post \nI had the honor of being appointed by the Commission on Human Rights \nand by the Secretary-General to act on two recent occasions in an \nAfrican country as rapporteur and as an expert, respectively, while \ncollaborating with the Government in the improvement of institutions \nprotecting fundamental freedoms after that country had suffered under \na cruel dictatorship. Fortunately, very positive results were \nachieved. I mention this because it makes it quite clear that the \nCommission can find new courses of action to carry out its important \ntask and because this sheds new light on Costa Rica's initiative as \nregards the creation of the post of United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Human Rights. Experience has shown that when United Nations \nprocedures are particularly flexible and diverse in carrying out its \nessential mandate to promote and protect human rights those rights \ncan be better protected and more people understand what the \nOrganization is for and what it is all about. People also then feel \nencouraged and cope more vigorously and perseveringly with adversity, \nanguish, humiliation and the kind of pain that they experience on a \ndaily basis as they strive to ensure that those that govern them \nrespect their dignity.\nOf course all human rights are important. Without them international \npeace is an illusion. At the moment, however, I want to refer to the \nright to vote, the right to work and the right to life. And I want to \nmake a general comment on economic and social rights, which also play \na major role in the important task of creating a community of nations \nmore free from tension and combating the present erosion of efforts \nin support of peace.\nThe right to vote ensures the right to political participation in all \nareas at all levels. It makes it possible for the people of the world \nto be the true forgers of their destiny instead of this being done by \nminority cliques and those that have seized power and the \nrepresentation of the majorities on the pretext of the alleged \ninability of those that know what is best for the development of the \npersonality of the nation and how to contribute intelligently to the \ncommon well- being. The right to vote for government. By means of the \nvote the right to self-determination, embodied by the United Nations \nin a number of most important documents, is exercised.\nFor this purpose nothing can replace free periodical and fair \nelections. The use of violence, such as terrorism and guerrilla \nwarfare, can certainly not replace the right to vote. The former is a \nblot on modem society, although it has a long history. Among some \ntotalitarian forces there is a tendency to exalt terrorism as a means \nof social struggle. But fortunately, mankind has reacted vigorously \nagainst any justification of this kind of political and social \naction. Mankind supports instead a democratic struggle for the \ndignity of all human beings and particularly those that have been \nexcluded from the productive mainstream of society. We must take \nadvantage of this healthy universal reaction to perfect national and \ninternational juridical means of dealing with this very serious \nthreat to peace. The latter, guerrilla warfare, which also has a long \nhistory, has become a very important factor nowadays. There is \nsometimes a great deal of ambivalence about guerrilla warfare. When \nit is a question of peoples exercising their right to rebellion, it \nis often a last resort in defending their fundamental freedoms. On \nthe other hand, when the right to vote is a possibility and when \nthere are other ways of ensuring the smooth functioning of democracy, \nguerrilla warfare appears to be a totalitarian weapon which disrupts \nsociety in a profound and often irreparable manner. It is thus an \nally of anarchy which destroys any effort to bring about the common \ngood.\nTherefore, in order to replace bullets by votes, it was decided, at \nthe meeting of Foreign Ministers on 4 October in San Jose, Costa \nRica, to create a body to promote and advise on the subject of \ndemocratic elections, the purpose of which would be to ensure an \nelectoral system throughout the continent, promote and foster this \nprocess in the Americas and provide advice on the practice of the \nsystem to countries requesting it.\nThe recent tragic events relating to the courageous trade union, \nSolidarity, in Poland have aroused world public opinion regarding the \nsubject of the right to work. Costa Rica believes that the United \nNations should promote days of study on work and other rights related \nto it, such as the freedom to create trade unions independent of \nGovernments. My Government suggests that the United Nations arrange a \nseminar with high-level participation to consider in depth the \nadmirable encyclical of His Holiness Pope John Paul II as a \ncontribution to peace. The encyclical will arouse the awareness of \nthe peoples and may ensure that Governments reach appropriate \ndecisions which will mitigate the tension that leads to social \ninjustice and endangers peace. In the hope that this idea of a \nseminar will be accepted by the United Nations, the Government of \nCosta Rica takes this opportunity of offering its capital as the \nheadquarters.\nWe should bear in mind the basic thinking of His Holiness, or at \nleast this essential part: in particular, makes possible pluralist \nparticipation in the choice \\\"Commitment to justice must be closely \nlinked with commitment to peace in the modem world.\\\"\nThis is linked to the role of work and the worker in the quest for peace:\n\\\"... human work is a key, probably the essential key, to the whole \nsocial question, if we try to see that question really from the point \nof view of man's good. And if the solution-or rather, the gradual \nsolution-of the social question, which keeps coming up and becomes \never more complex, must be sought in the direction of 'making life \nmore human', then the key, namely human work, acquires fundamental \nand decisive importance.\\\"\nFurthermore, another cardinal principle enunciated by John Paul II \nshould also be stressed here-the ethical value of work\n\\\"which clearly and directly remains linked to the fact that the one \nwho carries it out is a person, a conscious and free subject, that is \nto say, a subject who decides about himself.\\\"\nAnd here the Pope of the workers pauses to emphasize the subjective \ndimension of work, rising from its dignity:\n\\\"... the basis for determining the value of human work is not \nprimarily the kind of work being done, but the fact that the one who \nis doing it is a person.\\\"\n114. Equally enlightening are some other thoughts which I shall now \nsum up. First, rejection of \\\"materialistic and economistic thought\\\", \nwhich equates work with goods and is the source of unheard of, \ninhumane exploitation, even today, when the concept of capitalism at \nany cost has been tempered. Hence, a different approach must be \nadopted-one which comprehends the working man:\n\\\"... in accordance with the true dignity of his work-that is to \nsay,... as subject and maker, and, for this very reason, as the true \npurpose of the whole process of production.\\\"\nSecondly, the strengthening of worker solidarity, not only because \nthere are many different kinds of work and because there are still \nmany injustices which derive from the liberal socio-political system, \nbut also because:\n\\\"On the world level, the development of civilization and of \ncommunications has made possible a more complete diagnosis of the \nliving and working conditions of man globally, but it has also \nrevealed other forms of injustice, much more extensive than those \nwhich in the last century stimulated unity between workers for \nparticular solidarity in the working world. This is true in countries \nwhich have completed a certain process of industrial revolution. It \nis also true in countries where the main working milieu continues to \nbe agriculture or other similar occupations.\\\"\nThirdly, work, at the same time as it promotes a hierarchy of duties, is:\n\\\"... a source of rights on the part of the worker. These rights must \nbe examined in the broad context of human rights as a whole, which \nare connatural with man.\\\" His Holiness also defends the right to \nassociation for the defense of the vital interests of \\\"those employed \nin the various professions\\\".\nThe right to life, furthermore, has aroused and continues to arouse \nconsiderable polemics in all countries, in regard to the question of \nthe death penalty. The United Nations has not remained on the \nsidelines of that important discussion, as is shown by the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In order to \nshed new light on the subject of capital punishment and to link it, \nas it must be linked, to the struggle for the protection of \nfundamental human rights, the Government of Costa Rica has convened a \nworld congress to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the \nabolition of the death penalty in Costa Rica. My Government and the \npeople of Costa Rica hope that many will participate in the \nconference. We wish to create a climate which would lead to the \nabolition of such a drastic punishment, which is so prone to error \nand arbitrary use. Costa Rica would be greatly honored if the \nSecretary- General would be present at the opening of that congress \nin December this year. My Government also supports the efforts of all \ncountries which advocate abolition of the death penalty and \nparticularly the efforts by the delegations of the Federal Republic \nof Germany and Sweden.\nAs I have already stressed, economic, social and cultural rights are \nno less important and deserve our full attention. The comparison \nbetween those rights and civil and political rights-a comparison that \nwas valid in an earlier time for the purpose of stressing the former, \nis outmoded. It is today generally recognized that the enjoyment of \nsocial justice in liberty is indispensable. But if economic, social \nand cultural rights, enshrined in the International Covenant, are to \nbe enjoyed, there must be transformations in the structures of \nStates, which is much more difficult to achieve than changes needed \nto bring about the enjoyment of this other set of rights. Such \nstructures are the heirs to odious privileges of the few, which have \nbeen prejudicial to the rights of the many dispossessed. They also \nrepresent cruel forms of repression, perhaps more ruthless and \ninhumane than those generated by lack of respect for the fundamental \nrights and freedoms of men and citizens, because they intensify the \npain and despair of the weakest. Moreover, the changes that are \nneeded to bring about the enjoyment of economic and social rights \nrequire more time and more financial and technological resources, as \nwell as a degree of national and international consensus that is much \ngreater and more solid in nature. For that reason, the United Nations \nmust concern itself with showing Member States that here, too, there \nare real causes of discontent that affect world peace in a direct way \nand with devastating force. Governments would thus be' come more \ninterested in the social reforms that are\nrequired.\nThe Government of Costa Rica is also concerned about other problems \nthat tend to work against peace. With greater eloquence than mine, \nrepresentatives have referred to the catastrophic developments in the \nworld economy, which have had a devastating effect on the development \nand political stability of the vast majority of States Members of the \nUnited Nations. Today I should like to add my voice to the powerful \nvoices that have spoken out in alarm and protest against this state \nof affairs. In particular I should like to highlight the situation in \nLatin America.\nThe year 1981 was one of the worst of the post-war period from the \neconomic standpoint. All the indices suggest that there will be a \ngreater deterioration in the immediate future. The stagnation of our \neconomies, the galloping inflation which characterizes most of our \neconomies, the deterioration in the terms of trade and the serious \ndisequilibrium in the balance of payments which accompanies it \ndisrupt social peace and make it more difficult to find democratic \npolitical solutions to the serious problems besetting many countries.\nOur region has seen its external debt doubled in only three years, \nand today it exceeds $240 billion. This is the result of an attempt \nto replace a lack of dynamism in exports, brought about to some \nextent by the weak demand of the developed countries, by an influx of \ncapital, with increasingly higher interest rates.\nIn the circumstances, it is disappointing that today there is not the \nnecessary political consensus to ensure a take-off in global \nnegotiations. Recognizing the structural problems which characterize \ninternational economic relations and emphasizing that a global \ndiscussion of these problems is necessary, we share the opinion of \nthose that say it is urgent that short-term action be taken to \nprevent the complete collapse of the weaker economies.\nFor this reason it is necessary that we start work on an emergency \nprogramme encompassing, infer a//a, the following actions: first, \ninitiatives to increase the flow of trade by means of eliminating \nbarriers to the exports of the developing countries and by means of \ngreater South-South exchange; secondly, the creation of compensatory \nfunds to reduce the impact of the deterioration in the terms of \ntrade; thirdly, better promotion of joint investment by the \nindustrialized and developing countries in the latter; fourthly, the \nincrease, on a generous and disinterested basis, of the flow of \nresources towards multilateral financing bodies and technological \nco-operation to improve the liquidity of the developing countries; \nand, fifthly, the promotion of greater understanding and tolerance in \nthose bodies as regards the implementation of economic measures in \nsuch a way as to ensure a better balance between the objectives of \nreactivation and of stabilization.\nWe should like to stress that the adoption of a programme such as the \none just mentioned should not be seen as a substitute for greater \nefforts leading to the creation of a new economic order. We believe, \nhowever, that these measures are in keeping with the spirit of the \nnew order, that they would help to establish a climate more conducive \nto the success of initiatives concerning the structural change that \nwe desire and that they would create necessary conditions-although \nperhaps not all the conditions-for the peace and security which our \npeoples deserve.\nIn this respect, the meeting of Foreign Ministers held at San Jose on \n4 October drew\n\\\"... the attention of the industrialized democratic countries to the \nneed to increase co-operation with the democratic countries of the \nregion, with bold and effective initiatives which will contribute to \nthe efforts to ensure recovery and economic and social development \nwhich are being made by the countries of the region concerned\\\".\nIn addition to those that I have mentioned, there are, of course, \nmany other reasons why the general picture of present international \nrelations so gloomy. The situation in the Middle East requires that \nwe dedicate ourselves, free from the heavy burden of prejudices, \nobstacles and past events, to the search for peace for that tormented \nregion. My Government hopes that all the States of the Middle East \nwill make the changes and reach the agreements necessary, for an \nhonorable lasting peace that will guarantee the sovereignty, \nsecurity, peace and well-being of all the States of the area. This \napplies in particular to the noble people of Lebanon, who deserve to \nbe allowed to return to the condition of their glorious past. At the \nsame time, the Government of Costa Rica is confident that the \nlong-suffering and noble people of Palestine will in the not too \ndistant future see the end of their present precarious existence. \nThen Palestinians will be able, like all other nations, to enjoy \npeace, work and respect for their dignity, in harmony with their \nneighbors and with universal recognition of their many virtues.\nFor the subjugated peoples of South Africa and Namibia my country \nhopes that the hour of liberation will soon come. To this end, the \nincreasingly active participation of the international community, \nencouraged and guided by the United Nations, is essential.\nMy Government feels great satisfaction at the constructive efforts \nbeing made by the Government of the Republic of Korea to bring about \nthe reunification of that country on the basis of its recent \nproposals. Whatever is done must be in line with the aims and \npurposes of the United Nations regarding the reunification of Korea. \nCosta Rica recognizes the peace-loving and hard-working nature of the \nfriendly and noble people of the Republic of Korea.\nCosta Rica welcomes the fact that the dear sister Republic of \nArgentina has taken the initiative in pressing its just claim to the \nMalvinas Islands in this United Nations forum and hopes that the \nnegotiations will prove fruitful. The association of the \nSecretary-General with the dialogue, in accordance with a proposal of \nwhich Costa Rica was a sponsor, is a guarantee that the parties will \nreach an honorable and peaceful final agreement.\nCosta Rica shows the concern expressed in this Hall at what is \nhappening in Cyprus, Afghanistan and Kampuchea, where situations in \nviolation of the principles of the Charter continue.\nI should now like to take up the subject specifically referred to by \nthe Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization. \nI refer to what he has called \\\"the prevailing convulsion of Central \nAmerica\\\".\nMore than four decades ago we, the democratic sectors promoting \nsocial change and freedom in Central America anticipated the present \ncrisis in the area. Our predictions were based on the existence of \neconomic and social structures and systems of military government \nwhich legalized them. They constituted forms of oppression whose \ninevitable end result would be the rebellion of peoples fighting \nagainst the lack of social justice and for freedom. Today the \nexplosion of popular wrath has assumed a virulent form as a result of \nthat anti-democratic record.\nBut what was perhaps not anticipated was the international \ncircumstances prevailing during the final confrontation between the \npeoples and the dictatorships. We did not anticipate all the \nimplications of this global confrontation today between democracy and \ntotalitarianism, a confrontation that would thoroughly disrupt \nefforts to adapt these new forces to present realities in Central \nAmerica. What was particularly unexpected was that, on behalf of \nfreedom, social justice and democracy, an effort would be made after \nthe predictable rebellion to establish another unanticipated form of \ntotalitarianism, thereby flouting the very ideals which impelled the \nforces of change. Yet that is precisely what is happening today. This \nother form of totalitarianism, bolstered by open intervention by \nforces outside the Central American area, has only sharpened the \nconflict, polarized political ideas and created new formidable \nobstacles to democratic, representative and pluralistic government \ndevoted to social justice, without the need for the bloodshed and \nconfrontation now rending the peoples of the Central American nations \napart.\nIn an effort to produce a realistic way out of the present crisis \nbesetting Central America, the President of Costa Rica, Luis Alberto \nMonge, on the very day he assumed power on 8 May of this year, began \nto put into practice what he had advocated in his electoral campaign, \nnamely, a broad alliance of democratic forces and Governments in \norder to confront the totalitarian offense and promote the values, \nmachinery and goals of representative, pluralistic and participatory \ndemocracy for clearly social purposes. For this purpose, infer in a \njoint declaration of the heads of State attending the ceremony of the \ntransfer of power on 8 May, it was agreed, on Costa Rica's \ninitiative, that there would be created a good offices group which \nwould have as its special mandate the study of the various peace \ninitiatives that had been presented by various Governments in order \nto bring about the relaxation of tension in Central America, as well \nas other proposals that might be presented for the same purpose in \nthe future. Ever since, my country has stressed the need for this \nkind of machinery or one similar to it that would make it possible \nfor the parties directly involved in the conflict to sit at the \nnegotiating table. And so it was that the Government of Costa Rica \ndecided to convene a meeting of foreign ministers of countries \ninterested in the pro-, motion of democracy in Central America and in \nthe Caribbean whose Governments have been legitimized through \nelections.\nOn 4 October, at San Jose, at the invitation of the Costa Rican \nGovernment there met representatives of Belize, Colombia, the \nDominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Jamaica, Panama, the \nUnited States and Costa Rica. The Governments of Mexico and Venezuela \nwere also invited. Panama and the\nDominican Republic participated as observers, and the latter signed \nthe Final Act. At the conclusions of the deliberations on the main \nfactors obstructing democratic processes in the area, faith was \nreaffirmed in representative, pluralistic and participatory democracy \nand the foundation was laid for the promotion of democracy and peace \nin our area.\nRegarding that democracy, the participating ministers declared:\n\\\"Their faith in and acceptance of the principles of representative, \npluralistic and participatory democracy, which thus understood \nconstitute a way of life, thought and action, with room for differing \nsocial and economic systems and structures, but having a common \ndenominator, namely, respect for life, personal security, freedom of \nthought, freedom of the press and of religion, and the right to work \nand to proper remuneration, just living conditions, the free exercise \nof the right to vote and other human, civil, political, economic, \nsocial and cultural rights.\\\"\nAs regards the promotion of peace in the area, the Ministers stated\n\\\"Their conviction that in order to foster peace and regional stability it is \nnecessary to promote internally political awareness leading to the \ncreation of democratic, representative, pluralistic and participatory \nsystems; the establishment of machinery for multilateral and \npermanent dialogue; absolute respect for borders defined in existing \ntreaties, respect for which is the best way of preventing border \ndisputes and incidents, with due account being taken, where \nnecessary, of traditional lines of jurisdiction. There must also be \nrespect for the independence and territorial integrity of States; use \nor threats to use force to settle conflicts must be rejected; the \narms race must cease and, on a full basis of reciprocity, external \nfactors obstructing a lasting and stable peace must be eliminated.\\\"\nIn addition, the ministers felt that it was necessary to emphasize \ncertain actions of particular importance which were essential in \nformulating a realistic, viable peace plan. For this reason, they \nstated that:\n\\\"... it is essential for a peace plan that each country, in the \nregion and outside of it, carry out the following actions: first, to \ncreate and maintain institutions of government which are truly \ndemocratic, based on the popular will as expressed in free and \nuntainted elections, based on the principle that the Government is \nresponsible to the governed; secondly, to respect human rights, \nespecially the right to life and security of person, and fundamental \nfreedoms, freedom of expression, information, assembly and worship, \nand the right to organize political parties, labor unions and other \ngroups and associations; thirdly, to foster national reconciliation \nwherever profound divisions within society have occurred, by \nextending opportunities to participate within the framework of \ndemocratic institutions and procedures; fourthly, to respect the \nprinciple of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and \nthe right of peoples to self-determination; fifthly, to prevent the \nuse of the territory of a country to support, supply, train or \nsupervise terrorists or subversive elements acting in other States, \nputting an end to the traffic in weapons and materials, and \nrefraining from direct or indirect support for terrorists or \nsubversive or other activities designed to bring about the violent \noverthrow of the Government of another State; sixthly, to limit \nweapons and the scale of military and security forces to levels which \nare strictly necessary for the maintenance of public order and \nnational defense; seventhly, to ensure, in accordance with reciprocal \nand fully verifiable terms, international control of all ports of \nentry and other border areas which are of strategic importance; \neighthly, to effect withdrawal, on a fully reciprocal basis, from the \nCentral American area of all foreign military and security advisors \nand personnel, and the banning of imports of heavy weapons of an \nobviously offensive nature in accordance with procedures which ensure \nproper verification.\n\\\"These actions represent an integrated framework in each State which \nis essential for the promotion of regional peace and stability.\\\"\nAs already stated, it is, of course, quite clear that without \nappropriate means or machinery to analyses this peace plan and other \nproposals with the same purpose, they all run the risk of being \nineffective, and that would be tragic. For that reason, at the San \nJose meeting which I have referred to, the ministers agreed \\\"to set \nthemselves up as a Forum for Peace and Democracy\\\", a forum which \ncould be extended through the inclusion or the collaboration of other \ndemocratic States. The Forum could recommend specific actions to \nrepresentatives of participating countries, and they should report on \nthe results and transmit the final act of the meeting to other \nStates, so that they can present any appropriate comments and views.\nThe representatives asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Costa \nRica to transmit the final act, on behalf of the participating \nGovernments, to the Governments of the region and to other \nGovernments concerned, in order to obtain their views on the \nprinciples and conditions for peace set forth therein.\nThey decided to convene a new meeting as soon as possible in order to \nassess the progress being made in implementing the aims of the \ndeclaration.\nThe Forum for Peace and Democracy is an expression of a common will; \nit does not constitute an official body, and therefore has the \nnecessary flexibility and dynamism to carry out its great task. The \nnucleus of the Forum is made up of Belize, Colombia, El Salvador, \nHonduras, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, the United States and \nCosta Rica. Whatever democratic countries from the area wish to \nbecome members of the Forum may do so, and a second group can be made \nup of democratic countries which wish to co-operate with the Forum \nwithout actually belonging to it. Here I should like to stress that \nthe Forum was created so that there might be the participation in it \nof all countries involved in conflicts in Central America that \ndisrupt peace, so that they could explain their views and make peace \nproposals; and this has already been done by Nicaragua, Honduras, \nMexico, the United States and Panama individually, and by Mexico and \nVenezuela jointly, apart from the eight other countries that met at \nSan Jose and created the Forum and proposed the aforementioned plan \nfor regional peace.\nAs part of the mandate assigned to me at the San Jose meeting, I have \nalready circulated its final act and I am now taking the steps \nrequired to enable the Forum to be used as a practical instrument for \nwaging this great peace offensive of the democracies. We hope that, \nwith the support of those peoples who desire peace, democracy, \nfreedom and social justice, this new initiative of the Forum for \nPeace and Democracy will meet with a warm response and understanding, \nbecause we believe that this is the broadest, most comprehensive and \nmost viable means of achieving the ends we all so much desire.\nCosta Rica is a country with long diplomatic traditions; we are \npeace-loving and unarmed. We neither want nor are able to become \ninvolved in any armed conflict in Central America. But neither can we \nrefrain from contributing to peace efforts in Central America. Costa \nRica's security depends on security and peace in the region. For this \nreason Costa Rica has sincerely and eagerly devoted its efforts to \nconvening the meeting of foreign ministers concerned for peace and \ndemocracy in Central America and the Caribbean, whose Governments are \nthe result of the electoral process. As I have already stated, that \nmeeting took place on 4 October in the capital of my country. For \nthat reason also, Costa Rica, on 8 May of this year, proposed the \ncreation of the Forum for Peace and Democracy, which began to \nfunction at that San Jose meeting.\nFor the first time ever, there is now a procedure whereby all parties \nconcerned can sit down together and, without any delays or excuses, \nengage in a frank, constructive dialogue. If any party does not avail \nitself of that opportunity, one can only conclude that, essentially, \nthere are elements more interested in seeking violent confrontation. \nI am confident, however, that this peace initiative of ours and the \nmachinery to implement it will be accepted by everyone. The peoples \nof the region, which yearn for peace, security and democracy, have \ntheir eyes turned to us to see how we, the leaders of their \nGovernments, fulfil our lofty duties.\nOn this glorious anniversary of the discovery of America, I conclude \nmy statement with a tribute to Spain and to its extraordinary people \nwhich has given us its values and taught us, through the centuries, \nhow to overcome all adversity in the persevering quest for the \ndignity and happiness of every human being.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, may I start by congratulating you on your \nelection as President of this thirty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. At the same \ntime, I would like to convey to you our \nsatisfaction at seeing such an experienced \npolitician occupy this high post. Your merits \nwill most certainly help us to achieve positive \nresults in our endeavors.\n2.\tI would also like to pay a tribute to \nyour predecessor, who carried out the duties of \nthe presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly with such competence and \nauthority. His contribution deserves our \nadmiration and gratitude.\n3.\tI wish to address a special salute to Mr. \nPerez de Cuellar and express my satisfaction at \nseeing in this eminent position such an \ninfluential personality, whose human and \ndiplomatic qualities have already been widely \ndemonstrated.\n4.\tThe importance and complexity of the \nquestions included in the agenda clearly show \nthat dialogue among peoples is essential to \ninternational relations. However, a fruitful \ndialogue depends on the existence of a climate \nof international confidence. Confidence is not \ncompatible with persistent acts of disrespect \nfor the provisions enshrined in the Charter of \nthe United Nations and in the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, or with violations \nof sovereignty, that affect the territorial \nintegrity of nations and disregard the right of \npeoples to self-determination and independence. \nConfidence also excludes the tendency of certain \nStates to impose on other countries, through the \nthreat or use of force, a certain behavior or \nideological submission, contrary to the \ndeep-rooted feelings of their peoples.\n5.\tThe absence of this climate of confidence \nwas evident during the second special session of \nthe General Assembly on disarmament, undoubtedly \none of the most ambitious efforts of the \nOrganization. Disarmament, understood as a \nbalanced and controlled reduction of nuclear and \nconventional weapons, does not stand as an \nautonomous category within the framework of the \nrelations among States. However, the increasing \ntensions in international relations must neither \nbe an excuse nor a justification for the modest \nresults attained. Both the security and the \nfuture of humankind require that immediate action \nbe taken on certain aspects of the arms race, in \norder to deflect it from its present course.\n6.\tAccordingly, the initiation of \nnegotiations at Geneva, between the United States \nand the USSR, to control and reduce nuclear \nweapons of intermediate range as well as \nstrategic nuclear weapons, is ah encouraging step \nand responds to many concerns. We hope that \nimportant and substantial reductions will follow, \nmainly with respect to the ground systems which, \nbeing the most vulnerable, are the most \ndestabilizing.\n7.\tWe also follow with great interest the \nVienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces, \nArmaments and Associated Measures in Central \nEurope. The new proposals recently presented by \nthe West offer a possibility to break the \npresent impasse. We believe they provide a good \nbasis for progress.\n8.\tThe implementation of the provisions of \nthe Helsinki Final Act would be a decisive \nelement towards international detente. Such \ndetente must be global and indivisible, based on \ncriteria of reciprocity, and must govern \nrelations among countries with different social \nand political systems as well as among \nGovernments with identical ideological \nstructures. However, the debates at the Madrid \nmeeting of the Conference on Security and \nCo-operation in Europe, in which my Government is \nso deeply engaged, shows that there, too, the \neffects of the present crisis of confidence are \nfelt, thus impairing the attainment of positive \nresults whenever a solution for basic problems is \nat stake.\n9.\tPast and present events in Poland fully \nillustrate this state of affairs. This is the \nreason why the Portuguese Government has from \nthe outset openly condemned such events, drawing \nthere from the necessary conclusions.\n10.\tThe position of Portugal is that the \nobligation is undertaken in this Held must be \nexecuted in good faith. It is necessary to strive \nfor the fulfillment of the objectives we \nourselves have proposed, thus contributing to \nthe full realization of the principles of the \nCharter and the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. It is not a question of drastically \nchanging international reality. That would be \nunthinkable. Rather, it is a question of trying \nto ease tensions and increase confidence in \nrelations among nations and peoples\u00f3since these \nare also mentioned in the Final Act. Such an \nattitude cannot function in one direction only. \nIt concerns all parties involved and it precludes \nproclamation of an official doctrine which, \ndepending on the areas concerned and according to \none's convenience, interprets coexistence either \nas co-operation or as intolerant confrontation. \nOnly in this way can detente become a reality, \ntranslated into positive acts, and not merely a \ndialogue of the deaf.\n11.\tThe general considerations I have just \nformulated do not diminish\u00f3rather, they \nemphasize\u00f3the importance of regional tensions \nsusceptible of jeopardizing world stability. I \nshall mention only a few examples. I would like \nto refer first to the situation in Namibia, where \nthe exercise of the right to self- determination \ncontinues to be delayed giving rise to serious \nrisks of conflict in southern Africa. Portugal \nconsiders that the independence of Namibia, in \naccordance with Security Council resolution 435 \n(1978) is essential to the stabilization process \nin the region.\n12.\tThe repeated attacks against the \nterritories of Angola and Mozambique, which \nPortugal has condemned in a timely and vigorous \nmanner, cannot fail to be seen in this context, \nhence rendering more urgent a stable solution to \nthe problem. Given the very special ties my \ncountry has with Angola and Mozambique \nPortuguese public opinion follows with deep \ninterest the efforts made towards achieving \npeace, and the subsequent developments in \nsouthern Africa. The interrelationship between \nthese two elements is made clear by the economic \npressures to which those two countries and \nZimbabwe have been subjected. In this context, we \nthink that the goals being pursued by the \nSouthern African Development Co-ordinations \nConference may constitute a very positive \ncontribution to a balanced development of the \narea.\n13.\tI would like to make it clear that we do \nnot wish any specific role for Portugal and that \nwe put our trust in the efforts of the \nSecretary-General, and in the diplomatic \ninitiatives and responsible role played by the \ncontact group of five Western States and by the \nfront-line States. However, the evolution of \nevents shows that flexibility and rapid action \nare essential. Whenever necessary Portugal will \nbe ready to cooperate, if requested. This my \nGovernment has already earnestly done.\tt\n14.\tThe search for a solution to the \nPalestinian problem which would result in a \nglobal, lasting and just peace in the Middle East \nis today an essential element of international \nsecurity. The most recent aspects of the problem \nemphasize even more strongly the need to respect \nthe principle of self-determination and to \nconsider the just claims of the Palestinian \npeople, who long to create a new independent \nState.\n15.\tBut in the Middle East crisis it is \nequally necessary to state clearly the need for \nrespect for the sovereignty, territorial \nintegrity and political independence of all \nnations in the area, in particular Lebanon and \nIsrael, as well as the right of their respective \npeoples to live in peace within duly recognized \nand guaranteed international boundaries.\n16.\tThe Portuguese Government welcomes the \nmost recent initiatives taken by the \ninternational community, namely. President \nReagan's peace plan and the plan agreed by \nconsensus at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference \nat Fez. Neither of these plans should be \nconsidered separately. Both constitute a \nsignificant step towards the achievement of peace \nin the area. The complexity of the Middle East \nsituation is now viewed on a more realistic \nbasis which may lead to the compromise solutions \nlong awaited and much desired by the \ninternational community, thus relegating to the realm \nof the unthinkable such horrifying massacres as \nthose recently inflicted on the defenseless \nPalestinian refugees.\n17.\tThe Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, \nwhich so clearly infringes the juridical rules \nupon which the United Nations is based, has been \nrepeatedly condemned in the Assembly and still \ngives rise to harsh criticism against the \nhegemonic purposes which were behind it.\n18.\tThe Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea is \nyet another source of tension. My Government \nsupports the diplomatic efforts either \nrecommended or already accomplished aimed at \nfinding a peaceful solution to these conflicts.\n19.\tFrom what has been said it is evident \nthat the consequences of the exercise of the \nright of peoples to self-determination are of \ngreat importance within the framework of \ninternational relations; therefore it is the duty \nof the United Nations to enforce the respect for \nthat principle so uncompromisingly proclaimed by \nMember States and to which the great majority of \nthe countries here represented owe allegiance.\n20.\tIt is in this context that the problem of \nEast Timor should be seen. In the light of the \nprinciples concerning the rights of peoples, \nwhich the Organization is bound to defend, the \nproblem of East Timor and the need for the \ninternational community to ensure the exercise of \nthe rights of that Territory's population are \nfor my country matters of high priority and \nundeniable importance. Portugal, which seven \nyears ago ceased to be able to carry out its \nresponsibilities as administering Power, has \nrepeatedly declared that it makes no claim to the \nTerritory of East Timor, to which my country is \nlinked historically and by bonds of human \nsolidarity that exist to this day. These bonds \nare reflected in the deep sensitivity with which \nthe Portuguese nation as a whole follows this \nproblem, while it hopes for a solution consistent \nwith international ethics and justice.\n21.\tThe Portuguese State has often said that \nits only goal is the fulfillment of a national \nand moral duty. Aware of the justice of our cause \nand certain that we are interpreting the \nunanimous feeling of the Portuguese State and \nthe Portuguese people, I wish to reaffirm clearly \nour desire to co-operate actively with the United \nNations, using all the mechanisms envisaged in \nthe Charter, so that through an open dialogue we \nmay all find a solution that truly respects the \ninterests and cultural identity of the people of \nEast Timor and enables them to define their \ncollective destiny.\n22.\tWe are going through particularly \ndifficult times, in which the weight of economic \nproblems has a growing influence and obvious \nrepercussions in the political Held. The present \nstate of the world economy continues to cause \nserious concern as we face a sombre reality, \nmarked by persistent inflationary pressures, \nmonetary fluctuations, high interest rates, \nunemployment and social tensions. The outlook \nfor the near future cannot but be disquieting. \nThe gradual deterioration of the economic \nsituation has affected all countries, regardless \nof their political, economic or social system, \nbut it is the poorest among us that have been \nmost severely harmed.\n23.\tThe experience of the last few years has \nshown that global interdependence is an \ninescapable fact and as such requires greater \nsolidarity among nations. This immense task is \nvital and demands the realistic, co-ordinate and \nuntiring efforts of all members of the \ninternational community, without exception.\n24.\tMy Government believes in the importance \nand usefulness of a realistic, productive and \naction-oriented North-South dialogue. We are \nfacing global problems which demand a global \napproach and global solutions. We trust therefore \nthat it will be possible to reach agreement on \nthe conditions which would make possible the \nlaunching of global negotiations in a spirit \nguided by common interest and respect for \nexisting organizations. North-South relations are \nusually reduced to a formal and strict \ndistinction between developed and developing \ncountries, but such a dichotomy is far from the \npresent reality.\n25.\tPortugal, south of the North, is at an \nintermediate stage of economic and technological \ndevelopment: a donor country within the limits of \nits capacity, it is simultaneously a recipient of \nassistance essential to the process of national \ndevelopment in which it is engaged.\n26.\tBeing an Atlantic country, an active \nmember of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \na European country and a candidate for membership \nof the European Economic Community, Portugal is \nin a position in which it can understand not only \nthe needs of the developing countries but also \nthe difficulties facing the more advanced \neconomies. Portugal's membership in the European \nCommunity, one of the priorities of our foreign \npolicy, will, we are certain, enable 3s to \nreinforce our capacity to under-stand both sides \nof the problem and at the same time collaborate \nactively towards its solution. On the one hand we \nshall pursue more resolutely Portugal's \ndevelopment process and on the other wider \nperspectives will be opened for the privileged \nrelations we maintain with many areas of the \nworld other than the Portuguese-speaking African \ncountries and the African continent.\n27.\tMy Government is engaged in increasing \nand diversifying its bilateral aid, but it is \nequally interested in developing co-operation \nprojects, with the assistance of specialized \nagencies of the United Nations and with the \nco-operation of other countries. Aware of our \nlimitations and possibilities, but conscious also \nthat, besides quantitative aspects, there are \nalso the qualitative ones, we shall strive to \nachieve these goals.\n28.\tIf the role played by small and medium \nenterprises has become increasingly important \nwithin our economy, in the international \npolitical system, too, the role of small and \nmedium countries must be acknowledged as \nincreasingly relevant.\n29.\tIndeed, the perception and impact of \nquestions such as the energy crisis, problems of \ninvestment and technology and protectionist \npolicies are common to this group of countries \nand constitute, in their particular case, \nconditioning factors of a qualitative and not \nmerely quantitative nature. This reality draws a \ndistinction between us and the larger countries. \nWe believe that, with a view to creating a \nrealistic and useful basis for dialogue, it is of \nthe utmost interest that we undertake a common \nconsideration of this issue.\n30.\tLike the others, my country is \nparticularly sensitive to the energy problems \nthat affect our balance of payments in a very \nnegative way, reducing our possibilities of \ncarrying out the measures necessary to pursue our \ndevelopment process. A sustained economic growth \ndepends to a great extent on intensification of \nproductive investments, increased productivity \nand the maintenance of an open trade system.\n31.\tAlthough one must admit that the \nseriousness of the world economic situation has \nnot caused a radical increase of protectionism, I \nshould like to stress the concern of the \nPortuguese Government regarding some \nprotectionist measures which affect exports from \ndeveloping countries and from countries in an \nintermediate stage of development, like Portugal. \nWe hope that during the next ministerial meeting \nof GATT important decisions will be taken \ncontributing, in a decisive way, to fostering \nfree international trade between all countries \nand groups of countries.\n32.\tI should also like to refer to the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea  Last \nApril Portugal voted in favor of the Convention. \nThis decision was taken in the light of our own \ninterests as a coastal State. It also took into \naccount the interests of the international \ncommunity, which may be greatly affected should \nan adequate regulation of these matters not be \nestablished. This does not mean that my country \nis satisfied with all the provisions contained \nin the Convention, namely, those regarding the \ncomposition of the International Sea-Bed \nAuthority^ In fact the interests of \nsemi-industrialized countries are not taken duly \ninto account, especially in the case of those \ncountries that, like Portugal, has ? face serious \nemigration problems. These considerations do not, \nhowever, impair our intention to sign and ratify \nthe Convention, thus contributing towards \navoiding chaos in international maritime \nrelations. Accordingly, Portugal calls upon every \ncountry to make an additional effort to find a \ncompromise formula which would render the \nConvention universally acceptable.\n33.\tIf, on the one hand, economic matters are \nintimately linked to political problems, it is \nalso true that from them arise very serious \nconsequences concerning human rights. Thus, when \ndiscussing here the best way to achieve the \nobjectives we have pro-posed Cor \nourselves\u00f3namely, the creation of a more \nequitable international order\u00f3we cannot overlook \na basic fundamental principle: that the United \nNations is, above all, a body at the service of \nhumankind. Beyond the diversity of traditions, \ncultures and systems, man attains universal value \nas a subject of rights and fundamental freedoms, \nthrough intrinsic dignity. Conse-quently, in \naddition to those factors, there is yet another \nconcern: we continue to be faced with the \npersistence of policies that ignore the essence \nof human rights and lead to serious violations of \nsuch rights, as a result of local conflicts or of \nsituations of instability or intolerance.\n34.\tOf such situations, the system of \napartheid is a paradigm. This system is condemned \nby us, as it is our belief that any form of \ndiscrimination, besides being unacceptable on an \nethical and human plane, is a denial of progress \nand culture.\n35.\tAs I have already stated, there are many \nareas in the world where the rights to \nself-determination, free choice of regime, \nindependence and security of States are not \nrespected. When it comes to human rights\u00f3meaning \nrelations between the Government and \nindividuals\u00f3the situations in which human beings \nare denied their basic rights are regrettably \nmultiplying. I am referring to political \nrepression, racism, foreign domination and \npoverty. The international community acknowledges \nthe fact that human rights are inseparable from \nthe rights of peoples and of nations and that \nboth are closely related to peace, security and \nprosperity in the world. In order that \ninternational stability may be attained, States \nmust respect the rights of other nations and \nthose of their own citizens. In this context, the \nUnited Nations has a dual responsibility: the \ndefinition of principles through the enunciation \nof a code of conduct and supervision of their \neffective implementation.\n36.\tThe Portuguese Government attributes the \ngreatest importance to the achievement of that \naim. Accordingly, Portugal has adhered to the \nmain international instruments concerning human \nrights, the latest one being the International \nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of \nRacial Discrimination, to which we acceded on 23 \nSeptember.\n37.\tThe United Nations has created a system \nand institutions to promote and protect respect \nfor human rights the world over. However, the \nnumber of cases that are violations of the moral \nconscience of nations is regrettably increasing.\n38.\tIn this context, we are deeply concerned \nwith the difficult living conditions suffered by \nthe Timorese people as well as with the \nviolations of its cultural identity and its \nrights, caused by the present situation in the \nTerritory of East Timor. Convergent reports and \ninformation reaching us from East Timor leave no \ndoubt about the moral and physical sufferings \nendured by the people of Timor. The problem of \nEast Timor was only recently discussed at Geneva \nwhen the Sub-Commission on Prevention of \nDiscrimination and Protection of Minorities \nadopted resolution 1982/201 on this question, in \nwhich it acknowledged the diplomatic efforts made \nby Portugal to redress the situation in the \nTerritory and called for international \nco-operation to defend the rights of the Timorese \npeople. In this context as well, of great \nsignificance in the sphere of international \nmorals and law, I wish to reiterate the \nPortuguese will to co-operate in the settlement \nwithin the wide framework of humanitarian \nquestions, of several problems brought about by \nthe situation in East Timor. I wish to reaffirm \nhere that the Portuguese position as to \nprinciples and human rights is clear and that it \nconstitutes the pursuit of an ethical and \npolitical duty which cannot be overlooked if we \ndo not want to put in jeopardy the values that \ngovern us. Likewise, I reiterate Portugal's firm \ndetermination to reach a global solution to this \nproblem within the framework of the Organization, \nthrough an open and frank dialogue.\n39.\tThe history of the United Nations stands \nas an example of endeavor to give mankind its \nfull dimension, free from the yoke of political \ndomination, urgent material needs and deadly \nwars. Many are the difficulties that have been \nencountered when pursuing these aims. Some \nachievements have even brought about new and \ncomplex problems.\n40.\tTo admit that reforms must be introduced \nin certain structures and habits does not mean \nthat we should question the provisions of the \nCharter. On the contrary, within the limitations \nimposed by the framework of international \nrelations, those provisions still offer the best \nmeans of overcoming institutional impediments, \nand are at the same time an irreplaceable frame \nof reference when it comes to settling certain \ntypes of conflicts. The Portuguese Government \nsincerely believes that the Organization can \nhandle confrontations and pave the way to their \nsettlement by means of dialogue, at the same time \nand provide the necessary impartiality as a forum \nfor negotiation.\n41.\tIf the Organization is affected by some \nshortcomings, that is not its fault. Those \nshortcomings\u00f3so sharply described in the report \nof the Secretary- General on the work of the \nOrganization\t\u00f3are caused by those who find \nthem very convenient. That is why, when there is \na common will, the United Nations offers the \nappropriate institutional means for the search \nfor multilateral solutions. It is for the \nreaffirmation of such goals that all of us \ngathered here must strive, without any weakening \nor preconcep-tions, without any demagoguery or \nprocrastination; the moral force of those who are \nin the right will always triumph in the end.\n"

Never \nbefore, in the discharge of its responsibilities, \nhas the United Nations been so convinced of the \nfutility of its decisions\u2014witness its resolutions \nbeing trampled underfoot by certain Member States \nwhose duty it is because of their capacity to \nnegotiate, to set the course of justice and \nreason.\nThis preliminary assessment of the world \nsituation was necessary in order to highlight the \nimmensity of the task of presiding over the \nAssembly since, through our deliberations and \ndecisions, it may be possible to restore \nconfidence in the United Nations and in all those \nthat never lost faith in its calling. In \nextending our most sincere congratulations to Mr. \nHollai on his election, our delegation would like \nto offer him our best wishes for the success of \nour work. He may be assured that my country, \nwhich as a Vice-President is working with him, is \nanxious to give him all possible support and \nassistance. I also address my best wishes to the \nSecretary-General for success during his term of \noffice. The way he has discharged his \nresponsibilities during this first year, so rich \nin events, is striking proof of his skill and \nability to direct the Organization. Moreover, his \nreport on the work of the Organization contains \nlucid comments and guidelines which have the full \nsupport of the Upper Volta.\nLast year, looking back on the situation in the \nworld, at the 28th meeting of the thirty-sixth \nsession, I spoke of a momentum and of hopes which \nshould not be dashed. Today once again these are \nour wishes, although the ills that envelop and \nafflict our world make despair a constant \ncompanion.\nIn the Middle East, first, in spite of four \nspecial sessions of the General Assembly, several \nSecurity Council meetings, a special meeting of \nthe non-aligned countries and many appeals by the \ninternational community, Israel placed greater \nfaith in war than in dialogue. AH the efforts \nmade to reach a just and lasting settlement of \nthe Palestinian question crashed against the wail \nof death and bellicose arrogance erected by \nIsrael\u2014Israel which, having become a constant \naggressor, proclaims and defends its own rights \nwhile trampling on those of others.\nThe tragic events in Lebanon are proof enough \nthat 37 years after San Francisco a State is able \nto invade another with impunity under the pretext \nof being a liberator. After events in \nAfghanistan, Kampuchea and Lebanon, who would \ndare to speak of international morality? For \nthose of us not having double standards, those \nacts of aggression are all equally reprehensible.\nThus, we see the Hebrew State, not content with \noccupying Arab lands, now interfering in Lebanese \naffairs. In this respect we condemn the principle \nof fait accomplit. This is why my country fully \nsupports the Security Council resolution which \ndemands the establishment and maintenance of a \nmultinational force whose primary mission would \nbe to guarantee the security of Palestinians and \nto consolidate the integrity and independence of \nLebanon. The massacres of Shatila and Sabra can \nin no way wipe out the inalienable rights of the \nPalestinian people. Israel, above all, should \nknow this. Israel should know that as regards the \nstruggle for the right to life and freedom more \noften than not everything follows the well-known \nbiological phenomenon of organic regeneration. In \nother words, the Palestinians who died for \nfreedom and justice. In these conditions, where does \nvictory reside? Regardless of the final solution \nfound and regardless of the means used, the \ntragedy in the Middle East cannot be resolved by \nforce of arms. Only frank and sincere \nnegotiations between the parties can lead to an \nequitable settlement of the dispute. That \nsettlement must be based on the relevant \ndecisions of the United Nations, with mutual \nrecognition of the right to existence of both the \nPalestinian people and the Israeli people as an \nindispensable prerequisite. In this context, the \nArab peace plan which resulted from the Twelfth \nArab Summit Conference at Fez is an initiative in \nthe right direction.\nIsrael must understand this wisdom, this \nsacrifice, and respond by giving up all the \nterritories occupied by force and beginning a \ndialogue with the Palestinian people, through its \nlegitimate representative, the PLO. A policy of \ndomination or revenge on either side would be a \ndead-end policy, catastrophic for the region, \nwhich needs peace so much in order to regain \nunity and pool its vast resources to promote its \neconomic and social development.\nThe region is also the arena of another conflict, \nwhich has for two years now pitted Iraq and the \nIslamic Republic of Iran against each other on \ngeo-strategic and political-ideological grounds. \nThe Upper Volta is increasingly concerned by the \nmagnitude of that confrontation, which, if not \nsoon honorably resolved may lead to foreign \nintervention, thus endangering international \nsecurity. We appeal to those two non-aligned \nStates to conform to the ideals of the \nnon-aligned movement, which are based on peaceful \ncoexistence, and put an end to a fratricidal war \nwhich wounds and weakens us all.\nAfrica and Asia are also hotbeds of tension, and \nhere again we cannot but be pessimistic. With the \ncomplicity of certain Powers, the racist regime \nof Pretoria stalks and murders the freedom \nfighters who struggle to recover their dignity as \nfree men. In spite of these vicissitudes, the \nAfrican National Congress and SWAPO are \ncontinuing their heroic struggle for a completely \nfree South Africa and an independent and \nsovereign Namibia.\nThe blind hostility of apartheid to the \nobjectives of Africa lead to repeated incursions \nagainst the frontline States, inflicting human \nsuffering and material damage upon them and \narousing only verbal condemnation from the Powers \nwhich oppose any sanctions against the South \nAfrican regime. None the less those sanctions are \nnecessary to compel the South African authorities \nto be more reasonable. Those sanctions are \nessential to put an end to the odious \nsegregationist system which still, at the end of \nthis twentieth century, dares to institutionalize \nas a system of government the theory of racial \nsuperiority dear to the Fascist regimes. In the \nname of justice and dignity, we wish to reiterate \nour support for the front-line States, whose \ndetermination and perseverance do honor to all \nAfrica. In the name of justice and freedom, we \nask the members of the contact group to apply all \ntheir skill in persuasion and negotiation to make \nthe Pretoria regime understand that the \nindependence of Namibia is inevitable and \nnecessary.\nAs regards the events in Chad, every African \ncountry had its own opinion, and positions were \noften contradictory and even conflicting. What is \ncomforting is that we were able to exercise \nself-control and turn to will rise again from \ntheir ashes the OAU, which had its first \nexperience of maintaining peace in a country prey \nto civil war. Despite the difficulties it faced, \nthe OAU accomplished useful work in Chad. In \nthese circumstances, who would venture to \nquestion the usefulness and importance of that \norganization? It follows that the disagreements \nthat now exist within the OAU because of the \nquestion of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic \nwill not inevitably lead to its disappearance. On \nthe contrary, the enthusiasm and faith that \npresided over the organization's birth must not \nwane and give way to disputes and excommunication.\nOn the question of Western Sahara, my country's \nposition is very clear: it is based on our desire \nto work sincerely for the unity of Africa and on \nour wish to respect the norms of law, without \nwhich that unity would be only artificial. We in \nthe Upper Volta are accustomed to independent \nthought and action, because the Upper Volta does \nnot belong to any outside school; it has its own \nschool. This underlies our vision of African \nunity; it also underlies our position on the \nquestion of Western Sahara, whose solution must \ninvolve an awareness of the following realities.\nThe question of Western Sahara is an exclusively \nAfrican question; hence there is no need to refer \nit to the League of Arab States. A just and \nlasting settlement of the question must be based, \nabove all, on the original principles of our \norganization; it is essential that the nineteenth \nsession of the Assembly of Heads of State and \nGovernment of the OAU be held, as planned, at \nTripoli.\nAbove and beyond misunderstandings and \nsensitivities, what is important is cohesion and \nunity. In the life of any institution at some \ntime or other there are difficulties that must be \novercome. Let us, therefore, rally to safeguard \nour own unity. This is a categorical need, \nbecause an Africa bedeviled from within cannot \nallow itself to be destabilized or distracted by \nhegemonic designs.\nSimilarly, as regards Asia, we deplore the clear \ninterference of foreign Powers in Afghanistan and \nKampuchea. In the case of those countries, just \nas wherever else it is violated\u2014in Africa, in \nLatin America\u2014we wish to see respect for the \nprinciple of noninterference.\nThe question of Korea has always been a matter of \nconcern to my country, which calls for and works \ntowards reconciliation between the two Koreas and \ntheir reunification. The Upper Volta urges them \nto settle the Korean question by peaceful means, \nthrough negotiations, without foreign \ninterference.\nNow the force which brings together the countries \nof Latin America, Asia and Africa, the non- \naligned movement must preserve the integrity of \nits basic principle, non-alignment. Increasingly \nlost sight of, non-alignment is increasingly \nnecessary, vital and consistent with our \nfundamental interests. Without strict respect for \nthe principles of our movement and in the hands \nof hegemonic Powers, we become pawns in a game \nthat they play and control to satisfy their own \nstrategic interests. Our ideals transcend that \nsad destiny, and our actions must no longer doom \nus to it. Our task is to contribute balance and \njustice to the international community. We must \nalso work fervently for a world based on true \ncollective security.\nIn this context we can only be disappointed and \nfrustrated that the second special session of the \nGeneral Assembly devoted to disarmament, in which \nall countries had placed such great hopes, ended \nin failure. The main cause was the bad faith of \nthe nuclear States, which kept raising objections \nand reservations in an attempt to make \ndisarmament their own preserve. Even if their \narsenals warrant such pretension, it still \nremains true that peace is everybody's business.\nIn spite of those disappointing results, we \nconsider it necessary, within the framework of \nthe World Disarmament Campaign, to continue to \nmobilize world public opinion in favor of peace.\nThe future of the world economy arouses deep \nconcern in my country. The present crisis, \nbecause of its multifaceted nature, spares no \ncountry, whether of North or South, \nindustrialized or developing. Inflation and \nunemployment have sounded the alarm everywhere. \nThe elements of a crisis similar to that of the \n1930s are again present and, as if this were \nenough to overcome it, certain economic Powers \nhave taken protectionist measures, which have had \nthe immediate effect of producing disorder in \ninternational economic trade. In the long term it \nis to be feared that those same measures may lead \nto social and polemical upheaval, with \nunforeseeable results.\nAnother feature of the present situation which is \nequally disturbing to my country is the slowing \ndown of the humanist movement towards \ninternational co-operation which had led to the \ncreation of a number of bodies within the United \nNations system designed to Foster the development \nof the least-favored countries.\nAs proof of that I would cite the enormous \ndifficulties now faced by UNDP, whose capacity to \nintervene in the sphere of international \ndevelopment has fallen in 1982 below what it was \n10 years ago. For the countries that benefit from \nthat assistance this situation will most \ncertainly lead to the elimination of many \nprojects whose economic and social impact is \nclear.\n123. The concern that I have just shared with the \nAssembly is not confined, unfortunately, to UNDP: \nit extends also, I am afraid, to such specialized \nagencies and bodies as UNICEF, FAO, WHO, UNEP, \nand others. It is as though in recent years the \ninterest that led to the creation of such bodies \nhas waned; it is as though the suffering, poverty \nand penury of millions of human beings prey to \nhunger, thirst and the most diverse and cruel \nills no longer awakened ;he conscience of men of \ngood will.\nIt is therefore not surprising that this \nworldwide economic recession, whether we call it \ninflation, an energy crisis or deterioration in \nthe terms of trade, which paralyses the growth of \nthe most prosperous, powerful economies should be \ndestroying the development efforts of the \nthird-world countries, and, more specifically, \nthe least developed among them. In Africa, and \nmore particularly in the Sahelian countries, \nthese ills, together with natural disasters and \ntheir consequences tend to become a veritable \npsychosis.\nBy the end of this session of the General \nAssembly we expect to see an increase in the \nnumber of African countries classified as among \nthe least developed, which will bring to 52 per \ncent the proportion of States on our continent in \nthat category. These figures speak for \nthemselves; they are proof that in spite of the \nstruggle of the African countries since their \nindependence and in spite of the Lagos Plan of \nAction and the efforts of the international \ncommunity to help our continent emerge from its \nchronic underdevelopment, the results have not \nmet the expectations of our peoples. Indeed, the \nresults have even been negative in certain \nrespects.\nIt is often said that comparisons are odious. \nWithout trying to draw analogies between the \npresent situation of the developing countries and \nthat of postwar Europe, my country, the Upper \nVolta, is convinced that only massive assistance \nto those countries along the lines of the \nMarshall Plan could help them to solve their \neconomic problems. Obviously, the success of such \na plan depends on the political will of all \nStates, particularity the major Powers. In our \nview, the latter should reverse the arms race and \ndevote the resources thus released to the \npeaceful purposes of economic and social \ndevelopment.\nIt is within this framework that the Upper Volta \nattaches particular importance to resumption of \nthe North-South dialogue and renewal of global \nnegotiations on economic development. We \ntherefore appeal to the rich countries, and to \ntheir political will, in particular, to recognize \nthat the interests of mankind and the very \nsurvival of the human race transcend \nself-interest, demand the prompt resumption of \nthose negotiations and must be the basis of their \nphilosophy.\nThe Upper Volta, a land-locked country and one \nwhich is geographically disadvantaged and \nclassified among the least-developed countries, \nwelcomed with great satisfaction the adoption of \nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the \nSea' on 30 April 1982. The decisive adoption of \nthat instrument constitutes, in our view, a \nstriking victory of an international community in \nsearch of its identity, an important step towards \na more just and lasting balance in inter-State \neconomic relations. Is that not an example, if \nexample be needed, of the value of dialogue?\nI should like on behalf of my country to take \nthis opportunity to appeal to the States that for \ndifferent reasons were unable to adopt the \nConvention on the Law of the Sea to review their \nposition. On a Convention of such importance, \nconsensus would make it possible for us to mark \none more milestone on the path towards peace and \ndetente.\nBefore concluding, I should like to restate my \ncountry's full confidence and faith in the United \nNations and in its noble mission, which is that \nof bringing about an era of peace and progress \nfor the well-being of mankind. The Upper Volta \nhas attentively followed all the efforts made in \nthat direction during the past year, whether it \nbe the World Assembly on Aging, a matter which is \nincreasingly of concern to the national \ncommunity, or the Second United Nations \nConference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses \nof Outer Space which took place in August at \nVienna. We believe that all these activities \nshare a clear vision of objectives to be attained \nin order to make our world more fraternal and \nmore humane.\nIt is urgent that the United Nations, through the \nproposals for renewal suggested by the Secretary- \nGeneral, regain its place and its role in \naccordance with the principles of the Charter. It \nis essential that all the nations of our world \ngive the United Nations every support to enable \nit to accomplish its mission in our troubled \nworld, that of safeguarding peace and justice.\nAbove and beyond the difficulties of all types \nthat today disturb international life, above and \nbeyond national selfishness, tension and \nconflicts which govern inter-State relations, one \ntruth remains: never before since the emergence \nof life on earth has mankind been more \nthreatened, more haunted. Never has peace been \nmore precarious, never has our world been more \nanguished, more disturbed; disturbed at the \npresent, disturbed for the future. In these \nconditions, our only chance of survival is to \nmobilize all our energies in the service of \ngreater justice, greater equity on earth.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I should like to address to you, \nSir, the warm congratulations of the Algerian \ndelegation on your accession to the important \nposition of President of the General Assembly. We \nare particularly glad to see you assume this \ndifficult responsibility because you represent a \ncountry, Hungary, with which Algeria has \nestablished excellent relations of friendship and \nco-operation. You have succeeded Mr. Kittani, who \nfor one year placed his great experience and \nability as an accomplished diplomat at the \nservice of the Organization. I should also like \nto congratulate Mr. Perez de Cuellar for the \ndynamism he has shown in discharging his mandate \nsince his election to the high post of \nSecretary-General.\nThe Assembly is faced from one session to another \nwith the same challenge of how to build a truly \nuniversal peace. The fact that this is almost a \npermanent challenge might lead one to believe \nthat the United Nations can only continue to wish \nfor beneficial achievements which would give full \nsignificance to the concepts of convergence and \nharmonization on which this assembly of nations \nis based.\nIn the statements made since the opening of the \ngeneral debate the same concern has emerged over \nthe crisis in international relations as a whole \nand the serious problems facing our world. There \nhave been two points that we have all been \nobliged to make: first, the lucid analyses that \nfrom year to year have highlighted the primary \ncauses of the critical state of our world and the \ndangers for the future of mankind; secondly, the \ninternational community's inability resolutely to \ntackle these primary causes and prevent these \ndangers.\nBut promoting true peace requires that we go \nbeyond simply being aware of the dreadful \nrealities of international life; nor can it \nsimply be reduced to diagnosing, however correct \nour diagnosis may be. What is certainly needed is \na break, a change, in attitude and conduct which \nhave broadened tension and insecurity. Unless we \nhave such a break, such a change, the \ninternational community will not be able to put \nan end to systematic violations of the principles \nof the Charter.\nIn these circumstances, we can hardly be \nsurprised that the picture of our world today is \none of anarchy where the unleashing of unbridled \nforce crushing the elementary principles and \nvalues of law shows the failure of policies based \nonly on power plays and relationships of force. \nThe tragedy of the Palestinian people is the most \ndramatic illustration of this. Indeed, the \nPalestinian problem, which has dominated \ninternational affairs and the work of the \nOrganization this entire past year, is the most \nsignificant and disturbing example of the crisis \nof the world today. The denial of justice to the \nPalestinian people has made this issue a major \ncrisis of our age, one that leads to the most \nserious dangers for international peace and \nsecurity.\nThe crime against humanity which was perpetrated \nin Beirut and witnessed by the entire world was \ncommitted when a situation had lasted for too \nlong, one in which an entire people's right to \nlive was denied. That crime was perpetrated \nbecause of constant encouragement and unlimited \nresources given to the Zionist policy of \naggression. Can we add to that horror by \nemphasizing the fact that it was only after the \ndeparture of their defenders that thousands of \nwomen and children were massacred?\nIs there any need for me to recall that the \nPalestine Liberation Organization decided on \nwithdrawal of its armed forces, not because it \nwas reluctant to sacrifice its fighters, but \nprecisely out of respect for a civilian \npopulation which had paid with its blood a noble \nransom of solidarity. What a contrast, what a \nsignificant contrast, between infamy and respect \nfor human life. The PLO thus gave us proof of its \nability to use well its considerable political \nand military resources to advance its cause. In \nleaving that theatre of operation the PLO at the \nsame time broadened the strategic base of its \naction and its hold on the people.\nIn the resolute struggle waged by the Palestinian \npeople under the leadership of thePLO, its sole \nlegitimate representative, the Beirut battle \nsymbolizes both the stubborn resistance and the \nspirit of responsibility which prove the \nauthenticity of a national liberation war. \nTherefore it would be wrong to expect a solution \nin the Middle East without the Palestinian people \nor against them. More than ever before, the \nrecognition of the national rights of the \nPalestinian people, above all their right to \nestablish a State in their homeland, is essential \nto a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\nThis is moreover, the very substance of the \ninternational community's consensus on a \nsettlement of the crisis in the Middle East. It \nis the duty of the United Nations to fulfil its \nresponsibilities and make possible the \nimplementation of this consensus, thereby \nensuring a return to peace in the Middle East. It \nmust react with specific action and bold \ndecisions that at last ensure justice for the \nPalestinian people.\nThe plots hatched against the Palestinian \nresistance, like, those we see in other parts of \nthe world, force us to say that there seems to be \na planned policy for destroying solidarity, a \nstrategy for splitting regional and other \npolitical groups, in order to turn back the tide \nof history and re-establish imperial domination \nin the third world countries faced with many \nproblems and trying despite a thousand \ndifficulties to find solutions in keeping with \nthe aspirations of their peoples.\nAgainst this background certain actions against \nthe Organization of African Unity are of \nparticular concern to us. Its very birth bore \nwitness to the victories won through the struggle \nof the African peoples in the decolonization \nprocess, and OAU was from the outset a means of \ncompleting this liberation of the continent in \nall areas and a bulwark of African freedom a has \nto its credit constant action in solidarity with \nall freedom fighters and determination to go on \nuntil it succeeds, it has inevitably become the \ntarget of attempts to crush it.\nTherefore, after all kinds of political, economic \nand military pressures have been brought to bear \non it, attacks are now directed, through that \norganization, against the very basis of unity and \nsolidarity in our continent. But the crisis of \nOAU, although an African matter, is not \nexceptional in nature and must be overcome by the \nefforts and the determination of its members. \nHowever, although these difficulties are \ntransitory, that does not lessen the \nresponsibility of those that caused them, and \ncannot be used as a pretext for considering it \nless necessary to search together, as in the \npast, for solutions to the problems facing \nAfrica, the most important of which remains that \nof eliminating colonialism and racist domination.\nThe tragedy being played out in the southern part \nof Africa becomes grimmer with each passing day. \nThe policy of Apartheid universally condemned as \na crime against humanity, is also constantly \nbeing expanded. The illegal occupation of Namibia \ncontinues and is being consolidated, while brutal \naggression against African States in the region \nis intensifying. This situation demands that the \ninternational community continue to mobilize in \nsupport of the cause of the South African people, \ntheir emancipation and freedom to determine their \nfuture. It also demands the imposition of a total \nembargo and comprehensive sanctions against South \nAfrica. Only such a response can put an end to \nthe policy of defiance and aggression of the \nPretoria regime.\nAs regards Namibia, it is time for the \ninternational consensus on the inalienable right \nof the Namibian people to independence and the \nlegitimacy of its struggle, under the leadership \nof its sole representative, SWAPO, to be given \npractical effect. It is time for the Western \nPowers that have the duty and the means of \ninfluencing the policy of the Pretoria regime to \ndo what is incumbent on them and to shoulder \ntheir responsibility, because they have a \ncommitment to the international community \nconcerning the process of independence for \nNamibia.\nIn north-west Africa the conflict between the \npeople of Western Sahara and the occupying Power, \nthe Kingdom of Morocco, has been a matter of \nconstant concern to the international community \nsince 1975. It is thus natural that OAU and the \nUnited Nations should have attempted to find a \njust and definitive solution to this problem some \nof the sidetracking of the process that should \nhave led to. the decolonization of Western \nSahara. The Organization, aware of the justice \nand legitimacy of the struggle waged by the \npeople of Western Sahara, led by the POLISARIO, \nhas thus constantly called for the exercise by \nthe people of Western Sahara of their right \nfreely to determine their own future, and in \nGeneral Assembly resolution 36/46 called for \nnegotiations between Morocco and POLISARIO.\nOAU, for its part, aware of the dangers of the \ncontinuing conflict in the region, has made a \nresponsible attempt to find ways and means of \nmoving towards a solution consistent with its \ncharter and principles. Since OAU It is thus \nencouraging to see that one of the two parties to \nthe conflict, the Sahraoui Arab Democratic \nRepublic, continues to demonstrate a high sense \nof responsibility to the cause of peace and of \nAfrica by expressing its willingness to seek a \npolitical settlement. It simply remains for us to \nhope that the voice of reason, or simply common \nsense, will end by triumphing and that there will \nbe victory for a national liberation cause that \nhas been recognized as such by the international \ncommunity and that this will make it possible to \nmarshal all enemies and exploit all wealth for \nthe greater benefit of the fraternal peoples of \nthe region, united by the same historical \nexperience and a common future.\nDisturbing trends in international affairs, in \nthe form of hotbeds of tension in the third \nworld, are also to be found in the serious \nbarriers to promotion of a true international \ndialogue. Whether it be disarmament or \ninternational economic relations, we can see a \nparalysis in the channels of negotiation, a \ndisruption of the machinery of consultations.\nAgainst this background, the recognized failure \nof the second special session of the General \nAssembly on disarmament reveals the difficulties \nand the infernal logic of this kind of \nconfrontation. While the international community \ncame to the lofty conclusion that security cannot \nbe achieved by a build-up of arms, and while \nthere has been a tenfold increase in destructive \npotential of the arsenals of the nuclear Powers \nto destroy the entire human species, the \nopportunity of moving forward in international \nnegotiations on disarmament, getting us out of \nthe rut of the discussions of the past, has not \nbeen seized. However, on this vital issue where \nthe data is perfectly clearly established, there \nwas some hope that the rivalry in the unbridled \narms race would eventually yield to rivalry in \nannouncing concrete and effective measures for \ndisarmament.\nHowever, it must be recognized that the call to \nreason and the expectations and hopes of our \npeoples have met no response. Furthermore, the \nconceptual edifice patiently built in the Final \nDocument of the Tenth Special Session of the \nGeneral Assembly, of 1978, has on occasion been \nchallenged in the principles and priorities it \nestablished, and this shows that there has been a \nmove backwards in political commitment to true \ndisarmament. This serious regression was \nnaturally accompanied by increased activity on \nthe part of imperialism and by geo- strategic \nmaneuvers in the third world. This activism was \nreflected,\tby obstacles being increasingly \nplaced in the way of the national liberation \nstruggle of the peoples, an increase in policies \nof intervention and destabilization, the \nreactivation and opening of military bases and a \nfrantic search for military facilities for \ninterventionist purposes.\nThe Indian Ocean was proclaimed a zone of peace \nby the United Nations, and yet there is military \ncompetition and unequalled rivalry there and also \nin the Mediterranean, where we have the same \nforeign presence against the wishes of the \nnon-aligned coastal States. Even Cyprus, a \npeaceful island, is living in a situation that is \nsimply incompatiblewith its own nature as an \nopen-hearted meeting-place for civilizations and \nas an independent and non-aligned country.\nThroughout the third world, in Africa, in Asia \nand in Latin America, there is an increase in the \nnumber of attempts being made to stifle the \nforces of progress by resorting to intimidation \nand destabilization techniques, and denying the \npeoples' right freely to choose their political \nsystem and their own path of development.\nIn international economic relations, the present \nsituation is extremely disturbing. Inseparable \nfrom the deterioration in the international \npolitical environment, the world economic crisis \nis deepening and worsening. The international \neconomic system, a source of inequality and a \nprivileged area in terms of continuing \nrelationships of domination, is now prey to major \nupheavals. The disruption in the world economy \nhighlights the intrinsic limits of an order that \nis doomed because it has not adapted to the \ndevelopment needs of two thirds of the human \nrace. The haphazard measures that have been \nadvocated by the developed countries simply do \nnot work, and this is additional proof that the \norder is collapsing.\nAgainst this background, it is hardly surprising \nthat the economic situation of the developing \ncountries should have continued to deteriorate. \nWhen we look regularly at the balance sheets, we \ncan see that there has been a continued increase \nin poverty and the ravages of hunger. Under \ndevelopment of two thirds of the human race is \none of the main features of the world ted ay, and \nthe gloomy prospects in view of continuing trends \nover the years and decades to come are indeed \nthreatening.\nThis precarious world economic situation \nhighlights more than ever before the need for a \nfair restructuring of this anachronistic \nframework and of the unequal rules that currently \ngovern international relations. In that \nconnection, the developing countries have spared \nno effort to prelaunch the dialogue with the \ndeveloped countries\u2014a comprehensive, responsible \ndialogue taking account of the realities of the \ndeveloping world and of the growing \ninterdependence of the world economies; a \ndialogue covering all the major issues \nsimultaneously and in a consistent, interrelated \nway; a dialogue which, with universal, democratic \nparticipation, would presage our final objective \nof democratizing international economic relations.\nThose were the bases on which the non-aligned \ncountries and the Group of 77 conceived the \ninitiative of global negotiations on \ninternational economic co-operation for \ndevelopment\u2014an initiative that won the consensus \nsupport of the international community with the \nadoption in 1979 of General Assembly resolution \n34/138. At a time when the Second United Nations \nDevelopment Decade was ending on a strikingly \nunproductive note, the adoption of that \nresolution sparked hopes that the developed \ncountries would finally evince the political will \nto launch a significant common effort for the \nbenefit of one and all. Throughout the past three \nyears the Group of 77 has demonstrated \nflexibility and has been open t^ dialogue; it has \nplayed a dynamic and constructive role in the \nsearch for a commonly acceptable basis for the \nlaunching of those global negotiations.\nIn 1980, at the eleventh special session of the \nGeneral Assembly, devoted to economic issues, the \nGroup of 77 contributed act national community. \nSince then several proposals have been made, with \ndue regard for the requirements of the minority \nthat did not join the consensus. Thus the Group \nof 77 took the initiative of putting forward a \nproposal with three options, with a view to \nmaking possible the urgent launching of the \nglobal negotiations. Unfortunately, the three \noptions were not accepted\u2014although there was no \nreal negotiation at all. Despite that rejection, \nthe Group of 77 once again demonstrated a \nconstructive spirit by taking another initiative \nin the hope of removing all doubts weighing on \nthe launching of global negotiations. The \nindustrialized countries, however, felt it \nnecessary to submit four amendments to that \nproposal, the productof tremendous compromise. \nThe Group of 77 carefully and responsibly studied \nthose amendments, thus demonstrating again its \nwillingness to co-operate fruitfully, and decided \nto accept two of the four amendments proposed. \nHowever, inasmuch as the other two proposed \namendments questioned resolution 34/138 as the \npolitical framework for the global negotiations \nand called into question the delicate balance \nbetween the central role of the General Assembly \nin the conduct of the global negotiations and the \nparticular role of the specialized agencies, the \nGroup of 77 was unable to accept them. Hence we \nventure to hope that the compromise proposals of \nthe Group of 77 will eventually be accepted.\nDuring this period of deteriorating international \neconomic relations and given the impasse in the \nNorth-South dialogue, South-South co-operation \ntakes on particular importance. As a parallel and \nsupplement to the efforts at a North-South \ndialogue, South-South co-operation is part of the \nmajor project of establishing the new \ninternational economic order. It is in that \ncontext that the developing countries have traced \na framework and defined the operational \ninstruments for the constant strengthening of \ntheir individual and collective autonomy. The \nGroup of 77, aware that its strength lies in \nunity among its ranks and in cohesion in its \napproach, thus offers a new basis for reinforcing \nits solidarity. A year after the adoption of the \nCaracas Programme of Action, its implementation \nhas begun with the faith and determination that \nnurture great hopes.\nIt is in that international atmosphere that \nAlgeria, having survived more than a hundred \nyears of darkness, celebrated the twentieth \nanniversary of its independence. Having fully \nrecovered its attributes as a State, Algeria \nundertook to consolidate its political \nindependence by meeting the requirements of \neconomic independence. Eager to preserve its \ndearly reconquered sovereignty and desirous of \nmutually beneficial international co-operation, \nAlgeria opted for a foreign policy governed by \nprinciple and molded in the common destiny which \nis based on its belonging to the Arab world, the \nAfrican world, the Moslem world and the third \nworld. At the same time, it codified in its \nnational charter and Constitution the fundamental \nprinciples of a diplomatic policy which sets \npeace and development, so intimately related, as \nits objective, and the principles of the United \nNations as the inviolable guide of its conduct. \nHaving rediscovered the benefits of peace, \nAlgeria undertook to promote in good faith, at \nthe sub regional level, a policy of positive \ngood-neighbor-liness which embodied the principle \nof the inviolability of frontiers and called for \npolitical harmonization and broad-ranging \nco-operation. This approach was also reflected in \nour strong belief in the ideals of Arab unity and \nAfrican unity, and all efforts to consolidate the \nbasis of our effective solidarity and the \nharmonious working together of the two groups.\nLending our voice to the community of the \noppressed, within which we forged our deep \nbeliefs and well-tested friendships, and the \nworld of the deprived, whose situation and \naspirations we share, Algeria is working to \nestablish international relations free of any \ntinge of domination or exploitation. We are doing \nthis with perseverance within the United Nations \nand within other groups to which we belong.\nAlgeria is a founding member of the non-aligned \nmovement, and we have elevated non-alignment to a \nclear commitment and a system of values, a \nreference system which inspires our conduct and \ndetermines the positions we take. We believe in a \ngreat future for this movement, whose relevance \nin today's world confirms its importance and the \ncorrectness of its doctrine. We thus express our \ndeep belief that the Seventh Conference of Heads \nof State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, \nto be held at New Delhi, will help to strengthen \nthe cohesion and capacity for action of this \nmovement and strengthen its role in the \ninternational arena.\nAlgeria's assessment of the role of the Organization is based on \nthat same premise and arises from the same \noutlook. It is undeniable that the United Nations \nhas played a globally positive role, due account \nbeing taken of the limits imposed on it both by \nits very nature and by the will of the States of \nwhich it is composed. Its movement towards \nuniversality is proof that it is viewed as a \nunique forum for reconciling views in order to \nseek solutions to the problems of our world.\nHowever, the many shortcomings that have led to \nthe paralysis of the Organization call for a \nresponsible consideration of its future, and \nindeed this; something that the Secretary-General \ninvites us to do in his report on the work of the \nOrganization. The call for the democratization of \ninternational relations and the legitimate desire \nto strengthen the role of the United Nations and \nto lift the Organization to the level of its \nresponsibilities, particularly in the field of \ninternational peace and security, can no longer \nbe ignored.\nThe Secretary-General has highlighted the \ndeficiencies of the Organization, and thereby \nemphasized the correctness of the political \nposition taken by a great majority of Member \nStates, and of our work on the present \nfunctioning of the United Nations. World public \nopinion can be harsh to the United Nations, but \nwe should think about it carefully, because the \nUnited Nations is in fact based on a profession \nof faith of our peoples, which it would be \ndangerous to treat lightly.\nForemost among the factors that have immobilized \nthe Organization, while dangers are mounting and \nall eyes  of the veto in the Security Council, \nwhich demonstrates the great gap that now exists \nbetween the spirit of the rule of unanimity and \nthe use made of it are fixed on us, is \nundoubtedly the abuse In view of this \ndevelopment, which is increasingly prejudicial to \nthe credibility and effectiveness of the United \nNations, it is urgent that the international \ncommunity reconsider the way in which the \nSecurity Council functions and subject it to a \nstrict review in the light of political ethics so \nas to restore to that body its original purpose. \nThe vitality of the United Nations and its \nability to hold high those principles that \nestablish its moral strength could then be \ndemonstrated by its ability to establish and \npreserve real universal peace.\nIf this session were to lead to a real \ndetermination on the part of Member States truly \nto make the United Nations the center for the \nharmonization of the actions of nations in the \nattainment of common ends, and if the most \npowerful of them were to reflect that \ndetermination in a change of attitude and \nconduct, then we would have reason to encourage \nour peoples' belief in the great future of the \nOrganization.\n"

        "file_text": "My delegation extends its warm congratulations to \nMr. Hollai on his unanimous election to the \npresidency of the thirty- seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly. It is my pleasure to have known \nhim for several years as a friend. His wide \nexperience, especially in the affairs of the \nUnited Nations, and his richly deserved \nreputation for skill, patience and the \naccumulated wisdom of experience constitute a \nguarantee that this session will be fruitful and \nconstructive. We look to his guidance and \nleadership in the resolution of the numerous \nproblems that exist at this most critical period \nfor the relations among nations.\n216.\tTo his predecessor, Mr. Kittani, who \nserved under similarly difficult circumstances \nand emerged with honour, my delegation also \nextends its congratulations.\n217.\tWe are delighted to welcome the new \nSecretary- General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. \nA thorough professional, he is universally \nregarded as a diplomat's diplomat, and we are \nhappy that he is now at the head of the \nOrganization. He has revealed to us the other \nside of his nature\u00f3courage and candour in \nadmitting the deficiencies of the United Nations, \ntogether with constructive suggestions which \nshould enable us to return to the first \nprinciples of the Charter. The Secretary-General \nhas seen us as in a mirror and asked us to take a \ncloser look at ourselves with a view to providing \nremedies for the ailments of the United Nations \nsystem. In expressing his views the Secretary- \nGeneral has reminded us that the strengthening of \nthe United Nations is the first order of business \nand that the performance of this task, difficult \nthough it may be, is indispensable to the \nsolution of the problems which threaten the peace \nof the world.\n218.\tIn the past we have often tended to \nsubstitute hyperbole for thought. Today the \nsituation has changed: hyperbole has turned into \nfact. The tragic events in Lebanon, serious \nproblems in themselves, reverberate throughout \nthe entire Middle East and raise anew the \nunwelcome prospects of wider conflict. The Middle \nEast is the vortex of crisis and, if the past is \na guide to the future, it will almost certainly \ninvolve other Powers in a conflict which may well \nbe larger and more destructive than any in the \nunending series of Middle East wars.\n219.\tAt the core of the problem is the issue \nof Palestine. The new and highly disturbing \nelement is a widely perceived effort to solve the \nproblem not through political means, but by the \nuse of force. This is clearly unacceptable, not \nonly in terms of Security Council resolution 242 \n(1967) but also in terms of the principles of the \nCharter.\n220.\tNo one is under any illusion that the \nMiddle East situation can be solved on the \ninstant, but it is quite correct to say that the \nend of armed conflict offers fresh opportunities \nfor a new start. The intractable problem is \ningrained psychological blocks which make \ndialogue more difficult than it should be. This \nis why negotiations must be a process\u00f3that is, a \ncontinuing dialogue which makes compromises \npossible. For this reason, my delegation welcomes \nthe initiatives of President Reagan and the \nTwelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez. We believe \nthat these are starting- points which in the \ncourse of the negotiating process could be \nmerged, in the legitimate interests of all the \nparties concerned.\n121. My delegation identifies with the positive \nelements of the United States proposal, which i\u00df \nbased on the Camp David accords ratified by the \nIsraeli Knesset, notably the immediate freeze on \nthe establishment of Jewish settlements and \nopposition to permanent control by Israel over \nthe West Bank and Gaza.\n222.\tMy delegation maintains, however, that \nthe full autonomy envisaged for these areas \nshould lead to the implementation of the right of \nself-determination by the Palestinian people and \nthe establishment of an independent State \ncoexisting with Israel. We hold, furthermore, \nthat at an appropriate stage in the process the \nPLO should be a party to the negotiations leading \nto permanent peace in the area.\n223.\tIt should be noted that neither the United States \nnor the Arab States have rejected each other's \nproposals. This fact leads to the hope, however \ntenuous, that each recognizes certain common \ndenominators in the proposals and to the further \nrecognition that in the existing circumstances, \nmodality is of the utmost importance.\n224.\tIt is Israel that has proved to be \nintransigent, possibly in the euphoria of \nmilitary success. But the one thing it must \nacknowledge is that its military victory over the \nPLO has, by a curious paradox, improved the \npolitical standing of the PLO. Because of the \nevents in Lebanon, Israel may find itself with \nits back against the wall, with foes but no \nfriends and isolated beyond hope of redemption. \nWe very much doubt that this is what Israel \nwants. We therefore call upon Israel to heed the \nvoices of reason and moderation. Too much blood \nhas been spilled in the Middle East and too many \nbitter tears shed for Israel to ignore the \ngrowing clamour for peace with justice and honour.\n225.\tKampuchea, on the other side of the \nworld, the hopeful sign is the formation of the \nCoalition of Kampuchean Nationalists under the \nleadership of Prince Samdech Norodom Sihanouk. \nThe formation of the Coalition signifies the \ndetermination of the Kampuchean nationalists to \nexpel the foreign forces from Kampuchean soil and \nenable its people to exercise freely their right \nto self-determination.\n226.\tIn deciding on a coalition the Kampuchean \nnationalists have assumed the mantle of legality, \na cloak denied them before although they fought \nand continue to fight, with valour, and in \ncircumstances of insuperable difficulties.\n227.\tIf they are to succeed in their \nendeavour, they will require material assistance \nfrom friends that have in this very Hall \ncondemned the illegitimate usurpation of \nKampuchea by Viet Nam. At this very moment \nthousands of Kampucheans await the call in the \ndetermined effort to recover their birthright. We \nhave every hope that, with the support of \nfriends, the Kampuchean coalition or the \ndemocratic Government of Kampuchea will in the \nend pave the way for the restoration of \nKampuchean sovereignty in free elections under \nthe supervision of the United Nations. In the \nface of this development, Viet Nam has a final \noption: to wipe out the fledgling and \nunder-supplied anti-Vietnamese forces before \ntheir movement gathers strength and momentum. \nThere are reports that this is precisely what it \nintends to do. It is in this light that the need \nfor support and assistance acquires urgency. We \nurge our friends to provide it.\n228.\tAnother potential source of tension in \nAsia is the uncertain and precarious relations \nbetween North and South Korea. Conflict in that \ndivided country is bound to have a severe impact \nin the strategic region of North-East Asia. \nTherefore we would encourage the parties \nconcerned to launch fresh initiatives which could \nlead towards the goal of reunification. President \nChun of South Korea has taken the initiative in \nthis regard and he deserves our support.\n229.\tI shall refrain from dealing with \nsubjects already touched upon by President Marcos \nwhen he addressed the Assembly the other day. I \nmight only add that, with respect to the \nlaunching of global negotiations on international \neconomic co-operation for development, we might \nremind ourselves once more that these \nnegotiations were conceived in the light of our \nshared concern over the steady deterioration of \nour economies. The need to establish a firm basis \nfor global economic progress that is equitable to \nall acquires added importance in view of the \ninadequate response of some of our institutions \nto the problems of contemporary economic \nrelations. In joint efforts and in an admirable \nspirit of compromise encouraged by the high-level \nmeetings in Cancun, Ottawa, Versailles and New \nDelhi, among others, we have managed to reach \nagreements on nearly all the outstanding points \nof difference.\n230.\tI recall that, at the signing of the \nBretton Woods Agreement in New Hampshire in 1946, \nwhen I signed the Agreement on behalf of the \nPhilippines, I then said:\n\\\"The economic pattern being drawn here was established \nby the victorious Allies, but this will not last \nlong. More members of the United Nations will \njoin in the future. Last year we signed a United \nNations Charter with 54 nations. I envision more \nthan 100 nations will join. In that case they \nwill decide that they want a new international \neconomic order.\\\"\nI said that in 1946, when we signed the Bretton \nWoods Agreement. That is now the North-South \ndialogue.\n231.\tAs we resume discussions at this session, \nwe diverge on only two points. To those who hold \ndiffering views on these two points, these are no \ndoubt of great importance, and their reluctance \nto accept either is therefore understandable. Yet \nthe potential reward of agreement and the \npossible penalties of failure to reach agreement \nare of such magnitude that they allow us few, if \nany, options. Therefore I would urge all parties \nto look beyond narrower preoccupations for the \nsake of the larger good. On the part of the \nPhilippines, my delegation is prepared to accept \nneither one nor the other formulation but both \nformulations in a common text. We do so in the \nfirm belief that in practice and application the \ntwo points are not necessarily irreconcilable. \nSuch an approach, in our view, would close the \nlast remaining gap and thus enable the \nlong-delayed global negotiations to get under way.\n232.\tTurning to another subject of a global \ncharacter, my delegation wishes to express its \ngratification at the completion of the work of \nthe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of \nthe Sea. It has involved many years of difficult \nnegotiations but it is certainty one of the more \nhopeful signs of the rich possibilities open in \nthe way of international cooperation.\n233.\tAlthough the Convention on the Law of the \nSea was not adopted by consensus, as originally \nplanned, this does not detract from the \nimportance of the work of the Conference. The \nmonumental document produced by the Conference \nwill, when it enters into force, become the \ninternational law, or the law of mankind, which \nwill govern the rights and duties of nations on \nthe uses of the waters of the earth. We in ASEAN \nare proud that the President who steered the \nConference on the Law of the Sea to that final \ndeclaration is Mr. Koh, the representative of \nSingapore, one of the nations of ASEAN. It is the \nearnest hope of my delegation, as well as of the \n130 nations which voted for the Convention, that \nin the interests of an orderly regime on the seas \nof the world those that did not find it possible \nto vote for it will in the future accede to it \nand thus make the Convention universal in fact as \nwell as in law.\n234.\tAllow me to return to the subject of the \nSecretary-General's report. It is a subject of \nextreme importance and should, if we are aware \nof our responsibilities, provoke a great deal of \nthought among us.\n235.\tFor years my delegation, having in mind \nArticle 109 of the Charter, which suggests the \nholding of a general conference for a review of \nthe Charter, has proposed that steps be taken \ntowards amending it. Unfortunately, the \nassumptions, not to speak of the circumstances, \nwhich inspired the founding fathers in framing \nthe Charter of the United Nations changed almost \nimmediately after its ratification. To press the \nissue of a general conference at this time would \nraise a political storm which we can ill afford \nin a time of persisting crises.\n236.\tIn recognition of the post-atomic \nrealities, the Assembly did approve the creation \nof a Special Committee on the Charter of the \nUnited Nations and on the Strengthening of the \nRole of the Organization in a search for ways and \nmeans of improving the functioning of the United \nNations within the framework of the present \nCharter. The Special Committee is now ready to \npresent to the Assembly the first concrete \ndocument resulting from a labour of nearly seven \nyears. The draft Manila declaration is a worthy \nattempt to provide specific interpretations of \nthe Charter's provisions on the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes and in this sense it \nconstitutes a watershed in the efforts of the \nOrganization to ensure the well- beingof peoples \nand the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity and in addition promote the progressive \ndevelopment of international law. If I read \nproperly between the lines of the \nSecretary-General's report, that is precisely \nwhat he means.\n237.\tIt has been said that there are two \nUnited Nations, The first United Nations has on \nbalance achieved remarkable progress in the \neconomic and social fields, notably in assisting \nthe younger nations in their first faltering \nefforts at development.\n238.\tBut the same cannot be said of the \nsecond, the other United Nations in its primary \nrole of maintaining international peace and \nsecurity. This is the theme which the \nSecretary-General develops in his bold and \nperceptive annual report. Thank God for a\nSecretary-General who sees through the \ndifficulties that we face. His suggestions cannot \nbe dismissed lightly for, as head of the \nOrganization, his voice carries special weight \nand authority.\n239.\tMy delegation is prepared to support the \nSecretary-General's suggestion for a meeting of \nthe Security Council \\\"at the highest possible \nlevel\\\" to discuss the problems which have \nimpaired the proper functioning of the \nOrganization as envisioned by its founders. I can \ndo no better in closing than to quote the words \nof the Secretary-General which we should always \nbear in mind in this Hall:\n\\\"... I am absolutely convinced that the United \nNations is indispensable in a world fraught with \ntension and peril. Institutions such as this are \nnot built in a day. They require constant \nconstructive work and fidelity to the principles \non which they are based.\n\\\"We take the United Nations seriously when we \ndesperately need it. I would urge that we also \nseriously consider the practical ways in which it \nshould develop its capacity and be used as an \nessential institution in a stormy and uncertain \nworld.\\\"\n240.\tAs one who has been deeply involved in \nthe United Nations from the very start and \nbitterly regretted its defeats and savoured its \ntriumphs, I compliment the Secretary-General on \nhis acute analysis of the United Nations. I share \nwith him the view that we should work \nunremittingly to build a sense of world community \non the firm foundation of a political and moral \norder which alone can lift mankind to the \\\"broad \nsunlit uplands\\\" of peace and security.\n"

        "file_text": "We are extremely pleased to see a representative \nof the sister Hungarian People's Republic elected \nto the high office of President of the current \nsession of the General Assembly. Your election, \nSir, testifies to the high standing of socialist \nHungary and its peaceful policy in world affairs, \nit is a personal tribute to you by the \ninternational community. We sincerely \ncongratulate you and wish you new successes in \nyour work for the benefit of the Organization.\nWe also address our friendly wishes for all \nsuccess and determination to the new Secretary- \nGeneral, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar.\nI wish to assure you, Mr. President, and the \nSecretary-General that Poland is as intent as \never on making a constructive contribution to the \nproceedings of another session of the General \nAssembly. The Polish delegation has come to the \npresent session at a critical juncture in \nPoland's history. Last December our country found \nitself confronted with an alternative: descent \ninto the abyss of fratricidal bloodshed, which \nwas the goal of the enemies of socialism and \nforces of anarchy, or temporary recourse to \nemergency measures to steer Poland out of a \nprofound crisis. The supreme interest of the \nnation and the State bade us, in compliance with \nthe Consti\u00actution of the Polish People's \nRepublic, to proclaim martial law. Its purpose, \nas we stated in the official notification in \npursuance of article 4 of the Interna\u00actional \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights was to \nreverse an excep\u00actionally serious public \nemergency threatening the life of the nation and \nto create the conditions for the effective \nprotection of Poland's sovereignty and \nindependence.\nWe are deeply convinced that the proclamation of \nmartial law ultimately serves not only the most \nvital interests of Poland but also peace and \nsecurity in Europe, for any dangerous development \nin the situation in my country, located as it is \nin the very heart of the European continent, \ncould have disas\u00actrous consequences, especially \nas various forces hostile to detente have pinned \non this hopes of under\u00acmining the existing \nrelationship of forces.\nThe origins of the causes and determinant factors \nwhich have led to the present situation in my \ncountry are complex. We have explained them on \nnumerous occasions; they are on record in the \nauthoritative statements of the supreme organs of \nState. Those abroad who were willing to \nunderstand them did understand. Others failed to \nshow sufficient good will and respect for the \nnorms of international relations to leave Polish \naffairs to Poles. For no one knows or can know \nbetter than the Poles themselves what is good and \nright for Poland.\nThe proclamation of martial law in Poland, \nratified in the Act passed by Parliament on 25 \nJanuary this year, complied with all the \nrequirements of the law. From first to last it \nwas a sovereign Polish, and solely Polish, \ndecision. No constitutional body, including the \nParliament and the Government it had duly \nconstituted, ceased to function as a consequence. \nThey all continue to shoulder their great \nresponsi\u00acbility for the destinies of the nation \nand the State, in a situation in which the \nsurvival and the future of independent Poland, \nfor which many generations have fought, were at \nstake. At the price of emergency measures \nintroduced on a temporary basis, Poland was \nspared a civil war. We know ourselves how high a \nprice this is, but it is not as supremely high as \nwould have been the loss, on a mass scale, of a \nfundamental human right\u2014the right to life. No one \nis entitled to try to raise this price. More than \nonce in the past Polish blood has been shed, and \nnot always in the interests of the people of \nPoland. We are learning the lessons of history.\nIn the passing months the Tightness of our \nindispensable decisions has been confirmed. They \nhalted the process of disintegration of the State \nand collapse of the economy; they stopped the \ndangerous drift towards internationalization of \nthe Polish crisis. Despite difficulties, the \ncountry's political and eco\u00acnomic life is \nproceeding towards normalization, to the \naccompaniment of a significant relaxation of the \nrigours of martial law.\nWe do see the possibility of lifting the existing \nrestrictions. We are determined to advance \npatiently and unswervingly along a path of \nnational dialogue and accord, guided by realism \nand good will. We shall consistently follow the \nprogramme of the ninth Con\u00acgress of the Polish \nUnited Workers' Party\u2014the socialist renewal of \npolitical, social and economic life, and the \nguarantees of socialist democracy. We shall \ndevelop it with absolute single-mindedness, with \nPolish hands and Polish minds and hearts.\nUnfortunately, some Western Government , in \nparticular the United States Administration, and \nalso imperialist propaganda centres, have decided \nto take advantage of developments in our country \nto start a violent and anti-Polish campaign. It \nis being conducted with a wilful incomprehension \nof Poland's raison d'etat and is based on a \none-sided, tendentious appraisal of the situation \nas well as on false stereotypes. It has made \nPoland an object of inadmissible inter\u00acference in \nits internal affairs and a target of economic \nblackmail. At the same time, all the weapons to \nbe found in the arsenal of a propaganda \naggression and instruction in subversion are \nbeing deployed against us. Indeed they bespeak \nattempts at a primitively conceived \nideologization of international relations and \ntranslation of the relics of McCarthyism into \nthis sphere.\nThe opponents of peace in our country seem to be \nturning a blind eye to the massive process of \npositive change that is taking place in all areas \nof public life. We are carrying out an economic \nreform, backed by a broad network of new \nlegislation. This includes important laws for the \nimplementation of the reform\u2014on State enterprises \nand workers' self- management in a State \nenterprise. The proclamation of martial law has \nin no way interrupted the work of legislative \norgans or the introduction of new legal \nregulations in major spheres of the country's \nsocial and economic life.\nA National Council for Culture and a \nParlia\u00acmentary Economic and Social Council, as \nwell as other organs pursuing important national \nissues, have been established. The Teachers' \nCharter, laws on higher education, on special \nrights of war veterans and on co-operatives were \npassed in Parliament. Intensive work continues on \npress legislation and on the law on trade unions.\nIn the light of the foregoing, how would one \nassess in the United Nations the attacks against \nPoland, launched and conducted with unusual \nvicious- ness by certain Governments? We have \nalready officially drawn these actions to the \nattention of the Governments on whose inspiration \nor from whose territories they are undertaken. \nMost of them, and especially radio programmes in \nthe Polish language, consist of propaganda, based \non attacking the country's internal order and \nincitement to change its socio-political system. \nIn recent months they have acquired all the \nfeatures of a propaganda aggression against\n, Poland. This cannot but amount to a \ncontravention of the purposes and principles of \nthe Charter of the United Nations and a violation \nof the norms formu\u00aclated so far by the \ninternational community in the Held of \ninformation and mass communication, including in \nparticular those of the United Nations and \nUNESCO. This has nothing to do with the right to \nfreedom of information and the concept of its \nbalanced flow. On the contrary, it represents \ntheir most evident abuse.\nIt is also hard to resist surprise at the \nbehaviour of certain Governments which seem \ndeliberately to obstruct the functioning of the \nPolish economy. Do they not realize that they are \nthereby weakening Poland's Payment capacities? \nAfter all, the country's discharge of its \nfinancial obligations depends on the rate at \nwhich its economic balance can be restored. As \nfar as this is concerned, we shall not be found \nwanting in resolve. We therefore welcome \ninitiatives for the development of equitable and \nmutually profitable co\u00acoperation with Poland. An \naltogether different approach, however, is taken \nby certain quarters in the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization [NATO]. When observing their \nunfriendly and, indeed, unrealistic attitude \ntowards Poland, when listening to their warnings \nand \\\"advice\\\" addressed to us, one is tempted to \nask: have these gentlemen by any chance forgotten \nto whom they are speaking, have they forgotten \nthat Poland is not part of NATO but it is and \nshall remain a sovereign and inseparable \ncomponent of the community of socialist States?\nIf the object of all anti-Polish actions is to \nforce us to back down and abandon the socialist \npath of development, we can only answer in the \nwords of Prime Minister Wojciech Jaruzelski:\n\\\"Poland has never yet bowed to a foreign \nulti\u00acmatum. Evidently not all abroad understand \nour history, our sense of pride and dignity. \nThere are contradictions and conflicts in our \ncountry., But it is not foreigners who are going \nto resolve them\\\".\nWe gratefully acknowledge the attitude of our \nfriends and partners who hurried forward with \nassistance at a difficult time for us, who \ndisplayed an understanding of our problems and \ncontinue to help us overcome them. Especially \npriceless is the aid of our neighbour and closest \nally, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. If \nfriends in need are friends indeed, so today \nagain we are realizing who our true friend is.\nWe reciprocate the understanding and sympathy of \nthe developing countries which perceive in our \nsituation a reflection of some of their own \nproblems. We see in their attitude a fellow \nfeeling of reciprocity for the numerous instances \nof Poland's resolute commitment to the struggle \nagainst colonialism, neo\u00accolonialism and \nimperialism.\nWe also appreciate the attitude of those Western \nStates which have not submitted to pressure and \ncontinue their normal relations with Poland.\nWe should like to believe that there will soon be \na return to dialogue with all our remaining \npart\u00acners on a basis of mutual respect for \nsovereignty and equality. In this spirit, we \nuphold as being still timely the appeal made, in \nJuly last year, by the ninth Congress of the \nPolish United Workers' Party to our partners in \nthe West to intensify frank dialogue and \nexploration of ways of averting cold-war threats \nand preserving what has so far been achieved by \ndetente. The internal affairs of any country, \nPoland included, must not be exploited for the \npurpose of exacerbating international tension and \nintensifying the arms race.\nI declare with absolute firmness: it is not \nPoland which is upsetting international \nrelations. They are being upset by those who wish \nto take advantage of the internal situation in \nour country as one of the pretexts to stifle \ndetente and impose a new \\\"cold war\\\" on the world, \nto divert attention from their own doings aimed \nagainst other nations and against peace.\nAn ominous spectre is haunting the world\u2014the \nspectre of nuclear war. Its danger is more \nevident today than ever before, as it is openly \nspoken of and is being prepared in the open. The \ngenuine aspirations of the peoples lie on the \nside of peace. The first and supreme duty of \npoliticians and Governments in the sphere of \ninternational relations is to keep awakening and \nperpetuating these aspirations and to do all they \ncan to banish for ever an apocalyptic vision of \nthe world. Whoever is unfaithful to this duty, \nwhoever ignores his own and his country's \nresponsibility for international peace and \nsecurity and embarks on generating tension, \nescalating armaments and preaching intolerance, \nis betraying the trust of his own people, is \nstriking at its peaceful aspirations and is no \nlonger fit to voice them.\nWe are witnessing disregard for the interests and \nsecurity of States. This is destroying the \nlabor\u00aciously assembled record of coexistence and \ndetente and undermining the recognized \nfoundations of inter\u00acnational security, including \nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. The year that has passed since \nthe thirty-sixth regular session of the General \nAssembly has regrettably seen the dangerous \ntrends in the world grow stronger and many of \nthem acquire the features of no less than \npolitical and military adventurism.\nObsession with nuclear superiority and pursuit of \nan illusory security through remorseless \nexpansion of military arsenals are intensifying \nthe arms spiral, destabilizing military balance \nand undermining interna\u00actional confidence.\nPeace is awaited in the Middle East. The bloody \nmassacre of the defenceless population in Beirut \nhas appalled the international community. A \nheinous crime has been committed before the eyes \nof the whole world. We most resolutely condemn it \nas well as its instigators, perpetrators and \nprotectors. The genuine aspirations for a just \nand durable peace, challenged by the aggressive \npolicies of Israel, have been expressed by the \nArab World at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference \nat Fez. The consistent policy of the socialist \nStates, which has recently been spelled out in \nthe six-point plan by Leonid Brezhnev, is aimed \nat ensuring lasting peace in that region of the \nworld. Peace in the Middle East cannot be a sum \ntotal of separatist endeavours and agreements but \na collective and comprehensive settlement that \nrespects the fundamental and just rights of all \nits parties, and in particular the right of the \npeople of Palestine to establish its own State.\nA tragic harvest is being reaped by the Iran-Iraq \nconflict. Events in that sensitive region today \ncheer the enemies of peace and of third world \nunity.\nThe pressure of retrograde relics of colonialism, \nneo colonialism and racism continues \nundiminished. In particular, the lack of a \nsettlement in Namibia that would accord with the \njust aspirations of its people fortifies the \nSouth African regime in its arrogance and \naggressiveness, not only there but also at home, \ntowards its own population, the victims of \napartheid Attempts are being made to spread \nconfronta\u00action and tension to all continents. The \ndangerous quality of the international situation \nat the beginning of the 1980s is not, however, a \nresult of factors beyond human control. More than \ntwo years ago, the States parties to the Warsaw \nTreaty noted in their declara\u00action that the main \nthreat to peace and detente lies in the arms \nrace, encouraged by cold-war quarters and \nmilitary and industrial complexes, as well as in \nthe attempts to revive a policy based on a \nposition of strength. This appraisal is \nsubstantiated by the present policies of ruling \ncircles of NATO which are at variance with the \nbasic requirements of international realities and \nare founded on an over-estimation of their own \ncapabilities and an under estimation of those of \nothers. Serious threats arise from the \nincreasingly frequent attempts to globalize the \nNATO theatre of operations.\nThe picture of the contemporary world is not made \nup only of disturbing trends and actions. The \nworld's progress towards peace is actively \naffected nowadays by a constructive factor\u2014the \ncommunity of socialist States. Faithful to the \nunchanged guide\u00aclines of their foreign policy, \nmembers of our com\u00acmunity continue persistently \nto oppose the policy of armament and to \ncounteract the threat of nuclear war. They \nresolutely declare themselves in favour of a \npeaceful and just settlement of the problems of \nthe world of today, for detente and the \nstrengthening of international security, the \nelimination of conflicts and trouble spots, as \nwell as the expansion of all-round equitable and \nmutually beneficial international co\u00acoperation.\nIt would be hard, too, not to perceive the \nprofound interest in expanding constructive \nco\u00acoperation displayed by the non-aligned, \ndeveloping and neutral States. Longings to remove \nthe nuclear threat are surfacing with growing \nforce among broad sections of the public, in the \nactivities of social forces and religious \nmovements.\nDespite their adversaries, detente tendencies \nhave been lastingly embodied in the record of \naccom\u00acplishments of the international community. \nWe realize that in today's divided world, detente \nis variously interpreted. But to consider it \nsolely in terms of short- term gains and losses \nand to treat it expediently as a political \ninstrument that can be discarded once it has \nceased to serve one's momentary advantage reveals \na profound lack of understanding of the laws of \nthe contemporary world. For us it is the only \neffective instrument in the search for solutions \nto pressing world problems and for abiding \nguarantees of peace. Indeed, these accord with \nboth the vital desires and interests of the \nPolish people and the requirements of progress in \ninternational relations. Polish foreign policy \nremains one of steadfast actions on behalf of \ndetente and broad international dialogue. We have \nborne witness to this from the very beginning of \nPoland's membership in the United Nations, \nincluding our active participation in the work of \nthe Security Council.\nIn a few days 25 years will have passed since \nfrom this very rostrum Adam Rapacki presented a \nPolish plan, known by his name, for the \ndenuclearisation of Central Europe.\nUnceasing in our efforts, several years later we \npresented a momentous regional initiative to \nconvene a European security conference. Its great \nsuccess should be attributed to the perseverance \nand single- mindedness of the socialist States \nand the under-standing of its significance by \nother participants. Consummated by the Final Act \nof Helsinki, the process of the Conference on \nSecurity and Co\u00acoperation in Europe stands out as \none of the most optimistic elements of \ncontemporary international politics and an \nimportant confirmation of the genuine \nopportunities that exist for a positive evolution \nof East-West relations, which exert their \ndecisive impact on the general climate of world \naffairs.\nThe closeness of Europe's impingement on our \ndestinies in no way obscures our perception of \nthe wider international horizon, with all its \ndeterminants and needs. The interdependence of \nindividual regions and the world as a whole has \nbeen the guiding factor in a number of Polish \ninitiatives of a global nature, to mention only \nthe Declaration on the Preparation of Societies \nfor Life in Peace, adopted by the General \nAssembly in resolution 33/73. Implementation in \ngood faith by all States of its weighty \nprovisions would help to build firm foundations \nfor peace and co-operation, free from prejudice, \narrogance and ill will.\nThe lasting record of Poland's foreign policy \ncomprises the process of the normalization of our \nrelations with the Federal Republic of Germany \ninitiated by the treaty of December 19707 That \ntreaty is of historic significance for the two \nnations as well as for a constructive development \nof the European situation and the security of our \ncontinent. Practical implementation of its \nprinciples has yielded positive results, both for \nthe two parties and for Europe at large. Poland \nis invariably motivated by the need for that \nprocess to be continued and, for its part, is \nready to make a further contribution to its \nfavourable advance. We expect also that the \nFederal Republic of Germany in its policy in \nrelation to Poland will still be guided by its \nobligations under the treaty and by the supreme \ninterests of European security and peace.\nThroughout the history of the Organization we \nhave often heard it asked from this rostrum: what \nmust be done to save mankind from the tragedy \nthat would result from negative actions of \ncertain States if not checked in time? We ask the \nquestion again, conscious as we are of its acute \nrelevance and urgency. The most pressing task at \npresent is to prevent a further deterioration of \nthe situation which, inter alia, amounts to \nbreaking the deadlock in disarmament negotiations \nand talks aimed at eliminating conflicts.\nThe Polish Government has therefore par\u00acticularly \nwelcomed the commencement of Soviet-American \ntalks on the limitation and reduction of nuclear \narms in Europe and on strategic arms limitation \nand their reduction. They both fit the formula, \nfrom which all stand to benefit, of strengthening \ninterna\u00actional peace and security, that is, \nlimitation and containment of the arms race as \nwell as disarmament, which the Organization \nconsiders to be the most important problem facing \nthe world today. The world awaits rapid and \nconcrete results from these talks.\nIt '<= also in the perspective of results that we evaluate the second special \nsession of the General Assembly devoted to \ndisarmament. We do not con\u00acceal the fact that we \nfind them insufficient by far. Nevertheless, the \nfact that the session was held in so complicated \nan international situation can be regarded as a \npositive development. Moreover, it witnessed an \nevent of the calibre of an historic pre\u00accedent: \none of the nuclear Powers assumed a solemn \nobligation not to be the first to use nuclear \nweapons. It would be hard to exaggerate the \nmomentousness of that Soviet decision. If some \nother Powers see in it alleged undertones of \npropaganda, we can only encourage them to make \nsimilar \\\"propaganda\\\" by pledging also that they \nwill not be the first ever to use nuclear weapons.\nThe objectives of the special session were \nfurther helped by other important Soviet \ndecisions, including the unilateral moratorium on \ndeployment of medium-range missiles in the \nEuropean part of the USSR and a unilateral \nreduction of a considerable number of such \nmissiles. Taken in conjunction with the whole \ncomplex of issues put forward by the Soviet \nUnion, at the twelfth special session, : the \nmemorandum entitled \\\"Averting the growing nuclear \nthreat\\\"* and in the proposal entitled \\\"Basic \nprovisions of a convention on the prohibition of \nthe development, production and stockpiling of \nchemical weapons and on their destruction\\\",* all \nthese decisions and pro\u00acposals add up to a new \nand constructive impetus enhancing an effective \ndisarmament dialogue on a basis of equality, \nreciprocity and undiminished secu\u00acrity of any \nparty.\n133. For the time being, even partial progress in \narms limitation and disarmament can exert a \npositive influence on the growth of the sense of \nsecurity of States and thus on their readiness to \nenter into dialogue and deal with critical \npolitical problems. Among issues of primary \nimportance that also appear on the agenda of this \nsession are banishing the danger of an outbreak \nof nuclear war, eliminating chemical weapons, and \nforestalling an arms race in outer space In the \nlight of the insane doctrines concerning the \npossibility of limited or local nuclear war, and \neven of winning a nuclear war, the Organization \nis facing tasks of a sempiternal order.\nIn the province of closest interest to us, we are \nin favour of promptly restoring the business-like \nnature of the proceedings of the Madrid session \nof the Con\u00acference on Security and Co-operation \nin Europe, including the adoption of a decision \nto convene a conference on confidence-building \nmeasures and disarmament in Europe. That would \nalso facilitate progress in the Vienna Talks on \nthe Mutual Reduction of Forces, Armaments and \nAssociated Measures in Central Europe.\nOther political issues await settlement, and they \ncan be well served by the constructive proposals \nof the Sixth Conference of the Ministers for \nForeign Affairs of the Lao People's Democratic \nRepublic, the People's Republic of Kampuchea and \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam relating to \nthe situation in their region and especially to \nnon-interference in the internal affairs of the \nPeople's Republic of Kampuchea and recognition of \nits rightful place in the United\nNations.\tStill of great significance are\nthe initiatives of the Government of Afghanistan \nconcerning the situation in South West Asia and \nalso the proposals of the Korean People's \nDemocratic Republic for the settlement of the \nKorean question. They all have our full support.\nViewing international security in purely military \nterms no longer meets the requirements of the \ntimes. The Government of Poland believes that the \npresent- day catalogue of confidence-building \nmeasures will be incomplete until and unless it \nincorporates effective economic \nconfidence-building measures. Their object should \nbe to counteract the transfer of tensions to the \nsphere of economic and trade co-operation and so \nenable it to become a permanent material \nfoundation for the process of detente and a \nfactor easing political strain. Our concept of \neconomic confidence-building measures encompasses \nthe prohibition of unlawful economic restrictions \nand discrimination as well asthe pursuit by \nGovernments of an active policy to induce \neconomic units to discharge in full obligations \nincurred under relevant international \ninstruments. We consider the adoption of \nlarge-scale and long-term projects in the basic \nfields of international economic co-operation to \nbe an important element of economic confidence \nbuilding.\nWe are convinced that the elaboration and \nsubsequent adoption and implementation of a set \nof economic confidence-building measures would \nalso make an important contribution to the \nfurtherance of the progressive ideas and \nobjectives of the new international economic \norder, and of sound solutions within the global \nnegotiations.\nThe existence of the United Nations and its \naccomplishments and experience are proof that a \ncom\u00acprehensive programme of positive action on an \ninter\u00acnational scale is feasible even today, when \nvarious adverse developments in the world have \nled to. the weakening of the Organization as a \nrecognized political authority and forum for the \neasing of conflicts. Con\u00acvincing reference to \nthat effect has been made by the \nSecretary-General in his enlightening report on \nthe work of the Organization.\nThe United Nations grew out of the good win of \nnations and Governments. Whenever that good will \nis lacking, the threshold of its capacity for \neffective action is lowered. To act in the \ninterests of strengthening the role of the United \nNations and the principles of its Charter is to \ninvest in it the confidence and political good \nwill of Member States. The success of the \nfounding fathers of the United Nations 37 years \nago arose Rom the way in which, after the great \ntragedy of destruction and suffering, the common \ninterest prevailed over that of the individual. \nThe desire to secure one-sided advantages today \nonly too often takes precedence over the common \ngood. We have to overcome this tendency and \nreturn to the main underlying ideas of the \nOrganization. Poland is ready to continue to act \nfor the benefit of the supreme common purposes of \nthe United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "3.\t On behalf of my Minister for Foreign Affairs and on my own behalf I should like to extend to you, Sir, my warm congratulations on your unanimous election to the high office of President of this session of the General Assembly. Your election is a recognition of your talent and experience in the conduct of international affairs and a tribute to Hungary a country with which Sri Lanka has warm and cordial relations. I should also like to thank your predecessor, Mr. Ismat Kittani, who presided so well over the last session of the General Assembly. Similarly, I wish to convey to the Secretary-General our warm appreciation for his unrelenting labors in the cause of the United Nations.\n4.\tWe are about to end this year's general debate, during which we have been privileged to hear distinguished leaders from several Member States. I make this statement on behalf of my delegation today only\n \nbecause Sri Lanka is on the eve of an election, when its people will, under their Constitution, exercising their freedom and the universal franchise which they have enjoyed for 51 years, elect a President. That freedom, that democratic right to elect their leader and their Government at prescribed intervals, is a quality which we cherish and proclaim with some justifiable pride.\n5.\tThe leaders who have addressed the Assembly on the international situation, while not agreed on the causes, have been unanimous concerning the gravity of the situation that now prevails. They have spoken of the continuing armed conflicts in some regions, the heightened confrontation in others and the cease-fires and the fragility of the peace obtaining elsewhere. They have also spoken of the dire poverty and hunger of many millions of the world's people, the plight of millions of refugees, the millions of unemployed and the world's economy in recession. And they have spoken of the patent incongruity of the continuing expenditure of billions on the arms race ostensibly to provide security but in truth leading us inexorably to a nuclear holocaust.\n6.\tWe Member States bring these issues before the Organization, having established it to resolve these very problems. But, as to the present state of the Organization and its capacity to fulfill that task, the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization [A/37II] could not have been more forthright. He tells us of the disarray in the United Nations system of collective security and describes the present situation as \\\"perilously near to a new international anarchy\\\". He could not have spoken otherwise, having seen the blatant disregard of principles of the Charter and the defiance of resolutions, not just of the General Assembly but also of the Security Council, and witnessed a Security Council incapable of enforcing its own fiat.\n7.\tWe have come to this sorry pass because Member States pursue their exclusive national interests with scant regard for the obligations they have assumed under the Charter. And when this malaise overcomes the permanent members of the Security Council, as the Secretary-General says in his report, \\\"we bring upon ourselves a global catastrophe and find ourselves without institutions effective enough to prevent it\\\".\n8.\tIn his report the Secretary.-General asks Member States and the Security Council tr take cognizance of situations and act before they reach the point of crisis. He seeks the support of its more influential members to ensure respect for the Organization's decisions. Several leaders have commended the Secretary-General for his appraisal. We can only hope that Member States will be no less fervent in their \nsupport for him when he acts in accordance with the responsibilities vested in him by the Charter.\n9.\tIn June this year we assembled for the twelfth special session of the General Assembly, the second special session on disarmament. It is not speaking with hindsight to say that the circumstances under which that session met were most propitious. We were meeting to talk about disarmament while three separate wars were being fought, the human and material costs and consequences of which are yet to be assessed. For months before and during the special session popular sentiment, wherever that could be openly expressed, was persistent and vocal in reminding us of how much was expected of us. After five weeks of protracted exchanges we could only conclude with a feeble document recalling our renewed commitment to the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly. It has been left to the General Assembly to determine the date of the next special session on the subject. As we said at the concluding meeting of the second special session on disarmament [28th meetingJ, we were even more dismayed by the attitude of some who believed that they had in 1978 conceded too much and who sought to retract the commitments they had undertaken.\n10.\tThough nuclear disarmament has been acknowledged as the first priority, according to the rationale it is the deterrent effect of the nuclear weapon that has ensured the security of many and the fragile peace. Our response remains that peace through the nuclear deterrent has been sustained, not at the progressively reduced level envisaged but at an accelerated and competitive level of nuclear destructiveness. We can therefore only reiterate that security through the nuclear deterrent and the reversal of the nuclear arms race are quite incompatible. In June we suggested that if the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons was not acceptable we should at least demand a joint or individual declaration by nuclear-weapon States that they would not be the first to use nuclear weapons. Such an undertaking had long been given by one nuclear-weapon State, namely, China, and at the second special session on disarmament we welcomed a similar declaration by the Soviet Union. Similar or reciprocal declarations from the other nuclear-weapon States would have their own consequences as regards our goal of nuclear disarmament.\n11.\tAgain at the special session we recalled the somewhat tedious history of the tripartite negotiations on a nuclear test-ban treaty and concluded by reiterating the appeal made in 1978 that, pending the conclusion of a test-ban treaty, there should at least be a moratorium on nuclear tests. The renewed efforts of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva have been slow, and it is in this context that we welcome the initiative of the Soviet delegation at this session of the General Assembly calling for the immediate cessation and prohibition of nuclear weapon tests, including a moratorium on peaceful nuclear explosions [see AI37/243]. This proposal will receive our most careful consideration.\n12.\tSri Lanka was privileged to be the Asian country that transmitted a message by satellite to the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and\nPeaceful Uses of Outer Space, held in August this year in Vienna. The President of Sri Lanka, Mr. J.R. Jayawardene, addressing that gathering via satellite from Colombo, stated:\n\\\"The potential of satellite technology for destructive uses is the greatest challenge which humanity faces today. We have the word of every astronaut and cosmonaut who looked at planet earth from space that their first response to this view of our planet was a profound realization not only of its smallness in the vastness of the universe but also of the oneness of the human condition. The greatest irony of our time is that, even with that perception of our human bond, nations could think in terms of using that very same space to deny that bond. It would be man's greatest injustice to man, man's greatest insult to science to view outer space as another arena of conflict, another medium of mutual destruction. On behalf of all the peoples of our world and in the name of all humanity, I voice our profound hope that this Conference will succeed in averting that folly.\n13.\tWe believe that those sentiments will find a universal echo; and during this session Sri Lanka will join with other delegations and will give of its best to help preserve peace in outer space.\n14.\tDuring the last 30 years, no General Assembly session has concluded its business without adopting more than one resolution on the Middle East and Palestine. For over two years now, we have been suspending without closure an emergency special session on Palestine; the foresight of having resorted to that procedure has become increasingly evident. This year we meet in somewhat different circumstances. Having invaded and occupied more territory in Lebanon, including part of its capital, Israel advanced into west Beirut, ostensibly to enforce order there after the assassination of the President-elect of Lebanon. Having demanded and obtained the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], Israel was in effective control of west Beirut. The world was aghast when an internal faction in Lebanon carried out the massacre of defenseless Palestinians herded into refugee camps. The estimates of the numbers killed have been given in the hundreds, but they are believed to be too low and the truth about the scope of the violence may never be known.\n15.\tThe parallels and the ironies the diaspora, the ghettos, the branding as \\\"terrorists\\\", the annexations and now a holocaust are too obvious to avoid mentioning. The death-camps in Europe hastened the acceptance of a State for the Jewish people, and we had to have the genocide and massacres of Shatila and Sabra to convince the unbelieving that the Palestinians also have a right to a homeland, to peace and security. Their heroism and sacrifices have also become a legend in our time. I might conclude my remarks on this subject with an expression of hope that the adoption of the proposals by Arab leaders at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez and the initiative shown by the leadership of other crucial countries may serve as a new beginning to a solution of this problem.\n16.\tFor over a decade, Sii Lanka, together with the other littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean region, has sought to implement the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. We had hoped that, with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and other maritime users, the Conference on the Indian Ocean scheduled to be held at Colombo in 1981 would mark a significant beginning for the implementation of the Declaration. That conference was postponed to the first half of 1983. At no time have we taken the position that a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean will materialize overnight from one conference. Rather, we regard the conference in Colombo as the commencement of a process to include the consideration of such remaining issues as could not be completed during the preparatory meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean.\n17.\tThe view that the political and security climate must reach some hypothetical degree of improvement, and the recurring tendency to link every initiative with global strategies, should not be applied selectively. No international conference or negotiation has been deferred until circumstances were ideal, or nearly ideal. It seems appropriate to ask whether the Treaty of Tlatelolco would have come about if its pioneer, Mr. Garcia Robles, had deferred that project until today. On the contrary: conferences and negotiations have been held in the midst of hostilities. None among us would claim the ability to forecast that the future holds the promise of better times. If anything, what we have heard during this session is that the international situation has worsened yet negotiations in other areas are taking place. As I speak here today, my delegation believes that it is still possible for the Ad Hoc Committee to place before the General Assembly a draft resolution that will enable the conference to be held in accordance with General Assembly resolution 36/90 of December 1981.\n18.\tWe have waited four years for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which was to have made Namibia free. The five Western States whose initiative made that resolution possible have been conducting negotiations with the Government of South Africa. The United Nations has been in readiness to play its own part with the administrative and operational arrangements. However, at the pre-implementation meeting at Geneva in January 1981 the Government of South Africa showed that it had undergone a significant change of attitude, a change which even some of the Western contact group found it difficult to entertain. The cease-fire and the free elections, which were to bring about the independence of Namibia, were delayed by new conditions which had little relation to the mandate given under resolution 435 (1978). While it is sought to accommodate these new conditions, the work entrusted to the United Nations is held in abeyance. There have been reports that even the Tumhalle group which was installed in Windhoek has been found by the powers in Pretoria to be less than equal to its task. Once again the authenticity of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] as the sole representative of the Namibian people has been demonstrated. What does provide a reason for concern is the continuing sensitivity being shown towards a Government whose apartheid policies have received universal opprobrium. Four years of prevarication is more than the international community can countenance. We would ask only that the United Nations resume the role conferred on it by Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\n19.\tThere are three other issues on which my delegation considers it necessary to comment. Two of them concern the geographic area from which we come  Afghanistan and Kampuchea while the third concerns Cyprus. The non-aligned movement, of which Sri Lanka is a member, regards non-interference in internal affairs as a cardinal principle. When interference takes the form of entry by foreign troops into another's territory, the threshold has, literally and metaphorically, been crossed. That has been the situation in those three countries. While those foreign troops remain, we can take no position other than that which we take year after year in the draft resolutions that come before the General Assembly. In doing so we are not only upholding a principle, but also resorting to what is perhaps the only safeguard available to smaller States. We wish for the success of the efforts now being made by the Secretary-General to bring about a political settlement in Afghanistan, and we trust that they will proceed with greater momentum. We hope that the new coalition Government for Kampuchea will offer a new approach. In Cyprus, which has had to endure the longest occupation, we would ask that the inter-communal talks prove to be more productive than they have been hitherto and that the Members of the Organization will remain committed to their own resolutions calling for the restoration to Cyprus of all its territory, free from external interference.\n20.\tThe time has now come to state clearly that no matter how one describes or determines the mighty on this planet, their might is of little consequence if it is exercised to the neglect and the detriment of the small and the weak. It is our view that following the near total failure of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris in 1975 we have today perhaps one last opportunity to sort out our international economic relations in a global process and thus prevent anarchy. Self-reliance is but one aspect of the attempt to bring some order and reason to international economic relations. The case for reasonable conduct through international agreements and regulations cannot be dismissed as dangerous thinking promoted by third world countries in an attempt but a vain attempt to claim their share of the pie. A joint effort at achieving an equitable new order is an imperative if we are to continue together. The Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the Organization, has cautioned against those short-term advantages which sometimes dictate political solutions to problems. That same caution needs to be applied in the field of economic relations. The short-term advantage has too often proved to lead to long-term disaster.\n21.\tSri Lanka has without doubt reaped many benefits from its membership of the United Nations system as a whole. It is a matter for regret, however, that those aspects of the Charter devoted to the economic and social well-being of the peoples that are\nto be saved from the scourge of war have been increasingly neglected through failure on the part of the international community to use the United Nations system as a positive instrument for economic and social development.\n22.\tWe have identified the need for a North-South dialog, a South-South dialog, an East-West dialog and so on. This identification is perhaps a useful method for setting about to solve problems of international economic relations. We do not, however, have an identity of views on the ingredients for the solution of those problems. In his report the Secretary-General has proposed a high-level meeting of members of the Security Council in order to solve certain problems. We see in this a vital link with the need for a global round of negotiations on economic affairs. If we fail to see that link, the vitality of the multilateral process will become eroded and it will be open to grave danger.\n23.\tConsiderable efforts have been made by the developing countries to use existing institutions in order to achieve the kind of harmonization which is a cherished goal of the Charter. We have endeavored to bring the kind of new thinking to the World Bank system that will help it keep pace with the constantly changing perceptions of economic development. At the joint annual meetings of the Board of Governors of the World Bank, held in Ontario in September, the Minister of Finance of Sri Lanka made the following observation:\n\u201cThese institutions are not independent entities living and moving in a world apart. They are creatures of the international economic environment. And it is policy-makers and politicians who shape and reshape that environment.\\\"\n24.\tSince 1963 UNCTAD has been a central forum for the determination of development priorities. In retrospect, considerable value should be attached to UNCTAD as a forum for negotiations and as one which has lived up to expectations, rather more than did the first session of UNCTAD, which resulted in the creation of an international trade organization. Similarly, GATT continues to be a focal point for some of the distressing features of disharmony in international trade. It is ironic that laissez-faire thinking, which was mooted as a framework for improvement in trade and in trade-related matters for the world as a whole, has today resulted in modifications to the detriment of third world countries at a time when barriers to trade constitute one of the biggest impediments to advancement in this field. The social factors that prompt protectionism and what are termed unfair trade practices are understandable. It is this very fact that should prompt the international leadership to undertake a searching examination of the issue, with a view to changing attitudes on a global scale in order, to prevent a breakdown in relations.\n25.\tWe have not despaired at the immensity of the problems that face us. We believe that despite the causes for gloom we have the capacity to pursue action in limited areas and that this will enable us to maintain our faith in the United Nations system. At the 14th meeting of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka proposed an international year of shelter for the\nhomeless. If food, clothing and shelter still remain the basic priorities for the creation of a better quality of life for people, then it is undeniable that the focusing of attention on housing will result in some good action by the United Nations. The proposal for an international year, which has been set for 1987 [resolution 36171], now needs the active support of all Member States to make a success.\n26.\tWe are not bereft of evidence of the success of determined international effort to bring about greater order in the world community, enhancing the role of and respect for the United Nations. We arc about to conclude the marathon talks undertaken by the nations of this world in concluding the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.3 This was an outstanding exercise in the use of this forum for the harmonization of views. Through the Convention the international community has also recognized that there are areas of this planet that are beyond national jurisdiction and that they constitute the common heritage of mankind. We have no doubt that in years to come these positive achievements will help guide our thinking in other areas of endeavor.\n27.\tWe shall conclude this session of the General Assembly with the customary package of wide- ranging resolutions. That reminds us of yet another observation in the Secretary-General's report: the tendency for Governments to act as though the adoption of a resolution absolved them from further responsibility. We also know of the tasks imposed on the Secretary-General, who is obliged to follow up the implementation of those resolutions, and the self- imposed burdens on national Governments that are called upon to respond to the queries, information, action and so on that are the sequel to those resolutions. Implementing decisions and policies of the Organization and motivating action by national Governments are admittedly no easy tasks considering the variety of conditions obtaining at national levels. There have been extensive studies and remedies and much research prescribed which have yet to influence our work here. We are not lacking in awareness of the problem, but perhaps a beginning could be made through a more understanding and responsible approach to our work in the Assembly.\n28.\tI shall conclude by assuring the Assembly of my delegation's co-operation in this endeavor.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "115.\tMr. President, the General Assembly in \nhaving unanimously decided to entrust you with \nthe task of guiding its work has thereby paid a \nresounding tribute to you personally and to your \ncountry. It is Tunisia's agreeable duty to join \nin this tribute from this rostrum. At the same \ntime, the General Assembly has conferred upon you \na particularly heavy and delicate responsibility. \nFully cognizant of the very exceptional gravity \nof the questions to be debated at this session, \nTunisia is convinced that you will \nwhole-heartedly guide our work with all the \ncompetence and devotion and all the effectiveness \nand objectivity of which we know you are capable. \nIn expressing its warm con\u00acgratulations to you, \nmy delegation would like to assure you of its \ncomplete co-operation.\n116.\tI should also like to take this \nopportunity to pay to your predecessor, Mr. Is \nmat Kittani, the tribute he deserves for the \nskill, objectivity and courtesy which he \ndisplayed with admirable consistency throughout \nthe past year. His presidency will remain a \nmatter of pride for his country, as well as all \nthe other Arab, Moslem and non-aligned countries.\n117.\tThe year that has just elapsed has shown \nus once again that developments in the \ninternational situation since the previous \nsession have not registered any appreciable \nprogress. What is more, the conditions under \nwhich the present session is being held are \nmarked by an even greater and more disturbing \ngravity.\n118.\tOne need only observe the current \npervasive disorder in international relations to \nrealize the risks the world is running. Whether \nit be the persistence of hotbeds of tension which \nwe have not managed to put out or the emergence \nof new conflicts which we have not been able to \nprevent, whether it be the growing imbalance in \ninternational economic relations and their \ndisastrous consequences for the third-world \ncountries, whether it be, finally, the problems \nof security and the all-out arms race, inevitably \nwe are faced with a turn of events extremely \ndifficult to control.\n119.\tWhen the elementary principles of \ninternational law are daily trampled underfoot \nthroughout the world, when clear-cut acts of \naggression are committed with impunity and in \ndefiance of unanimously admitted standards, when \ngenocide is premeditated and con\u00acfessed openly \nwithout the guilty party being ener\u00acgetically and \nimmediately thwarted in its dark designs and when \ninternational peace and security are so sorely \nundermined without the Security Council \nshouldering its primary responsibility in timely \nand appropriate fashion, we are entitled to feel \ndoubts, indeed anguish, about the effectiveness \nand viability of the international order we have \ntoday.\n120.\tGiven that international relations are \nbased more and more on the principle of \ninterdependence and that the conflicts and crises \nwhich affect one group of parties automatically \nhave an impact on the interests of other parties, \nwe are forced to the conclusion that we stand \ntogether. We are at one concerning how we wish to \nbuild the world for ourselves and for future \ngenerations. We are at one concerning the \nconse\u00acquences of any serious decision which \nvarious parties may take unilaterally. It is here \nin this Hall, and nowhere else, it is within the \nOrganization that this solidarity must be \nexpressed and made real, and it is on the basis \nof the principles of the Charter that the unity \nof our goals and the unity of our action can be \nshown.\n121.\tThis is to assume that the Organization \nis strong and respected, that it can be the \nconscience of the world and at the same time a \nrecourse for those among us who are victims of \nany violation whatsoever of the principles to \nwhich we adhere. In a word, it is to assume that \nthe Organization is able to say what is right and \nto see that right is respected.\n122.\tBut what in fact do we see? Each time \nthere is a flagrant violation of the Charter, the \nSecurity Council, to which the Member States have \nentrusted the main responsibility for maintaining \ninternational peace and security, can only \ndiscuss the question. However, we must note that \nthe veto, which has been used and abused more and \nmore in recent times, all too often puts a stop \nto all discussion and thus to any action by the \nCouncil. When it is not the veto which obstructs \nthe Council, it is the party complained of, \nwhich, with disturbing calmness and awareness of \nimpunity, immediately rejects the resolution \nwhich has been adopted and declares null and void \nany initiative by the Council. In the words of \nthe Secretary- General, we are perilously near to \na new international anarchy.\n123.\tIn this situation, which is more and more \ndangerous for international relations, Tunisia \nhas never missed an opportunity, especially of \nlate during its term as a member of the Security \nCouncil, as Well as in the General Assembly\u2014of \nshowing its concern and calling for widespread \nawareness of that danger. My country, which has \nalways given its full and unreserved support to \nall United Nations efforts to carry out its \nmission for international peace and security and \nto establish a better balance in economic \nrelations, recog\u00acnizes that the United Nations \nhas played an extremely important role, \nparticularly in facilitating the irreversible \nprocess of decolonization and in clearly stating \nthe relationship between the process of \ndecolo\u00acnization and the process of development. \nMy country considers, indeed, that the \nOrganization is the unique and irreplaceable \ninternational forum for negotiation and, when \nnecessary, for decision. This explains our fear \nand concern when we see the state of semi \nparalysis in which the United Nations finds \nitself. It also explains our great satisfaction \n5n seeing our own concerns reflected in the \nreport on the work of the Organization submitted \nby the Secretary-General.\n124.\tIt is happy and comforting to know that \nless than a year after taking office the \nSecretary-General has officially pointed out, \nwith remarkable clarity and authority, the \ndangers which threaten the United Nations, and at \nthe same time the world. It is equally comforting \nthat the Secretary-General has taken care to put \nforward specific suggestions and proposals for \nretrieving, before it is too late, a situation \nwhich if left alone would inevitably lead to the \ndecline of the Organization.\n125.\tAware of the consistent position taken by \nTunisia in this connection, a position which we \nhad the opportunity of stating again during his \nrecent visit to us, the Secretary-General will \nnot be surprised to hear Tunisia confirm to him \nfrom this rostrum its total confidence, as well \nas its support for any action to strengthen the \nOrganization and defend its high and noble goals, \nbecause in my country legality is a watchword, \nand international legality is conceived of as an \nintangible principle which must necessarily \nunderlie the conduct of international relations.\n126.\tIt is to international legality that \nTunisia and its President have appealed each time \nsome conflict in the world has had to be \nresolved. Recent events in the crucible of the \nMiddle East have brought to the forefront the \nconstant concern of President Bourguiba to endow \nhis thinking and his actions with the neces\u00acsary \nlegitimacy, on the basis of the sacrosanct \nprinciple of legality.\n127.\tWhat has been called the Bourguiba Plan \nfor a just solution to the Palestinian problem is \nbased in fact on a return to and use of the \ninternational legal principles defined as early \nas 1947 which, regardless of their imperfections, \ncould not be rejected by anyone, least of all by \nthose whose birth and very existence depend on \nthem\u2014but those are the very people who today show \nthe most complete scorn for international law, \nthe principles of the Charter and the entire \nOrga\u00acnization, adopting an attitude of defiance \nand arrogance and ignoring the decisions and \nrecommendations of the international community.\n128.\tThe General Assembly is beginning its \nwork at a time when the entire world has just \nwitnessed a frightful massacre carried out in \ncold blood in Pal\u00acestinian refugee camps by armed \nbands trained and financed by Tel Aviv, in the \npresence and with the complicity of the Israeli \noccupation forces which had encircled the Sabra \nand Shatila camps. The wave of Shock at this \nhateful crime has led to consternation, horror \nand outrage throughout the world. There is not \nthe slightest doubt that by moving into west \nBeirut, in violation of the agreements reached \nthrough the intermediary of the Habib mission, \nthe Israeli leaders bear the whole responsibility \nfor this crime against humanity. Under the \npretext of protecting the civilian population of \nBeirut, they in fact allowed their legion of \nmercenaries to do the dirty work. This tragedy, \nunprecedented in the recent history of mankind, \nis the logical consequence of the paranoia \ncharacteristic of those in power in Israel, who \nconsider each Pal\u00acestinian a potential terrorist \nand, as such, an absolute evil which must be \nrooted out and exterminated. Is not a former \nPrime Minister of Israel alleged to have admitted \nto that sense of fear at the birth of each \nPalestinian child?\n129.\tWhat can only be called the hasty retreat \nof the multinational forces of separation in \nleaving the refugee camps without protection, \ndespite the fears expressed in the first place by \nthe Palestinian leaders, was evidence of that \ncriminal design. This appalling slaughter, among \nthe victims of which were thousands of women, \nchildren and the elderly, is the result of this \ndiabolical war launched by the Israeli Government \non 6 June. In fact since that time, the Israeli \nArmy, with considerable manpower and material of \na very sophisticated kind, has invaded more than \nhalf of Lebanon, causing immense destruction and \npartic\u00acularly heavy human losses among the \nLebanese and Palestinian populations, estimated \nby UNICEF to be 30,000 dead and wounded in Beirut \nalone.\n130.\tUnder the false pretext of ensuring the \nsecurity of its northern frontiers, where a \nceasefire has been in force since July 1981, \nIsrael has put into operation the final phase \u2014in \naccordance with its strategy\u2014of its plan to \nannihilate the Palestinian resistance centered on \nthe PLO, leading to the elimina\u00action of the \nPalestinian presence in Lebanon, by terrorization \nand the destruction of their shelters.\n131.\tIn the past, the Tel Aviv authorities \ntried in vain to establish a tame new \nadministration to carry out in Israeli-style \nautonomy in the occupied terri\u00actories on the West \nBank and in Gaza, once the democratically elected \nmunicipal councils had been dissolved and \nreplaced by village leagues which are armed \ngroups that bring about Israeli order  in the \nexpectation that a quisling will emerge to serve \nas a likely negotiator.\n13z. Neither the systematic repression of the \noccupied territories, nor the use of \nsophisticated military arsenals, including \nphosphorous and frag\u00acmentation bombs as well as \nimplosion bombs, or the terrible bombardment of \nwest Beirut, has succeeded in overcoming the \ndetermination of the Palestinians to fight to \ndefend their legitimate cause, as President \nReagan himself recognized in his statement on 1 \nSeptember.\n133. For 60 years, the Palestinian people, faced \nwith Zionist designs on their country, have never \nceased to fight. In spite of the ups and downs of \nan unequal struggle and the fact that on three \noccasions since 1948 the Palestinians have been \ndispersed, Palestinian nationalism has emerged \nstrengthened from each test, because never in the \nlong history of colonialism Las brute force \nsucceeded in overcoming the determina\u00action of \npeoples who fight for liberation. The \nPal\u00acestinian people, driven from their homeland \nand pursued with hatred and tenacity in exile, \nhave paid heavily for their recognition of their \ninalienable right to self-determination and the \nestablishment of their own State.\n134.\tBy subjecting an entire country to fire \nand bloodshed, by massacring savagely and \nindiscrimi\u00acnately thousands and thousands of \ninnocent people, by depriving blockaded \npopulations of any sanitary or humanitarian aid, \nby creating finally even more victims, including \nvictims among their own ranks, which has never \nhappened before in the confronta\u00actions in that \nregion, was Israel really, in those con\u00acditions, \nresponding to its need for security, or did it \nuse its military power to ensure its supremacy?\n135.\tIf we are to believe Time magazine of 20 \nSep\u00actember 1982, Israel is the fourth largest \nmilitary power in the world. In those conditions, \nhow can they use vulnerability and insecurity as \npretexts when what is involved is the appeasement \nof dominating and expansionist instincts? What is \ninvolved is an attempt to establish its own order \nin Lebanon, which is an independent and sovereign \ncountry. It is a question of stripping an entire \npeople, the Palestinians, of its rights to \nself-determination and to a State, and of \ndiscrediting its unique and sole representative, \nthe PLO.\n136.\tThat is what really lies behind the \nnotion of security invoked each time by Israel; \nit is nothing but a code name to camouflage dark \ndesigns. Do we have to emphasize that security is \nthe constant concern of all peoples in the \nregion? It is also a condition neces\u00acsary to \ntheir development. Security cannot be con\u00acceived \nof as being the supremacy of one State over \nothers, implying a right to intervene in the \ninternal affairs of other countries, nor could \nsecurity be con\u00acsidered as a means of \nlegitimizing the subjugation of- peoples.\n137.\tOne reality emerges clearly from all \nthose events: that of an imperative need to end \nthe tragedy of the Middle East. Any further delay \nwould risk jeopardizing forever peace and \nsecurity in that region and in the world. To that \nend, the Palestinian people and the other Arab \npeoples, with a single voice \u2014through their \nleaders who met at the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference at Fez\u2014have shown their deter\u00acmination \nto achieve a just, overall and lasting solution \nof the problems.\n138.\tTwo basic principles were clearly \ndefined: first, the withdrawal by the Israelis \nfrom all Arab terri\u00actories, including Jerusalem, \nand then the recognition of the absolute right of \nthe Palestinians to self- determination and to \nthe establishment of their own State under the \nleadership of the PLO. It also involves the right \nof all the peoples of the region to live in peace \nunder the guarantee of the Security Council; \nwhich has that role in accordance with the \nCharter.\n139.\tThat plan, which has the merit of \ninternational legality and takes into account all \nthe recent public peace initiatives\u2014in particular \nthat by President Reagan in which we noted with \nsatisfaction a more correct appreciation of the \nrealities of our region\u2014for the first time \npresents a specific means of implementing a \nlasting world solution.\n140.\tHowever, whereas the peace efforts of the \nArab countries arouse interest and even support \namong many countries, the Tel Aviv authorities, \nby the use of arrogance and defiance as an \noverriding weapon, remain hidebound in their \ncomplete and total refusal:  no  to the Fez Arab \npeace plans;  no  to the self-determination of \nthe Pal\u00acestinian people and the creation of their \nState;  no  to the existence of the PLO, although \nit is recognized by 117 States;  no  to the \nVenice Declaration;  no  to the Franco-Egyptian \nplan;  no  to the Brezhnev plan; and  no  to the \nReagan plan of September. The entire world is in \nthe wrong; Israel alone is in the right.\n141.\tAt the Fez Summit Conference an historic \nturning point was reached by Arab countries, \nopening up new prospects towards a lasting peace. \nIt is the duty of the Organization and of the \nSecurity Council in the first instance to assume \ntheir responsibilities, to end this infernal \ncycle of brute force which can only exacerbate \npassions, feed the extremists, creates radical \nattitudes and deals a fatal blow to the hopes for \npeace of the peoples of that region.\n142.\tIt is comforting to see the action taken \nby the advocates of peace in the Middle East, \nincluding Israel itself, growing continuously. \nEverything must be done to ensure that the Fez \nmessage of peace does not become one more lost \nopportunity.\n143.\tIf we are appealing today more than ever \nfor respect for international legality, it is \nbecause in this period of disturbance and \ndisorder in which we live legality is the only \nway for us to speak a common language. It \nconstitutes for us all the law which each must \nrespect.\n144.\tIt is this legality which we wish to see \nrespected in Namibia and elsewhere. It is the \nillegal occupation of Namibia that we have always \ndenounced with all our strength. It is \nrecognition of the legitimate rights of the \nfraternal Namibian people, represented by SWAPO \nthat we demand. It is the rapid and definitive \nsolution of the anachronistic problem of Namibia \nin application of the relevant United Nations \nresolutions that is our deepest aspiration. It is \nour desire to see with us as soon as possible \nhere in the United Nations a free and independent \nNamibia that we are expressing today, at a time \nwhen hope of a solution is dawning.\n145.\tIt is in that same spirit that we \ndenounce most forcefully once again today the \ninhuman practice of apartheid, which the \nsegregationist and racist Pretoria regime has \nmade into a system.\n146.\tWe appeal to the conscience of the \ninternational community so that without further \ndelay that aberra\u00action of our time may be ended, \nas mankind approaches the end of the twentieth \ncentury. It is a political, economic and social \nproblem, but it is also and above all as we see \nit a problem of civilization. To the people of \nSouth Africa, to its leaders, represented by the \nAfrican National Congress, who are steadfastly \nstruggling for the sake of civilization, we \nreaffirm our esteem and our active solidarity.\n147.\tOther equally grave hotbeds of tension \ncontinue to disturb the African continent. The \nconflict in Western Sahara that still disturbs \nthe northern part of the continent, the conflict \nin the horn of Africa, the problems of refugees, \nand displaced persons, the problems of drought \nand hunger, make it necessary for the Africans \nthemselves to redouble their efforts and draw on \ntheir traditional wisdom to find settlement \nprocedures that are acceptable to all and thus to \nstrengthen the ranks of the Organization of \nAfrican Unity, which has throughout its history \nplayed a particularly positive and indeed \nirreplaceable role.\n148.\tThe OAU, to which nearly one third of the \nMem\u00acbers of the United Nations belong and which \nis pursuing at the regional level the same \nobjectives as the United Nations has demonstrated \nthat it is able to contribute substantially to \nthe work of the Organization, which is universal \nin its calling.\n149.\tAs regards the situation in Asia, in \nAfghanistan and in Kampuchea, no notable progress \nhas been recorded in the past year towards the \nsolutions advocated by the General Assembly. \nForeign forces are still occupying the \nterritories of those two coun\u00actries. The Afghan \nand Kampuchean peoples are still being prevented \nfrom exercising their right freely to decide on \ntheir own system of government. Interna\u00actional \nlegality and the principles of the Charter \ncon\u00actinue to be disregarded. It is time that the \npeoples of those two countries, like other \npeoples, at last had the right to speak.\n150.\tThe particularly sensitive Gulf region, \nbecause of the unjustified persistence of the war \nbetween Iraq and Iran, two fraternal neighbouring \ncountries which should enjoy understanding and \nco-operation, con\u00actinues to constitute a source \nof major concern to us and to all who desire \nstability and equilibrium in that region. We have \nnoted with great interest the con\u00acstructive \nattitude taken by one of the parties and we ask \nthat international legality be respected, here as \nelsewhere, and that Security Council resolutions \n479 (1980) and 514 (1982) be fully implemented.\n151. The use of force, regardless of its \nimmediate results, can never bring about peace \nand security. It is through the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes that the objective of \ngenuine peace can be achieved. It is through \ndialogue and negotiation that just and lasting \nsolutions can be found. This will always be our \npreferred course of action. We support this same \ncourse of action for the settlement of disputes \nthat have lasted some time now, as well as for \nthose that have emerged more recently, such as \nthe conflict that broke out in the South Atlantic \nover the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) and which, \nbecause it grew out of all proportion, seriously \ndisturbed the world.\n152. We appeal to the United Kingdom and the \nRepublic of Argentina, two friends of Tunisia, to \nresume, on the basis of the relevant resolutions \nof the General Assembly, the dialogue which was \ninterrupted, using once again the good offices of \nthe Secretary- General, whose commendable efforts \nin that matter, had they not been hindered, would \nhave spared many lives and thus enhanced the role \nof the United Nations.\t,\n153. In this general context of disorder, tension \nand confrontation the second special session of \nthe General Assembly devoted to disarmament was \nheld from 7 June to 10 July last. My country had \nhoped that that session would bring about a \ngeneral awareness of the danger of widespread \nconflagration which haunts the world. It had \nhoped that the international com\u00acmunity would \ntake appropriate measures to prevent war and to \narrive at an agreement which would prohibit for \never the use or the threat of use of nuclear \nweapons, an agreement on which the fate of all \nmankind depends.\n154.\tOur disappointment and our frustration \nwere great when our efforts failed. The necessary \npolitical will for such an agreement was lacking, \nparticularly on the part of those with the \nlargest arsenals of weapons of destruction. Could \nit have been otherwise, when the biggest Powers \nseek only to ensure their own security without \nmuch concern for international peace and security?\n155.\tWe venture to hope that at this session \nthose who in the past were not ready will have \ndecided to make the necessary efforts to join \ntheir will to that of the great majority \nexpressed here, especially through the \nnon-aligned countries, and thus make it possible \nto prevent a nuclear disaster, achieve general \nand complete disarmament and focus exclusively on \neconomic and social development in peace and \nsecurity.\n156.\tThe international economic situation \ncontinues to stagnate in crisis and is cause for \nthe most serious concern. Year after year we \nwitness a worsening of the already very \nprecarious conditions of two thirds of mankind. \nThe facts are there, shameful, distressing.\n157.\tIn 1980 nearly 800 million human beings \nhad an annual per capita income of less than $150 \nand they continue to live in miserable conditions \nof absolute poverty. If nothing is done to remedy \nthis situation their numbers will increase in \nabsolute figures by approximately 30 per cent and \nwill reach the figure of 1 billion by the year \n2000.\n158.\tIn a world economy characterized by \nuncer\u00actainty and instability and affected by \ndestabilizing and disturbing phenomena which \nseriously obstruct its growth rate in the short \nand medium term, the prospects for the developing \nworld are grim indeed.\n159.\tThe sacrifices and efforts made by the \ndevel\u00acoping countries, moreover, no longer \nreceive the back\u00acup and support that are needed \nfrom a developed world which is becoming \nincreasingly egocentric. In fact, official \ndevelopment assistance from member countries of \nthe Organization for Economic Co\u00acoperation and \nDevelopment decreased by 6 per cent in 1981. \nFurthermore, the excessive indebtedness of the \nmajority of developing countries has passed the \ncritical threshold, and may at any time plunge \nmany of these countries into bankruptcy. In \naddition, the proliferation and strengthening of \nprotectionist measures in the developed countries \nmay stifle, if they have not already done so, the \nemerging industries of the developing countries.\n160.\tIn brief, in their economic and social \ndevelop\u00acment efforts the developing countries are \nfacing serious obstacles: a deficit in the \nbalance of payments, deterioration in the terms \nof trade, a decrease in the volume of their \nexports, higher debt-servicing costs, \nover-indebtedness and galloping imported \ninflation. The steady deterioration of the \neconomic conditions of the developing countries \ndoes not seem to be of much concern to the \nindustrialized countries, which, claiming \ndomestic economic difficulties, obstruct change \nand oppose reform.\n161.\tUrgent change is none the less greatly needed in order to restructure international \neconomic relations on the basis of justice, \nequity and sovereign equality, in accordance with \nthe objectives of the new interna\u00actional economic \norder. To that end the members of the Group of 77 \nhave proposed a new approach in a suitable \nframework. They are prepared to undertake, \nthrough global negotiations, an egalitarian, \nuniversal and dynamic dialogue, in order to study \nin a democratic forum, that of the General \nAssembly, the major problems in the way of \ninternational economic co\u00acoperation. Instead of \nseizing the opportunity to engage in genuine, \nconstructive and comprehensive negotia\u00actions, our \npartners from the developed countries seem more \nconcerned to safeguard and protect the excessive \nadvantages inherited from an unjust economic \norder.\n162.\tWe are very disturbed at the lack of the \nsincere political will to launch the global \nnegotiations on international economic \nco-operation for develop\u00acment. We believe it is \nhigh time for the international community to \nreach agreement in this respect.\n163.\tIt is encouraging to see in the \ncommunique issued after the Versailles Economic \nSummit in June that the growth of the developing \ncountries and the strengthening of constructive \nrelations with them are vital to the political \nand economic prosperity of the world. \nParadoxically, however, we are witnessing an \nerosion of the spirit of international \nco-operation. In recent years the developing \ncountries have faced the rejection of dialogue by \ntheir industrialized partners from the north.\n164.\tOur disappointment and our frustrations \nare increasing. Never before has international \nco-operation met so many obstacles, so often been \ndeadlocked. We are even witnessing a calling into \nquestion of mutually accepted commitments to \nincrease con\u00acsiderably the financial resources of \nUNDP. The deterioration of the financial \nsituation of UNDP is a source of concern and \nanxiety for all the developing countries. Such \ndeterioration may not only hinder the \nimplementation of those countries^ projects and \npro\u00acgrammes but even endanger the very principle \nof multilateral co-operation, which is urgently \nnecessary for the international community, and in \nparticular for developing countries.\n165.\tIt is essential, bearing in mind how far \nwe are from attaining the objectives that we have \nset through our agreements, to redouble our \nefforts to give UNDP the financial means that it \nneeds to enable it to sup\u00acport and aid the \ndeveloping countries on a foreseeable, secure and \ncontinuing basis in their economic and social \ndevelopment efforts.\n166.\tThis attitude of rejection and \nobstruction on the part of certain developed \ncountries is undeniably harmful to both the \ncredibility and the ideals of the United Nations. \nIt could destroy the rare achievements of \nmultilateral co-operation, the results of so many \nyears of effort.\n167.\tWe for our part will continue to believe \nin the virtues of dialogue and agreement, a \ndemocratic, com\u00acprehensive, global dialogue for \nthe consideration of questions and for \ndecision-making. In this respect, we are pleased \nthat the Third United Nations Conference on the \nLaw of the Sea has arrived at a convention which, \ndespite the dissatisfaction that it may have \nprovoked in certain quarters, none the less \nconstitutes the embodiment of the law. We \nstrongly hope that the results of 10 years of \npainstaking efforts and intense negotiations will \nsoon be formally adopted by the entire \ninternational community.\n168.\tThe agenda of the thirty-seventh session, \non only a few items of which I have touched, \nclearly demonstrates the seriousness of our \nresponsibilities and the importance of the task \nbefore us, an enormous and most exhilarating task \nif we are truly to find solu\u00actions to the \nproblems of our day and prepare a better future \nfor ourselves and our children. We must, first \nand foremost, rid ourselves of the specter of war \nand the threat of a nuclear holocaust, for which \nsome with thoughtless equanimity are preparing.\n169.\tIt is urgently necessary to put an end to \nso-called localized wars and other regional \nconflicts which, like the one in the Middle East, \nspread and grow sharper day by day, bearing the \nconstant danger of an overall conflagration.\n170.\tWe must take fully into account our \ncom\u00acplementarity and our interdependence in order \nto prepare at last a new international order \nsuited to our time. We must ensure strict respect \nfor the principles embodied in the Charter and \nmake this forum the primary place for agreement \nand negotiation, which alone can enable us to \nfind comprehensive and generally acceptable \nsolutions to our problems.\n171.\tBy adopting that course of action we \ndefend the aims and objectives of the \nOrganization and disprove the forecasts of its \ncritics by strengthening its effectiveness, its \nprestige and its credibility. This is the course \nthat Tunisia intends resolutely to pursue.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, Sir, I wish to congratulate you on \nyour election to the high office of President of \nthe General Assembly.\n21.\tDuring the last few years we have \nwitnessed a serious deterioration in the \ninternational political climate. The tensions \nbetween East and West are particularly serious \nsince the East-West relationship still plays the \ndominant role in shaping international relations. \nBut crises have emerged also in other regions and \nwith grave consequences.\n3l. However promising the possibilities may be \nfor modem man to create positive conditions of \nlife, we must nevertheless acknowledge that we \nhave still failed to deal with many of the \nworld's major challenges of today in the \npolitical, economic and military fields. The most \ndisturbing development is the increasing tendency \nto resort to the use of force in international \nrelations. Events in Lebanon, in Afghanistan and \nin the Falkland Islands are clear examples of \nthis.\n52.\tWhen conflicts between nations create \nthreats to international peace and security we \nneed international mechanisms which can intervene \nto stop the escalation of such conflicts into \nopen war. We need organs which can promote \npeaceful political settlements of disputes. The \nUnited Nations was established to serve these \npurposes. However, the United Nations is not \nalways used in the way intended under the \nCharter; and when it is used; we have seen that \nits demands, calls, recommendations and \nresolutions are not heeded.\n53.\tThis development harms both the United \nNations and its Member States. Norway has always \nregarded the United Nations as the cornerstone of \nits foreign policy and we therefore regret this \ndevelopment. In his annual report on the work of \nthe Organization the Secretary-General highlights \njust this situation. We greatly appreciate his \nopen, frank and constructive presentation of the \nproblems.\n54.\tThe Charter has invested the bodies of \nthe United Nations with clearly defined and well- \nbalanced responsibilities for independent action. \nIt is up to us, the States Members of the United \nNations, to make constructive use of the \nmechanisms provided for in the Charter in order \nto further the common causes of the world \ncommunity.\n55.\tOver the years we have witnessed a \ndisturbing tendency to use the Organization for \npolitical prop\u00acaganda and condemnations rather \nthan for seeking realistic and constructive \nsolutions to the problems before us. Member \nStates ought to consider whether this is \ncompatible with our desire to develop the United \nNations into an instrument for the settlement of \ndisputes and the maintenance of international \npeace and security.\n56.\tIn his report the Secretary-General draws \nour attention to the same problem by stating that \npublic debate, which often can become rhetorical \nand con\u00acfrontational, is in itself not enough and \ncannot be a substitute for serious negotiations. \nHe has also put forward a number of proposals on \nhow we should tackle the problems now facing the \nOrganization. I would in particular mention the \nfollowing proposals.\n57.\tThe Secretary-General proposes, as an \nimportant first step, a conscious recommitment by \nGovernments to the Charter. In response to this I \nhereby reaffirm Norway's commitment.\n58.\tThe Secretary-General asks us to \nreconstruct the concept of collective action for \npeace and security within the framework of the \nCharter. The Norwegian Government agrees with him \nand we are prepared to co-operate with him in \ninvestigating ways and means of achieving this \nurgent goal.\n59.\tThe Secretary-General comments on the \nSecurity Council and suggests that the Council \nshould keep an active watch on dangerous \nsituations and if necessary initiate discussions \nwith the parties involved before they reach the \npoint of crisis. We support a more forthright \nrole for the Secretary-General within the \nframework of Article 99 of the Charter in \nbringing potentially dangerous situations to the \nattention of the Council. We find his suggestion \nfor developing a wider and more systematic \ncapacity for fact-finding in potential conflict \nareas very useful and we look forward to a discussion \non how this capacity could be strengthened.\n60.\tThe Secretary-General also comments on \npeace\u00ackeeping operations. As a country that has \ncon\u00actributed troops to several United Nations \nforces since 1956, and is contributing to UNIFIL, \nwe have a direct interest in this vital aspect of \nthe activities of the United Nations. We \ntherefore strongly support the \nSecretary-General's recommendation that Member \nStates, especially the members of the Security \nCouncil, should now urgently study the means by \nwhich our peace-keeping operations could be \nstrengthened. We are not convinced that an \nincrease in their military capacity or authority \nis a viable option, but we find very interesting \nthe suggestion of underpinning the authority of \npeace-keeping operations by some kind of \nguarantees.\n61.\tI should like to mention one last aspect \ncon\u00accerning the role of the United Nations. \nPerhaps the greatest strength of the United \nNations is embodied in its universality. Norway \nhas always considered the principle of \nuniversality to be of cardinal importance for the \nauthority of the United Nations. We shall \ncon\u00actinue to do so, and in this connection I \nshould like to stress the strong concern and \nprotest of my Govern\u00acment concerning the vote in \nthe General Conference of IAEA on 24 September^ \nnot to accept the credentials of the Israeli \ndelegation. Such moves will inevitably have \nnegative repercussions for the whole climate \nwithin the United Nations system.\n62.\tThe reaction in Norway to the recent \nreports of the massacre of Palestinian \nrefugees\u2014children, women and men\u2014in Beirut has \nbeen one of shock and revul\u00acsion. My Government \nfully associates itself with the international \ncondemnation of this massacre. Such a cruel act \nis a clear demonstration of how far the \nantagonisms and hatred have developed between the \ndifferent groups in the area. This act shows us \nmore clearly than ever the urgent need for \nnational recon-ciliation in Lebanon and a \ncomprehensive and Listing solution to the Middle \nEast conflict in general. In the present \ncircumstances we know this is extremely \ndifficult. It can be possible only if all parties \ncon\u00accerned are willing to show moderation and act \nin a spirit of compromise.\n63.\tNorway fully supports all the Security \nCouncil resolutions adopted on the crisis in \nLebanon during recent months. We urge all parties \nto respect the national sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of Lebanon.\n64.\tWe also recognize the legitimate concern \nfor the security of the State of Israel. The \nevents that took place prior to 6 June this year \ndid not, however, justify the massive Israeli \ninvasion that followed. All States in the area, \nIsrael as well as its neighbours must have the \nright to live in peace within secure and \nrecognized boundaries. There can be no just and \ndurable solution to the Middle East conflict \nunless this principle is fully respected.\n65.\tThe implementation of the national rights \nof the Palestinian people, including its right to \nself- determination, is of equal importance. This \nimplies Israel's withdrawal from territories \noccupied in 1967. It also implies that \nrepresentatives of the Palestinian people should \nparticipate in negotiations on the solu\u00action of \nthe Palestinian problem in all its aspects. The \nprocedure for the realization of Palestinian \nself- determination should be established through \nsuch negotiations.\n66.\tIn spite of the tragic events of the last \nfew weeks we have noted some encouraging signs of \na positive development towards a peaceful and \ncom\u00acprehensive solution to the conflict. The plan \noutlined by the President of the United States on \nI September for a more general settlement of the \nMiddle East problem, and in particular the \nPalestinian question, has been welcomed by Norway \nas a significant and important contribution to \nthe peace process. The agreement at the resumed \nTwelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez earlier \nthis month on a number of principles for the \nsolution of the crisis strengthens our conviction \nthat serious efforts are being undertaken to try \nto solve the conflict in the Middle East.\n67.\tThere are several other pressing international problems on our agenda.\n68.\tIn Namibia, the ongoing efforts to reach \na negotiated political settlement are entering a \ncrucial stage. Norway strongly supports these \nefforts and we sincerely hope they will succeed \nso that Namibia can obtain its independence in \n1933.\n69.\tIn South Africa, the inhuman system of \napartheid persists. Together with the other \nNordic countries, Norway will continue to examine \nways and means of exerting pressure on the South \nAfrican Govern\u00acment so that the necessary and \ninevitable changes will come about by peaceful \nmeans.\n70.\tIn Afghanistan, the tragic war is \ncontinuing. The Soviet Union assumes a heavy \nresponsibility by ignoring the clear decisions by \na vast majority in the Assembly that it should \nwithdraw its military forces. The Afghan people \nmust be granted the right to determine the future \nof its country without external interference. \nNorway supports the efforts by the \nSecretary-General to solve this conflict.\n71.\tIn Kampuchea, the impressive humanitarian \neffort of the international aid agencies, led by \nUNICEF, has helped to save the Kampuchean people \nfrom famine and starvation. The illegal \nVietnamese occupation of the country continues, \nhowever. Norway will support resolutions and \nefforts to achieve a political solution so that \nthe long-suffering Kampu\u00acchean people can finally \nobtain true independence and self-determination.\n72.\tThe Norwegian delegation will express the \nposition of my Government on these and other \nim\u00acportant questions on our agenda in more detail \nat a later stage. I feel it necessary, however, \nto make some remarks on the position of my \nGovernment on three of the most vital questions \nfacing the United Nations and the international \ncommunity, namely, the problems of disarmament, \nthe question of human rights and the North-South \ndialogue.\n73.\tArms control and disarmament were dealt \nwith extensively in the United Nations during \nthis year's special session. In spite of positive \nresults on some important issues, the second \nspecial session on disarmament this summer did \nnot succeed in devel\u00acoping further the important \nFinal Document of the Tenth Special Session of \nthe General Assembly, the first special session \non disarmament, in 1978. However, this must not \nbe allowed to undermine our resolve to continue \nto work for arms control and disarmament within \nthe global framework which the United Nations \nrepresents.\n74.\tOur deliberative process in the United \nNations must be realistic. We cannot force \nagreement in the absence of consensus, nor must \ndivergent views deter us from seeking agreement. \nUnless we succeed in our consensus-building here, \nour ability to influence negotiations outside \nthis Hall will be minimal.\n75.\tNorway attaches great importance to the \nfollow- up to the second special session on \ndisarmament. We intend to submit proposals for \nthe strengthening of the machinery in the \nmultilateral field of negotiations and research, \nincluding a limited expansion of the Committee on \nDisarmament.\n76.\tFurthermore, Norway, together with the \nother Nordic countries, would like to see \nconcrete action taken by the Assembly with regard \nto the United Nations study on disarmament and \ndevelopment.\n77.\tOur follow-up discussions during this \nsession of the General Assembly must necessarily \nbe addressed to a broad range of issues. At this \ntime, however, I should like to make a few \nobservations regarding nuclear and conventional \nweapons. Priority must be assigned to questions \nrelated to nuclear disarmament. The prevention of \nboth a further vertical nuclear arms build-up and \na horizontal proliferation of such weapons is one \nof the greatest challenges facing the community \nof nations today, and there is a clear link \nbetween these two tasks.\n78.\tIn this connection, the negotiations \nbetween the United States and the Soviet Union at \nGeneva on strategic nuclear weapons\u2014the strategic \narms reduc\u00action talks\u2014and intermediate-range \nnuclear forces are of particular significance. It \nis our hope and goal that the talks will lead to \nsubstantial reductions in strategic nuclear \nweapons on both sides. With regard to the \nintermediate-range nuclear force negotiations, \nNorway supports, as a first step, the total \nelimination of American and Soviet land-based \nintermediate- range missiles.\n79.\tProgress in those talks would in our view \nalso provide a further incentive to our efforts \nto halt the spread of nuclear weapons to other \ncountries. Nuclear disarmament is also closely \nlinked to ongoing talks regarding a future \ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. Norway attaches \ngreat importance to the activities of the \nCommittee on Disarmament in this regard; and we \nshall continue our involvement in these matters.\n80.\tOur preoccupation with the need to hate \nand reverse the nuclear arms build-up must not \nmake us forget developments in the conventional \nfield\u2014and the increasing destructiveness of \nconventional weapons. Therefore, the security \nproblems involve not only nuclear weapons, but \nalso conventional arms.\n81.\tReal progress towards disarmament can be \nachieved only through negotiations resulting in \nbinding and verifiable agreements. Declarations \nof intent alone concerning those questions can \nnever be sufficient.\n82.\tTo conclude my remarks on disarmament, I \nwould like to point out that positive results \nfrom these nego\u00actiations could lead to a \nlessening of tension in the East- West \nrelationship in general.\n83.\tSince the creation of the United Nations \nsub\u00acstantial efforts have been undertaken to \nestablish international instruments and norms for \nthe protection of human rights. The Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights and the International \nCovenants on Human Rights, one on civil and \npolitical rights and the other on economic, \nsocial and cultural rights, have become our basic \ninstruments. In spite of those and other \ndeclarations, we are nevertheless confronted \nalmost daily with reports of gross and systematic \nviolations of fundamental human rights. Such \nreports show that a number of Governments do not \nlive up to the commit\u00acments and principles \nembodied in those covenants and declarations. We \nmust also, regrettably, conclude that the \nmechanisms established for the protection and \npromotion of human rights are inadequate.\n84.\tWith that situation as the background, it \nmust be an overriding concern to ensure more \neffectively each individual's enjoyment of human \nrights and fundamental freedoms. This issue has \nbeen discussed for a number of years within the \nUnited Nations. Concrete proposals have been \nsubmitted; the establish\u00acment of a post of United \nNations high commissioner for human rights is \nonly one among several examples. Thus, it is not \na lack of ideas that hampers the pro\u00acmotion of \nrespect for human rights, but a lack of political \nwill.\n85.\tRecognizing that violations of human \nrights must be regarded as an international \nconcern, it must also be the duty of the \ninternational community to react to such \nviolations whenever they occur, regardless of the \npolitical colour of the regime in question. The \ninvocation of the principle of non-interference \nin internal affairs cannot be accepted as a \njustification for the international community not \nto act. If we do not respond similarly to \ncomparable violations, our credibility will be at \nstake. My delegation will address itself to those \nissues later in this session, in particular with \nregard to the situation in Iran, where the \nviola\u00actions of human rights are becoming \nincreasingly severe through religious \npersecution, torture and arbitrary executions.\n86.\tBefore concluding, I would like to \ncomment briefly upon the importance of the \ninternational economic situation, in particular \nthe North-South dialogue.\n87.\tOne conclusion from the September meeting \nof the International Monetary Fund [IMF] and the \nWorld Bank in Toronto was that the world economic \nsituation has worsened and that the short-term \nprospects for improvement are still bleak. The \nlow-income devel-oping countries have been \nparticularly hard hit by the recession in the \nindustrialized world. Many of the developing \ncountries are faced with crushing debt problems, \nthe ramifications of which may threaten the \nstability of the international financial system. \nWe see increasing protectionist tendencies and a \nrisk of an erosion of the open international \ntrading system. The spectre of mass unemployment \nthreatens the stability and cohesion of the \ninternational com\u00acmunity, in particular because \nof its effect on our youth.\n88.\tAt the same time, the economic and \ndevelopment organizations within the United \nNations system are faced with a crisis of their \nown. In a joint Nordic statement to the IMF/World \nBank meeting the crucial importance of \nmultilateral assistance was underlined, as well \nas the necessity for donor countries at least to \nkeep their contributions to the present level. \nIt* this forum, I would in particular point to \nthe very difficult situation now facing UNDP. If \nwe do not find a rapid solution to the present \nfinancial problems of UNDP the resulting cutbacks \nin projects and assistance will have serious \nrepercussions on the entire United Nations \ndevelopment system.\n89.\tMy Government intends to maintain an \nactive role in the work for a new international \neconomic order. We regard the concept of a new \ninternational economic order as an effort, \nthrough international negotiations, to achieve a \ncombined strategy to foster just and equitable \neconomic relations between rich and poor \ncountries. We see this as a matter of developing \nmechanisms for co-operation which will enable the \ninternational economic system to function in the \nbest possible way to the mutual advantage of all \nparties, and in particular to the benefit of \ndeveloping countries.\n90.\tIf the present situation regarding the \nNorth- South dialogue is allowed to persist, it \nmay not only have a negative impact on the \nrelations between the developed and developing \ncountries, but also further aggravate the stress \non the international economy. The Norwegian \nGovernment still thinks that the planned round of \nglobal negotiations represents a comprehensive \nand integrated approach to the North- South \nproblems, and it still hopes that agreement can \nbe reached so that this round can be launched \nduring this session of the Assembly. We also \nintend to take a very active part in the \npreparations for the ministerial meeting of GATT \nin November and for the sixth session of UNCTAD \nto be held next year at Belgrade. The commitment \nof Norway to the goals of international \ndevelopment co-operation will also 6e evident \nfrom the decision of my Government to main\u00actain \nits official development assistance at the level \nof 1 per cent of its gross national product in \nthe years to come in spite of the economic \nproblems which are facing my country also.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, Sir, I should like to congratulate \nyou run your unanimous election to the high \noffice of the presidency of the thirty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. Your wide \nexperience and diplomatic talents make you \nwell-suited to confront the tasks that lie ahead \nof you. I should like also to congratulate your \npredecessor, Mr. Kittani of Iraq, for the \nefficient and dedicated manner in which he \nhandled the affairs of the last session of the \nGeneral Assembly. We wish him well in his future \npursuits and hope that the international \ncommunity will continue to benefit from his wise \nand able guidance.\nA host of critical issues continue to preoccupy \nthe international community. Because of various \nfactors, several of which the Secretary-General \ndealt with in his report on the work of the \nOrganization, the United Nations system, \nparticularly the Security Council, was not always \nable to deal effectively with many such issues. \nFor quite some time now many have felt the \nincreasing inadequacy of the United Nations \nmeaningfully to promote and maintain peace and \nsecurity\u2014the very objectives for which the United \nNations itself was established. Hence, there is a \nvery clear necessity to take steps to make the \nUnited Nations system more effective in dealing \nwith international peace and security. It is \nimportant for the permanent members of the \nSecurity Council to take the leading role in \nbringing about the required changes. They must \nplace on a higher footing the larger interests of \nmankind as a whole. My delegation hopes that \nthose countries will come forward and bear the \nresponsibilities that they have agreed to \nshoulder.\nThe news media worldwide, as well as most of the \nspeakers who have preceded me here, have referred \nin glowing terms to the report of the Secretary- \nGeneral on the work of the Organization. We \nappreciate the frank approach taken by the \nSecretary-General. We are of the view that the \nproposals put forward by him should be given \nimmediate and priority consideration. We \naccordingly welcome the proposal made by Sierra \nLeone for the inclusion in the agenda of an \nadditional item on the issue of collective \nsecurity.\n539\nAt this juncture, I should like also to take the \nopportunity warmly to congratulate the Secretary- \nGeneral for the very admirable manner in which he \nhas exercised his functions regarding the affairs \nof the\nOrganization despite serious constraints. During \nthe course of the year he has dealt with some \nvery difficult situations in a manner befitting \nhis position and the powers vested in him. In \nmoments of crisis he has displayed rare skill and \ndiplomatic talent. My delegation, which has \nalways had full confidence in him, now wishes him \nall success during his term at the helm of the \nOrganization.\nMany issues that confront us at this session have \nbeen on the General Assembly agenda since the \ninception of the Organization. In many such cases \nsolutions continue to evade us. One issue is the \ncrisis in the Middle East. The holocaust that has \nbeen visited upon Lebanon in recent months has \nappalled and shocked the consciences ox all. The \nmassacre of Palestinian refugees in Beirut was \nindiscriminate and merciless. Those who \nperpetrated this crime must be counted among the \nlowest ranks of criminals. We support a thorough \ninvestigation to expose the true nature of this \nghastly deed.\nMy delegation was equally appalled at the heavy \nbombing of Beirut by Israel in order to \nannihilate the Palestine Liberation Organization. \nThis action on the part of Israel caused the loss \nof countless civilian lives and the destruction \nof much valuable property. Israel cannot continue \nto resort to such use of force to settle disputes \nwith its neighbors. Nor will Israel and its \nneighbors be able to achieve lasting and \nworthwhile peace in the absence of dialogue and \nnegotiations. It is also the belief of my \ndelegation that the crux of the problem in the \nMiddle East is the question of Palestine. Israel \nand others cannot afford to ignore the legitimate \nand genuine cause of the people of Palestine. My \ndelegation therefore Ally supports the plea of \nthe overwhelming majority of the United Nations \nmembership, a plea that has resounded countless \ntimes in this Hall, for the self- determination \nof the people of Palestine. In order to achieve \nthis goal Israel will have to withdraw its forces \nand its settlers from all territories occupied \nsince the 1967 war.\nAnother war that has levied a heavy toll of life \nand property over the last two years is the one \nbetween the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq. \nThe appeals and the diplomatic efforts of the \nUnited Nations, the non-aligned movement and the \nIslamic group of countries have so far failed to \nbring this war of attrition to an end. This is an \nabsolutely needless conflict, and the countries \ninvolved must, in their own interests, bring the \nwar to a quick halt.\nA/37/PV.29\nThe Charter very explicitly calls upon all \nMembers not to resort to the use of force in the \nsettlement of disputes. However, during the \ncourse of the last few years several nations have \nattempted to settle their disputes by using \nforce. Whether their cause is right or otherwise, \nthe use of force in the settlement on disputes \ncannot be justified. The international community \nshould not permit anyone to gain through the use \nof force. Otherwise the safety and well-being of \nsmaller and weaker nations will be constantly \nthreatened. For instance, in South-West and \nSouth-East Asia, military might has been used to \nintervene in the internal affairs of weaker \nnations. On grounds of principle, we cannot \nendorse the presence of foreign troops in the \ncountries of these regions. Such troops must be \nwithdrawn and the sovereign, independent and \ntruly non-aligned status of the countries \nconcerned restored.\nMy delegation had hoped to see a sovereign \nindependent Namibia by now. However, in spite of \nnumerous resolutions of the United Nations, South \nAfrica continues to occupy this international \nTerritory. My delegation now hopes that the \nWestern contact group will soon be able to \nconclude negotiations and ensure Namibia's \nindependence within the framework of Security \nCouncil resolution 435 (1978).\nIn South Africa itself, the despicable practice \nof apartheid, condemned by every nation in the \nworld, still persists. The rights of the majority \nhave been denied. The authorities in Pretoria \nmust soon realize their folly and right the \nwrongs being done.\nIL My delegation joins those who have expressed \ndisappointment with the outcome of the second \nspecial session on disarmament. The consistent \nand high- pitched expression of fear of the \ndangers of the arms race, the tremendous \ndiversion of resources and the massive rallies \nthat we have witnessed have failed to move the \nleaders of the major countries of the world, \nparticularly the two super-Powers.\nDespite the serious obstacles that exist, we \ncannot and must not lose hope in our attempts to \nachieve general and complete disarmament. There \nmust be a rethinking on the part of those \ncountries that have held back project in this \nrepaid. A way to maintain peace and security on \nthis planet of ours, instead of threatening its \ndestruction, must be found and established.\nThe outcome of nine years of negotiations on the \nlaw of the sea was a laudable achievement of the \nUnited Nations. It was also a step towards the \nsetting up of the new international economic \norder. Many potential disputes will now be \nprevented because of the provisions contained in \nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the \nSea. It is true that not all countries were able \nto ensure the full coverage of their each and \nevery interest. The landlocked countries, for \ninstance, have had to be satisfied with very \nlittle, to put it bluntly. They have withheld \nmany reservations in the larger interest. In view \nof this, it was disheartening that a few \ncountries which, in fact, had gained \nsubstantially, did not see fit to permit the \nConvention to be approved by consensus.\nEarlier speakers have all pointed to the dire \nsituation of the international economy. The worst \nconsequences of this state of affairs continue to \nbe shouldered by the non-oil-exporting developing \ncountries. Millions upon millions in the \ndeveloping countries of Asia, Africa and Latin \nAmerica live in practically total deprivation. \nThough efforts have been made to tackle this \nproblem, they have simply been too little or too \nlate, though well intentioned. What is required \nto deal effectively with such a situation is an \nincreased flow of resources to these \nunderdeveloped areas and a restructuring of the \ninternational economic system. We therefore \ncontinue to stress that the present economic \norder is unfair, unjust and incapable of treating \nthe difficulties that confront it. The longer we \ndelay the launching of the global negotiations \nand the establishment of the new international \neconomic order, the longer it will take to \nachieve our goals. My delegation urges those \ndeveloped countries which have so far failed to \nendorse the launching of the global negotiations \nto do so without further delay.\nMy delegation attaches considerable importance to \nevery facet of international economic \nco-operation. The developing countries, and \nespecially the 31 least developed among them, \nrequire a steady input of financial and technical \nresources to enable them to create the necessary \nbasis for sustained social and economic \nadvancement. Without such sustained and \npredictable resource flows the least developed \ncountries will not be able to overcome the \nstructural imbalances, lack of basic \ninfrastructure and the poverty that presently \ncharacterize their economies. The resources given \nthus far to the least developed countries, \nthrough both multilateral and bilateral sources, \nthough inadequate, have had a beneficial impact \non their economies. A detailed analysis of the \nconditions in these countries and their \nrequirements for assistance was taken up at the \nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed \nCountries, held in Paris in 1981. Serious efforts \nare now under way to implement the Substantial \nNew Programme of Action that emerged at the \nConference. UNDP, UNCTAD and the World Bank have \nmoved, in close co-operation with the least \ndeveloped countries, to arrange the aid \nconsultative group meetings between potential \ndonor countries and recipient countries. My \ndelegation would like to urge all donors, and \nparticularly the developed countries, to come \nforth and increase their assistance in keeping \nwith the decisions of the Paris Conference.\nIn this context, we were heartened by the \nstatements of several countries, including the \none delivered on behalf of the European Economic \nCommunity by the Foreign Minister of Denmark at \nthe 8th meeting of the Assembly. Those assurances \nand the actions being taken will keep up the \nmomentum generated in Paris towards implementing \nthe Substantial New Programme of Action.\nIn spite of those developments, my delegation has \nnevertheless been perturbed by the serious \ndecline in real terms in multilateral assistance \nin general. As members of the UNDP Governing \nCouncil, we have particularly observed the \nserious lack of resources that will confront UNDP \nin the Third Indicative Planning Figures Cycle. \nMany least developed countries have come to rely \nto a major extent on UNDP, UNICEF and other \nsimilar assistance for undertaking projects and \nprogrammes crucial to their socioeconomic \ndevelopment. A deterioration in this type of \nassistance would definitely jeopardize their \nplans and programmes. We therefore once again \ncall upon the international community, and \nparticularly the developed countries, to \nreinvigorate their assistance through UNDP and \nother multilateral agencies. The developing \ncountries are now very aware of the benefits of \neconomic and technical co-operation among \nthemselves. The basis for such co-operation has \nbeen clearly laid down in the Caracas Programme \nof Action which was finalized in 1981, and in the \nprogrammes outlined by the non-aligned movement.\nIn our region of South Asia, seven countries \n\u2014Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, \nSri Lanka and my own, Bhutan\u2014are in the process \nof gradually but steadily laying the foundations \nfor enhancing socio-economic co-operation. The \ninitial encounters among these countries have \nrevealed that without co-operation many important \nand crucial problems of the region cannot \nadequately be dealt with. Co-operation is \nrequired urgently to improve the region's \ntransport, communications and other infra- \nstructural facilities. Health, population, the \nenvironment and agriculture are other areas in \nwhich the region could profit from increased \nco-operation. The countries of South Asia, which \nhad either been cut off from or which have been \naverse to each other because of colonial and \nother historical factors also need to understand \neach other's cultural and religious heritage. \nThey must also respect and recognize each other's \ngenuine and legitimate aspirations as sovereign \nmembers in joint pursuit of furthering the \nwell-being of their peoples. The fact that all \nthe countries that have joined the South Asian \nforum are members of the United Nations, the \nnon-aligned movement and the Group of 77 creates \na common ground among them to come together. \nBhutan attaches considerable importance to this \nemerging venture of co-operation in South Asia \nand we are confident that the other countries in \nthis venture will do all in their power to make \nit a success and to put South Asia on a new path \nof peace, prosperity and progress.\nIn conclusion, I should like to reaffirm the \nstrong commitment of the Kingdom of Bhutan to the \nprinciples and purposes of the Charter. We must \ntake all action necessary to strengthen the \nOrganization, which is universal in character and \nholds the only hope of mankind for peace and \nprosperity.\n"

It is a pleasure for me to take \nthis opportunity to greet the Secretary-General \nand to wish him every success in the \naccomplishment of his important tasks.\n103.\tAn objective analysis of the world events \nthat have taken place since the last session of \nthe General Assembly shows that the present \ninternational situation is very tense and fraught \nwith dangers for the peoples' freedom and world \npeace. The aggravation of this situation and the \ngrave economic, political and social crisis which \nhas the capitalist and revisionist world in its \ngrip have increased the danger of war.\n104.\tThis situation is a direct result of the \nexpansionist and neo-colonialist policies \npursued by the imperialist Powers, and above all \nby the two super powers. At present there is no \narea in the world that is not affected by or \nsubject to their predatory ambitions. Both \nsuper-Powers obstinately continue their \nexpansionist policy of establishing world \ndomination, which is seen also in their \nunceasing race to achieve political and military \nsuperiority the one over the other, to attain new \nstrategic positions, and so on. It is this \naggressive policy and the rivalry between the two \nsuper-Powers that further complicate the various \nsituations and make them more tense and fraught \nwith dangerous consequences.\n105.\tThe efforts of the United States \nimperialists to impose their will on various \ncountries impose their expression in United \nStates persistence in an ever more aggressive \nforeign policy which relies increasingly on \nmilitary force. The same intensification of \naggressiveness is also seen in the foreign policy \nof the Soviet social-imperialists. At the present \ntime all- round militarization of the country's \nlife and the exercise of pressures and military \nforce against other countries characterize that \npolicy.\n106.\tUnited States interference in Iran and \nthe stationing of its aggressive military forces \nin the Middle East, the occupation of Afghanistan \nby the Soviet Union, the incitement of conflicts \non the African continent, intervention in Latin \nAmerica and Southeast Asia along with the \npolitical, economic and military threats and \nblackmail in regard to many countries by the two \nsuper-Powers, all go to show that they are \npursuing a policy of oppression and aggression. \nThere is no area in international relations where \none does not encounter their policy from a \nposition of force; there is no armed conflict or \nhotbed of tension that, directly or indirectly, \nthe super powers do not have a hand in. More \nthan ever before, they are arming their war \nmachines by adding to their arsenals of new, \nsophisticated weapons. The propaganda clamor \nabout disarmament by the superpowers is nothing \nbut a maneuver to cover up their frenzied arms \nrace. And at the same time as they are arming \nthemselves, they are engaging in an arms traffic \nwhich has become a business of immense scope, \nfrom which they reap fabulous profits and which \nincreases the political and economic dependence \non them of various countries.\n107.\tIn order to conceal their true aims and \nto deceive the peoples, the super-Powers make a \nbig demagogic fuss so as to present their actions \nas being in favor of safeguarding peace. To that \nend, they have set up a number of commissions and \nmachinery dealing with various problems: from the \nstrategic arms limitation talks to European \nsecurity, from the reduction of troops in Europe \nto the demilitarization of outer space. All this \naims to create the false impression that \nsomething is being done, that the key to peace \nlies in their agreements and their initiatives. \nAH this demagogy also has the aim of imposing on \nthe peoples the idea that they should not take \nany action but should inevitably yield to the big \nPowers.\n108.\tThe situation continues to be very \nserious on the European continent. The events \nwhich have occurred in and around Europe clearly \nindicate that the political and military blocs \nheaded by the United States and the Soviet Union, \ntheir policy of an \\\"atomic umbrella\\\" and of \nspheres of influence, constitute the source of \ndiscord, tension and confrontation between \nvarious countries.\n109.\tThe statements that the signing of the \nHelsinki Final Act would eliminate political, \nideological and military tension and that the \nMadrid meetings on European security would \nstrengthen peace in Europe have showed themselves \nto be a bluff. The insecurity of Europe has grown \neven greater.\n110.\tThe two super-Powers with their rival \naggressive blocs\u00f3NATO and the Warsaw Pact\u00f3have \nstrengthened their military power with the most \nmodem weapons, accumulating an unprecedented war \narsenal. They are filling Europe with missiles \nand nuclear weapons so as to use them as a means \nof threat, and blackmail against the countries \nwhere they are stationed and against other \nEuropean countries. Military maneuvers of an \naggressive character have grown in intensity and \nhave assumed greater proportions. The presence \nin the Mediterranean of big naval fleets \nbelonging to the super-Powers has turned that \nbasin into a militarized sea; that presence \nconstitutes a serious threat to the freedom and \nindependence of the coastal countries of that \nbasin as well as to peace in Europe and in the \nworld.\n111.\tThe Albanian delegation believes that \nreal security and co-operation in Europe can be \nattained only by the European countries \nstrengthening their independence and sovereignty, \nby opposing the policy of both super-Powers, by \nliquidating bases and blocs of NATO and the \nWarsaw Pact and by driving foreign military \nforces, together with their missiles and Other \nnuclear weapons, out of their countries. The \nPeople's Socialist Republic of Albania will \nnever allow the stationing of foreign military \nbases and forces on its territory. It has \ndeclared that fact publicly and has endorsed it \nin its Constitution.\n112.\tThe situation in Europe is also reflected \nin the Balkan region. The two imperialist \nsuper-Powers have not renounced their goals and \nare aiming at turning the region into a permanent \npowder keg. They strive to prevent the normal \ndevelopment of relations between the Balkan \npeoples and countries, to revive did hostilities \nand quarrels, to encourage and mcite chauvinist \nsentiments and passions and to imbue then  With a \nsense of confrontation. Such attempts are fraught \nwith danger for the peoples of this area and run \ncounter to their sincere desire for the \nestablishment of mutual confidence, \nunderstanding and genuine co-operation.\n113.\tIn its relations with neighbouring \ncountries, the people's Socialist Republic of \nAlbania has, since its very inception, always \nbeen guided by a policy of good neighborliness. \nIts desire and aim have always been that the \nBalkan countries might live in peace and \nfriendship without interference in each other's \ninternal affairs, implementing the fundamental \nprinciples of mutual co-operation and respect. We \nare convinced that this is the correct way to \nforge fruitful and lasting relations which serve \nthe cause of peace and security in the Balkans. \nThe leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver \nHoxha, has said:\n\\\"The People's Socialist Republic of Albania \nbelieves that at present the genuine aspirations \nof the Balkan peoples and peace and stability in \nthis region can best be served by preventing the \nimperialist super-Powers from interfering in the \ninternal affairs of the countries of our region \nand by taking concrete and constructive steps \nwith a view to the positive development of \nrelations on the basis of the policy of good \nneighborliness. The situation in the Balkans \nwould be greatly improved if the Balkan countries \nwere to undertake officially not to allow the \nsuper-Powers to use their territory in order to \nthreaten or endanger neighbouring countries. In \nthe future, as in the past, socialist Albania \nwill consistently adhere to this policy and will \nmake every effort to ensure that mutual respect \nand genuine understanding prevail in its \nrelations with neighbouring States.\\\"\n114.\tIn the Middle East, the situation has deteriorated further. Fifteen \nyears after their aggression, the Israeli \nZionists continue to hold the occupied Arab \nterritories. In an arrogant and unrestrained \nmanner, and under the protection of the United \nStates, they have undertaken new invasions. The \ncrimes and massacres committed by Israel against \nthe civilian Palestinian population, which \nsurpass even those committed by the Hitlerites, \nhave aroused the indignation and profound hatred \nof the peoples of the world. The events which \nhave occurred in the area this year are a \nconsequence of the situation imposed by the \nsuper-Powers. They show how the peoples pay with \nblood and extraordinary sacrifices for the \nintrigues and plots hatched behind their backs.\n115.\tThe peoples of the world, and above all \nthe Palestinian people, see clearly that this \nbarbarous Aggression constitutes one of the most \nflagrant expressions of the agreements and \nintrigues concocted between the United States and \nthe Soviet Union fbr concessions and mutual \nrecognition of the aggressions they have \ncommitted or are about to commit. It is also the \nexpression of the bargains they have struck with \neach other against Iran, Afghanistan, the \ncountries of the Persian Gulf, the Midtue East \nand other States in various regions of the world.\n116.\tWashington's emissaries offer various \nplans for the alleged settlement of the Middle \nEast problem, but in the final analysis; all of \nthem boil down to the Camp David agreement and \naim at liquidating the Palestinian question, \ndenying the Arab peopled their rights and \nannexing the territories occupied by Israel under \nthe false pretext of guaranteeing \\\"secure \nboundaries\\\"\n117.\tThe Americans and the Soviets, through \ntheir imperialist policies, are responsible for \nthe shedding of the blood of the peoples and are \nthe main culprits. We note with indignation that \nGovernments which could have acted to stop the \nhands of the murderers did not even raise a \nfinger to avert the Israeli onslaught against \nLebanon And the Palestinians, to stop the \nbarbarous massacres and genocide committed \nagainst the martyred Palestinian people.\n118.\tI could speak here in diplomatic terms, \nbut that would be of no value. I am going to \nspeak in a different fashion, openly; I shall say \nwhat our people think. If the aggressive thrust \nof the United States imperialists and the Soviet \nsocial-imperialists is not stopped, the world \nwill find itself on the verge of a third world \nwar. But that cannot be stopped by words and \nprotests. I would recall that the Security \nCouncil resolutions and its protests on the most \nburning issues have yielded no result. The \nIsraeli war and the genocide against the Arabs, \nand against the Palestinians in particular, \ncontinues, as does the aggression and oppression \nagainst Afghanistan, and the list is longer.\n119.\tThe situation in the Middle East is \nfraught with the danger of an imperialist war and \nof bloodshed and oppression for the Arab peoples. \nIn our view it should be clear to anybody that it \nis the United States imperialists and the Soviet \nsocial-imperialists that puM the strings in all \nthe plots against the freedom and independence of \npeoples; it is they that shamelessly divide the \nzones of influence between them and play with the \nfate of peoples: it is they that incite hostility \namong the peoples and organize the networks of \nagents and putsches to pave the way for their \nexpansionist and hegemonist ambitions that \nsituation is intolerable fbr the people and we \ntherefore believe that it should be resolutely \nopposed and exposed.\n120.\tThe difficulties that may be created for \nthe brave Palestinian people will never put an \nend to their just struggle. Recent developments \nin that region have shown the Arab peoples that \nthe great mission of their national liberation \nand the defense of their freedom and independence \ncan be carried out only by them. The unity of the \nArab peoples against Zionism and the plots of the \nsuper-Powers is a basic factor in their struggle \nin their just cause.\n121.\tThe Albanian people and Government \nstrongly condemn Israel's barbarous aggression \nagainst the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples, its \nmonstrous crimes and the genocide it has \ncommitted. In the future too we shall fully \nsupport th5e just struggle of the Palestinian \npeople to have, like any other people, their own \nhomeland and State, and the efforts of the Syrian \npeople and other fraternal Arab peoples to drive \nthe Israeli aggressors out of the occupied Arab \nlands. Lebanon must be an independent and \nsovereign country and the aggressive Israeli \ntroops must withdraw immediately.\n122.\tOur country, Albania, has taken all the \nnecessary measures and is ready to defend itself \nand overcome any aggression by its enemies. But, \nbeing a small country, we are not able to render \nmaterial aid to oppressed peoples fighting \nimperialist domination. What we can do is unmask \nthe aggressive policy of United States \nimperialism and of Soviet social- imperialism and \nthe policy of subjugation. This we are doing and \nshall continue to do, come what may.\n123.\tThe situation in the Gulf area, where, \nsince the victory of the Iranian revolution, the \ngreat Powers have intensified their policy of \nplots and blackmail, remains serious. In spite of \nthe shameful defeat which the United States \nimperialists suffered in Iran, they never give up \ntheir efforts to regain their lost privileges and \npositions, while the Soviet social-imperialists \nare trying to exploit the situation in their own \ninterests. The courageous Iranian people have \nsuccessfully overcome the numerous difficulties \ncreated for them after the victory of the \nanti-imperialist revolution, and are \nsafeguarding the freedom and independence of \ntheir homeland.\n124.\tThe Albanian Government holds that it is \nin the interest of Iraq and Iran to end their \nconflict and settle their disputes through \nnegotiation so that the two peoples may live in \npeace and friendship. This would also be in the \ninterests of the people of the region and their \nwelfare and progress; and it would be a blow \nagainst the policy of the super-Powers, the aim \nof which is to see various countries pitted \nagainst each other.\n125.\tWe support the courageous Afghan people \nwho for three years now have been continuing the \nfearless struggle against the Soviet occupation \nforces to regain their national independence.\n126.\tOnly a few months ago in the Malvinas \nIslands the British imperialists, with the \nsupport of the United States, put into effect \ntheir gunboat policy. Once again the Latin \nAmerican peoples saw the true face of United \nStates imperialism and understood the value of \nthe treaties and agreements concluded with that \ncountry. Notwithstanding the manner in which the \nevents unfolded, no one can deny Argentina its \nright to exercise sovereignty over the Malvinas \nIslands. The sovereign rights of nations and \npeoples cannot be violated or proscribed either \nby force of arms or by treaties and agreements \nconcluded to the detriment of peoples.\n127.\tThe countries of South-East Asia, which \nfor decades have suffered from cruel colonial \noppression and exploitation and have been \nsubjected to imperialist aggression, are still \nunder the political and military threat of the \nUnited States, the Soviet Union and China, which \nare doing their utmost to pit them one against \nthe other, to pave the way for their \ninterventions and to safeguard their \nhegemonistic positions. As in the past, Albania \nsupports the right of the peoples of those \ncountries to settle their internal problems \nthemselves and to decide their own future without \nforeign interference. No one has the right to \ninfringe their independence, sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity, no matter what the \npretext. The countries of that region have the \nright to be fully independent, free and sovereign \nunder the tutelage of none.\n128.\tThe situation in the Korean peninsula \ncontinues to be tense because of the presence of \nthe United States occupation forces in South \nKorea. The Albanian people and Government support \nthe just struggle of the Korean people to drive \nUnited States troops out of South Korea and for \nthe independent reunification of their homeland.\n129.\tThe African countries and peoples which have just freed themselves from \nsavage colonial oppression and exploitation have \nintensified their efforts and their struggle in \ndefense of their sovereign rights against all-out \nimperialist and neo-colonialist interference. \nThey are constantly faced with the policies of \nthe super-Powers, which keep alive conflicts and \nhotbeds of tension and encourage African \ncountries to fight against each other, in order \nto pave the way for their further penetration \ninto Africa, expand their zones of influence and \nplunder the vast natural resources of that \ncontinent. This policy and activity encourage the \nracists of South Africa to continue the \noccupation of Namibia and the oppression of its \npeople. The barbarous oppression, ruthless racial \ndiscrimination and odious apartheid policy \ncarried out by the Fascist Pretoria regime \nagainst the indigenous population, together with \nits serious acts of aimed provocation against \nneighbouring countries, constitute a permanent \nthreat to the African peoples. The Albanian \npeople is in complete solidarity with the peoples \nof Azania and Namibia and other African peoples \nand resolutely supports their just struggle for \nliberation, to uproot colonialism and \nneo-colonialism and to foil the intrigues and \nprevent the interference of the imperialist \nPowers.\n130.\tA significant factor which cannot but \nhave a negative effect on the present world \nsituation is the general crisis gripping the \ncapitalist-revisionist world. It has exacerbated \nthe inter-imperialist contradictions and the \neconomic, political and military rivalries. It \nhas led to economic stagnation, a continuous fall \nin production, inflation and price rises, \nunemployment and the constant deterioration of \nthe well-being of the working masses. Many \ncountries have witnessed the growth of terrorism, \nanarchy and political and moral corruption. \nSocial relations and inter-State relations have \ndeteriorated. The crisis has made domestic and \ninternational tensions more acute both in the \nWest and in the East. Typical of this is the \ncritical situation in Poland, where the people \nare suffering the consequences of the \ncapitulationist and opportunistic line dictated \nby Moscow. We support the resolute opposition of \nthe peoples to oppression, plunder and financial \nmanipulations flowing from the imperialist \nPowers' policy aimed at increasingly shifting the \nburden of the consequences of the grave economic \ncrisis on to the backs of the working masses.\n131.\tToday the peoples' struggle throughout \nthe world against the policy of aggression and \noppression as practised by the imperialist \nPowers, primarily the two super-Powers, is \ngaining in strength and scope. In Asia, Africa, \nCentral and South America and elsewhere the \npeoples are struggling for national liberation, \ntheir independence and sovereign rights and their \neconomic and social emancipation. Their struggle \nhas gained irresistible momentum, thus becoming a \nsignificant factor in the process of world \ndevelopment, and winning the support of \nprogressive mankind.\n132.\tAlbania resolutely supports the struggle \nof democratic States and peoples in defense of \ntheir national sovereignty and their legitimate \nrights and interests. It supports efforts to \nestablish just international economic relations \nand to combat colonial exploitation. The gap \nbetween industrialized and developing countries \nis becoming ever wider. This is the direct result \nof the intensive exploitation which exists in \nvarious forms. Colossal profits are reaped by the \ncapitalist monopolies from the toil and blood of \nthe peoples of developing countries, burdensome \ncredits and the imposition of very low prices for \nraw materials as compared with those of \nmanufactured goods. The tactics of the \nimperialist Powers concerning the so-called \nNorth-South dialogue are nothing but efforts to \nperpetuate the old unjust economic relations and \nfurther to intensify exploitation. Countries and \npeoples have every right to exercise sovereignty \nover their national assets and to use them for \nthe benefit of their national development and \nprogress.\n133.\tThe People's Socialist Republic of Albania follows a consistent \nand independent foreign policy based on \nprinciple\u00f3a policy of friendship and sincere \nco-operation with all peoples and countries that \nlove freedom and peace. That foreign policy, \nwhich is guided by the principles of proletarian \ninternationalism, is free from the slightest \nsign of narrow nationalism, chauvinism or \nnational exclusiveness or any tendency to \nunderrate others. It has always been and \ncontinues to be against the policy of aggression \nand oppression of the two super-Powers, the \nUnited States and the Soviet Union, with which we \nneither have nor ever will have relations or lint \ns of any kind. United States imperialism and \nSoviet social- imperialism have been and remain \nthe greatest enemies of the freedom and \nindependence of peoples. We are against their \nattempts to create the psychosis according to \nwhich the world can only find stability under \ntheir tutelage. We have never accepted that \ninternational policy should be the monopoly of \nthe super-Powers.\n134.\tProceeding from the well-known principles \nof equality, respect for sovereignty, \nnon-interference in the internal affairs of \nothers and mutual benefit, our country has \nextended and strengthened its relations of \nfriendship and co-operation with other States, \nwith all countries that love freedom and peace. \nIt has diplomatic relations with some 100 \ncountries from all continents and trade and \ncultural relations with a large number of them. \nWe are in favor of conducting normal and free \ntrade exchanges without discrimination or \nrestrictive measures, and against maneuvers and \nattempts by anyone to exploit them as a means of \npressure and to impose their own will and \npolitical views. We also favor exchanges in the \nfields of art, culture, science and so on and \nbelieve that these should be expanded and enable \nthe peoples to acquaint themselves with each \nother's achievements.\n135.\tThis year the Albanian people will \ncelebrate an important event in its history\u00f3the \nseventieth anniversary of the proclamation of \nindependence, which was the culmination of their \ncentury-long struggle for national independence. \nThey had to make innumerable sacrifices and shed \nmuch blood to win genuine freedom and \nindependence, to become sovereign masters of \ntheir own homeland and to open the road to \ndevelopment and progress. For our people have \nalways valued national freedom and independence \nabove all else. Hence, national oppression and \npractices of national discrimination, wherever \nthey occur and in whatever form and no matter \nwhat the pretext or justification, are alien to \nus. We are against any policy of \ndenationalization, against restrictions in and \nobstacles to the protection and free development \nof the national culture, art, language and \neducation, against the negation of traditions and \nhistory. Every people, big or small, has the \nabsolute right to preserve and affirm its \nnational identity. Respect for national dignity \nand values and with the other rights flowing from \nthe principles of the Charter of the United \nNations creates conditions in which the peoples \ncan live in friendship and States can have normal \nrelations with each other.\n136.\tSocialist Albania, without stretching out \nits hand to anyone for aid or credits, has \nensured an independent and vigorous development \nin all fields of life. It has averted the \ndestructive consequences of the  world economic \nand political crisis and created favorable \nconditions for the constant improvement of the \nwelfare of the working masses of the country. The \nnew price cuts which came into effect in June \nthis year in Albania, at a time when everywhere \nelse the opposite was happening, were a clear \ndemonstration of the vitality of our socialist \norder.\n137.\tThere are those that accuse Albania of \nbeing isolated and cut off. This is not true. We \nare vigilant because we are alert and know that \nenemies are hatching plots against socialist \nAlbania, because we see clearly and a familiar \nwith their methods and the plots they direct \nagainst other peoples.\n138.\tIt does not bother us if some journalist \nwrites an article alleging that Albania is a \nclosed and a poor country. We find such \npropaganda worthless. Our people are satisfied \nwith their own political and economic situation. \nThey have everything they need and are sure that \nthey will have much more in the future. It is to \nthat end that they are working and struggling, \nrelying entirely on their own resources. We would \nlike to inform those who are supposedly concerned \nabout the well-being of our people that in the \npart of the world where, according to them, \nabundance and well-being prevail, there in fact \nexists an incurable economic crisis that has \nthrown millions of unemployed persons into the \nstreets, and that in their countries prices \ncontinue to rise and drugs and vandalism run \nriot. In socialist Albania, which they regard as \na poor country, such phenomena do not exist. \nPerhaps those critics would enjoy seeing us too \nbecoming prey to such phenomena\u00f3but that will \nnever happen. Such things will never be condoned \nin our country; there is no room for them there. \nAlbania has kept its door closed to such things \nin the past and will continue to do so in the \nfuture. But it has opened and will open its doors \nto its many friends and well-wishers who exist \namong the peoples and to whom we are grateful.\n139.\tThe Albanian delegation will spare no \neffort to make its modest contribution to the \nproceedings of this session of the General \nAssembly so that its work may take a proper \ncourse that with serve the interests of peoples \nand of peace.\n"

        "file_text": "The unanimous election of Mr. Hollai to the \npresidency of the Assembly is a tribute to the \nPeople's Republic of Hungary, a country with \nwhich Madagascar is glad to have very cordial \nrelations based on our common aspiration to \nsocial progress, and if I can speak as a former \ncolleague I must say that we also see in this \nelection recognition of his personal qualities \nand his unceasing contributions to the \ndeliberations and work of the United Nations. To \nhis predecessor, Mr. Kittani, we would address \nfraternal thanks for the exemplary and \nresponsible way in which he carried out his \nmandate. It is also fitting for us again to \nexpress the confidence of the Malagasy Government \nin the Secretary General and to assure him of the \nfull cooperation of our delegation.\nAt the last session, when analyzing the \ninternational situation, the Foreign Minister of \nthe Democratic Republic of Madagascar highlighted \nthree points: the failure of the system of \ncollective security drawn up in the Charter in \nrather special circumstances; the widespread \ninsecurity in international relations; and the \nneed for a multilateral approach to both the \nassessment and the solution of world problems.\nThat analysis is still valid today, particularly \nnow that we are so bitter and disconcerted to see \nthat despite the numerous meetings, the \nsuccession of conferences and the numerous \nconsultations we still cannot manage to emerge \nfrom the world political and economic crisis. How \ncould it be otherwise, when real or potential \nconflicts are constantly on the increase, and \nwhen, through neglect or of necessity or \ninadvertently, the determination of priorities is \ngoverned by one law only, the law of confusion, \nand when we are virtually helpless in the face of \nthe return of the primacy of national interests?\nThe most pessimistic among us are quite willing \nto say that we have tried all remedies, that \nnothing can be done about this problem, that all \nwe can do is remain content with a short lived \nrespite from time to time. We are tempted to \nagree with them, because the notions on which the \nhopes of a just and equitable redefinition of \ninternational relations were based have been \ndiscarded. What happened to detente? What about \npeaceful coexistence? Is it now obsolete? And \nwhat happened to the right of peoples and nations \nto independent development? Are we still bound by \ninternational solidarity? The generous enthusiasm \nof the 1970s is no longer with us, and we are \nwitnessing the erosion of the collective \nresponsibility necessary for vision and the \nmanagement of a world that obviously can no \nlonger be what it was 37 years ago.\nThe vast majority of the countries of the third \nworld were not present at the time of the \ndrafting of the Charter, the limits and even the \nimperfections of which we recognize. But in \njoining the Organization we were determined to \nremain as faithful as possible to the precepts of \nthe Charter. In that respect we were idealists, \nbecause, for example, we thought that by \nbrandishing the Charter we would be able to rid \nthe world of. But at the end of the twentieth \ncentury Apartheid remains at the center of our \nconcerns. It is an inhuman and retrograde policy \nif ever there was one. The racial segregation \npracticed in South Africa is detrimental not only \nto the dignity and well being of the non white \npopulation of that country; it poisons the \npolitical life of the continent as a whole, and \nits persistence makes it impossible for us to \ntalk about true stability or peace in either the \nshort term or the long term.\nThe\tregime presupposes the use of force, \nbecause no ethnic group can willingly submit to \ndomination and exploitation by another group. To \nstay in power this regime has to ensure that its \nvictims will stop being inspired by the example \nof the independent African countries. It has to \nundermine and destroy the network of solidarity \nwhich the South African liberation movement, \nessentially the African National Congress, enjoys \nor may enjoy beyond the frontiers of South \nAfrica. That is why the Pretoria authorities do \nnot hesitate to show their anti  African nature \nby increasing their acts of aggression, \ninterference and destabilization against their \nimmediate or more distant neighbors, in \nparticular those of southern and eastern Africa.\nThe sister Republic of Seychelles will take a \nlong time to recover economically from the \nmercenary aggression of 25 November 1981 and to \nregain the security it needs to press ahead with \nits policies and the development that should be \npromoted by enabling the Special Fund set up \nunder resolution 3202 to become operational.\nThe racist regime sends into action mercenaries \nand bandits, which it trains, finances, leads and \ncommands, in order to challenge the socialist \ncourse followed by Mozambique.\nAngola, which has suffered several acts of \naggression since independence in 1975, has had \npart of its territory occupied for more than a \nyear by South African troops; its airspace is \nconstantly violated, and its civilian population \nand installations are constantly at the mercy of \nbombardments and airborne troops.\nWas that provided for in the Charter? Is it \ntolerable? The only answer can be no, but when we \nAfricans who are in our flesh and in our dignity \nvictims of the system of Apartheid and the \nextortion that accompanies it ask for sanctions \nagainst Pretoria or compliance with and the \nstrengthening of the arms embargo decreed by the \nSecurity Council, all we get is unwillingness to \nact and vetoes.\nIn Namibia, which South Africa still considers to \nbe one of its provinces, Pretoria has done \nnothing to break the infernal cycle of injustice, \nturmoil and repression through voluntary \nrenunciation of a policy that is constantly \nchallenged. Instead, the racist regime continues \nto rely on force to suppress or at least to \nthwart the desire for emancipation of those who \ndisagree with it and continues to maintain the \nillegal occupation of the Territory.\nIt is regrettable that certain circles, \ndisregarding this aspect, refuse to recognize \nSWAPO as the authentic and sole representative of \nthe Namibian people and continue to treat it as a \nterrorist organization, showing a lack of \nsensitivity towards the large  scale physical \nliquidation of SWAPO militants. Those same \ncircles have been the most zealous advocates of \nthe need to shore up confidence in the racist \nregime and to keep it secure, as if injustice and \nillegal occupation needed comfort or \nconsolidation.\nRecently those same circles have not hesitated to \ngo beyond South African requests by reimposing a \nconditional link between the independence of \nNamibia and the withdrawal of the Cuban \ninternationalist troops that are in Angola at the \nrequest of the Angolan Government. Leaving aside \nthe fact that this would constitute a flagrant \nintervention in the internal affairs of a \nsovereign independent State, this proposed link \nis truly surprising. It seems to be forgotten \nthat it was South Africa that committed \naggression against Angola and not the other way \nround. Now it is South Africa that needs to be \nprotected against the combined forces of Angola \nand Cuba. Instead of internationalist or why not \nmultinational troops being brought in to provide \nprotection for that country, those that are there \nare being asked to leave.\nFor this reason we support the terms of the \ncommunique of the summit meeting of the front \nline States held in Lusaka on 4 September 1982. \nReaffirming that Security Council resolutions 386 \n(1976) and 435 (1978) are the sole valid basis \nfor a negotiated settlement of the Namibian \nquestion, we subscribe to the position of the non \naligned countries that the United Nations has the \nprime responsibility for the solution of this \nquestion, with a view to the rapid transition of \nthe Territory to independence. If that \nindependence is further delayed, the Organization \nshould shoulder its responsibility and proclaim \nNamibia independent, with all the consequences \nwhich that might have, particularly for South \nAfrica, whose rights in the matter we challenge, \nfor the Member States, which cannot with impunity \nabandon the Namibians to their fate and, lastly, \nfor the Organization itself, one of whose primary \nobjectives is after all the liberation of peoples.\nThe unanimity of the African States on the \npolitical liberation of Africa, particularly of \nits southern part, we should have liked to see \nmanifested in a positive manner in respect of \nWestern Sahara. For us, the admission of the \nSahraoui Arab Democratic Republic as the fifty \nfirst member of the Organization of African Unity \nis irreversible because it represents an \nimportant stage in the struggle of the Sahraoui \npeople to put an end to the Moroccan occupation, \nwhich we continue to denounce, and to enjoy fully \nindependence, sovereignty and their inalienable \nnational rights. Last year, in Nairobi, at the \neighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of \nState and Government of the OAU, a consensus \nemerged ' in respect of the framework in which \nthe exercise of those rights could take place and \nno divergence of views manifested itself as to \nthe need for a ceasefire and negotiations between \nthe parties to the conflict, which in our opinion \ncan only be Morocco and POLISARIO,\nThe crisis experienced by the OAU does not date \nfrom the admission of the Sahraoui Arab \nDemocratic Republic to that organization but it \nis evident that\nits solution depends to a great extent on the \ncommencement and successful outcome of \nnegotiations on Western Sahara. The error in this \nmatter, if there has been an error, does not lie \nin the existence of divergent views, but may \nderive from the belief that unity can be achieved \nat any price and on any conditions. The African \ndetermination to overcome this crisis is still as \nfirm as ever and we shall achieve our aims and be \neven more strengthened in our principles and \nconvictions, if only to confound those who have \ncounted on a temporarily disunited Africa in \norder to promote certain interests which will \nnever be ours.\nOn the Middle East, there are those who would \nlike to calm our apprehensions by suggesting that \nthe recent Israeli aggression against Lebanon and \nthe Palestinian people ended in political defeat. \nIn Israel itself something seems to have changed, \nsomething resembling the qualms of a conscience \nwhich had long been accustomed to accept the \ndouble talk of the Government; while among the \nmost fervent defenders of the Zionist regime \nthere are those who complain they have been led \nastray by Begin and Sharon and now seem to \nrecognize the dangers of unconditional support \nfor Israel and the virtues of a more critical and \nobjective attitude to its crimes.\nAlthough salutary those reactions have come \nrather late and we cannot forget what a great \nprice has been paid by the Palestinian people in \norder to bring about these modest movements in \npublic opinion. Israel is now its own rejection \nfront. It is the only country which has rejected \nin tum the United Nations plan, the Fahd plan, \nthe Reagan plan, the Brezhnev plan and the Fez \nplan. In its isolation, and even though it is in \nthe wrong, none the less Israel in fact, however \nwrongly, holds positions of strength which enable \nit to veto any proposed solution. Its supplies of \nweapons, munitions and military hardware continue \nto be assured. It occupies Jerusalem, Lebanon and \nthe Golan Heights. The West Bank and the Gaza \nStrip are under relentless control. The \nsettlements are solidly established and do not \nseem to be threatened. The liquidation of the \nPalestinian resistance continues, with the use of \nmethods the horror of which transcends \nimagination, including as they do genocide.\nIn this connection the President of my country \nwrote as follows in a message to the Secretary \nGeneral dated 19 September: from now on, the word \ngenocide will bring to mind not Oradour, but \nBeirut... the holocaust, the concentration camps \nand systematic massacres at Dachau and Buchenwald \nare eclipsed, as we near the end of the twentieth \ncentury, by the final solution perpetrated by \nBegin\u00eds and Sharon's executioners. Now, after the \ngenocide in west Beirut, we feel bound to declare \nto the world that verbal condemnations and United \nNations resolutions are no longer enough but that \nit is time for action. I therefore have the honor \nto request you: To call upon all the great Powers \nto impose an economic, commercial, diplomatic and \nmilitary embargo on Begin's Fascist and extremist \nIsrael; in particular, that the great Powers \nwhich boycotted Argentina at the time of the \nMalvinas affair should desist immediately from \nsupplying Israel with arms, munitions and \npetroleum. To consider the possibility of \norganizing an international tribunal along the \nlines of the Nuremberg Tribunal against the \nIsraeli Fascist war criminals and their Lebanese \naccomplices. To demand the immediate and \nunconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from \nLebanon. It is high time for a review of history, \ngeography and frontiers in this explosive region \nof the world and to give the martyred Palestinian \npeople a State, a homeland, a nation of their \nown. In the absence of urgent, concrete and \ndecisive action, we greatly fear that the peace \nof the whole world will be very seriously \nthreatened. In another part of the world a \ndeplorable conflict has been taking place for \nmore than two years between two countries which, \nlike my country, belong to the non aligned \nmovement. We have no more ardent desire than to \nsee the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq resolve \ntheir conflict in a peaceful manner, bringing the \nhostilities to an end as soon as possible, \nbecause their own interests and the interests of \nthe rest of the world are at stake. En this \nrespect we are encouraged to see that, within the \nframework of the current meeting of Foreign \nMinisters of non aligned countries, the two \nparties have agreed to accept a consensus text \nreaffirming the principles of the movement and \nthose of the Charter, principles which can and \nmust serve to bring about a just and lasting \nsettlement of this dispute. The armed conflict \nwhich broke out this spring in respect of the \nMalvinas was a source of great consternation to \nthe world because of its intensity and its \nramifications, involving regional alliances. Was \nthis confrontation inevitable, once the \nnegotiations between Argentina and the United \nKingdom had remained too long in a state of \nuncertainty? As the General Assembly now intends \nto invite the parties to resume their talks, it \nis important in our opinion to learn from the \npast, and in particular from the recent past. We \nmay wonder, among other things, whether the idea \nof self determination should constitute a \nrelevant factor in these negotiations. Just as \nthe Jewish settlers living in the settlements set \nup by Israel do not acquire the right to take \npart in a referendum on self determination \nconcerning the future of the occupied Arab and \nPalestinian territories, so in the same way the \npersonnel transferred by the Falkland Islands \nCompany for the purposes of the colonial \nexploitation of the islands cannot determine by \ntheir vote the question of sovereignty over those \nislands.\nAlthough it is not on the agenda, the question of \nKorea is none the less of concern to Member \nStates. We do not believe that the solution lies \nin the endorsement of the division of the country \nand the admission of two Korean entities into the \nOrganization. How will that resolve the problems \nposed by the abuse of the United Nations flag and \nthe introduction of atomic weapons into the \npeninsula? Direct negotiations between the two \nparties is inevitable if there is a real desire \nto make progress  towards the settlement of this \ncrisis and they are all the more called for since \nthe joint communique of 4 July 1972 has defined \nthe basis for negotiations. We would add only \nthat the principles of that communique are in no \nway incompatible with the establishment of the \ngreat Koryo confederation which we very much look \nforward to.\nOther hotbeds of tension exist in Asia, Central \nAmerica and the Caribbean and we are concerned by \nthem because they do violence to the principles \nwhich we cherish, particularly the right to self \ndetermination, respect for sovereignty, \nindependence and territorial integrity of States, \nthe right of peoples to choose freely without \ninterference of any kind their political, social \nand economic regime, and the right of nations to \npreserve by all possible means the gains of their \nrevolution. We will not repeat our position, \nwhich is constant and well known. We wish to \nassure our friends and comrades from those \nregions that our solidarity is with them, as it \nis with all the victims of destabilization, \ninjustice and imperia list domination.\nBefore proceeding to consider the world economic \nsituation, I should like fairly briefly to touch \nupon disarmament. At the second special session \nof the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, \nwe tried to maintain the impetus of the first \nspecial session and despite some rather \nunfavorable factors we felt that the time had \ncome to promote further a multilateral approach \nto disarmament, particularly in view of the risks \nattendant upon the bilateral negotiations. We did \nnot succeed in our aims, but this is no reason \nfor us to abandon the comprehensive programme for \ndisarmament, the complete prohibition of nuclear \nweapons tests, the control of strategic nuclear \nweapons, or the strengthening of the nuclear non \nproliferation regime, particularly as regards \nnegative security guarantees.\nWe still believe that the two approaches, \nbilateral and multilateral, strengthen and \ncomplement each other, particularly in the case \nof nuclear  weapon free zones, zones where the \nlimitation of conventional weapons is envisaged, \nand zones of peace such as the Indian Ocean, \nwhich, for our own security and for the sake \nworld peace, should become a demilitarized, \ndenuclearized zone. On this matter the proposals \nof the non aligned countries are blocked, but an \nIndian Ocean treaty remains our final objective \nand we once again urge the great Powers to reduce \ntheir military presence in the Indian Ocean area \nas a first step towards the eventual elimination \nof the great Power presence and the \nimplementation of the Declaration of the Indian \nOcean as a Zone of Peace. Such was the unanimous \nposition of the non aligned countries at the \nministerial meeting of their Coordinating Bureau \nat Havana last June. I should now like to refer \nto the economic situation and first to point out \nthat the deterioration of the situation, which is \na manifestation of a structural crisis, has \nbecome one of the most serious political problems \nof our age, since it is a potential source of \ninstability and insecurity for all countries, \nboth the developing countries, which already have \nnegative growth rates, and the developed \ncountries, where the recession is continually \ngetting worse and unemployment rates have become \nuncontrollable The crisis is widespread: it is \nglobal and it will remain with us for a long time \nbecause of the deterioration of the international \neconomic climate and the emergence of trends \nwhich are not favorable to integrated development \nbased on solidarity.\nAlthough the consequences of the crisis have been \nfelt grievously by the international community as \na whole, its bad effects have hit much harder at \nthe developing countries. The repercussions of \nthis are manifold, but some of them need to be \nemphasized. The developing countries have a large \ntrade deficit, mainly due to unequal terms of \ntrade and stagnant production. Despite their \nproducers' associations, they have no control \nover commodity prices on international markets, \nor over the rising prices of capital goods; they \nare therefore subjected to inflated import prices \nand reductions in the prices of their exports, \nwhich lead in turn to a net reduction in \ninvestment, forcing them to sacrifice part of \ntheir development programme.\nThe deficit in their balance of payments, \nresulting from the increase in their financial \nobligations in the private capital markets and \nthe high level of interest rates have led to an \nunprecedented increase in the external debt of \nthose countries, to about $540 billion at the end \nof 1981. The servicing of that debt alone absorbs \nan average of 25 per cent in some cases over 40 \nper cent of their export earnings.\nMoreover, in the field of multilateral \ncooperation, despite the encouraging indications, \nofficial assistance for development is slowing \ndown. The financing of the programmes and funds \nof the UnitedNations system is becoming more and \nmore uncertain, while support for multilateral \nfinancial institutions is crumbling and the \nmassive transfer of resources remains illusory.\nIn the quest for solutions to these problems, we \nshould like simply to take up again the following \npoints which have already been discussed many \ntimes by the States members of the Group of 77.\nFirst, interdependent economic relations as they \nare in the present day world are still unbalanced \nand reflect inequalities of development. The aim \ncan no longer be the recovery of the world \neconomy on the basis of an undifferentiated \nprocess of growth; there must be development of \nthe countries of the third world fully in keeping \nwith their options.\nSecondly, the problems posed by world trade, the \nfinancing of development and the international \nmonetary system require concerted action and \ncannot be dealt with without a recognition of the \nharmful effects of certain national policies on \nthe world economy, and particularly the economy \nof the developing countries. We have not \nadequately grasped these effects because of the \ndistance between the decision making centers; \nthat is why we consider it essential that the \nsixth session of UNCTAD should provide Member \nStates with an opportunity to deal in an \nintegrated manner with development issues.\nFinally, the third aspect of joint endeavor is \nrequired to restore an economic environment \nfavorable to development and the recovery of the \nworld economy, with due regard for the objectives \nof the new international economic order. These \nfew considerations confirm the value of global \nnegotiations and we look forward to seeing these \nnegotiations open as soon as possible. Desirous \nof being considered as equal partners in the \nreform of international economic relations, the \nthird world countries have proposed an agenda and \na procedure for these negotiations which reflect \ntheir belief that equity and justice alone can \nassure a reorganization of relations governing \ncountries which have long been categorized on the \nbasis of an incorrect understanding of the \ninternational division of labor. At the beginning \nof my statement, I referred to the erosion of \ncollective responsibility which is not only due \nto the fact that each one of us wishes to propose \nor, in the worst of situations, to impose its own \nsolution. In this respect we must first of all \nrevitalize and strengthen what should properly be \ncalled the pillars of the Organization, that is \nto say, all the organs or machinery for \nconsultation and decision making at the regional \nand intergovernmental levels, taking care, \nhowever, to avoid further polarizing positions, \nand adopting convergent approaches in the \ninterest of security for all in all spheres. The \nsolution of conflicts will thus be made easier \nand one can even hope that conflicts will even be \navoided. This requires, however, that we examine \nour priorities in the light of the permanent \ninterdependence of problems which will continue \nto confront a world of increasing solidarity. In \nour view, it is not too late to check \nconfrontation hither between East and West, North \nand South or even between countries of the South \nin order to make mutual recognition of interests \nthe comer stone of cooperation and coexistence. \nIn short, as Members of the Organization we must, \nin facing the crises before us, be open  minded \nand positive, resist temptations towards \nfragmentation and maintain the common principles \nto which we have freely consented, without \nallowing ourselves to have recourse to expedients \nin the name of pragmatism and acceptance of \nreality. It is in this context that we have \nstudied the Secretary General's report on the \nwork of the Organization with the greatest \ninterest. Our concerns are very much his own, \nand, since the Organization is not just the \nsymbol of collective responsibility but also the \nmost appropriate framework for its implementation \nand further development, we can but rejoice if \nthe indications given by the Secretary General in \nhis report are followed up by deeds, particularly \nby the permanent members of the SecurityCouncil. \nThis would put to an end the continual challenge \nto the authority and functioning of the \nOrganization. To take up this challenge is also \none of the reasons and not the least for our \nparticipating in this general debate. For our \npart, we renew our whole hearted commitment to do \nour utmost in this respect and in the cause of \npeace.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to begin by congratulating the \nPresident on his election to the high office he \nhas been asked to fill at this session of the \nGeneral Assembly. His contribution as President \nof this forum will undoubtedly be invaluable in \nachieving the success we hope for in the tasks \nwith which we have been entrusted, especially in \nthe fulfillment of the principles and purpose of \nthe Charter.\n233.\tMy country would also like to greet, \nthrough him, the friendly nation of Hungary, with \nwhich we have a very close and productive \nrelationship.\n234.\tNor can I omit to take this opportunity \nto recall the outstanding performance of Mr. \nKittani of Iraq, and to reaffirm our appreciation \nof the ability and effectiveness with which he \ncarried out his task at a particularly difficult \nsession of the General Assembly.\n235.\tFinally, before I reach the substance of \nmy statement, I should like, as Minister for \nForeign Affairs of a Latin American country, to \ngreet most warmly the first Latin American \nSecretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, \nto whom my country is deeply indebted for his \nearnest efforts during the South Atlantic crisis \nto reach a solution to the conflict.\n236.\tThis year my country had to deal with a \ngrave international crisis rooted in the fact \nthat even today, on the eve of the twenty-first \ncentury, there remain forms of colonial \ndomination in the world, despite the efforts of \nthe Organization and of the overwhelming majority \nof its Member States to eradicate them. The \ncrisis to which I am referring, which resumed in \nan armed confrontation between Argentina and the \nUnited Kingdom, would not have taken place had \ncolonialism and its vestiges been completely \neliminated from the face of the earth.\n237.\tThe conflict which took place in the \nSouth Atlantic, comprising the Malvinas Islands, \nSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, \nshows that there is as yet no end to the efforts \nof the United Kingdom to cling to its colonial \npossessions and to maintain its privileges, \nsomething possible only in an international state \nof affairs which is based on the existence of \nunequal relations, supported in the main by the \ncrude domination of force.\n238.\tThe Government of the United Kingdom has \nattempted to obscure the very clear rights of the \nRepublic of Argentina to claim territories of \nwhich it was divested by force; but the General \nAssembly is well aware of the historical \nbackground of the matter and the stubborn British \nattempts to distort it have come to naught.\n239.\tExisting cartographic proofs offered by \nmaps of that time demonstrate that the Malvinas \nIslands were discovered by Spanish navigators in \nthe first half of the sixteenth century. Then, \nsince the beginning of the seventeenth century, \nthey were explored by French navigators until \n1764, when Louis de Bougainville established the \nPort Louis settlement, now Soledad Island, a \nsituation which gave rise to a Spanish protest \nand a subsequent recognition by France of the \nsover\u00aceignty of Spain over these territories. In \n1766 Port Egmont was established in the islet of \nTrinidad, the only territory occupied by the \nBritish in the Malvinas Islands, from which they \nwere also expelled by the Buenos Aires Government \non 10 June 1770.\n240.\tSubsequently secret diplomatic \nnegotiations led to the precarious restitution of \nthose settlements to the British on condition \nthat at a later date they would have to withdraw \nfrom them definitively, a commit\u00acment which the \nUnited Kingdom fulfilled in 1774. Since then the \nUnited Kingdom virtually forgot all about the \nislands until it took them by force in 1833.\n241.\tIn the period between 1767 and 1810, a \nyear when Argentina started on its road to \nindependence, the Malvinas were administered by \n20 governors appointed by the Spanish Crown. The \nRepublic of Argentina, having become independent \nfrom Spain, then succeeded Spain in all its \nrights, including the rights of sovereignty over \nthe islands which belonged to Spain. By virtue of \nthis, until 1833, the administra\u00action of the \nMalvinas was exercised by six Argentinean \ngovernors, under whose government my country had \nthe peaceful and exclusive occupation of the \narchi\u00acpelago, without any discussion by the \nEuropean powers of our claims, titles and rights \nto these territo\u00acries. What must be emphasized, \nbecause it is a decisive point, is that the \nUnited Kingdom in 1825 recognized that the \nRepublic of Argentina was a sovereign State, and \nat that time entered into a treaty of friendship, \ntrade and navigation with Argentina and did not \nthen voice any reservation with regard to its \nalleged rights over the Malvinas Islands or any \nother adjacent terri\u00actories. This most clearly \ndemonstrates that the United Kingdom was aware of \nthe fact that it had absolutely no right over the \nMalvinas Islands and archipelago, whose \nsovereignty it questions today.\n242.\tOn 3 January 1833, eight year^ after \nArgentina was recognized as a sovereign State, \nand after the signing of the treaty of \nfriendship, trade and naviga\u00action, British troops \noccupied the islands by force, bringing down the \nArgentinean flag, expelling Argentinean \nauthorities and Argentinean citizens, residents \nof the area and forcing them to go to Montevideo. \nThe Argentinean population was thus completely \nreplaced by a British military garrison.\n243.\tOn 15 and 22 January of that same year, \nthe Government of Argentina sent a protest to the \nCharge d'affaires of Great Britain in Buenos \nAires, and on 17 June the Argentine Minister, Don \nManuel Moreno, voiced the most energetic protest \nin London. Thus began an uninterrupted series of \nArgentinean protests against the British \noccupation and in all cases these were \narbitrarily rejected by the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom.\n244.\tThe Republic of Argentina never agreed to \nthe British occupation, nor did it ever give up \nits sover\u00aceign rights over the territory of which \nit was divested by force. All this is more than \nenough to show the inequity of any claims of \nacquisition by the United Kingdom.\n245.\tLet the Assembly compare the historic and \ncon\u00acsistent stand of my country with the silence \nof Great Britain in 1825 and its ominous \naggression of 1833.\n246.\tLet us come back now to our times. \nFollowing the creation of the United Nations the \ntreatment in the Organization of the item of \ndecolonization brought with it the adoption of \nthe well-known General Assem\u00acbly resolution 1514 \n(XV), which deals with decoloniza\u00action, as well \nas resolutions 2065 (XX) and 3160 (XXVIII) and \n31/49, which is specifically applicable to the \ncase of the Malvinas.\n247.\tIt was thus decided, first, that there \nwas recog\u00acnition of the existence of a dispute \nover sovereignty between the Republic of \nArgentina and the United Kingdom, secondly, an \ninvitation to those Govern\u00acments to continue \nforthwith negotiations to achieve a peaceful \nsolution of the matter, bearing in mind the \nprovisions and objectives of the Charter, as well \nas the interests\u2014not the wishes\u2014of the population \nof the islands; thirdly, the recognition of the \nefforts made by the Republic of Argentina to \nfacilitate the decolonization process and to \npromote the well-being of the population of the \nislands.\n248.\tStarting in 1966 negotiations began \nbetween the two Governments but these \nnegotiations did not lead to any result because \nof the indifferent attitude and dilatory tactics \ndisplayed by the British.\n249.\tAcceptance by the United Kingdom of the \ninvita\u00action to negotiate on the matter of \nsovereignty, for\u00acmulated in resolution 2065 (XX), \nwas embodied in the communications of Foreign \nMinisters Zavala Ortiz and Stewart,'3 as a result \nof the visit of the latter to Buenos Aires in \n1966. Clearly this acceptance was encouraging for \nit reflected, apparently, the beginning of a \nchange in the British position, which up to that \ntime had rejected all negotiations on the matter \nof sovereignty of the archipelago.\n250.\tLater the terms of reference of the \nnegotiation were formally set out in the joint \ncommunique of 26 April 1977,\\\" which stated \nspecifically that it would include the matter of \nsovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, South \nGeorgia and the South Sandwich Islands. That \nagreement between Argentina and the United \nKingdom was explicitly recognized in the parallel \nnotes addressed in June 1979's by the Per\u00acmanent \nRepresentatives of my country and of the United \nKingdom to the Secretary-General, informing him \nthat from 21 to 23 March 1979 the representatives \nof the Governments of both countries had held the \nfourth round of negotiations on the Malvinas \nIslands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich \nIslands, within the framework established in the \naforementioned communique of 26 April 1977.\n251.\tNevertheless, the obligations undertaken \nby the United Kingdom in those documents and 17 \nyears of negotiations failed to convince the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom to deal with the \nmatter of sover\u00aceignty fully and in good faith. \nThat was an arbitrary attitude which could not be \nexplained in the light of the clarity of the \ncommitments entered into.\n252.\tOn the contrary, my country continued to \ndemonstrate at all times its sincere resolve to \nsettle the dispute. Further proof of that was the \nletters addressed to the Secretary-General in \n1971 by the Permanent Representatives of \nArgentina and the United Kingdom^ on opening up \ncommunications between continental Argentina and \nthe archipelago, for that statement demonstrated \nin fact the declared intent of Argentina duly to \ntake into account the interests of the \ninhabitants of the Malvinas.\n253.\tThus the supply of fuel, the \nestablishment of regular maritime and air \nservices, free medical atten\u00action in hospitals on \nthe continent, the granting of fellowships in \neducational institutions and the supply of \nfoodstuffs are some of the many indications of \nthe sincere desire of Argentina to continue to \nimprove considerably the standard of living of \nthe inhabitants of the islands, which up to that \ntime had been isolated and had suffered \nshortages, which Argentina\u2014not the United \nKingdom\u2014tried to make good in the best interests \nof the inhabitants of the Malvinas.\n254.\tOne should bear in mind also that along \nwith this, and from the beginning of the \nnegotiations, my country repeatedly oHered to \ngrant guarantees and safeguards under the \nprotection of the United Nations in order to \npreserve the lifestyle of the inhabitants of the \nMalvinas, as well as their traditions and \ncustoms, with the idea of considering their \ninterests, an idea which is contained in General \nAssembly resolution 2065 (XX).\n255.\tNevertheless, despite all the efforts of \nsucces\u00acsive Argentine delegations in the rounds \nof negotia\u00actions, which were once again renewed \nat the last meeting in February 1982, it was not \npossible to get from the British delegations, \nwhich also included islanders, a list of the \nguarantees and safeguards which they required for \nthe protection of their interests.\n256.\tThe positive attitude demonstrated by \nArgentina in presenting to the United Kingdom in \nFebruary of this year a new proposal for settling \nthe dispute between the two countries met with \ncomplete silence on the part of the British \nGovernment. That proposal provided for a \nmachinery to speed negotiations over sovereignty \nand achieve concrete results in the form of a \nsystem of monthly meetings, with a \npre-established agenda, the venue of the meetings \nestablished in advance, presided over by \nofficials at the highest level.\nBut, as already stated, in accordance with the \nusual practice of Britain in matters of \nnegotiation with our country, we were not able to \nobtain a reply to this reasonable initiative by \nArgentina, despite the requests made by our \nGovernment.\n257.\tWe come now to the episode which \nunleashed the present crisis. Argentina received \nthe British ultimatum to withdraw a group of \ncivilian workers who had landed on South Georgia \nto fulfill a private contract, which was known to \nthe British authorities, under the threat of the \nuse of force if their demand was not heeded. That \nintimidation was accompanied by the movement \ntowards that area of various naval units, \nincluding nuclear submarines.\n258.\tThus the bloodless occupation of the \nMalvinas Islands by Argentina was a justified \nreaction in the face of the British decision to \nstrengthen its colonial domination over a \nterritory which by law belongs to my country and \nin flagrant contradiction with the provisions of \nGeneral Assembly resolution 31/49. I should like \nto emphasize that the recovery of the islands was \nachieved without the British suffering a single \ndeath or injury due in any way to the intentions \nof Argentina, a country which preferred to \nsacrifice many of its own soldiers for the sake \nof not causing any victims among the British \noccupying forces or the population.\n259.\tFurthermore, I should like to recall that \nimme\u00acdiately and without any pre-condition the \nRepublic of Argentina returned all British \nmilitary personnel, along with their flags, in \norder to avoid further prob\u00aclems in trying to \nreach a peaceful solution.\n260.\tThe recognition by Argentina of the \nauthority of the Security Council in this dispute \nwas made quite clear in many statements by my \nGovernment in favor of an effective and full \nimplementation of Council resolution 502 (1982). \nIn his statement at this session the President of \nBrazil, stressing the importance of the General \nAssembly's consideration of the question of the \nMalvinas, stated that the first step towards a \nsolution must be the full implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 502 (1982), adding: \n\\\"It is time for those who so vigorously condemn \nthe use of force in the solution of controversies \nto demonstrate the consistency and sincerity of \ntheir designs\\\".\n261.\tMy Government spared no effort in order \nto obtain immediately a negotiated settlement of \nthe crisis, accepting at all times the good \noffices offered to us; but we wonder about the \npossibility of arriving at a legitimate agreement \nwhen the United Kingdom, seeking no result other \nthan a military victory and the maintenance of \nthe colonial situation, brought its fleet into \nthe South Atlantic unlawfully, invoking Article \n51 of the Charter, and arrogated to itself the \nright to act, no matter what the consequences, by \ntaking all sorts of hostile measures.\n262.\tThe generous offer made by the Secretary- \nGeneral on 2 May this year, to be considered by \nboth Governments, did not achieve the solution \ncalled for by the serious crisis.\n263.\tThe Government of Argentina from the very \noutset had full confidence in the role which the \nOrganization, and especially the \nSecretary-General, could play in these grave \ncircumstances, to help with the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security and to eliminate \nall vestiges of colonialism in the world; but the \nUnited Kingdom adopted an extremely rigid \nposition with regard to the ideas which were \nbeing discussed, an attitude that was closely \nrelated to the increase of its military potential \nin the area.\n264.\tLater came Security Council resolution \n505 (1982), and a British veto on a draft \nresolution'? in the Security Council^ which, if \nadopted, would have made possible an immediate \ncease-fire, thus avoiding loss of life on both \nsides. This was the clearest proof of the lack of \npolitical will on the part of the United Kingdom \nto find a peaceful negotiated solution. The only \nthing which the British Govern\u00acment was \ninterested in was a success by its punitive \nfleet, to consolidate its imperialist presence in \nthe South Atlantic and improve its damaged \ndomestic political situation. The facts show that \nfrom the very beginning military action was the \nonly solution which the Conservative Government \nof the United Kingdom seriously considered.\n265.\tI am revealing no secret when I say that \nthe British Empire only reluctantly gave up its \ncolonies. Many of the nations represented here \nhave at one time in their history been colonies \nof the United Kingdom and know that their present \nsituation as sovereign States is not due to any \ngracious conces\u00acsion on the part of that Power, \nagreeing m a gesture of generosity to grant them \nindependence. On the con\u00actrary, every case of \nliberation was the result of a very difficult and \ncruel struggle by the oppressed peoples, or of \nthe final inability of the United Kingdom to \ncontinue exercising its control over those people \nin the face of the irresistible force of the \ngreat movement of history leading to decolonization, \ngenerated essen\u00actially by the United Nations.\n266.\tThe United Kingdom, which today attempts \nto act as the champion of self-determination, is \npre\u00accisely the colonial Power par\twhich in \nmany cases raised all kinds of obstacles when the \nUnited Nations tried to assist the just process \nwhich made it possible to liquidate most of its \nEmpire.\n267.\tThus, in the specific case of the \nMalvinas Islands, the practice of the United \nKingdom thus far has been to pretend to fulfil \nthe requirements estab\u00aclished in the resolutions \nof the General Assembly, requiring it to \nnegotiate in the dispute over sover\u00aceignty, while \nin reality sabotaging any serious attempt to make \nprogress on that important problem. It proceeded \nthroughout with no sense of haste or urgency, \nwhile striving only to protect its special \nprivate interests, and the monopolistic \nexploitation of its colony.\n268.\tThe United Kingdom has proclaimed that \nArgentina resorted to action in the midst of the \nnegotiations about the islands. No statement \ncould be more false. That process has been \nfrustrated precisely by the dilatory tactics and \ndelays used time and again by the British \nGovernment, quite apart from its complete failure \nto reply to the last proposal made by Argentina \nin February 1982.\n269.\tMoreover, I wish to state categorically \nthat throughout the 17 years of fruitless \nnegotiations imposed upon the United Kingdom by \nthe will of the\nGeneral Assembly in 1965 in its resolution 2065 \n(XX), the administering colonial Power of our \nMalvinas, South Georgia and South Sandwich \nIslands never gave any indication of trying in \ngood faith to reach a solution to the dispute \nover sovereignty which exists between that \ncountry and Argentina, refusing to discuss the \nonly subject that justified those negotiations \nand made them necessary: precisely the question \nof sovereignty.\n270.\tAmong the basic principles which it sets \nforth for the fulfillment of the purposes of the \nUnited Nations, the Charter, in Article 2, \nparagraph 2, states that \\\"All Members, in order \nto ensure to all of them the rights and benefits \nresulting from membership, shall fulfill in good \nfaith the obligations assumed by them in \naccordance with the present Charter\\\". But the \nattitude of the United Kingdom constitutes a \nflagrant violation of this commitment to which it \nsubscribed when it signed the constitutional \nstatute of the Organization, and its actions and \nomissions have shown how little importance it \nattaches to the resolutions of one of the basic \npillars of the relations in the international \ncommunity.\n271.\tFurthermore, if any doubt remained, the \nattitude of the present Government of the United \nKingdom is full confirmation that its objective \nhas always been to continue its usurpation of the \nIslands and to accept only those superficial \nchanges which serve to conceal the true colonial \nnature of its domination over them.\n272.\tAnd if the existence of colonies is an \naffront to the dignity of the peoples and a \nshameful blot on the name of an international \ncommunity which claims to be civilized, even more \nshameful is the attempt to invoke the principles \nof decolonization to prolong the life of the \nill-omened remnants of an era that fortunately \nhas come to an end. The Government of the United \nKingdom is trying to whitewash the guilt of its \nunlawful occupation by invoking the right to \nself- determination of the inhabitants of the \nIslands. In so doing, it is attempting to justify \ntheir plundering by invoking the principles that \nare generally accepted in the United Nations in \nthe hope that the nations represented here will \nforget all the times when these principles were \nignored or denied by the same United Kingdom \nwhich now invokes them.\n273.\tFor if the United Kingdom states that it \nis a nation which respects the right of \nself-determination, we are faced with a true \nhistoric paradox. How are we then to explain the \nstruggle for independence and national \nsovereignty of India under Gandhi's leader\u00acship, \nhuman symbol of anti-colonialism, peace and \njustice in our century? How can we forget the \nwars of liberation in Africa against British \nimperialism ever since the end of the Second \nWorld War? How can we explain the subjugation and \ndomination suffered by the peoples of Asia at the \nzenith of the United Kingdom's imperial \nexpansion? Could we perchance forget that he \nUnited Kingdom not only violated the true \nself-determination of the peoples, but it also \nmade illegal use of force, violating the most \nelementary rules and principles of international \nlaw and ethics? Why did the United Kingdom, \nclaiming to be such a staunch defender of the \nself-determination of peoples, displace by force \nthe population of the island of Diego Garcia, to \nmake over that territory for the establishment of \na military base in the Indian Ocean?\nCotild it be perhaps because they were not white, \nbut Macks and people of mixed Mood?\n274.\tObviously, it is no mere historical \ncoincidence that some of the major leaders of the \ndeveloping world and champions in our day of the \nfreedom and independence of peoples\u2014men such as \nNehru, Nasser, Kenyatta, Nyerere and Archbishop \nMakarios, among others\u2014had to confront at various \ntimes in their political struggles the colonial \nor neo-colonial domi\u00acnation of British \nimperialism.\n275.\tThese facts show that when the U \u201e \nKingdom claims to be defending the right to \ndetermination of peoples, that is not only a way \nvt concealing the truth about the nature of its \nillegal colonial possession of the Malvinas \nIslands, South Georgia and South Sandwich, but \nalso a cynical attempt to adjust its position to \nthe world of today, in order to perpetuate its \nlast ties of political and economic domination; \nin other words, its intent is to seem to change \nthings so that they can remain the same. The \nright to self- determination is basically a \ncollective right, recognized for all peoples, \nnations and States. That right assumes a \nlegitimate relationship between those who are to \nbenefit and the territory to be decolonized, but \nthe territorial link cannot be of any type, \nbecause the right to self-determination can never \nbe used as an instrument to split up a territory.\n276.\tFor example, the settlements established \nby Israel in the occupied Arab and Palestinian \nterri\u00actories\u2014in contradiction of the rights of \nthe countries and populations affected, and of \nthe Geneva Con\u00acvention on the Protection of \nCivilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August \n1949, and in flagrant violation of the \nresolutions adopted by the Security Council and \nthe General Assembly\u2014are a clear example of a \npolicy infringing the right of territorial \nintegrity. The international community has \nrightly condemned such policies, since the \nperpetuation of these illegal situations at the \nexpense of Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the \nPalestinian people year after year has become a \nconstant source of tension and violence, \nendangering not only the Middle East but \ninternational peace and security.\n277.\tTherefore, recognition of the right to \nself- determination of a population implanted by \nforce, after the forced expulsion of those who \nwere legiti\u00acmately living in the area earlier, is \na mockery of the efforts of the Organization to \nput an end to colonialism, and can lead only to \nthe renewal of colonialism in the guise of a \nsettlement freely consented to. The relation\u00acship \nbetween those who claim freely to exercise the \nright to self-determination and the territory in \nwhich they live must come from a justifiable \nsituation that existed before the occupation.\n278.\tThe clear and maked truth is that the \nUnited Kingdom has established a colony in part \nof Argentine territory, and the definitive \nsolution must be the restitution of that \nterritory to its legitimate owner, in keeping \nwith the right of territorial integrity, which \nclearly applies to this case, in conformity with \nresolution 1514 (XV). Otherwise, I must give \nwarning that to legitimize the illicit origin of \nBritish pos\u00acsession would be to establish a \ndangerous precedent for legitimizing future \nseizures of territory, based on the use of force, \nyet subject, it would be claimed, to \nlegitimization by the passage of time.\n279.\tThe recent crisis in the South Atlantic prompted the Government \nof the United Kingdom not only to seek to \nconsolidate its colonial domination, this time \nquite openly, over the Malvinas Islands and their \ndependencies, but also in violation of General \nAssem\u00acbly resolutions, to establish an \nextra-continental military base on the islands, \nwith nuclear submarines and nuclear weapons in \nthe area.\n280.\tThis provocative attitude has clearly \nintroduced a focus of continuing tension into the \nSouth Atlantic, which is unacceptable both to the \nRepublic of Argen\u00actina and to Latin America. We \nmust therefore put an end to that state of \naffairs. There has been a de facto end to the \nhostilities in the area, as everyone knows, and \nmy Government does not intend to take the \ninitiative in changing that situation. But \nfollowing the cease-fire the United Kingdom \ncarried out an armed attack on the Argentine \nscientific station \\\"Corbeta Uruguay\\\", established \nsix years earlier in the South Sandwich Islands, \nimprisoning the staff, who were carrying out work \nof a strictly peaceful nature. That unjustifiable \nact of aggression was recently condemned by the \nSecond World Conference On Cultural Policies, \nconvened in Mexico by UNESCO.\n281.\tFurthermore, my country has many times \nbrought to the attention of the Organization acts \nof harassment by British vessels and aircraft \nagainst Argentine fishermen, even outside the \nexclusion zone which the United Kingdom continues \nto impose around the islands for Argentine civil \nand military vessels and aircraft. Although \ntechnically limited to an area of 150 nautical \nmiles, this illegal and arbitrary measure has in \nfact been extended by the British Government to \nwaters outside the area, where Argentine fishing \nvessels are constancy subject to intimidation. \nThis is a serious matter that should be of great \nconcern to us, since we all recall how during the \nrecent conflict a British nuclear submarine did \nnot hesitate to torpedo and sink the Argentine \nRepublic navy cruiser Genera/\nwhich was sailing outside the exclusion zone \nestablished and defined by the United Kingdom \nGovernment itself\u2014a completely illegitimate and \nbrutal action which was no source of pride for \nBritish public opinion or any of its allies.\n282.\tThe facts that I have just described, as \nwell as the stand taken so far by the British \nGovernment, opposed to any genuine negotiation, \nshow clearly the need for the international \ncommunity, through a decision by the General \nAssembly, to support the Latin American \ninitiative to resolve the present situation and \nthe dispute over sovereignty between Argentina \nand the United Kingdom by substantive \nnegotiations carried out in good faith.\n283.\tLatin America is today writing a page in \nits history marked by its spiritual umty and its \nheroic role, reaffirmed recently by the Panama \nCanal issue, and today by the Malvinas question.\n284.\tThis unity will be demonstrated in the \nforth\u00accoming meetings of Latin American heads of \nState proposed by Uruguay, Panama and Colombia, \nin all of which my country will take part. It \nwill also be demonstrated next year at a meeting, \nconvened by Venezuela in Caracas, of heads of \nState and other representatives of their peoples \nto commemorate the bicentenary of the Liberator, \nSimon Bolivar, who conceived of our continent as \na federation of nations striving, through the \nstrength of their common ideals and \ndetermination, to bring about a world of justice \nand freedom. With this dream, to which our \nLiberator, Jose de San Martin, made his \noutstanding contribution, were associated all the \nnational heroes of Latin America, with a slogan \nthat we have not forgotten, and are determined \nnot to forget, calling for respect by the \ninternational community for our demands, today \nand for ever.\n285.\tLatin America, united today by the \nMalvinas, and tomorrow by whatever other equally \njust cause may affect any of the countries \ncomprising it, calls for a response that will \nmeet its legitimate demands.\n286.\tLatin America shall not be a \nbreeding-ground for colonial adventures. The \ncountries of the hemi\u00acsphere fought hard to win \ntheir independence and therefore have a long tradition \nof rejection of colo\u00acnialism. Those ideals of the \nfounding heroes of the Latin American homeland \ninspire the actions of the Governments of the \nregion, with whose decisive assistance and \nsupport the Hrst decolonization ini\u00actiatives \nprospered in the United Nations. It is in that \nspirit that Latin America has demonstrated its \nwhole\u00achearted support for the fraternal \ninitiative taken by Mexico, which calls for \nconsideration of the question of the Malvinas \nIslands during the current session of the General \nAssembly.\n287.\tI emphasize with pride and appreciation \nthat the question of the Malvinas Islands is no \nlonger in the Organization the private cause of \nmy country but has become the cause of Latin \nAmerica, as happened also in the case of Panama. \nIn their letter to the Secretary-General, the \nLatin American nations made the following points, \namong others:\n\\\"The persistence of this colonial situation in \nAmerica and the dispute between the Argentine \nRepublic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain \nand Northern Ireland concerning sovereignty over \nthe Islands, on which the General Assembly has \nexpressed itself in resolutions 2065 (XX), 3160 \n(XXVIII) and 31/49, have led to serious armed \ncon\u00acflict in the South Atlantic and constitute a \nsituation that affects the Latin American region \nin particular.\n\\\"The countries of America, which are peace- \nloving and anxious for a peaceful settlement of \nthe conflict, consider that the negotiations \nbetween the Argentine Republic and the United \nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland \nshould be conducted under the auspices of the \nUnited Nations/' [Sep\n288.\tThat initiative earned the gratitude of \nall the Argentine people, for which the cause of \nthe Malvinas is a national goal which takes \nprecedence over partisan differences and binds \ntogether citizens of all sectors.\n289.\tWe extend the same gratitude to the \nnon-aligned movement, which in its successive \nstatements has categorically endorsed Argentina's \nclaims.\n290.\tI wish to express similar appreciation to \nall countries which have extended to us their \nsupport and have recognized the legitimacy of our \nclaims.\n291.\tThe events in the South Atlantic have \ntaught us some hard but useful lessons, which \nwill have an impact on our future as a region and \nhence on our international relations. We have \nfelt the warmth of solidarity and the bitterness \nof frustration, depending on the reaction to the \nlegitimate claim of our peoples.\n292.\tWe shall never forget those who acted as \nour friends. As to those who did not so act, we \nshall re-examine in the future their earlier \npositions, bearing in mind the circumstances of \nthat time, which for many were unclear or \ndistorted. But the positions they are taking now, \nwill have to stand up to the closest scrutiny by \nthe Argentine people and by all those who agree \nwith the very clear principles which the \ninter\u00acnational community has committed itself to \ndefend. Their conduct will be judged not by \nGovernments, which are temporary things, but by \npeoples, which are permanent. History, which is \nincorruptible, will be a court of last resort. \nThe Argentineans and all Latin Americans are \nconvinced that it will be our ally, not to be \nsuborned.\n293.\tWe firmly believe that negotiations in \ngood faith between the parties provide the only \npossible path to peace. Hence we are prepared to \nheed the call of the General Assembly to begin \nnegotiations to find a peaceful solution to the \ndispute over sover\u00aceignty which will take into \naccount the relevant resolutions of the General \nAssembly and the Security Council, with the \nassistance of the Secretary-General, in whom my \ncountry has sincere confidence.\n294.\tArgentina has never expanded its \nterritory through the use of force. On the \ncontrary, it has traditional resorted to peaceful \nmethods and negotiations to resolve its \nterritorial disputes. In this spirit our country \nis committed to the peaceful settlement of its \nterritorial dispute with the Republic of Chile in \nthe southern part of the country, with the \ninvaluable participation of His Holiness Pope \nJohn Paul II as mediator. The people and Government \nof Argentina wish to express here their deepest \ngratitude to His Holiness for his tireless \nmediating activities and his guidance of the \nnegotiations with the Republic of Chile. Great \nimportance has been attached by the Holy See to \nthese activities, which resulted in the agreement \nsigned on 15 September last at Vatican City. That \nagreement is an unequivocal confirmation of the \ncomplete confidence which the two countries have \nplaced in the Supreme Pontiff and in his judgment \nas to the best way to settle the dispute. For our \npart, we reaffirm our belief that through \nmediation we will reach a final agreement \nacceptable to both parties which will put an end \nto the dispute once and for all, thus \nconsolidating the traditional links between the \ntwo peoples.\n295.\tThe world situation is so serious, and \nthe situa\u00action as regards the Organization's \nability to fulfill its purpose of maintaining \npeace and acting as a useful forum for \nnegotiation among its Member States has become so \ndifficult, that the Secretary-General felt \ncompelled in writing his exemplary report to \nabandon the usual practice of reviewing the broad \nrange of issues involved in the work of the \nUnited Nations and to concentrate on the central, \nvital problem of the chances of achieving the \naims which 37 years ago prompt J the creation of \nthe United Nations, after the six years of agony \nand destruction of the Second World War.\n296.\tIn the year since the last regular \nsession of the General Assembly the deteriorating \ntrend of inter\u00acnational relations has been \nconfirmed. The tensions stemming from the \ntraditional confrontation between the \nsuper-Powers have been aggravated by fighting \nresulting from long-standing conflicts which \nremain unresolved as a result of the lack of \npolitical will or an intransigent refusal to \nconfront the problems intelligently and in a \nforward-looking way.\n297.\tThus the lack of trust between \nantagonistic blocs or States at the international \nlevel provides the political opportunity for \nserious regional crises, and the military pacts \namong the great Powers encourage their allies, \nwhether or not they are in the right, in \nexaggerated confrontations or punitive operations \nreminiscent of the nineteenth century, although \nthey use the ultra-sophisticated arsenals of the \nlate twentieth century.\n298.\tFurthermore, the developed nations, are \nen\u00actrenching themselves m positions of privilege \nand when they agree to a dialogue with other \nStates which are not members of their club they \ndo so only on their own terms. Fear of change \nmakes them more inflexible and the climate of \ninternational tension, instead of making them \noutward-looking as regards the rest of the world, \nmakes them turn inward, which is a futile flight \nfrom the collective responsibilities they should \nshoulder. Those nations close their ranks to \ndefend the advantages they gained in the past, \nalthough the injustice of these is obvious. This \nis all clear evidence of a process of \ninternational political involution which augurs \nill for the future.\n299.\tWe cannot but affirm emphatically here \nthat if there remains any chance of justice and \nright prevail\u00acing, it can only be within the \nframework of the Organi\u00aczation, which has the \nnecessary ways and means to assist nations in \nconflict, provided those nations are really ready \nfor dialogue and negotiations to settle their \ndisputes. Hence, the international community must \nturn towards the United Nations in search of a \nreply and for attitudes which encourage the \npreser\u00acvation of world peace.\n300.\tWe all know that one traditional way is \nthrough disarmament but, unfortunately, the \npresent session is taking place in the shadow of \nthe failure of a few months ago of the second \nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted \nto disarmament. The international community had \ngreat hopes in that session, which it expected \nwould consolidate and develop the achieve\u00acments \nmade in the four years since the first such \nspecial session.\n301.\tBut the time is coming when all the \ncountries, and in the first place the great \nPowers, will be unable to ignore the fundamental dilemma \nany longer: they must either make sincere and \nserious efforts to bring under control the \nmassive increase in weapons, in particular \nnuclear weapons, or we shall be embarking upon an \nuncontrollable escalation of which we shall be \nthe prisoners and probably the victims.\n302.\tThe recent events in Lebanon constitute a \nfurther tragic manifestation of the permanent \nthreat stemming from the perpetuation of unjust \nand serious situations not resolved by the \ninternational system, which has once again failed \nin Its primary task, established under the \nCharter\u2014^namely, that of maintaining \ninternational peace and security. Too many years \nhave passed during which the people of Lebanon \nhave had to suffer as a result of successive \nviolations of their territorial integrity, \nindependence and sovereignty. This unjust \nsituation has been com\u00acpounded in recent weeks by \nthe barbarous acts perpetrated in the refugee \ncamps of Sabra and Shatila. This provoked the \nunanimous condemnation of the international \ncommunity, in which my Government joined first \nwith a communique issued in Buenos Aires and then \nby our vote at the seventh emergency special \nsession, on Palestine. There can be no doubt of \nthe responsibility of the Israeli Government \nwhich invaded the city of Beirut in violation of \nthe agreement reached and on the pretext of \npreventing chaos.\n303.\tThe Government and people of Argentina \nare convinced that ajust and lasting solution of \nthe question of the Middle East can be achieved, \nas my country has argued repeatedly in recent \nyears, only if there is recognition of and \nrespect for the inalienable right of the \nPalestinian people to self-determination and \nnational independence and to establish their own \nsover-eign Statu; acceptance of the right of \nIsrael and all countries of the region to live in \npeace within inter\u00acnationally recognized borders; \nIsrael's withdrawal from all the Arab territories \noccupied since 1967 and, in addition, recognition \nof a special regime for the Holy City of \nJerusalem, in accordance with the relevant \nresolutions of the Security Council and the \nGeneral Assembly.\n304.\tMany other situations are subjects of \ngrave con\u00accern to us. The persistence of the \nhateful apartheid regime in South Africa and the \nunjustifiable delay in the inexorable process of \nindependence for Nami\u00acbia, the decolonization of \nwhich must not be further postponed, are just two \nof these. South Africa cannot continue to resort \nto new and arbitrary excuses to preserve a \nshameful and unjust status quo the pur\u00acpose which \nis to deny the Namibian people the true exercise \nof their right to self-determination and national \nindependence in accordance with Security Council \nresolution 435 (1978) and with full respect for \nits territorial integrity. The international \ncommunity must use its best efforts to put an end \nto this colonial situation, which is marked by \neconomic exploitation and racial discrimination. \nThe people of Namibia must be assisted in their \njust struggle to put an end to South African \ndomination, which flies in the face of the most \nelementary principles of justice and equity \naccepted by the overwhelming majority of the \nStates Members of the United Nations.\n305.\tAnother grave situation which for reasons \nof regional brotherhood concerns us profoundly is \nthe instability and violence prevailing in \nCentral America, which prompted the promising \ninitiative of an offer of good offices by the \nPresidents of Mexico and Vene\u00aczuela, with a view \nto reducing tension and ensuring peace. Of \ncourse, my Government has already expressed its \nfull support for those efforts.\n306.\tI know that it is not original to refer \nto the crisis in international economic relations \nor to emphasize that the high cost is being borne \nby the developing countries. However, despite the \nattempts made by those countries to ensure the \nestablishment of more just economic and political \nrelations which ensure a proper place and \nequitable participation in the international \nsphere, some developed countries are working to \nprevent these through economic policies that \nundermine multilateral co-operation in general \nand co-operation for development in particular.\n307.\tThere has been a resurgence of \nprotectionism in the major decision-making \ncenters, accentuating further the economic and \nsocial difficulties on the periphery.' Selective \nand discriminatory policies have been \nestablished, based on concepts of so-called \ngraduation, which establish arbitrary and harmful \ndifferences for developing countries. By \nincreasing emphasis on bilateralism in \ninternational economic relations there has been \nan erosion of the multilateral framework of \ninternational co-operation.\n308.\tAs if all this did not constitute a \nsufficiently discouraging picture, we now see a \ntendency for certain developed countries to use \neconomic means for political ends, by trying to \nbring pressure to bear on developing countries to \nsubordinate the exercise of their sovereign \nrights.\n309.\tThe non-aligned movement has emphatically \ncondemned such behavior and the Charter of \nEco\u00acnomic Rights and Duties of States adopted by \nthe general Assembly in 1974, is also emphatic on \nthis point.\n310.\tWithin the Latin American framework, at \nthe regional level, it was understood from the \noutset, as confirmed by decisions 112 and 113 of \nthe eighth meeting of the Permanent Council of \nthe Latin Amer\u00acican Economic System, that Latin \nAmerica must reduce its vulnerability to the \nconcerted pressures of the developed world.\n311.\tNevertheless, in the midst of this \ndisturbing picture there are on the horizon some \npositive facts, such as those originating in the \nGroup of 77 and the recent statements made in the \nEconomic and Social Council by some \nindustrialized countries, which lead us to hope \nthat global negotiations can begin shortly in an \nattempt to revitalize the North-South dialogue.\n312.\tAs regards co-operation among developing \ncountries, the recent meeting in Manila showed \nthe realities and potential of this broad range \nof co-oper\u00acation and solidarity.\n313.\tI cannot conclude my statement without \nsaying that my country accepts the existence of \nthis real and regrettable world political \npanorama because it is a matter of plain fact. \nHowever, we also believe in the absolute need to \novercome this grave situation, because we are \nsure that the instinct of self-preser\u00acvation will \ncompel all the peoples in the world to unite \ntheir efforts to change this picture of real and \npotential conflicts. But we also firmly believe \nthat that primary objective cannot be attained \nthrough vague declarations and pious words, but \nonly through specific action and a healthy \npolitical determination, which, by establishing \ngood faith in international relations and \nencouraging progress and wealth, will make \npossible the emergence of new protagonists on the \nworld scene. There must be new presences capable \nof restor\u00acing a balance threatened today by the \nmagnificent development of some nations at the \nexpense of the stagnation or the slow development \nof others.\n314.\tI should like to conclude my statement by \nreferring once again to the Malvinas question, \nwhich is so vitally important to my country. The \nworld knows Argentina's devotion to peace and \nthat we have lived through more than a century \nwithout any periods of war. If a peaceful people \nfelt it necessary to take up arms to defend its \ncause, in an unequal battle, it was solely as the \nresult of the justice of that cause. Our forces \nconsisted entirely of Argentineans who were \nfulfilling their patriotic duty. In our struggle \nwe did not turn to foreigners boastful of their \nbloodthirsty ferocity closely tied to the \ndegrading exchange of money.\n315.\tOur martyrs, sacrificed in the desolate \nlands and frigid waters of the South Atlantic, \nwill be constant witnesses to Argentina's \nunwavering sovereignty over the Malvinas, a cause \nwhose defense brooks neither concessions nor \nhesitation. The hours of sacrifice of our \ncombatants, as well as the blood and the lives \nlaid down by so many of them, were not in vain. \nThe cry that went up then and that will lead us \nsteadfast to our goal will not fade from the \nconscience of mankind.\n"

We wish him greater successes in the\nfuture.\n4b. India approaches the present session of the\nGeneral Assembly with renewed commitment to the\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations.\nThe efforts of the United Nations to bring these\nprinciples into the realm of reality deserve the\nsupport of each one of us, for mankind has a\ngreat stake in its success. Our endeavor to\ncontribute to its success, therefore, is dictated\nby our own will to survive and to pursue our path\ntowards progress in a congenial international\nclimate, free from domination and exploitation.\n49.\tBuilding up self-reliance internally and\nmaintenance of an independent policy externally\nhave been the twin objectives of the Government\nif India since our independence. Traditions\ninherited from our ancient past still remain with\nus, but the leaders of modem India have succeeded\nin inculcating a spirit of adventure and inquiry\nin our people, making them receptive to evolving\ncontemporary ideas. In this sense our tradition\nitself has not remained static; it has enabled\nchange to come about, with stability and\ncontinuity being retained all the time. Side by\nside with the development of a rural economy,\nwhich provides sustenance for the majority of the\npeople of India, we have built a modem industrial\ninfrastructure which enables us to keep pace with\nthe spectacular scientific and technological\nadvances taking place in the world. Our mixed\neconomy, in which the public sector occupies the\ncommanding heights but the private sector\nprovides the majority of the means of\nproduction, has proved its resilience and\nstrength. Foreign collaboration and technical\nco-operation have provided an impetus to our\ndevelopment, but both have operated within the\nframework of our own national priorities,\ndetermined by an integrated planning process. The\nstability that we have acquired through our\ndemocratic institutions, which give our people a\nsense of deep involvement, has proved propitious\nfor our progress.\n50.\tIn his thought-provoking report on the\nwork of the Organization, the Secretary-General\nhas painted a grim picture of the world that we\nlive in today. Things have come to such a sorry\npass that unless they are checked, we will, he\nfeels, approach \\\"a new international anarchy\\\".\nThese are somber words, coming as they do from\nthe Secretary-General. In his very first address\nto the General Assembly, Prime Minister\nJawaharlal Nehru had warned us that it was\nbecoming increasingly apparent that if we did not\nproceed speedily enough towards a world order, we\nwould be left with no order in the world. If\nafter 37 years of its existence, the Organization\nis unable to offer anything more than mere\npalliatives, the time has indeed come for a\nreassessment, some soul- searching and, above\nall, concrete remedial action. The\nSecretary-General's hands need to be strengthened\nso that he can advise, and if necessary, even\nprod the Security Council into action, to prevent\noutbreaks of fresh conflicts. For it is painfully\nobvious that the Security Council, the discharge\nof whose responsibilities is predicated on the\nprinciple of concurrence among its permanent\nmembers, stands paralyzed and immobilized because\nof the inability of the permanent members to rise\nabove their narrow national objectives to\nharmonize their positions in the cause of peace.\n51.\tAlthough all of us, being representatives\nof nation States, believe strongly in the\nwell-known attributes of national sovereignty, it\nshould not be difficult for us to see that the\ncommon good of mankind ought to have a certain\noverriding priority in the scheme of things. In\nany event, national interest cannot be inimical\nto the common good of humanity: the two have to\ngo hand in hand and be combined harmoniously,\ndespite some seemingly disadvantageous positions\nin the short run at the national level.\n52.\tAH of us are committed to the goal of\ngeneral and complete disarmament, particularly\nnuclear disarmament. People in every part of the\nworld have become acutely aware that, through no\nfault of their own, they would perish if\nstrategies nuclear deterrence were tested out,\nsince they would obviously be tested out on them.\nThey also know only too well that after a nuclear\nconflict either they would not be living at all,\nor, if they do live, that life would be so\nhorrible that death would be preferable to it. It\nis this awareness that has forced multitudes of\npeople, irrespective of color, creed, religion,\nnationality or political persuasion, tc go out on\nto the streets to urge sanity in dealing with\nmatters of life and death. Their loud and clear\nvoices signify that there could be no agenda more\nurgent than that for devising immediate measures\nfor nuclear disarmament and the prevention of\nnuclear war.\n53.\tIn response to this overwhelming popular\nsentiment the world over, the Prime Minister of\nIndia, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, presented at the\nspecial session on disarmament this year a\nconcrete program of action which included the\nnegotiation of a binding convention on the\nnon-use of nuclear weapons, a freeze on the\nproduction of nuclear weapons and fissionable\nmaterial used in the manufacture thereof, the\nsuspension of nuclear-weapon tests, and the\nresumption of negotiations for concluding a\ntreaty on general and complete disarmament. India\nsubmitted a number of proposals and draft\nresolutions to facilitate the beginning of a\nserious nuclear disarmament program. Yet the\nopposition of nuclear-weapon States prevented the\nAssembly at the special session from taking any\nconcrete steps in this regard. The so- called\nconsensus document that finally emerged was so\ninsipid as to be meaningless. In the\ncircumstances, India had no choice but to\ndisassociate itself from the conclusions in the\ndocument.\n54.\tThe outcome of the special session was\nperhaps yet another instance of what the\nSecretary-General describes as the lack of\ncapacity of the Organization to come to terms\nwith the present reality. Nevertheless, we shall\nnot despair, despite the attempts of a few but\npowerful nations to hold peace hostage to their\nnuclear arsenals and to their own perceived\nsecurity interests. There have been, however,\nsome positive albeit feeble indications of late.\nWe welcome the evolution in the attitude of some\nnuclear-weapon Powers. It is our earnest hope\nthat at this session India's proposals will be\nconsidered in all seriousness and that decisions\nwill be taken that will rid the world of weapons\nof mass destruction.\n55.\tIt is gratifying to think that in a world\nteetering on the brink of nuclear disaster the\nvast majority of humanity prefers, wisely, to\nkeep out of military alliances devised by great\nPowers. The non-aligned nations know perfectly\nwell that military alliances and interlocking\narrangements do not guarantee peace and\nstability, but on the contrary, serve as a\npotential invitation to intervention and\ninvolvement in strategic conflicts. The\npreservation of peace, therefore, is at the core\nof the philosophy of non-alignment developed by\nour founding fathers. It becomes more and more\nrelevant with every passing day. Its practice has\nenabled India, as our Prime Minister pledged at\nthe time of our independence, to look at the rest\nof the world with clear and friendly eyes: clear\nsince we are not obliged to look through alien\nglasses of any hue, and friendly since we believe\nthat mutually beneficial relations can be forged\non the basis of equality. Non- alignment, which\nin our lexicon is a synonym for freedom of\nthought and action, has invested our\nindependence with meaning and content. It has\nalso sharpened our determination to oppose the\nevils of imperialism, colonialism, racism and\nall manifestations of foreign domination. The\nvalue and relevance of out non-alignment have\nbeen demonstrated not only by the increasing\nnumber of adherents it has found, but also by the\nqualitative change that it has helped to bring\nabout in international relations.\n56.\tDespite manifest diversity in political\nand economic outlook and an understandable\npreoccupation with regional problems, the\nessential unity of purpose of non-aligned\ncountries remains intact on matters of vital and\ncrucial global interest and concern. The unique\nbond among them is the voice of sanity which they\nhave raised with consistency and determination.\nIn turn, this unity has sustained the prestige\nand influence of the non-aligned movement through\nthe constantly shifting patterns in international\nrelationships. India is honored that in these\ndifficult times it has been called upon to host\nthe Seventh Conference of Heads of State or\nGovernment of Non- Aligned Countries. While we\nare naturally grateful for this opportunity, we\nare mindful of the tremendous responsibility it\nentails. With utmost sincerity, I promise that\nIndia will do all in its power to be worthy of\nthe trust which the movement has reposed in it.\n57.\tOur neighborhood, the South Asian\nsubcontinent, is currently going through a\nprocess of regional co-operation on the basis of\nmutual benefit. India is gratified at these very\ndesirable developments, which are in consonance\nwith its own efforts over the years to build\nbridges of understanding among the countries of\nthe region. True, external interference and\nintervention continue to sow suspicions and\ninflame passions. An unprecedented build-up of\nsophisticated arms, unrelated either to\nreasonable needs or to perceived threats, still\npoints to the continuance of strategic consensus\nsituations so detrimental to regional\nindependence and harmony. Yet one can perhaps\nhope more than hitherto that the subcontinent\nwill be able to usher in an era of peace which is\nmore comprehensive than the mere absence of war,\nand encompasses relationships of positive\nfriendship and co-operation.\n58.\tThe slender thread which the\nSecretary-General has found in the search for a\npolitical settlement of the situation in\nAfghanistan is another development that has been\nwelcomed in our part of the world. There is\nuniversal reaffirmation of the inadmissibility of\ninterference in the internal affairs of States,\nas also of the introduction of foreign troops\ninto any country. Here again, given the prospect\nof success of the Secretary-General's effort,\nIndia feels gratified that its own approach to\nfinding a political solution has been vindicated.\n59.\tWe commend the commencement of the Geneva\ntalks and trust that they will pick up momentum\nhereafter, to enter substantive areas. We feel it\nis high time they did, and our feeling is in line\nwith what the Afghan people urges.\n60.\tGeographically distant from us but\nequally close to our hearts are the friendly\npeople of Kampuchea, who are struggling valiantly\nto remove the ravages caused by a heartless\ndictatorial regime. The advent of an alliance of\nconvenience, whose real content is too thinly\nveiled to need any unveiling, should not distract\nour attention. Once the fear of the return of the\nholocaust is removed and the threat to their\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty is ended,\nthe people of Kampuchea will be willing\u2014nay,\neager\u2014to get foreign troops to leave their sail.\nThe expedients improvised for seating the forces\nwithout legitimacy in these chambers can hardly\nhelp either the process of healing the wounds of\nKampuchea or of finding an acceptable political\nsolution. What is needed is the ending of\nconfrontation in South-East Asia, which alone\ncould have a welcome impact on the stability and\nprosperity of the entire region.\n61.\tThe security environment in the Indian Ocean\nregion has further deteriorated because of the\nincreased build-up of the military presence of\ngreat Powers, contrary to the wishes of the\nnon-aligned littoral and hinterland States. The\nimplementation of the historic general Assembly\nresolution 2832 (XXVI) declaring the Indian Ocean\na zone of peace, adopted in 1971, has remained a\ndistant dream. Theories of balance and doctrines\nof deterrence are being advanced in order to\njustify the introduction of sophisticated\nweaponry into the area.\n62.\tThe Conference on the Indian Ocean,\noriginally scheduled to be held in 1981 in\nColombo, is still postponed at the behest of\nthose who are far removed from the area.\nSimultaneously, efforts are afoot to subvert the\nfundamental elements of the Declaration set out\nin the 1971 resolution and to distort its\nessential framework. We believe that the time has\ncome for the commencement of the process of the\nelimination of foreign military presence from the\nIndian Ocean, that the Colombo Conference should\nbe held come what may, in accordance with the new\nschedule, and that it should address itself to\nthe question in a forthright manner.\n63.\tThe shifting of fortunes in the war\nbetween Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran and\nthe colossal loss of lives and property has once\nagain highlighted the futility of war as a means\nof settling disputes. I personally have had the\nexperience of participating in the peace-making\neffort on the basis of a mandate given to my\ncolleagues from Cuba, Zambia and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization [FLO] and to me at the\nConference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of\nNon-Aligned Countries at New Delhi in 1981. My\ncolleagues and I are convinced that, while there\ncan be no victor or vanquished, the damage\ninflicted on each other by these two neighbors\nwill only weaken their ability to meet the\nchallenges that face them as developing countries.\n64.\tThe recent conflagration in West Asia\nresulting in the virtual destruction of Beirut\nand the horrid genocide of the Lebanese and\nPalestinian population have shaken the conscience\nof mankind to the very core. It was nothing short\nof a holocaust, imposed, strangely and\nironically, by none other than Israel.\nIronically, again, the withdrawal of the PLO from\nBeirut, to save innocent civilians from further\nsuffering and devastation, itself led to the\ngruesome massacre of Palestinians in Shatila and\nSabra. Israel's responsibility, indeed\ncomplicity, is self-evident. Those who had\nundertaken to protect the Palestinian and\nLebanese civilians in Beirut in the wake of the\nPLO's withdrawal must also share the blame for\nthe criminal bloodshed.\n65.\tThe dispersal of the heroic Palestinians\nwill neither weaken their will to fight for their\ninalienable rights nor bring peace to the area.\nOccupation of the land of its neighbors will not\nguarantee Israel's security; the effect, if\nanything, will be just the opposite. A\ncomprehensive solution consisting of Israel's\nwithdrawal from all Arab territories occupied\nsince 1967, the establishment of a Palestinian\nState and mutual guarantees of security among the\nStates of the region must be achieved. There now\nseems to be greater understanding of the fact\nthat no comprehensive solution will be achieved\nwithout the active involvement of the PLO, the\nrepresentative of the Palestinian people. In the\ngory drama in Lebanon, the PLO has demonstrated\ngreat heroism and courage. The PLO and other Arab\nnations have since shown great statesmanship in\nevolving and adopting the Fez Charter\\\", the Final\nDeclaration of the Twelfth Arab Summit\nConference, whose proposals deserve very serious\nconsideration.\n66.\tIn recent weeks there have been important\nproposals made by world leaders. They vary in\napproach and content, but fundamental to all of\nthem is the recognition that the uprooted people\nof Palestine should secure their legitimate\nrights. In this case, as with other problems, the\nslowing down of the effort to find a solution\noften results in the creation of vested interests\nin the continued non-solution of the problem.\nThis leads to prevarication and circumvention\nand a long stalemate. This has happened in West\nAsia, with the disastrous consequences which we\nare now witnessing. Therefore the quest for a\ncomprehensive solution should be pursued\nrelentlessly. Instead of indulging in a\nfine-print scrutiny of the various plans mooted\nso far and losing valuable time in endless\ndiscussions, immediate steps should be taken at\nthe United Nations to devise a suitable mechanism\nfor finding a permanent solution to the problem\nof West Asia. This is the very minimum that needs\nto be done in expiation of the rivers of innocent\nblood that have been allowed to flow in Lebanon.\n67.\tRacism and colonialism still rage in\nsouthern Africa today, with little progress\neither in the elimination of\tor in the\nliberation of Namibia. The people of South Africa\nremains in bondage, despite the universal\ncondemnation of the obnoxious discriminatory laws\nof the Pretoria regime. We have been awaiting the\noutcome of the contacts being conducted by the\nfive Western States for the implementation of\nthe United Nations plan for free elections in\nNamibia. The South West Africa People's\nOrganization [SWAPO], the sole and authentic\nrepresentative of the Namibian people, which\nnegotiated in good faith for a cease-fire and\nfree elections, has reason to apprehend that\nSouth Africa and its supporters have been\ncreating an illusion of progress in these talks\nmerely to link up the situation in Namibia with\nextraneous issues. The international community\nwill, as it must, intensify its demand for\npunitive action against South Africa under the\nCharter, if the current efforts for a negotiated\nsettlement fail to achieve results. South\nAfrica's supporters will find it difficult to\nshield it from the wrath of the world for very\nlong.\n68.\tSeveral old items on the agenda continue\nto engage our attention. Thus the situation in\nCyprus, unfortunately, still remains frozen. In\nspite of repeated calls of the movement of\nnon-aligned countries and the support of the\ninternational community in general the relevant\nresolutions of the United Nations have not yet\nbeen implemented. We trust that the inter-\ncommunal talks will soon bear fruit and the\nquestion resolved free from external interference\nand in accordance with decisions of the United\nNations.\n69.\tMore recently, despite the efforts of our\nsagacious Secretary-General, conflict and\nbloodshed in the South Atlantic could not be\naverted.\n70.\tIn Central America there are dangerous\nportents of intervention and destabilization. The\nUnited Nations cannot remain a mute spectator and\nmust lend support to all efforts for dialogue and\nnegotiation to create mutual confidence and to\nresolve outstanding disputes.\n71.\tIt is with great satisfaction that we\nnote the long and at times difficult negotiations\nsuccessfully concluded with the adoption of a\nuniversal and comprehensive Convention on the\nLaw of the Sea. The Convention is a symbol of\nshared expectations of the international\ncommunity and represents a major contribution to\nworld peace and the new international economic\norder. Later this year, in December, in Jamaica\nthe Final Act will be open for signature. It is\nour earnest hope that the Convention on the Law\nof the Sea will be endorsed by all States with\nprompt signatures and ratifications.\n72.\tInternational co-operation for\ndevelopment is the topic of our age. We strongly\nbelieve that our approach to development and\nco-operation will have to be informed by certain\nobjective and fundamental considerations. First,\nthe arms race is not compatible with the movement\ntowards a more stable global development and\nsustainable international order. Secondly, the\ninternational community cannot aspire to durable\npeace so long as a major component of it remains\nunderdeveloped. Thirdly, orderly development and\ncontinued progress can take place optimally only\nin an atmosphere of harmony and co-operation.\nFourthly, co-operation demands that the\nprivileges which the developed countries have\nbeen enjoying so far should not be turned into\nrights and that the concerns of the developing countries\nbe taken into account.\n73.\tSome months ago, in a special session,\nthe General Assembly brought out clearly the\nclose connection between disarmament and\ndevelopment, but failed to draw the requisite\nconclusions from it.\n74.\tA year ago the two co-Chairmen of the\nInternational Meeting on Co-operation and\nDevelopment, which was held at Cancun, referred\nto the North-South relationship as one of the\nmost serious challenges to be faced in the coming\ndecades by mankind, together with the maintenance\nof peace. The theme of Cancun was \\\"Co-operation\nand Development\\\". Regrettably, there was no\nagreement as to how the real challenge of the\nNorth-South relationship was to be met, though,\nas our Prime Minister observed after the Cancun\nmeeting the door was kept open for dialogue.\n75.\tOne can only hope that world statesmen\nwill take an enlightened and long-term view of\nhistory. We also need to promote world-wide\npolitical understanding, with the involvement of\nthe public, of the connection between the\nNorth-South relationship and the maintenance of\npeace. This would contribute significantly to\ngenerating the requisite political will that is\nsorely needed to overcome the present paralysis\nin the North-South dialogue.\n76.\tViewed against this background, it is\nmost disheartening that the adverse effects of\nthe continued deadlock on the negotiating front\nhave been compounded by an actual deterioration\nin the North- South relationship. As the report\nof the Committee on Development Planning on its\neighteenth session^ has illustrated, there is\nboth qualitative and quantitative deterioration\nin multilateral economic co-operation. Examples\nof this are increasing protectionism, high\ninterest rates, fast-diminishing concessional\nassistance, the secular decline in prices of many\ncommodities, difficulties in access to the\ninternational capital market and the injection of\nnon-economic factors and political considerations\nin the functioning of multilateral economic\ninstitutions. For the first time since the Second\nWorld War, the developing countries, taken as a\ngroup, have registered a fall in their per capita\noutput.\n77.\tTwo years ago the Assembly adopted the\nInternational Development Strategy for the Third\nUnited Nations Development Decade. However, it\nremains a paper document. There is all round\nfailure on the part of the developed countries to\nfulfill their commitments. There is no agreement,\neven on the procedures for the global\nnegotiations that were expected to contribute to\nthe implementation of the Strategy.\n78.\tRecent developments show that while the\ndeveloping countries do have a conciliatory\napproach, there is not enough encouraging\nresponse from the developed countries. Several\nof them are not negative, yet there are some that\nare not even prepared to think in terms of a\nconsensus that can bind the North and the South.\nThey are still to be convinced that\ncomprehensive and global negotiations will in\nthe long run facilitate the emergence of a viable\nco-operative relationship among the nations of\nthe world. As for the developing countries, they\nare not interested in a zero- sum game, but in a\npositive-sum approach. They are conscious of the\nfact that the progress in regard to the\nachievement of the new international economic\norder is inextricably linked with the world\neconomic recovery program. Thus, today world\neconomic problems can be solved only by joint\nactions. There is no alternative for the\ninternational community but to move beyond the\npresent stalemate to more fruitful, durable and\njust international economic relationships.\n79.\tLet me now turn to the current problems\narising from the pursuit of anti-inflationary\npolicies, protectionist trends, high interest\nrates and the drying up cf the sources of\nconcessional flows. The anti- inflationary\npolicies that have been adopted by some developed\ncountries are not conducive to growth and\nemployment. Consequently, there has been a\ndecline in the price per unit of exports by\ndeveloping countries of their raw materials and\nprimary products. The exports of industrial products\nof developing countries have been adversely\naffected by growing protectionism. The high\ninterest rates are causing serious problems in\nregard to debt burden and access to international\ncapital markets. The International Development\nAssociation [IDA] is in deep trouble. All this\nmakes the task of developing countries extremely\ndifficult. The situation is particularly grave\nfor oil-importing developing countries in regard\nto their balance-of-payments position and the\ndevelopment of their energy resources, which\nrequire large capital outlay.\n80.\tWe should thus lose no time in devising\nfeasible strategies that are complementary to\nthose predicated on global negotiations for\nrestructuring international economic relations.\nUrgent steps need to be taken for a world\neconomic recovery program and for building upon\nthe limited gains that have been secured through\nNorth-South co-operation. Agreement should be\nsought wherever possible. Detailed guidelines for\nfurther work should be drawn up so as to\nfacilitate thorough discussions and eventual\nagreement on all connected matters at the sixth\nsession of UNCTAD, where this matter will be high\non the agenda.\n81.\tNumerous international conferences have\nstressed the need for making efforts concurrent\nwith global negotiations in order to achieve\nprogress in areas of critical importance to\ndeveloping countries such as food, energy, trade\nand financial flows. The Versailles Economic\nSummit had outlined certain practical areas for\naction. We would urge developed countries not to\nuse lack of progress on global negotiations as an\nalibi for inaction. We expect that they would\ntranslate their suggestions into concrete and\nco-operative programmes of action that would\ncontribute to the development of the developing\ncountries.\n82.\tA broad consensus now exists, and indeed,\nthis was one concrete gain in Cancun\u2014on evolving\na strategy to increase food production. We hope\nthat a well-thought-out international program\nwould emerge in this regard. Efforts must\ncontinue to devise a global strategy for food\nsecurity and for constant updating of measures\nand actions. It is important to reach agreement\non an international wheat trade agreement for\nstability of supplies and prices.\n83.\tIn the field of energy the most important\ntask is to help oil-importing developing\ncountries to exploit their own energy resources.\nAt the same time, much greater research\nactivities and financial resources are needed for\ndeveloping alternative sources of energy. Ongoing\nstudies should be completed early in regard to\nthe securing of financing for an increased\nprogram of energy investment through an energy\naffiliate of the World Bank or a special fund, or\nother agreed arrangements.\n84.\tA further expansion and liberalization of\nthe International Monetary Fund [IMF]\ncompensatory facility is called for. Indeed, we\nneed to give greater consideration to the\nestablishment of a completely new\ncommodity-related scheme. Predictability in the\nearnings, supply and demand of commodities is an\nobjective which we should seriously pursue. This\ncalls for adequate and effective price\nstabilization arrangements.\n85.\tThe deterioration in the world trading\nsituation is especially affecting countries with\nrelatively low per capita income. The\ninternational trading regime which has emerged\nneither adheres to the principles and rules\nenvisaged by GATT, nor is it responsive to new\ncircumstances. What is necessary is the most\ncareful consideration of the requirements of an\ninternational trading order that will be\nefficient, equitable and effectively promote the\ndevelopment of developing countries. For this\nthere should be a return to a set of agreed\nprinciples in international trading\nrelationships, particularly through practical\nsupport for the principles of multilateralism,\nnon-discrimination, non- reciprocity vis-a-vis\ndeveloping countries, transparency and\npredictability consistent with special and\ndifferential treatment to developing countries.\nProgressive liberalization of the trade in\ntextiles, clothing, the leather industry and\nother consumer durables is a matter of great\nimportance to the industrial development of\ndeveloping countries. The developing countries\npossess comparative advantages in these areas. We\nexpect that the GATT ministerial meeting and the\nsixth session of UNCTAD would agree on concrete\nmeasures in this regard.\n86.\tThe situation created by the second\nmassive oil price rise is qualitatively different\nand more acute than that faced by the world\ncommunity at the time of the first energy crisis\nless than 10 years ago. The growth momentum of\nthe developing countries was then maintained\nthrough flows of international finance on\nsuitable terms to the countries most adversely\naffected by the crisis and through new modalities\nof concessional developmental assistance. No\nsimilar effort is visible today or even being\nconsidered. Instead, private capital and\ninvestments are suggested as a solution to the\nproblems of developing countries. While private\ncapital can be useful in certain areas,\nexperience clearly shows that it cannot provide\nresources for long-term development aiming at\nsocial improvement and stability with low or no\nmarket profit. It cannot alleviate the\nbalance-of-payments burdens of developing\ncountries. Above all, multilateral aid should\nnot be made conditional on corresponding in flow\nof private investment. Similarly, the increasing\nrecourse to exclusive bilateralism continues and\nmust be resisted to the extent such bilateralism\ntends to obstruct multilateral co-operation and\nis pursued at the expense of the latter.\n87.\tThus, the international monetary and\nfinancial system is increasingly pushing\ndeveloping countries towards adjustment policies\nthat seriously undermine their stability. This is\nhappening at a time when the oil-importing\ndeveloping countries are making efforts against\nsuch heavy odds as increasing exports during a\ntime of declining world demand, raising higher\nand higher resources domestically in order to\nfinance the same volume of imports; and bringing\nabout reduction in already low levels of\nconsumption in order to increase investments and\nsavings. There is a limit to which our countries\ncan be pushed.\n88.\tCo-operation among developing countries\nis now viewed both as an essential component of\nthe new international economic order and as an\nimportant instrument for bringing it about. Three\nyears ago, the Sixth Conference of Heads of State\nor Government of Non-Aligned Countries at Havana\nhad agreed on policy guidelines for reinforcing\nthe collective self- reliance of developing\ncountries. We note with satisfaction that a\nprocess has now been set in motion which is\ncontinuously enriching the concept, practice and\ncontent of economic and technical co-operation\namong developing countries.\n89.\tConcomitant support measures by\ninternational organizations would be of great\nhelp in technical preparations for major\nSouth-South undertakings such as, for instance,\nthe establishment of the global system of trade\npreferences among developing countries and the \nsetting up of a South-South bank. We believe that\neconomic co-operation among developing countries\ncan make a significant contribution to world\neconomic recovery. We trust that the Assembly\nwill give due and favorable consideration to\nthese matters.\n90.\tThis is not the moment to think in terms\nof mutually exclusive alternatives. The present\nsorry state of affairs can be repaired only by\naction on all fronts. We need bilateral as well\nas multilateral co-operation, official\ndevelopment assistance as well as private flows\nof capital, North-South co-operation as well as\nSouth-South co-operation, global negotiations for\nrestructuring international economic relations as\nwell as concurrent efforts for securing progress\nin sectoral areas. Let us, therefore, not engage\nin futile debates, but work honestly to secure\nconcrete results. I trust that our deliberations\nin the Assembly will lead us to this path.\n91.\tThe German philosopher Hegel believed\nthat a notable contribution of man to\ncivilization was the creation of the\nnation-State, which provides the individual with\nthe opportunity of finding the full satisfaction\nof his needs in co-operation with pie community.\nThis Organization, composed of 157 nation States,\nrepresents the quintessence of the civilization\nthat mankind has labored hard over the centuries\nto build. The Prime Minister of India, Shrimati\nIndira Gandhi, recently observed:\n\\\"One of the most fascinating riddles of history\nis what makes a group of people share a sense of\ncommon destiny. Almost always this is the result\nof being together in hardship and humiliation;\noften it comes from being summoned to a heroic\neffort by a great figure or group of people who\ninspire them with a vision of truth or glory''.\nThe community of nations, as practically every\ndistinguished speaker has stressed in the\nAssembly, is confronted with an economic,\npolitical and moral crisis. Such adversity\nshould, instead of dividing us, reinforce our\nresolve to seek and secure our common destiny.\nWith such a distinguished gathering of leaders\nfrom all over the world who have addressed and\nare going to address the Assembly, we cannot\nafford to fail in finding that vision of truth\nand glory. I should like to conclude with the\nconviction that if we pledge to act together, we\nwill overcome the crisis that faces us today.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like first of all to congratulate the \nPresident on his election to his office for this \nsession of the General Assembly. I am convinced \nthat, with his wide experience of the United \nNations, he will successfully carry out the \nimportant tasks ahead of him. I should also like \nto pay a tribute to the outgoing President of the \nGeneral Assembly, Mr. Kittani, who presided over \nthe previous session with great distinction and \nskill. It gives me great pleasure to join the \nmany preceding speakers who have congratulated \nthe Secretary-General,\nMr. Perez de Cuellar, on his election to his high \noffice. In the exercise of his functions he has \nalready earned a reputation for great dedication \nand integrity. I can assure him and his staff of \nthe Swedish Government's full support for their \nendeavours in pursuit of international peace and \nco-operation.\nThe international situation has increasingly \ndeteriorated since the late 1970s. We are living \nin an era of distrust. The policy of detente has \nbeen superseded by a policy of confrontation \nbetween the super-Powers. A dialogue between the \nUnited States and the Soviet Union has, it is \ntrue, been initiated, but there is reason to be \nsceptical about the possibility of its yielding \nany quick results. We must, by our concerted \nefforts, reverse these trends.\nMy country has chosen to pursue a policy of \nneutrality, one of non-participation in alliances \nin peace time and neutrality in the event of war. \nThis policy, supported by a strong defence \nrelative to our situation, contributes to the \ncalm and stability in our part of the world. We \nshall pursue this policy with firmness and \nconsistency.\nSwedish territory will be protected from \nviolations with all available means. Such \nviolations will be treated with equal \ndetermination, no matter whence they emanate. \nInternational law gives us the right and the duty \nto safeguard our sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity. Let no one entertain fears or \nexpectations that Sweden would, even under strong \nexternal pressure, abandon its policy of \nneutrality.\nOur policy of neutrality does not, however, \ncondemn us to silence or passivity. On the \ncontrary, it challenges us to pursue an active \nforeign policy in the cause of peace, freedom and \ninternational co-operation.\nSweden will, in accordance with its traditions, \nseek to promote peaceful solutions and to play an \nintermediary role in international conflicts. In \ncommon with so many others, we have three \nfundamental values to safeguard, namely, \nsovereignty, security and solidarity.\nAll our considerations must start from the right \nof peoples to determine their own future. \nNational sovereignty is the foundation of \npolitical legitimacy in international contexts. \nThis is self-evident, but not uncontested. \nPeoples have had to struggle for their \nindependence, and that struggle is still going \non. More than 100 States have gained their \nindependence in recent decades. But they know, as \ndo all other small and medium-sized States, that \nin a world dominated by great Powers and powerful \ntransnational economic interests, this is a \nstruggle that must go on for a long time to come. \nThe real content of sovereignty is largely \nconditioned by the ability to pursue an \nindependent, effective economic policy.\nAgainst that background it is not surprising that \nthe movement of non-aligned countries has \nattracted such a large membership and has shown \nsuch great vitality, despite internal crises and \nconflicts of interests. National sovereignty must \nalways be safeguarded. One recent example of the \nviolation of this principle is Israel's invasion \nof Lebanon. By invading Lebanon, Israel has \ndemonstrated indifference to the principles of \nthe Charter and of international law. It is a \ntragedy that the State in whose creation the \nUnited Nations played such a decisive role now \nacts in a way that counteracts the authority of \nthe Organization. The international community has \nrightly condemned Israel's assault and demanded \nthe immediate and unconditional withdrawal of its \ntroops.\nSweden has on repeated occasions condemned acts of terrorism perpetrated against \nIsrael. But in our view these can never justify \nwhat has now taken place in Lebanon.\nThe massacre of Palestinians in Beirut aroused \nfeelings of horror and disgust in my country. The \nimmediate responsibility for these crimes rests \nwith their perpetrators. But this outrage would \nnot have been possible had its perpetrators not \nbeen allowed into the camps.\nThirty-five years have now passed and five wars \nhave been fought in the region since the adoption \nof the United Nations partition plan for \nPalestine. A just and. realistic solution \npresupposes that Israel and the PLO acknowledge \none another as negotiating parties. The PLO must \nrecognize Israel's right to live within secure \nand recognized borders. Israel must, for its \npart, recognize the Palestinians' right to \ndetermine their own future, including the right \nto establish a State of their own, in the spirit \nof the original partition plan.\nThe borders existing before the 1967 war are more \ntime-honoured and internationally recognized than \nany others. Obviously, the two parties must be at \nliberty to agree between themselves on \nadjustments of these borders which both can \naccept.\nThe Israeli Government's claim of supremacy over \nthe occupied areas has no basis in international \nlaw. The settlements policy pursued in these \nareas constitutes a serious obstacle to the \nefforts to solve the problems of the Middle East. \nThe acquisition of territory by force cannot be \ntolerated. Israel must discontinue its occupation \nof the areas it captured in 1967. A solution must \nalso include arrangements as regards Jerusalem \nwhich guarantee the right of free access to the \nHoly Places for all religious worshippers, \nregardless of nationality.\nThe various proposals and plans recently put \nforward from different quarters contain many \nconstructive elements. Together with Security \nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) \nthey should be able to form the basis of a \nlasting peace in the Middle East.\nFor the United Nations to play a role in solving \nthe conflict, it is necessary that Israel remain \na Member of the United Nations and that the FLO \ncontinue to be able to present its views before \nthis forum. My Government disassociates itself \nfrom any attempt to deprive Israel of its \nmembership or to limit it. To be elective the \nUnited Nations must rest on the principle of \nuniversality.\nThe Soviet Union has occupied Afghanistan for \nnearly three years now. The Assembly has \ncondemned this brutal assault. But the Soviet \ntroops are still there, and reports leak out \nabout continued assaults on the civilian \npopulation. This is all the more serious when we \nconsider the fact that the Soviet Union is a \npermanent member of the Security Council with \nspecial responsibility to uphold the principles \nof the Charter relating to peace and security. We \ndemand that the Soviet troops leave Afghanistan, \nand we hope that the talks which have now begun \nunder the auspices of the United Nations will be \nable to create the conditions necessary for a \ndurable settlement of this issue.\nThe right to determine their own future without \ninterference from outside is also the due of the \npeople in Kampuchea. There, too, a peaceful \nsolution must be found in accordance with the \nprinciples of the Charter, and the foreign troops \nmust be withdrawn. In recent months some signs of \nan incipient dialogue between the countries in \nthe region have been evident. We welcome this as \na step in the right direction.\nNamibia is still being denied by armed force its \nself-evident right to national independence. \nSouth Africa's illegal occupation of the country \nis in flagrant defiance of United Nations \nresolutions. South Africa continues to delay the \nUnited Nations plan for Namibia. This plan is the \nonly course for achieving a peaceful and \ndemocratic solution. There is a risk that this \ncourse will be abandoned if elements alien to the \nUnited Nations plan are introduced into the \nnegotiations on Namibia. The countries in the \ncontact group bear a special responsibility for \nensuring that the liberation of Namibia is not \nfurther delayed.\nSouth Africa is constantly guilty of subversion \nand armed aggression against the States \nneighbouring it. It is not enough to condemn \nthese lawless pursuits. The South African \nGovernment should be subjected to increased and \neffective pressure from the United Nations as a \npeaceful means for achieving the abolition of the \n\tsystem. The Security Council should, as \nquickly as possible, impose comprehensive \nmandatory sanctions against South Africa. We are \nsurprised to hear from States which have resorted \nto sanctions in several other contexts outside \nthe United Nations framework that sanctions \nagainst South Africa would not be effective.\nThe international community must give the \nafflicted States and liberation movements in \nsouthern Africa all the political, economic and \nhumanitarian assistance it can mobilize.\nThe ever-growing use of force in various parts of \nthe world is a cause of concern. The Charter \ncontains a clear and unequivocal prohibition of \nthe use of force in international relations. This \nis one of the foundations of international law.\nIn our time, the issues of national security have \nassumed a new dimension. Beyond the question of \nwho is right or wrong in a conflict, there looms \nthe greater question of the survival of mankind. \nIn the world of the super-Powers, one side cannot \nachieve security at the expense of the other. We \nmust, together, try to find common security for \neveryone's survival.\nNuclear weapons have changed the rules of the \ngame. If that ultimate weapon is used, the result \nwill be collective suicide. We must create the \npolitical conditions which will ensure that \nweapons of mass destruction will never be used.\nIn Europe, considerable headway had been made in \nthe process of detente at the beginning of the \n1970s. The two military pacts were on the way to \nfinding a new way based on an approximate balance \nof military power and on mutual respect. \nRelations between the two German States improved. \nWilly Brandt's\twas a pioneer achievement. \nContacts developed across the borders between \nindividuals and peoples. The increase in economic \nexchange was of mutual benefit. Detente between \nthe super-Powers provided greater scope for small \nand medium- sized States in the region to have \ntheir legitimate interests respected. The \nConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe \nheld at Helsinki laid the foundation for \ncontinued peaceful relations between the States \nof Europe.\nThe process of detente must be resumed and \ncarried forward. National security is promoted by \nextensive exchanges across borders in the \ninterests of all parties. The common interest in \npeaceful development will then grow.\nAt their meeting in Stockholm in August, the \nForeign Ministers of the neutral and non-aligned \nStates in Europe declared their intention to play \nan active and constructive role in the meeting of \nthe Conference on Security and Co-operation in \nEurope to be resumed at Madrid. Provided the two \nsuper-Powers show a minimum degree of willingness \nto compromise, at that meeting the Conference \nshould be able to achieve a comprehensive and \nbalanced final document on the basis of the \nHelsinki Final Act and also to decide on the \nconvening of a conference for disarmament in \nEurope.\nIn our part of Europe, close and trustful \ncooperation has existed for many years. There are \nno nuclear weapons in the Nordic countries. It is \nessential that this situation remain unchanged. \nSweden is striving to achieve agreements which, \namong other things, will make the Nordic region a \nnuclear-weapon- free zone. Agreements of that \nkind can ease the tension between the blocs and \nreduce the risk of those countries being \nsubjected to nuclear attack.\nIn Europe, there is the most horrifying \naccumulation of weapons of destruction anywhere \nin the world or at any time in history, as well \nas the largest standing armies. It is a prepared \nbattlefield. Nevertheless, we must not in Africa, \nAsia and Latin America that the wars have been \nfought, ever since the end of the Second World \nWar. Those wars have already claimed, and are \nstill claiming, innumerable victims. Starvation, \ndisease and deprivation follow in their wake.\nAH this is very largely due to a colonialism \nwhich is not so far back in the past. The world \nis still shaken by the convulsions of liberation, \nwhich are the more violent and the more prolonged \nthe longer the powers-that-be try to suppress the \npeoples' struggle for independence.\nIn Central America, centuries of oppression have \ngiven rise to a revolutionary situation. It is \nabsurd to claim that the workers, the farmers, \nthe students and the middle class have revolted \nin Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala because \nsome foreign Power asked them to do so. On the \nother hand, it is obvious that a foreign \nPower\u2014the United States\u2014plays a crucial role when \nit comes to keeping tottering dictatorships on \ntheir feet.\nThe violence in Central America is provoked by \nthose who oppose the demands of the people for a \nbearable life. Peace in the region also \npresupposes respect for the national independence \nof all States. It is still possible to achieve \nnegotiated solutions and put an end to the \nbloodbath. More and more Governments, both in \nEurope and Latin America, are joining the call \nfor a political solution in the region.\nFundamental national security may not and cannot \nbe won at the expense of the freedom and \ndevelopment possibilities of other nations. \nPeaceful development on reasonable terms for \neveryone presupposes solidarity. The demand for \nsolidarity must be equally strong whether it \napplies to individuals in the struggle for human \nrights or to nations in the struggle for \ninternational justice.\nIn our neighbouring country Poland, the central \ntrade union confederation, Solidarity, has bee-a \ndeclared illegal. The military take-over shucked \nus deeply. The process of democratization was \ninterrupted, and fundamental human rights are \nstill being trampled underfoot, in contravention \nof the Helsinki Final Act. And thus, the dream of \ngenuine reform has been temporarily shattered. If \nreal dialogue and reconciliation are to be \nachieved in Poland, martial law must be lifted, \nimprisoned and interned trade union leaders and \nother political prisoners must be released and \ntrade union activities must be allowed to be \ncarried on freely, in accordance with ILO \nConventions which Poland has undertaken to \nresect. The strikes and protests of the last few \ndays confirm the fact that the Polish workers are \nnot prepared to accept an imposed model for their \ntrade union activities.\nOur protests also apply to the military \ndictatorship in Turkey, where political parties \nare banned and trade unions are prevented from \nworking freely. The regime's opponents are \nsubjected to mass arrests and mock trials.\nDemands for democracy, for social justice, for \nhuman dignity and for national independence are \nmade with the conviction in the East as in the \nWest, in the North as in the South. Oppression \nmay assume different guises and forms, but it \ncauses its victims the same human suffering, the \nsame enslavement. Our solidarity must therefore \nnever be one-sided.\nIt is obviously in the interest of all to have \nrules governing political relations. Presumably \nthey also wish to have rules governing economic \nexchanges. But in the long run, rules of this \nkind work only if they can satisfy the legitimate \ninterests of all parties.\nWorld trade and world production have been \nexperiencing the deepest crisis of the post-war \nperiod for several years now. The international \nsystem of payments is creaking at the joints. The \nworld has been confronted by acute and chronic \nproblems in regard to its supplies of energy. The \nNorth-South dialogue has become a series of \nparallel monologues. Small countries have a \nparticular interest in trying to strengthen \ninternational co-operation. In the prevailing \neconomic situation, the GATT Ministerial Meeting \nand the coming world trade conference will be of \ngreat importance.\nFor three years we have been trying in vain to \nagree on a formula for global economic \nnegotiations. There is, however, the capacity in \nthe United Nations system to negotiate the \nanswers to at least the most urgent questions and \nthere is, after all, little difference in \npositions as regards the initiation of the global \nnegotiations. A few years ago the Independent \nCommission on International Development Issues, \nunder the chairmanship of Willy Brandt, presented \na report with the challenging title. The members \nof the Commission were people of varying \npolitical convictions and geographic origin; \nnevertheless they succeeded in arriving at common \nconclusions. Their report becomes increasingly \nvalid.\nA common strategy is needed to solve the growing \nproblems of the international payments system. \nMore and more countries are staggering under a \ndebt burden which stifles expansion potential not \nonly for the countries themselves but also for \ntheir trading partners. Transfer of resources \nmust be increased and as far as possible reformed \nin order to make them more automatic and \npredictable. The need for concessional resources \nis particularly great for the poorest countries. \nA common strategy is necessary also for the \nadjustment of world trade to new realities. One \nsuch reality is the industrial development of the \ndeveloping countries.\nSweden is among those countries which, as a \nresult of their own experience, regard free trade \nas extremely beneficial. The industrialized \ncountries must now demonstrate that they are \nprepared to allow other countries and peoples to \nenjoy the fruits of free trade. An adjustment of \nthis kind must take place, with account being \ntaken of two conflicting but equally legitimate \ninterests: the need of the developing countries \nto create sufficient resources so that they can \nparticipate in trade for their own benefit and \nthe need of the traditionally industrialized \ncountries to realign their production without \ncreating even greater unemployment.\nThe countries producing raw materials must \nreceive reasonable and foreseeable incomes from \ntheir production and gradually acquire the \ncapacity to process a much greater proportion of \ntheir own raw materials. No country should be \nconfined to the role of mere suppliers of raw \nmaterials.\nIn a world marked by heightened antagonism \nbetween the great Powers it is essential to \nemphasize the possibilities which none the less \nare available. The Independent Commission on \nDisarmament and Security Issues, under the \nchairmanship of Olof Palme, consisted, like the \nBrandt Commission, of people with varying \nbackgrounds and political convictions. In spite \nof considerable conflict of interests, they also \nmanaged to achieve a measure of mutual \nunderstanding. Allow me to comment briefly on a \nfew points. The Commission proposes a total ban \non nuclear-weapon tests. This has long been the \ncentral issue in the disarmament negotiations. \nSweden has for its part, by its own proposals and \nmonitoring efforts, done all it can for the \nattainment of this goal. I wish to indicate the \nSwedish Government's satisfaction at the fact \nthat the Soviet Union has submitted to the \nAssembly a draft agreement which is largely based \non previous common endeavours. It is our hope \nthat the other nuclear-weapon Powers will \ndemonstrate a corresponding will to negotiate, so \nthat agreement may finally be reached. May I also \nemphasize that a test ban is a focal element in \nthe efforts to freeze the nuclear-weapon capacity \nand to proceed to reductions. I am convinced that \nthe freeze idea will play an important role \nduring this session. In this context I wish to \nexpress our appreciation of those popular \nmovements which work independently for \ndisarmament and peace. The military forces \nstationed in Europe today are much larger than \ncan be justified by the security requirements of \nthe parties concerned. In fact, large balanced \nreductions would increase security.\nThe vast number of nuclear weapons deployed in \nEurope or targeted against that continent are the \nsource of special problems. Substantial \nreductions of these arsenals of nuclear weapons \nare necessary; but there is a connection between \nnuclear weapons in Europe and balance between \nEast and West as regards conventional forces. One \ncondition for getting rid of nuclear weapons in \nEurope is that both sides should also agree on a \nrough parity in conventional forces. The \nsmaller\u2014so-called battlefield\u2014nuclear weapons in \nEurope constitute a particular danger, as they \ncould be used at a very early stage of a \nconflict. The Commission proposes that these \nbattlefield weapons be withdrawn from the most \nforward positions and that a zone be created in \nEurope which is entirely free of these weapons, a \nzone which could stretch 150 kilometres on each \nside of the East-West border. This idea has our \nfull support.\nThe Swedish Government attaches great importance \nto all negotiations, such as those on mutual and \nbalanced force reductions and on theatre nuclear \nforces and the planned European disarmament \nconference, which aim in this way to reduce or \nabolish the role of nuclear weapons in Europe.\nThe Commission also proposes an international \nagreement on the total prohibition of chemical \nweapons, as well as a chemical-weapon-free zone \nin Europe. In the view of the Swedish Government, \nthe pre-conditions of implementing such an \narrangement for the purposes of \nconfidence-building should be examined more \nclosely. The proposal should also be used in the \nextensive efforts being made in the disarmament \nnegotiations in Geneva to achieve the total \nprohibition of all chemical weapons.\nThe most important instrument we have for \nachieving common security is the United Nations. \nIt is encouraging that during this debate so many \nGovernments have emphasized that it should be \npossible to use this instrument for preserving \npeace and security in the world in a more \nresolute way.\nThe Secretary-General has emphasized the \nimportance of this question by devoting the whole \nof his first report on the work of the \nOrganization to it. His report is a clear-sighted \nassessment of the international situation and of \nthe role of the United Nations in the \ninternational system. By departing from the \nstandards and duties which we set ourselves in \nthe Charter of the United Nations we are as the \nSecretary-General warns, \\\"perilously near to a \nnew international anarchy\\\".\nNo purpose of the United Nations is more \nimportant than the maintenance of international \npeace and security. Yet the United Nations has \nrepeatedly failed to realize that purpose and \nnever have the failures been more evident than in \nthe last few years. In the long run no \norganization can survive if the members do not \nrespect its rules. The prohibition in the Charter \nof the threat or use of force in relations \nbetween States is absolute; so is the obligation \nto use only peaceful means for the settlement of \ninternational disputes.\nWe need a more active and imaginative approach by \nthe Security Council to potential conflict \nsituations. There are many ways of achieving \nthis. One is improved co-operation with the \nSecretary-General, who has already announced his \nintention to develop and activate the preventive \nrole foreseen for him under Article 99 of the \nCharter.\nA factor which has greatly contributed to the \nerosion of the authority of the United Nations is \nthe repeated failure of the Security Council to \nsecure the implementation of its own decisions. \nThese are, according to the Charter, mandatory \nfor all Member States, and yet we have repeatedly \nseen them flouted by those to whom they were \naddressed. The Council must not, because of lack \nof foresight or for some other reason, place the \nSecretary-General in impossible situations but, \non the contrary, must give him all possible \nsupport in the assignments he is given.\nMany ideas similar to those tut forward by the \nSecretary-General are to be found in the report \nof the Palme Commission, to which I have already \nreferred. The report deals, with the need for \nagreement among the permanent members of the \nSecurity Council on early action primarily in \nborder countries in certain predetermined areas. \nThis would mean that in case of such conflicts it \nwould be possible to initiate action by the \nUnited Nations in time to prevent the use of \nforce. In this way the risk of great-Power \nrivalry in areas of conflict would diminish.\nIt is inevitable that the permanent members of \nthe Security Council, by virtue of the special \npowers and ability to act vested in them by the \nCharter, have special reason to reflect seriously \nupon the role they play. To put it simply, the \nUnited Nations cannot carry out its functions \nwithout the full co-operation of the great \nPowers, among themselves and with the rest of the \nworld. They should use that power and influence \nfor the purpose of making the ideals of the \nUnited Nations come true. This session of the \nGeneral Assembly has been convened at a time when \nmany of the world's problems have assumed crisis \nproportions. It is therefore only natural to \ndwell particularly on the responsibility of the \nUnited Nations for the maintenance of peace and \nsecurity, and its ability to contribute to a \nsolution of the economic crisis. The defence of \nthe principles of international law is a vital \ntask for the United Nations. This is a challenge \nfor the future. With the rapid advances in the \nfield of technology, more and more issues are of \na kind that cannot be solved by each State on its \nown. Here we are faced with the necessity for \ncommon solutions.\nWe must co-operate. The future always contains \nboth promise and threat. Let us together ward off \nthe threat and fulfil the promise.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President. it gives me great pleasure to \nconvey to you in the name of the delegation of \nthe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. our warm \ncongratulations on your election to your high \noffice. We have full confidence that your \nexperience and competence will contribute \neffectively towards a successful out-come to this \nsession. I should also like to pay a tribute to \nyour predecessor Mr. Kittani who presided over \nthe proceedings of the thirty-sixth session most \neffectively for which we thank him. I wish to pay \na particular tribute to the persistent efforts of \nthe Secretary-General to increase the \nopportunities for peace and to alleviate the \ntensions that prevail in many parts of the world. \nMy delegation takes this opportunity to express \nits full support for those efforts and to pledge \nits full co-operation with him.\n\n40. A careful study of the agenda of this session \nand the grave issues contained therein. which \nhave serious implications for world peace and \nsecurity confirms the bleak foreboding which the \nSecretary-General has clearly and forcefully \nexpressed in his report.\n\n41. Our world today is beset on all sides by \ndangers resulting from the predominance of the \npolicies of the use of force or the threat of the \nuse of force: instead of having recourse to, \npeaceful\u00ef means of 'settling problems among \nnations. This tendency has been intensified by a \ncontinuing and relentless arms, race. the \ndevelopment and acquisition of the most \n.sophisticated means of mass destruction and the \nallocation by many States of vast human and \nmaterial resources to those ends. '\n\n42. We also find that the States entrusted by the \nCharter of the United Nations with a special \nresponsibility for maintaining international \npeace and security have pursued policies which \nare at variance with that responsibility. Some of \nthem have resorted to the use of force while \nothers have condoned the fact that States have \ncommitted acts of aggression and intervention in \nthe affairs of other States.\n\n43. The failure of those States to put an end to \nthe military option and the use of force and \ntheir condoning of the use of force by others \nhave led to the prevalence of an aggressive \nattitude in relations between States and \nencouraged more States to take the same course.\n\n44. As a logical and ineluctable corollary of \nthis development, the international situation has \ndeteriorated most seriously. amounting as the \nSecretary-General said in his report to have \nbrought the world perilously near to a' new \ninternational anarchy. As a result of this \ndevelopment the United Nations has been rendered \nincapable of contributing lo the solution of \ninternational conflicts. The Security Council \nwhose principal duty under the Charter is the \nmaintenance of international peace and security \nhas been immobilized and prevented from \nperforming its -ask. Its functions have been \nconfined to issuing resolutions which remain \nunimplemented.\n\n45. Despite the fact that the Charter has laid \ndown a system of collective security in the \nworld.\u00ef we note that the principles enshrined in \nthe Charter for regulating relations between \nStates have been flouted. That system has been \nsubverted by the prevailing tendency to use force \nunder different pretexts, whether it be a warped \nconcept of security or alleged' self-defence. All \nthose pretexts are actually aimed at imposing \nhegemony and achieving the parochial interests of \nthose who have the force and the means of using \nit. Thus we see the blatant military occupation, \nthe colonization of occupied land~. the \ndestruction of ,property and cities and \ninterference in .and manipulation of the internal \naffairs of other States with a view to serving \nthe interests and aims of the aggressor.\n\n46. It is profoundly disturbing that instead of \ntaking immediate and decisive action to deter \naggressors assist their victims and prevent the \nfruits of aggression being reaped some of the \nmajor Powers choose to stand idly by. to condone \nthe aggression or even to obstruct the \napplication against the aggressor of the \nsanctions fm' which the Charter provides.\n\n47. That approach. with its concomitant weakening \nof the united Nations has led to the dangerous \nsituation that the world finds itself in today. \nIt has also led all those countries that observe \nthe Charter and support international law to lose \nfaith and confidence that their legitimate quest \nfor security and just solutions to their problems \ncan be pursued within the framework of the \nexisting international ordering the absence of \nsuch assured security, those Member States have \nfound themselves impelled to scramble .for' arms \nand divert large parts of their limited resources \nfor the acquisition of the necessary means of \nself-defence in confronting the policies of \nhegemony and domination being pursued by the more \npowerful States. We must state that such a \ndevelopment would never have taken place if the \nmajor Powers to which the Charter entrusted the \nmaintenance of world peace and security. ~ad \nshouldered their solemn responsibilities and \nduties with firmness and sincerity.\n\n48.\tThe most glaring example of what I, have \njust described is to be found in the Middle East, \nwhere the situation is characterized by the 'use \nof force and the imposition of occupation. \nHegemony and faits accomplis to which Israel has \nresorted persistently, without being subjected to \nthe deterrent action that would force it to \nsubmit to the international will and law..\n49.\tIsrael occupied the greater part of \nPalestine in 1948 and in 1967 it completed the \noccupation of the remainder. in addition to parts \nof other Arab lands. In the past few months it \nhas occupied large areas of the sister country of \nLebanon rendering homeless and displacing scores \nof thousands of its civilian population. Israel \nhas destroyed many of Lebanon's towns and \nvillages. It laid siege to Beirut devastating \nlarge parts of it with unparalleled barbarism by \nincessant land sea and air bombardment. which \nclaimed thousands of innocent victims in dead and \nwounded.\n\n50. One of the most heinous massacres in history \nwas perpetrated against unarmed civilians. \nforemost among whom were women old people and \nchildren. The conscience of humanity is still \noverwhelmed with revulsion anger and abhorrence \nat dimensions of this barbaric massacre which has \nits precedent in earlier Israeli massacres \ninnocent Palestinians at Deir Yassin, Qibya and \nKafr Qasim.\n\n51. The main objective of these repeated \nmassacres has invariably been to terrorize and \nuproot the Palestinian people and to silence \nthem. in the vain hope' that such massacres will \nerase from the consciousness of the Palestinian \npeople their yearning to return to their homeland \nin Palestine. and that they will abandon that \nhomeland to strangers who falsely claim they have \na better right to it than its legitimate owners.\n\n52. Israel's ability to persist in its aggressive \nexpansionist policies of which the most recent \nmanifestation is the victimization of Lebanon can \nbe traced back specifically to the time when the \nwhole world and particularly those great Powers \nupon which devolves the responsibility for \npreserving peace and security stood idly by or \nignored Israel's aggression in June 1967. At that \ngrave moment a fundamental deviation occurred in \nthe international collective security system. \nWhen the Security Council was prevented from \ntaking action in conformity with its established \npractice of linking a cease-fire with the \nimperative demand for complete withdrawal from \nall the occupied territories, Israel exploited \nthat in order to reap the fruits of its \naggression by continuing its occupation of Arab \nterritories and refusing to withdraw from them. \nMoreover, Israel refused to implement Security \nCouncil resolution 242 (1967) which called upon \nit to withdraw completely from those territories. \n.\n\n53.' Israel 'has persistently sought to cover up \nits defiance under the guise of its security. Its \nsupporters have sought to justify their massive \nassistance to it on the ground that a secure \nIsrael would be more willing to make concessions \nin exchange for peace. Events have proved the \nfallacy of that claim.\n\n54. We have seen that the greater Israel's military power grows the more obdurate \nand inflexible its policies become. It stretches \nits concept of security to include aggression \nagainst the neighbouring Arab States. Israel's \ndoctrine of security has become synonymous with \naggression expansion and occupation. It reached \nunprecedented dimensions recently with the \nmassacre of innocent civilians. The abominable \nevents in Lebanon have revealed to the whole \nworld and in particular to the friends of Israel. \nIsrael's true face and have unmasked the \nfalsehood of its security pretexts.\n\n55. Israel's definition of its security is but a \nslogan which it uses to cover up its continuing \nexpansion at the expense 'of Arab territories and \nrights. Israel expanded since the Partition Plan \nof 29 November 1947 going beyond the Armistice \nAgreement of 1949 and the cease-fire lines of \n1967 to what we see at present in Lebanon shows \nthat Israel is in no need of security. Israel has \nannexed Arab Jerusalem and the Golan Heights; it \nhas established Israeli settlements; it bombed \nIraqi, peaceful nuclear installations: and, it \nhas started to build a canal from the Dead Sea to \nthe Mediterranean. Such an expansionist Israel \nwhich has defined its perceived area of security \nas encompassing all the lands from Pakistan in \nthe East and North Africa in the West is \nsuffering from an abundance of security, not from \na lack of it. That is all too dear when we take \ninto account Israel military nuclear capability \nwhich was documented in the Secretary-General's \nreport at the preceding session.\n\n56. It has been the consistent pattern that \nwhenever there appear to be indications on the \nhorizon of efforts by the international community \nto achieve a just. comprehensive and lasting \nsolution to the question of Palestine and the \nconflict in the Middle East Israel resorts to a \npre-emptive military strike in order to occupy \nmore Arab lands in order to thwart any such \ninternational efforts and compel the world to \ndivert its endeavours towards dealing with the \ncomplexities resulting from the faits accomplish \nnewly created by Israel's aggression.\n\n57. Hence Israel's invasion of Lebanon and its \nattempts to manipulate Lebanon's political \nsituation and internal affairs in a manner which \nwould serve its objective of spreading its \nhegemony over the region. Israel was encouraged \nto launch its invasion by the meek reaction to \nits earlier invasion of southern Lebanon in March \n1978 and its ability to impose its own conditions \nfor a partial withdrawal. Those conditions \nincluded the creation of a buffer zone in south \nLebanon under the control of mercenaries \naccountable to its will. When Israel saw that \nthat dangerous precedent had been tolerated by \nthe inter-national community, it embarked upon \nits further invasion of Lebanon, which has \ncontinued for the past several months. At the \nbeginning of the invasion it declared that its \nobjective was to secure a cordon sanitaire, the \ndepth of which it would decide at will, on the \npretext of an alleged need to ensure the security \nof its citizens in the northern area.\n\n58. Israel has only been encouraged by the \nlaunching of the two invasions to carry out \nfurther aggression. We warn the international \ncommunity of the seriousness of Israel's \npremeditated plans and intentions regarding the \nArab States. It is determined to turn its back on \nthe principles on which a just peace could be \nachieved. We also warn it against Israel's \nefforts to impose a sham solution of its own \nmaking, the preparations for which have already \nbeen initiated in declarations by its leaders \nthat a solution to the Palestinian problem lies \noutside Palestinian national soil.\n\n59.\tThe international community must take a \nfirm and decisive stand in confronting these \nominous plans. It most prevents the aggressor \nfrom reaping the fruits of its aggression. The \ninternational community must also compel the \naggressor to respect the principles of \ninternational law and good faith in relations \namong nations, if we are truly committed to the \npurposes and principles of the Charter and to \nsafeguarding the region and the world as a whole \nfrom the serious consequences of allowing the \npresent situation to continue.\n\n60.\tThe international community, both within \nthe United Nations and outside it, has defined \nthe necessary bases for the achievement of a \njust, lasting and comprehensive peace in the \nregion. These include the withdrawal of Israel \nfrom all the Arab territories occupied since the \nJune 1967 aggression, the return of the Arab City \nof Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty, and recognition \nof the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Arab \npeople, including its right to self-determination \nin conditions of total freedom on Palestinian \nnational soil. Israel has subverted all the \ninternational efforts aimed at the attainment of \nthis goal. The most recent example of this was \nits outright rejection of the ideas put forward \nby President Reagan although they could not \npossibly be considered as prejudicing Israel's \nsecurity.\n\n61. In contradistinction to these Israeli \npolicies, which are based on the rejection of \npeace and attempts to achieve hegemony over the \nregion, there is sincere Jordanian and Arab \ndetermination to achieve a just peace which would \nguarantee rights and ensure security and \nstability in the region. Jordan accepted Security \nCouncil resolution 242 (1967) and has used its \ninfluence to persuade others to accept it and \nsupport its implementation. Jordan has also \nsupported efforts and initiatives formulated both \nwithin and outside the United Nations to ensure \nthe implementation of that resolution and the \nachievement of a comprehensive settlement, in \naccordance with universally agreed principles.\n\n62. Furthermore, Jordan's role was actively \npursued in co-operation with sister Arab States, \nat the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference held in Fez \nin September, in the formulation of a collect e \nArab peace initiative compatible with what the \ninternational community has resolved should be \nthe framework for peace. We call upon the \ninternational community to support this \ninitiative and to strive  resolutely to give \neffect to it since it offers an historical \nopportunity which has gained world-wide \nacceptable, with only Israel dissenting. It is a \nunique opportunity which must be seized by \neveryone in order to ensure a just peace and a \ncomprehensive settlement of this whose question, \nwhich has threatened international security and \nthe security of the region for the pas: 34 years.\n\n63. There is another conflict threatening the \nstability and security of the region in which we \nlive, namely, the Iraqi-Iranian war that has been \nraging for about two years. This causes Jordan \npain and grief because it involves two Islamic \nStates. Jordan, which respects the Charter and \ninternational law and accepts its national \nresponsibilities, supports its sister Iraq in its \ndefence of its national territory and its \nlegitimate rights on its land and waters. Jordan \nadds its voice to that of the international \ncommunity in asking the Islamic Republic of Iran \nto respond positively to Security Council \nresolutions 479 (1980), 514 (1982) and 522 \n(1982), as well as to the many mediation efforts \naimed at ending the war between the two \nneighbouring countries. Jordan has also welcomed \nwith satisfaction the initiative taken \nunilaterally by Iraq for the observance of a \ncease-fire and withdrawal of its troops to within \nits international borders in order to open the \nway for a just settlement that would prevent \nfurther bloodshed and destruction. Such a \nsettlement would give each party what rightfully \nbelongs to it and lead to the establishment of \ngood-neighbourly relations between the two \ncountries which would undertake not to interfere \nin each other's internal affairs.\n\n64. Several other parts of the world have been \nafflicted in the same way as the Middle East \nregion. The racist government of South Africa \ncontinues to practise its hateful apartheid \npolicies, to occupy Namibia and to commit acts of \naggression against neighbouring African States.\n\n65. The international community is duty-bound to \ntake a firm stand against the practices of this \nracist regime and to apply all the means of \npressure available to it, including the sanctions \nprovided for inthe Charter, to compel South \nAfrica to comply with international resolutions.\n\n66.\tWe also call for the implementation of \nUnited Nations resolutions pertaining to \nAfghanistan and Eritrea and for respect for the \nright of all peoples to self-determination and to \nexpress their national will in conditions of \ntotal freedom.\n\n67.\tJordan also calls for the peaceful \nsolution of the problem of Cyprus through the \nintercommunal talks under the auspices of the \nUnited Nations and within a framework which would \npreserve the unity, independence and non-aligned \nstatus of that country. .\n\n68. We support the solution of the problem of \nKorea by peaceful means through negotiations \nbetween the two parts of Korea, in accordance \nwith the joint communique issued in July 1972.\n\n69.\tIt is impossible to separate the gloomy \nclimate pervading the world today, which is based \non the use of the military option to solve \ninternational issues, from the overall thrust of \nthe arms race. The race to develop or acquire the \nmost modem weapons of destruction, conventional \nas well as nuclear, has intensified the tendency \nto use or threaten to use force and hag compelled \nmany States, particularly the developing nations, \nto seek to acquire arms for their legitimate \nself-defence at the expense of the satisfaction \nof their pressing economic and social needs. It \nis incumbent upon the major Powers to set an \nexample by showing the political will to curb the \narms race and to work, guided by the principles \nof the Charter, to averting aggression, providing \nan atmosphere of confidence and security for all \nStates that respect international law. It is also \nimperative to transfer the enormous human and \nfinancial resources devoured by the arms race to \nthe task of reforming the international economic \norder, which is exposed to huge strains and is \nsuffering from a structural disequilibrium. This \nstate of affairs had led many countries, \nparticularly developing countries, into a serious \nsituation, made them incapable of servicing their \nforeign debts and brought them to the verge of \ndisaster.\n\n70.\tIn this statement I have reviewed some of \nthe gravest problems facing our world today and \nthreatening its resent and future. The family of \nnations, individually and collectively, must \nexert serious and sincere efforts to deal with \nthe crises. We must not continue to pursue the \npolicies that have brought the world to the state \nof degeneration which we are witnessing today and \nwhich the Secretary-General has strongly \nemphasized in his report. It is our earnest hope \nthat the imminence of the danger will increase \nour awareness of the responsibilities incumbent \nupon the international community so that it may \nrise to the challenges confronting it and the \nworld may become a better place to live in.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I wish to add my congratulations to those which have \nalready been expressed on your election to the presidency of the \nthirty seventh session of the General Assembly. I also wish to \nexpress my appreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Kittani. It \nfell to him to preside over the Assembly at a time when it had to \ngrapple with critical issues that threatened and indeed seriously \nruptured international peace and security. Those sessions were \nunquestionably taxing, but as an accomplished and experienced \ndiplomat he always rose to the occasion. We must take this \nopportunity to pay a tribute to the Secretary General. This is the \nfirst regular session of the General Assembly that commences with Mr. \nPerez de Cuellar at the head of the Organization, His first year of \noffice has been a most distressing one in international relations and \nyet he has been able to rise above last year's crises and to focus in \nhis report on the work of the Organization on the fundamental issues \nthat must be addressed by this world body. In his report he quite \nrightly identifies the central problem facing the Organization as its \ncapacity to keep the peace and serve as a forum for negotiations. He \npleaded for a conscious recommitment by Governments to the Charter. \nMy country concurs with the Secretary General's views. I wish to \nexpress the hope that we can, in our deliberations over the next \nthree months, find effective solutions to the difficulties that he \nhas identified. We wish him well as he guides this Organization. In \nmy address to the Assembly at the thirty  sixth session I stated that \nthe decade of the 1980s was probably the most dangerous, certainly \nthe most critical, since the Second World War. I noted then that the \nworld economy was in crisis and that inflation in all countries, rich \nand poor alike, was out of control. I regret to say that the \nsituation has not improved. Indeed the current international economic \nrecession is deep and pervasive. All countries, industrialized and \ndeveloping, oil producing and non oil producing, are currently in a \nstate of economic decline, with not a few on the brink of collapse. \nThe economic backdrop against which international relations are being \nconducted continues to be characterized by recession, restrictive \ntrade policies and high interest rates in the industrialized \ncountries. Weakening demand for their primary products and low \ncommodity prices have depressed the export earnings of developing \ncountries. Increasing debt burdens have contributed to their economic \ndifficulties. The policies so far applied have not been able to avert \nhigh levels of unemployment, widespread starvation and persistent \npoverty in much of the developing world. I share the view of those \nwho are persuaded that recovery of the international economy is \nunlikely to be accomplished or to be lasting unless the developing \ncountries as a group can return to a period of positive growth and \nprosperity. Increasingly, it is being emphasized that there is a \nparallel between the present world economic situation and the \nrecession of the 1930s, but I believe that there is a fundamental \ndifference: there is today a greater understanding of the workings of \nthe international economic system and of the need for economic \ncooperation. In short, narrow national interests may be attractive, \nbut there is an overwhelming need for all of us to cooperate in order \nto save the world economy from further deterioration. What is needed \nnow is international agreement on ways to stem the tide of growing \nprotectionism. While protectionist tendencies are predictable in \ntoday's harsh economic climate, we all know from the lessons of \nhistory and the reality of economic interdependence that, if \nunchecked, protectionism is at best self defeating and at worst could \nprecipitate the very international collapse we all seek to avoid. \nThere is also a need for international agreement on the rate of \ncreation of new debt and on the role of private institutions, \nfinancial and otherwise, in the recovery effort. We now know that the \nworld can never again revert to economic self management, to \nprotectionism and to stalemate in multilateral efforts at financial \nand development cooperation without giving rise to the danger of \ninternational economic collapse. Though it is recognized that the \nproblems with which we are grappling are common to many developing \ncountries, I should like here to draw special attention to the \nparticular problems which confront very small States such as those of \nmy sub region. A month ago the Prime Minister of Barbados addressed \nthe joint annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the \nWorld Bank in Toronto. Speaking on behalf of the member Governments \nof the Caribbean Community, he pointed to the fact that the relative \ndeficiency in resources and capability implicit in small size imposes \ngreater difficulties on those States in achieving greater self \nreliance. He stated that the need for concessional resources in so \ncalled middle income countries cannot be determined by per capita \ngross national product alone without giving consideration to the \nresource endowments and the institutional capabilities within those \ncountries. He also expressed concern about the threatened application \nof principles based on the new concept of maturation or graduation. \nThat concept would imply the creation of a permanent class of middle \ndeveloped countries which would never realize their full potential by \nachieving developed status. It is a matter of deep concern that the \nproblems facing the economies of very small States are apparently \nstill not well understood by those who provide bilateral and \nmultilateral assistance. In this connection, we should like to draw \nthe Assembly's attention to eminent thinkers in this field. On 8 July \nthis year, Mr. William Demas, President of the Caribbean Development \nBank, addressed the Economic and Social Council in his capacity as \nChairman of the Committee for Development Planning. He pointed out a \nnumber of steps necessary for the recovery of the world economy and \nrecommended a more imaginative use of multilateral financial \ninstitutions. Specifically, he called for the following: first, the \nimmediate restoration of the resources of the International \nDevelopment Association to previously agreed levels and their \nsubsequent enlargement, accompanied by a substantial increase in the \nresources of multilateral development institutions, particularly the \nWorld Bank, as well as the creation of an energy facility with a \nvoluntarily subscribed equity base; secondly, the immediate \nresumption of Special Drawing Rights creation and the enlargement of \nthe resources available to IMF. In addition, IMF should make a \ngreater proportion of its resources available to the developing \ncountries on easier terms and should consult and listen to member \nStates when setting the terms of loans; thirdly, a significant \nincrease in concessional development assistance, including food aid. \nBarbados supports those recommendations and is convinced that they \nfeature in attempt to deal realistically with the economic problems \nfacing the developing countries. We are also convinced that the \nUnited Nations has a vital role to play in the realization of the \ngoals of development. That role may sometimes be limited merely to \nsensitizing public opinion, but it is important. I come now to the \nproposed global negotiations on international economic cooperation \nfor development. Barbados is keenly concerned about progress towards \na new international economic order. It is that concern which leads us \nto feel a deep sense of disappointment over the failure of efforts to \nopen global negotiations, for which the 1981 International Meeting on \nCooperation and Development at Cancun held out so much promise. We in \nBarbados think it is deplorable that the search for a solution to the \nfundamental economic problems of this world should be hampered by \nlack of action on the part of the industrialized countries. It is \neven sadder when one realizes that in obstructing global \nnegotiations, those countries are frustrating endeavors to combat \nhunger and poverty two problems that are endemic to most of the third \nworld and are the natural consequences of the old, unjust order. I \nbelieve that the serious obstacles to the efficient utilization of \nhuman and material resources for development are a result of the \ncurrent state of international economic relations. The present \neconomic order must be replaced by one based on equity, sovereign \nequality, common interests and cooperation. Developing countries, and \neven some developed ones, have expressed a desire to see the present \nsystem replaced. My country would like to see the entire \ninternational community summon the necessary political will to cure \nthe economic ills which plague all our countries. I believe that I am \non safe ground when I assert that Barbados is not alone among \ndeveloping countries in regarding the activities of the Organization \nin the sphere of technical assistance as one of the more satisfactory \naspects of its work. UNDP has, without a doubt, established itself \nover the years as one of the most effective means for delivering \ntechnical assistance throughout the developing world. And yet, at the \nmeeting of the Governing Council in June of this year, the \nAdministrator of the Programme produced statistical information \nshowing that the Programme is in grave danger as a result of the \ndeclining level of its real resources. The record will show that my \ncountry, upon which the hardships of the worldwide economic recession \npress no less onerously than upon any other country, has not faltered \nin its financial support for the Programme. The reason for this \ncontinued support is that Barbados views the state of \nunderdevelopment as one from which all countries of the world must \nemerge. If countries mean what they say when they lament the colossal \nwaste resulting from ever  increasing expenditure on weapons of \ndestruction, let them without delay look to those remedies which lie \nnearest to hand. UNDP is one such remedy, and it deserves the support \nof countries seeking to achieve the kind of world which we all \ndesire. That leads me to express my country's disappointment at \nfurther evidence of the lack of concern by some countries for \ndevelopment initiatives. I refer to the failure of those countries to \nsupport the Convention on the Law of the Sea. Barbados participated \nin the long and tortuous negotiations directed towards solving the \nproblem of the management of the resources of the sea. We expected \nthat the principle of the common heritage of mankind would be \naccepted and applied. Consequently, we are saddened by the grudging \nreluctance with which many of the developed States have recognized \nthe. Convention. We are also distressed by the apparently firm \nintention of stronger maritime Powers to ensure that the most \npromising aspects of the Convention are stymied by the concerted \naction of the technologically advanced. It would be worse than folly \nto repeat the mistakes of the last century, when colonizing Powers \ncarved up vast continental tracts of land. We live today with the \nlegacy of those nineteenth century errors. To allow the vast expanse \nof the oceans and their resources to be disposed of only among the \nmighty however bland the contemporary approach would be to fail \nsucceeding generations. Barbados will therefore cooperate with \nlikeminded nations in the establishment of an effective and efficient \nInternational Sea bed Authority. Such an Authority has the potential \nof being a vital agency for the management of and equitable \nparticipation in the wealth of the oceans. It therefore deserves the \nactive support of all those who recognize the right of \ntechnologically disadvantaged countries to have a fair share of the \nresources of our planet. We also welcome the decision of the Third \nUnited Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to have the Final Act \nand Convention signed in Jamaica later this year. This is most \nfitting, for although the political center of gravity has shifted to \nother areas, the Caribbean is an area of historical importance, \nhaving been a trading center in former centuries. The signing of that \nmultifaceted Convention will have particular significance. On that day \nwe shall reaffirm and strengthen our commitment to a more equitable \nsharing of the riches of the oceans. We shall, also be pledging \nourselves to preserve and develop their living and nonliving \nresources as part of the patrimony of all peoples. Just as the \ninternational community has failed to deal successfully with the \ninequities of the world economy, it has also been unsuccessful with \nthe question of disarmament. We are all aware that the failure of the \nAssembly at the recent special session to agree on a comprehensive \nprogramme for disarmament has caused grave disappointment. The \ndiscussions were important in so far as they provided an opportunity \nfor all countries to focus collectively on the general disarmament \nprocess and its objectives. I do not wish to reiterate here the \nhorrifying statistics of world expenditure on arms, for, in the words \nof the report of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and \nSecurity Issues, under the chairmanship of Olaf Palme, now Sweden's \nhead of Government, they have assumed a sort of deadening \nfamiliarity. Effective resolution of the disarmament issue depends \nprimarily on East West negotiations and on the political action of \nthe super Powers. However, all countries, large and small, must lend \ntheir voices in support of early action. It is in the common interest \nof all of us to avoid war. Barbados is convinced that the level of \narmaments will not be reduced unless hard negotiations are concluded \nbetween the super Powers and agreement reached on a mutual and \nbalanced force reduction. We hope that universal awareness of the \npotentially devastating consequences of the arms race will encourage \nefforts to bring about effective and conclusive negotiations on this \nissue Barbados will continue to share the related concerns of the \ninternational community on matters of security and development. If \nthe resources released from a cutback in the arms industry were used \nfor social and economic development, then widespread unemployment, \nhunger and poverty could be abated. But this can be achieved only if \nnations are convinced that they are serving a greater good than their \nown narrow interests. Barbados therefore again calls on all nations \nto respect the institutions they have built and to honor the \nundertakings they have made. Barbados speaks out again, firm in the \nconviction that the United Nations and the Charter are the guardians \nof international morality and the rule of law. Since the last regular \nsession of the General Assembly, recourse has too often been made to \nthe use of arms to resolve conflicts between States. This trend must \nbe condemned. My delegation once more would like to call on all \nnations to utilize the peaceful means for the settlement of disputes \nwhich are spelled out in Article 33 of the Charter. This leads me to \nthe question of the Security Council. The Charter intended that that \nCouncil should have primary responsibility for international peace \nand security. However, far too often, as the Secretary General warns \nin his report, nations have avoided bringing critical problems to the \nattention of the Council, or on occasion have submitted them too late \nfor that body to exercise any serious influence on their development \nand outcome. All members of the Council, both permanent and non \npermanent, have a duty to examine dispassionately and to search \ndiligently for solutions to issues that are brought before the \nCouncil. It is regrettable that the decisions of the Council are far \ntoo frequently ignored. I believe that the legal obligation of States \nto adhere to resolutions and decisions of the Council would be \nreinforced by the moral authority of a Council that is seen to be \nimpartial. It is only when the States Members of the United Nations \ncarry out the decisions of the Security Council that that body will \nfulfil the role for which it was conceived. My Government is mindful \nof the efforts that the Security Council has made over the years to \nbring peace to the Middle East. Yet today more than ever before the \ncontinuing unstable situation there, vividly dramatized by the events \nin Lebanon during the past two months, threatens global peace and \nsecurity. My Government believes that the withdrawal of all foreign \ntroops from Lebanon is a necessary condition for the restoration of \npeace in that country. The people of Lebanon must be given a chance \nto seek for themselves a genuine and lasting solution to their \nproblems. Barbados is horrified by the recent massacre of' \nPalestinian refugees in Beirut. We condemn in the most unequivocal \nterms the perpetrators of that dastardly slaughter of innocent men, \nwomen and children in refugee camps. It is indeed an irony of history \nthat the tragedy of Sabra and Shatila might have been prevented by \nthose who were themselves victims of past atrocities. We note that \nthat barbarous act has significantly alienated support from Israel, \nwhose soldiers were in effective control and occupation of the area \nwhere the camps were situated. This tragedy emphasizes the urgent \nneed for more earnest efforts to be made towards a general and \nlasting peace in that region. In the meantime, the Government of \nBarbados wishes to endorse calls made by the international community \nfor an investigation into the barbarities in Beirut. Barbados \nrecognizes the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self \ndetermination; and their latest sufferings underline the poignant \nneed for them to have their own homeland. We also recognize and \nsupport the right of Israel to exist as a sovereign and independent \nState within agreed and recognized boundaries. But Barbados has \nalways been opposed to the use of force to settle international \ndisputes. We believe that acts of aggression in the Middle East will \nnot enhance the chances for a lasting peace in that region. A number \nof elements now exist in the form of the Israeli Egyptian peace \ntreaty, the plan of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference and the \nproposals of the United States Administration, along with Security \nCouncil resolutions 242 and 338, which could be used to build a \npermanent and lasting peace in the Middle East. Included in the \nperennial litany of woe is the yet unresolved question of Namibia. \nThe freedom that has come to Angola, Mozambique and Zimbabwe will, it \nis hoped, soon come to Namibia. The writing has long been on the wall \nfor the racist regime in Pretoria, but its obduracy persists. In \ndesperation it continues to procrastinate by attempting to make Cuban \ndisengagement from Angola a condition of Namibian independence. South \nAfrica has no right whatsoever in Namibia, and should leave \nforthwith. A word about apartheid and sports an issue which, because \nof the prowess of Caribbean nations in many sporting activities, \nprincipally the game of cricket, is of more than passing interest to \nmy country. The proponents of apartheid have no shame. They do, \nhowever, have an abundance of material resources. By assuming that \neach man has his price, they have been seeking by wealth and stealth \nto lure our black sportsmen to parade their skills in South Africa. \nThe South African authorities hope thereby to strangle our sport \ninternationally and to reduce our positions of principle on apartheid \nto entry. For countries such as the one I have the honor to \nrepresent, countries which flinch at tampering with personal \nfreedoms, persuasion in matters of personal conduct and conscience is \npreferable to coercion. None the less, our cricketers must know that \nplaying in South Africa will disqualify them for selection for our \nnational team. Today I join with those solemnizing the Day of \nSolidarity with South African Political Prisoners in pressing for the \nrelease of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners in South \nAfrica. We hope that representatives here will continue to use every \nmethod at their command to isolate South Africa politically, socially \nand economically. That small States are vulnerable is a truism for \nwhich ample evidence can be found in recent events, both in the \nIndian and Atlantic Oceans an in the Caribbean Sea. It is to the \ncredit of organizations such as this that many more small island \nStates have not fallen prey to the desires of somearrogant, rapacious \nand stronger neighboring State. We must none the less be constantly \nvigilant. Today, many small island States face the threat of attack, \nnot by neighboring nations but by mercenaries soldiers of fortune, \nmotivated by personal greed, spurred by racial intolerance, or \nprompted by some nation State which would fain do its own dirty work, \nbut dare not. We contend that the activities of mercenaries violate \ninternational law and constitute interference in the internal affairs \nof other States. The activities of mercenaries result in breaches of \nterritorial integrity, national sovereignty and independence and \nviolate the self determination of peoples. Such activities pose a \nserious danger to international peace and security. Barbados is, and \nwill continue to be, in the vanguard of those States which press for \nthe adoption of resolutions and conventions to stamp out the \nrecruitment, use, financing and training of mercenaries. I wish, \ntherefore, to appeal to Member States for whom the elaboration of \nsuch a Convention would appear to create problems to present their \ncase in a constructive manner so that solutions may be attempted. \nFinally, let me assure the Assembly that Barbados holds the view that \nthe Organization presents the best means for harmonizing the actions \nof nations in the attainment of common ends. It already has many \nimpressive achievements to its credit. However, it must now address \nother pressing needs that clamor for solution. We fully realize that \nthe transformation of resolutions, decisions and treaties into \npractical action cannot be achieved except by commitment and \ndedicated effort by all our countries. Intellectual and moral \nthinking in the twentieth century has taken a huge humanitarian leap. \nWe have come to accept that peace in our time means more than the \nmere cessation of war. It connotes the creation and maintenance of \nconditions conducive to the full development of man's physical, \nintellectual and spiritual attributes. These conditions cannot exist \nif the leading military Powers continue in their race to outdo each \nother in the stockpiling and trading of arms of frighteningly \ndestructive power. Nor can the conditions indispensable to true peace \nexist where the battlefield is the ready recourse for disputing \nnations. Nor will the conditions of true peace exist while the \nmillions of the North are blessed with plenty, while dehumanizing \npoverty and crippling underdevelopment plague the millions of the \nSouth. Nor will the conditions of true peace ever exist until the \nmiasma of apartheid is eradicated from southern Africa. These \nconditions will not exist and be secure until, in word as well as in \ndeed, we begin to live out the true meaning of the resonant exordium \nof the Charter of this great Organization. There it reaffirms the \nfaith of the founding nations and indeed of all mankind in \nfundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the person, in \nthe equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small.\n"

His tireless\nefforts in pursuit of peace during his first year\nin office have already\u2014and justly\u2014 brought him\nworldwide attention. The Secretary-General's\nstrong committee, to upholding the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations is brilliantly\ndemonstrated in his report on the work of the\nOrganization, which is thoughtful and thought-\nprovoking. We, the countries of the world, would\ndo well to heed his advice that as an important\nfirst step we should consciously recommit\nourselves to seeking negotiated solutions to the\nworld's many problems by adhering strictly to the\nCharter of the United Nations.\n39.\tThe world today presents a bleak picture.\nIt is becoming increasingly difficult to remain\noptimistic about the future. Grave conflicts have\ncontinued to take place in many parts of the\nworld in the period that has elapsed since the\nthirty-sixth session. The threat remains that\nlocal and regional conflicts will escalate to the\nglobal level. The world is in the grip of the\nworst economic recession in decades. All nations,\nand in particular the developing countries, risk\njeopardizing the hard-won achievements made\nthrough international co-operation. Fundamental\nhuman rights are being increasingly violated in\nmany parts of the world. This combination of\nchallenges which the international community is\nfacing today calls for determined action and\nconstructive co-operation. The situation requires\nsomething more\u2014and something other\u2014than each\nnation working to solve its own problems. Wisdom\nand statesmanship are required if we are to meet\nthese challenges. We must admit that\ninterdependence inescapably characterizes the\nworld today. We must learn, as the\nSecretary-General so rightly puts it in his\nreport, \\\"to differentiate between short-term\nadvantage and long-term progress, between\npolitically expedient positions and the\nindispensable objective of creating a civilized\nand peaceful world order\\\".\n40. The United Nations provides the framework and\nthe forum for accommodating and reconciling our\ninterests if we accept the implications of our\ninterdependence. We must make a determined\neffort to use the opportunities available to us.\nWe must seek peaceful settlement of the disputes\nthat divide us. We must employ the available\ninternational machinery for the promotion of the\neconomic and social advancement of all peoples.\nAnd we must devote ourselves to the promotion and\nprotection of human rights throughout the world.\n41. The European Community and its 10 member States\npledge their full co-operation in achieving these\nfundamental goals. We believe strongly that we\nhave a role to play and a contribution to make in \nthis great endeavor. We wish to make our\ncontribution in fruitful partnership and\ncollaboration with the other nations of world. We\nunderstand and support their desire to defend\ntheir sovereignty and territorial integrity. We\nalso recognize that genuine non-alignment is an\nimportant factor in maintaining international\nstability and can make an important contribution\nto bringing about political settlements of the\nconflicts which threaten the world.\n42.\tThe European Community also strongly\nbelieves that through co-operation and\npartnership we can come to grips with the\nproblems of inequity which plague the world\neconomy. We shall pursue our efforts in these\nfields with vigor and look forward to building\nthe partnership based on mutual trust which is\nnecessary to achieve these important goals.\n43.\tSerious setbacks in East-West relations\nhave been a major element in the deteriorating\ninternational situation during recent years. The\npast years have brought new and disturbing\nviolations of the principles on which the United\nNations is based. The continued occupation of\nAfghanistan, with the evident willingness of the\nSoviet Union to pursue its aims by use of its\nmassive military potential, has contributed to\nthe creation of a climate of distrust and tension.\n44.\tThe tragic events in Poland since last\nDecember, which have taken place under pressure,\nhave also had a major negative impact on overall\nEast-West relations. These events, taking place\nin the heart of Europe, cause deep concern among\nthe Ten. The Ten have repeatedly called for the\nlifting of martial law, the release of those\narrested and the restoration of a genuine\ndialogue with the Church and Solidarity. The Ten\nwill continue to urge the Polish authorities to\nlive up to their declared intentions of\nre-establishing civil liberties and the process\nof reform in Poland as rapidly as possible.\n45.\tTo halt the present negative trend and\ndevelop substantial and balanced East-West\nrelations aimed at genuine detente, the causes\nunderlying the negative developments in East-West\nrelations should be removed in order to restore\nrespect for the principles of the Charter and the\nHelsinki Final Act to ensure mutually\nadvantageous co-operation through dialogue and\nnegotiations. We have already shown our\nreadiness to contribute to a positive\ndevelopment of East- West relations and we urge\nthe Soviet Union to demonstrate a similar\ninclination.\n46.\tThere is at present much popular concern\nabout world tension, the use of force by some\ncountries in contravention of die Charter and the\nimbalance in both nuclear and conventional\nweapons. This situation creates international\nmistrust and public anxiety. The latter manifests\nitself in many ways States where freedom of\nexpression is guaranteed. The Governments of the\nTen recognize and understand these concerns. We\nhave no doubt that similar concern is felt by the\npeoples of States where, regrettably, open\nexpressions of popular feeling about the build-up\nof armaments and the consequent burden on\nfaltering altering economics have so far been\nsuppressed.\n47.\tA few months ago the Member States met\nfor the second special session devoted to\ndisarmament. Governments and peoples all over the\nglobe had looked forward to this event in the\nhope that it would lead to a fresh impetus in the\nprocess of disarmament and thereby to the\nreduction of armaments and to huge military\nexpenditures. The results of the session were\ndisappointing. However, the Ten consider it very\nimportant that the consensus principle was\nupheld. Furthermore, the session unconditionally\nconfirmed the Final Document of the Tenth Special\nSession of the General Assembly the first such\nspecial session, in 1978. The views presented at\nthat session will form a useful basis for future\ndiscussions and negotiations. It is also\nnoteworthy that at the second special session\ndevoted to disarmament the Assembly agreed to\ncontinue the process initiated at the first\nspecial session.\n48.\tThe member States of the European\nCommunity will make every endeavor to help\naccomplish this important task. They will\ncontinue to support all constructive proposals\nwhich lead to reductions in armaments and to the\nbanning of certain types of weapons, and which\nenhance confidence and assure the security of all\nnations. In this respect the Ten strongly support\nefforts of a substantial and realistic nature\nmade in the sole negotiating body, the Geneva\nCommittee on Disarmament, and in other forums.\n49.\tThe Ten welcome the negotiations\ninitiated this summer between the United States\nand the Soviet Union on mutual reductions of\nnuclear strategic arms. These negotiations will\nundoubtedly be difficult. We hope, however, that\nthey will result in an early agreement on\nsubstantial reductions of these weapons.\n50.\tWe welcome also the negotiations between\nthe United States and the Soviet Union on\nintermediate- range nuclear forces, negotiations\nwhich are taking place within the framework of\nthe strategic arms reduction talks. It is well\nknown that these weapons are of special concern\nto us. We hope that the negotiations will lead to\nconcrete results in the near future.\n51.\tParallel with arms control and\ndisarmament in the nuclear field, substantial\nreductions in the conventional field must be\npursued vigorously.\n52.\tAs regards central Europe, efforts to\nestablish a real balance at a Cower level of\nforces between East and West have been pursued in\nVienna since H73, but progress has been slow.\nHowever, the Ten note that in the view of Western\nparticipants the prospects of an agreement have\nincreased following the presentation of new and\nconcrete proposals in Vienna. Their\nimplementation would lead to significant\nreductions and thereby contribute to a more\nstable relationship between East and West and to\nthe strengthening of peace and security in Europe.\n53.\tFurthermore, the Ten have declared\nthemselves in favor of a conference on\ndisarmament in Europe on the basis of a precise\nmandate to negotiate in a first stage militarily\nsignificant, binding and verifiable\nconfidence-building and security-building\nmeasures applicable to the whole of Europe.\n54.\tEfforts at improving East-West relations\nshould not be restricted to arms control. There\nis an equally great need for a comprehensive\nEast-West dialogue on other subjects, both\npolitical and economic. The process initiated by\nthe Conference on Security and Co-operation in\nEurope is a most important channel for this\ndialogue. The Ten sincerely hope that it will be\npossible, when the Madrid follow-up meeting\nwithin the CSCE process reconvenes in November of\nthis year, to reach agreement on a balanced and\nsubstantial concluding document. Such a document\nshould mark tangible progress within the human\ndimension of the Conference and contain a precise\nmandate for a conference on disarmament in\nEurope. In the opinion of the Ten the draft\nsubmitted by the neutral and non-aligned\ncountries remains a good starting-point for the\nnegotiating process in Madrid.\n55.\tSince the thirty-sixth session of the\nGeneral Assembly and following events in Lebanon,\nwhich are only the latest element in a chain of\nviolence and counter-violence in the area, the\nsituation in the Middle East has deteriorated\nfurther. During the last few months problems\nrelating to that situation have occupied the\nSecurity Council repeatedly, as well as the\nGeneral Assembly. The danger to international\npeace must be evident to all of us.\n56.\tThe Ten recall their vigorous\ncondemnation of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.\nWe are horrified by the terrible suffering and\ndamage which have been inflicted upon Lebanon and\nits civil population. A large number of innocent\nmen, women and children have been killed or\nwounded. Many thousands have been made homeless.\nWe are especially shocked and revolted by the\nmassacre of Palestinian civilians in Beirut. The\nTen have strongly condemned this criminal act. An\nauthoritative inquiry into the circumstances of\nthis incident is clearly necessary.\n57.\tThe Ten reaffirm their solidarity with a\nfriendly country whose population has suffered so\ncruelly and whose fragile stability is\ndangerously threatened. They are confident that\nthe Lebanese people will be able to bring about\nnational reconciliation. The presence of certain\nof their members in the multinational force\nestablished at the request of the Lebanese\nGovernment in line with the objectives of\nrelevant Security Council resolutions bears\nwitness to the attachment of the Ten to the\nrestoration of the authority of the Lebanese\nGovernment. They renew their offer to assist in\nthe relief and reconstruction of the country.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to begin, Sir, by extending to you \nmy congratulations and those of the delegation of \nthe Bahamas on your unanimous election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly. We are \nconfident that you will carry out the mandate of \nyour high office with the perseverance, ingenuity \nfor which you are well known. My delegation is \npleased to offer you its full co-operation in \nmaking this session a successful and constructive \none. I take this opportunity to express my \nprofound gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. \nKittani, who held the office during a difficult \nperiod. Yet he spared no effort to find solutions \nto the problems before us, left a clear imprint \nof patience and skill and displayed exemplary \ndistinction in the conduct of the affairs of the \nGeneral Assembly. My delegation wishes to pay a \ntribute to the new Secretary-General Car the \ndynamic, courageous and untiring effort and \ninitiative he has already displayed in upholding \nthe principles and objectives of the United \nNations. We are particularly pleased that he is a \nson of our Latin American region and we pledge \nthe support of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas \nfor his continuing efforts in the pursuit of \npeace and harmony among nations.\nIt is fortuitous that I should be addressing the \nAssembly today, 12 October 1982, the four hundred \nand ninetieth anniversary of the landing by the \nintrepid mariner Christopher Columbus en the \nisland now known as San Salvador in the \nCommonwealth of the Bahamas. That event, as we \nall know, marked the beginning of a new era in \nthe history of the world and of the Americas. The \nBahamas is proud of the role which fate destined \nit to play in the early history of our \nhemisphere, and it is in this spirit that the \nBahamas wishes to place on record its intention \nto bring before the Assembly at the appropriate \ntime a resolution to commemorate the \nquincentennial anniversary of Columbus's arrival \nin the New World.\nThe Bahamas has devoted itself to the \nestablishment and development of a peaceful and \nstable world order. This is essential \nprerequisite if progress is to continue towards \nimproving the quality of life of our own people \nand that of other nations of the world. Yet, as \none reviews the international situation over the \npast year, it is evident that peace and security \nhave been frequently shattered, with very serious \nconsequences, in various regions. A number of \nconflicts have interrupted international \ntranquility and resulted in heavy losses of human \nlife and considerable material damage,\nWe in the Bahamas are profoundly saddened by the \nevents in Lebanon. We believe in the sanctity of \nhuman life in a world seemingly desensitized by \nviolence and murder. We therefore deplore the \nmass murders, particularly of innocent men, women \nand children, in the refugee camps of Sabra and \nShatsla. Those responsible for such atrocities \nshould be held accountable. Unless the United \nNations is able to deal effectively with such \nsituations so as to serve as a deterrent to \nothers, then it will indeed become a useless \ninstitution.\nThe wishes of the Government and people of \nLebanon must be respected and its sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity restored. Accordingly, we \nurge the speedy withdrawal of all foreign forces \nfrom Lebanon We are also deeply disappointed by \nthe absence of full compliance with the series of \nSecurity Council resolutions on this matter. The \nuse of force against any nation must not take the \nplace of reason.\nThe right of all nations, including Israel and \nLebanon, to exist in peace and security must be \nrespected. There must also be recognition of the \nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people, \nincluding their right to self-determination. \nRecent events in the Middle East give a clear \nindication that a comprehensive, just and lasting \npeace in the Middle East is now more than ever an \nimperative.\nIt is regrettable that Iraq and the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran could not resolve their problems \nexcept by war. The conflict continues to threaten \nthe stability of the region and, given the \ninterdependence of relations among States, \ncontributes to international economic dislocation.\nWe therefore appeal to the parties to put an end \nto the hostilities and to arrive at a negotiated \nsettlement in accordance with Security Council \nresolutions 479 (1980) and 514 (1982). We are \nprofoundly appreciative of the \nSecretary-General's coordinated mediation efforts \naimed at preventing a further prolongation of the \nconflict and at finding a solution to the \ndifferences to the two sides.\nThe South Atlantic has not been spared the use of \nforce, costly in both human and material terms. \nWe would encourage the parties to bring about a \nformal end to the conflict in order that \nnegotiations may commence with a view to a final \nand lasting settlement.\nThe Bahamas is concerned by the violation of the \nfundamental principles on which the Organization \nis founded, especially the principle that the \nthreat or use of force in international relations \nis prohibited. This principle is particularly \nsignificant for small States and territories with \nlimited resources.\nThe dispute between Guyana and Venezuela owing to \nthe latter's revival of the claim to Guyana's \nterritory is another area of concern in our \nhemisphere. The Bahamas accepts that a judicial \nsolution to this problem has already been found \nunder international law. We urge that Venezuela \nrespect Guyana's territorial integrity and that \nthe two parties arrive at a peaceful solution in \nthe spirit of the purposes and principles of the \nCharter and of the agreements concluded between \nthem.\nWe continue to hope for an early, peaceful and \ncomprehensive solution to the situation in \nCyprus. We are cognizant of the gravity of the \nsituation and of its implications for the \nwell-being of the peoples involved and for the \ncontinuance of their national unity, based on \ntheir collective will, unhindered by outside \nforces. However, we must begin seriously to \nconsider measures for improving the effectiveness \nof the Organization, for in the Cyprus question \nwe see once again a situation where the decisions \ntaken by the Organization have not led to \nsignificant progress.\nPeace is indivisible. Violations of peace are to \nbe deplored. Indeed, recourse to the use of force \nis apparently becoming a norm in international \nrelations, to the detriment of countries both \nlarge and small. The proscription of the threat \nor use of force, the principles of sovereignty, \nindependence, territorial integrity, \nnon-interference in the internal affairs of \nStates and the peaceful settlement of disputes \nare indispensable norms of international life \nwhich must be respected by all.\nThe world economy continues to be caught in the \nmost severe recession since the great depression \nof the 1930s. The per capita gross national \nproduct for developing countries as a whole has \nfallen for the first time since the 1950s. The \npresent downward spiral follows two decades of \nexceptional growth and development in both \nindustrialized and developing countries. But now \nthere are serious doubts with respect to the \nprospects of growth during the rest of the \ndecade. The concern of Governments with immediate \ndomestic problems has intensified; protectionist \ntendencies have re-emerged; recession, inflation \nand high interest rates in the developed \ncountries have had an adverse impact on tourism \nand financial and technological resources flows, \nespecially foreign direct investment, in the \ndeveloping countries.\nIt is hoped that agreement can be reached on the \nframework and early launching of global \nnegotiations. The asymmetrical nature of the \ninterdependence between States has underscored \nthe need for measures to redress the structural \nimbalances in the world economy, particularly in \nthe areas of trade, raw materials, energy, money \nand finance. In our view, recovery and global \nnegotiations should not be regarded as \nincompatible. The participating heads of \nGovernment at the Versailles Economic Summit in \nJune agreed that the launching of global \nnegotiations was a major political objective. \nThat was a positive development. But further \nefforts in good faith are required to resolve the \namendments and counter-amendments to the proposal \nof the Group of 77 regarding the basis for \nconsultations.\nInterdependence and the consequent necessity for \ninternational economic co-operation are basic \nprinciples of international economic relations, \nas amply reflected in the International \nDevelopment Strategy for the Third United Nations \nDevelopment Decade. The uncertainty which has \nclouded international economic co-operation must \nbe removed. International co-operation must again \nbe set on the track towards world economic \nrecovery and economic development of the \ndeveloping countries.\nDuring the three decades that the General \nAssembly has been considering the question of \napartheid the overwhelming majority of mankind \nhas rallied to the cause of eliminating that \naffront to human dignity. In this International \nYear of Mobilization for Sanctions against South \nAfrica, the international community should \ncontinue to take energetic and concerted action \nin support of the legitimate struggle of the \noppressed peoples of South Africa for human \nrights. The need for collective action is \nunderscored by the continuing designation by \nSouth Africa of so- called independent homelands \nand by threats and acts of aggression against the \nfront-line States of southern Africa.\nWhile the case of the violation of human rights \nin South Africa is a blatant and obvious one, the \nexistence and persistence of human rights \nviolations throughout the world, in States \nMembers of the United Nations, cannot be denied. \nThe United Nations system has developed an \nincreasingly complex network of international \ninstruments and machinery to address the problems \nof human rights violations. Yet lack of consensus \non human rights issues, double standards and a \ngrowing trend towards selectivity have \nundoubtedly impeded the efficiency of this \nmachinery. Unless the United Nations is prepared \nconstructively to utilize existing human rights \nmachinery in a non- political humanitarian \nmanner, universally applicable solutions to \nproblems of human rights violations will not be \nfound.\nThe direct responsibility of the United Nations \nfor Namibia cannot end until genuine \nself-determination and independence are achieved \nin a united Namibia. My delegation is aware of \nreports of continuing mediation efforts by the \nWestern contact group and of guarded progress in \nresolving the outstanding issues. Nevertheless, \nwe call upon South Africa to desist from defying \nresolutions adopted by the United Nations for the \nearly independence of Namibia. South Africa \nshould not continue to use extraneous issues as \nan excuse for delaying or refusing to cooperate \nin the emancipation of Namibia.\nAt the recently concluded second special session \nof the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, \nthe Bahamas stated that the challenge facing us \nall was how to move from awareness, statements of \nintent, machinery and procedures to genuine and \nconcrete disarmament measures. The Bahamas also \nelaborated briefly on how that challenge could be \nsquarely and honestly met. Yet it seemed that we \ncould not resolve the contradictions that existed \nbetween motivation, words and action, and that \nspecial session ended in failure. Increased \nmilitarization, far beyond legitimate security \nneeds, only serves to increase international \ntension and exacerbate international conflict. \nThus, it behaves us all \u2014nuclear-weapon States, \nmilitarily significant States, non-militarily \nsignificant States\u2014to work collectively towards \nsignificant disarmament measures which will \nrestore the confidence of our peoples in the \nworth and effectiveness of the United Nations.\nMankind can no longer justify the enormous \nresources spent on armaments. The poverty, hunger \nand underdevelopment that face so many States \ndemand a redirection of those valuable resources. \nIn addition, the potential destructiveness of \nthose modem weapon systems is reason enough to \nbring mankind to its senses and to the \nrealization of man's true purpose in this \nuniverse. My delegation realizes that some \nprogress has been made towards disarmament, but \nwe must register our strong concern at the slow \npace of that progress.\nThe problem of drug abuse has come to be \nregarded, rightfully, as a universal one. It \naffects every region of the world. Over the past \nseveral years, the Latin American region has \nseemingly become a new focal point for \ninternational drug traffickers, as production and \ntrafficking, primarily in cannabis, hashish, \ncocaine and methaqualone have significantly \nincreased. The Bahamas, once uninvolved in such \nmatters, has become increasingly alarmed by the \nrealization that it has become a major conduit \nfor the illicit traffic moving from sources and \nsupply centers in South America to large and \nprofitable consumption centers in North America \nand Europe.\nIn this connection the Bahamas was pleased to be \nelected to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs. It \nhad its first opportunity, at the seventh special \nsession, held at Vienna in February of this year, \nto voice its concern with regard to the illicit \ntraffic in the Latin American region and, in \nparticular, in the Caribbean sub-region. The \ndilemma of transit States cannot be overstated. \nThey can exercise no control over the illicit \nproduction of or the illicit demand for narcotic \ndrugs. As victims of international drug \ntraffickers, they are forced to sacrifice much to \ncontrol a problem that is not of their making. \nThe Bahamas is therefore grateful for United \nNations intervention in the form of a study of \nthe problems of transit States.\nThe strengthening of international response to \nthe problem of drug abuse is vital. The Bahamas \ntherefore views the adoption at the thirty-sixth \nsession of the General Assembly of the \nInternational Drug Abuse Control Strategy, and \nthe five-year programme of action to implement \nthe Strategy as a significant step. Drug \ntrafficking can affect any State, whether \nproducer, consumer or transit. In this regard it \nis the hope of the Bahamas that initiatives \nundertaken to focus, within the context of the \nStrategy, on the actual movement of illicit drugs \nwill be supported.\nOnly consistency of purpose at the bilateral, \nregional and international levels will retard \nillicit production of, traffic in and demand for \nnarcotic drugs. Despite its limited resources the \nBahamas will continue, in conjunction with Member \nStates and the United Nations, to play an active \nrole in the struggle against drug abuse.\nThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of \nthe Sea has succeeded, after many years of \nlengthy negotiations, in producing a Convention \nwhich is unprecedented in scope and size\u2014a major \nmilestone in international co-operation and a \nfundamental contribution to international order \nand stability. A comprehensive document which is \nin many respects innovative has been negotiated. \nCompromises have been made to arrive at a \ngenerally acceptable convention which constitutes \na delicate balance between conflicting interests. \nWithin the United Nations system, the work of the \nConference is an example for the international \ncommunity of what can be achieved by multilateral \nnegotiations.\nThe Bahamas is an archipelagic nation. We are \ntherefore particularly gratified that the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea contains \nprovisions for the delimitation of the national \nfrontiers of archipelagic States. This Convention \ncorrects a serious omission in the law of the \nsea, as the two previous texts did not address \nthe circumstances peculiar to archipelagic States.\nWe had hoped the Convention would receive the \nunanimous support of the international community, \nand we continue to hope that it will. It is none \nthe less our sincere desire that those \ngovernments that have so far indicated their \nnon-participation will, in the final analysis, \ncome to the conclusion that their national \ninterests would be best secured by participation \nin the new form of true international \nco-operation represented by the Convention.\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work \nof the Organization raised the central issue of \nthe capacity of the United Nations to keep the \npeace and to serve as a forum for negotiations. \nThe Bahamas congratulates the Secretary-General \non the approach taken in his first report and \nconcurs with his analysis of the factors and \ncircumstances which appear to have contributed to \nthe impaired effectiveness of the Organization. \nWe subscribe also to the view that the present \ntendency of bypassing the Organization in \nsituations where it should and could play a \nvital, constructive role is damaging and \ndangerous for the future of the United Nations.\nThe Bahamas is of the view that a major role \nshould be played by the United Nations in dealing \nwith issues of universal concern and in taking \nthe initiative in the promotion of international \npeace, justice and co-operation. We reaffirm our \ncommitment to making this body a more effective \ninstrument in bringing about positive changes in \nthe world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with real pleasure that, on behalf of the delegation of the \nRevolutionary People's Republic of Guinea, we should like to extend \nto Mr. Hollai our warm congratulations on his well-deserved election \nto serve as President of this thirty-seventh session of the General \nAssembly. My country maintains with the People's Republic of Hungary \nthe best relations of friendly and fraternal co-operation. We cannot \ndoubt that Mr. Hollai's election will indeed contribute to the \ncrowning of our work with just solutions to our many concerns. In the \nquest for these just solutions, the President can be assured that the \ndelegation of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea will be \navailable at all times to ensure our fruitful co-operation. We should \nalso like to convey to the Secretary-General the warm encouragement \nand high hopes of President Ahmed Sekou Toure for a successful \ndischarge of the lofty tasks he has assumed as the head of the \nOrganization. The son of a thin world country, Mr. Perez de Cuellar \nwill, with his recognized wisdom, be able to deal with the pressing \nproblems confronting the international community. This session is \ntaking place at a particularly difficult and disquieting moment in \ninternational life. The aggravation of political tensions, to which \nhas been added a chronic and testing economic recession, is the \nhallmark of our time. Thirty-seven years ago, on behalf of perceptive \nhumanity, the peoples of the world endorsed the Charter in San \nFrancisco, thereby committing themselves: \\\"... to save succeeding \ngenerations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has \nbrought untold sorrow to mankind... \\\"... to establish conditions \nunder which justice and respect for the obligations arising from \ntreaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, \nand \\\"to promote social progress and better standards of life in \nlarger freedom\\\". Never had a human act and the legitimate will of \npeoples raised so much hope, confidence and faith in the future of \nnations. Between 1945 and 1982, 37 years have gone by; 37 years of \nthought, action and experience, 37 years of efforts crowned, to be \nsure, with victories, but more often ending with failure, \ndisappointment and bitterness. This session is thus being held at a \nmoment when the international situation is from various standpoints \nextremely unstable. The tragedy being acted out here and there \ndemonstrates to the world the degree of anguish and the urgency of \nthe responsibilities that must be assumed. On 29 June last, at the \ntwelfth special session President Ahmed Sekou Toure stated from this \nvery rostrum, in this connection: ' War, local though it be in a \ngiven geographic area of the world, is always universal in scope. \n\\\"War is raging in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia. \nLebanon is under attack by Israel, and Angola by the Republic of \nSouth Africa. In Namibia, in Western Saham, ... in Afghanistan, ... \nin El Salvador ... the fires of war have not been extinguished. Human \nlives are lost and property is destroyed. Violence continues \nthreatening the life of man and the well-being of society. \n\\\"International forums remain indifferent or powerless... Is the \nunhappiness of some creating the happiness of others?\\\" The outrageous \nattitude and the extraordinary stubbornness of racist South Africa, \nwhich is continuing not only to oppress and exploit the Coloured \npeople of South Africa, but is obstinately maintaining a state of war \nalong the Angolan border and in southern Angola and is illegally \nkeeping Namibia under its colonialist domination, can be cited in \nthis connection. The Namibian question is a question of rights, the \ninalienable right of peoples to independence. There is no ambiguity \nas to the correct or incorrect exercise of this right.\nAlibis arising from the Cuban presence in Angola, used to perpetuate \nthe grip on Namibia, are unacceptable to our delegation. The Cuban \npresence in Angela falls within the sovereign rights of the Peoples \nRepublic of Angola. Angola cannot be told to renounce that sovereign \nright. The open aggression of South African troops perpetrated \nagainst Angola is inadmissible and repugnant. It is even more \nintolerable to link that act of aggression to the Namibian question.\nOne can never say enough about the violations of the Charter and the \nopen arrogance of the proponents of the shameful system of in South \nAfrica, maintained with the complicity of certain Powers. It would be \nappropriate now to reiterate our appeal to the international \ncommunity to give material, moral and diplomatic support to SWAPO and \nto all the front-line States, which are the victims of the continuing \nacts of aggression perpetrated by the South African regime. The \nGovernment of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea considers \nthat in view of the prevailing situation in southern Africa, the \nUnited Nations must demand the full and immediate implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978) for the decolonization and \naccession to independence of Namibia, of which SWAPO is and remains \nthe sole legitimate representative. Elsewhere, we must recall here \nthe deep concern my country, the Revolutionary People's Republic of \nGuinea, feels concerning Israel's arrogance in the Middle East. It is \nhigh time for the State of Israel to face the obvious and to \nunderstand that its peace, its development, its survival, reside \nneither in its military policy, nor in war, but rather in a peaceful \nand speedy settlement of the Palestinian problem. Israel's obstinate \npursuit of a policy of aggression, expansion and confiscation and \nunbridled and systematic Judaization of Arab territories that it has \nbeen occupying by force dangerously jeopardizes its own future. It is \ntime the world recognized that the Palestinian people, under the \naegis of the PLO, has the right to a land, to a country, to a \nhomeland; and that Al Quds Al Sharif should have an international \nstatus which alone is compatible with its threefold religious \ncalling. The problems of the Middle East and those of southern Africa \nare obviously not the only concerns of our peoples. Africa, through \nits continental organization, is currently going through a serious \ninternal crisis. This points to the urgent necessity of finding a \njust solution to the problem of Western Sahara. We consider that the \nCommittee established at the eighteenth session of the OAU Assembly \nof Heads of State and Government should pursue its work to organize a \nreferendum in the Sahara. The convening of a special session of heads \nof State and Government would also help to ease the crisis now \nundermining and jeopardizing the moral standing of the OAU. To talk \nabout African problems is to talk about Chad, Mayotte, the Horn of \nAfrica and the serious worldwide economic recession, of which Africa \nis one of the main victims. Our delegation notes with some \nsatisfaction the beginning of an internal improvement in Chad that \nmay lead to political stability and the strengthening of national \nunity. It is appropriate now to appeal to all men of goodwill to \nsupport the efforts of the Council of State of the Republic of Chad, \nso that the work of national reconciliation can be completed. With \nregard to the Comorian island of Mayotte, my delegation invites both \nparties to conclude an agreement that would allow the return of that \nisland to the motherland. Another crisis is the deteriorating \nsituation in the Horn of Africa, the gravity of which my delegation \nhas constantly pointed out. Our concern is particularly great in the \nlight of the increasingly obvious intervention of foreign Powers in \nevents in that part of our continent. We call upon the two sister \ncountries, Ethiopia and Somalia, which are embroiled in that conflict \nto turn to the art of African wisdom: constructive dialogue and \nmutual tolerance. We must nurture peace where it reigns, restore it \nwhere it has been breached, protect it where it is threatened. \nTension exists not only in Africa and the Middle East, but also in \nthe Mediterranean basin, in Cyprus, in the Gulf, in Korea, in \nAfghanistan and in Kampuchea. Only yesterday, in the Falkland Islands \n(Malvinas), such tension flared into open, murderous war. In sofar as \nthe situation in Cyprus is concerned, the Government of Guinea \nencourages and supports all efforts at national reconciliation based \non dialogue between the Turkish and Greek communities and respect for \nterritorial integrity and for the unity of the Cypriot people.\nWith regard to the painful conflict between Iraq and the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, the Islamic Peace Committee continues to do all it \ncan. Despite the exacerbation of hostilities in recent days it will \ncontinue its efforts to reach a cease-fire and promote peaceful \nnegotiations between the two Moslem sister countries, which should by \nall rights be living in peace.\nPeace remains fragile or threatened in many parts of Asia. Peace is \nendangered in Korea because of the continued division of that country \nand foreign interference in the domestic affairs of the Korean \npeople. That people-in the North as in the South- seeks peace, \nindependence and reunification of the country, which should be one \nand indivisible. My delegation reiterates its appeal to the \ninternational community to lend continuing and resolute support to \nall efforts at a final peaceful settlement of the Korean question. We \nendorse the idea of turning the current armistice into a peace \nagreement and effecting the withdrawal of the foreign troops \nstationed in South Korea, under the aegis of the United Nations. The \nGovernment of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea approves \nthe conclusions contained in the Lome Declaration, adopted in June \n1982 at the African intergovernmental Conference in support of the \nreunification of Korea.\nIn Afghanistan and Kampuchea, violation of the fundamental principle \nof the Charter-non-interference in the domestic affairs of \nStates-which implies the inadmissibility of recourse to force in \nrelations among nations, is today creating tension and war. It is up \nto the people of Afghanistan alone to determine freely its domestic \nand external policies, without any pressure or interference.\nWith reference to Kampuchea, my delegation considers that a solution \nto this problem will emerge from the sincere adherence of all \ncitizens of that country, without exception, to a minimal programme. \nIn this connection, the legitimacy embodied by Prince Sihanouk is one \nof the components that must be taken into account.\nAlthough the guns have been stilled in the Falkland Islands \n(Malvinas), there is reason to fear that peace there remains fragile \nand at risk. Recent events in the South Atlantic prompt us to support \nthe idea of negotiations between Argentina and the United Kingdom, \nunder United Nations auspices, in search of a peaceful solution to \nthe question.\nThis rapid review of some of the problems affecting peace and \nstability in the world should serve to indicate that we are indeed \nliving in anxious and dangerous times, times when the spectre of the \napocalypse looming on the horizon troubles the peace of cities. At \nthe twelfth special session of the General Assembly President Ahmed \nSekou Toure said referring to the arms race \\\"Indeed, is there a \ndecent person who is not increasingly alarmed about the negative \nconsequences, already disastrous in many areas, of this frantic race \nbeing carried out at the expense of the lives of all the peoples of \nthe world? It is doubtful that such a person exists, for if he did \nthe internal light that God has given us would already have been \nextinguished. This is not a problem which concerns the nuclear Powers \nalone; rather, it is a whole set of concerns about which no statesman \nof our era can be indifferent. \\\"What actually is threatening peace? \nIt is the practice of colonialism, racism and apartheid hegemonism; \nthe downgrading of the fate of the so- called materially deprived \npeoples; the flouting of international laws which guarantee the right \nof every people to peace, security and progress.\\\" I should not like \nto give the impression that I have come to this rostrum to talk only \nabout political problems. The order designed, desired and maintained \nby those customarily called the \\\"great\\\" of this world persists and is \nbeing perpetuated. Because of that iniquitous order, the rich keep \ngetting richer, and the poor keep getting poorer. The disappointment \nof developing countries is justified in the light of the Declaration \non the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, acclaimed \nhere amid general enthusiasm-a new international economic order which \nshall correct inequalities and redress existing injustices, and \nensure steadily accelerating economic and social development for \npresent and future generations. We note with regret the lack of \npolitical will on the part of the industrialized countries to begin \nglobal negotiations. However, the many discussions between North and \nSouth, the various consultations held, and the adoption of Assembly \nresolution 34/138 had made it possible for the various parties to \nperceive a glimmer of hope in so far as the fortunate outcome of \nthose meetings was concerned. It now seems more indispensable than \never for the developing countries to promote a sound and viable \nco-operation among themselves. An open and frank South-South dialogue \nwould, we are convinced, make it possible for the developing \ncountries to reinforce their unity of action and to reaffirm their \ncommon determination to solve the many problems arising from the \nrequirements of integrated and endogenous development. The only \npossible way to ensure equality in North-South co-operation is to \nestablish fruitful relations of co-operation based on justice and the \nreciprocity of interests, with the United Nations as the framework \nfor negotiations. Above and beyond economic difficulties, our \ncountries in some cases have to contend with natural disasters, which \nremain the lot of the third world. In this connection, my delegation \nbelieves that the restoration of the Fouta-Djallon Massif in West \nAfrica would make it possible for that subregion of Africa to play \nits part as a regulator and supplier of water for West Africa and \nwould also make it possible to combat the problem of desertification \nand its many disastrous consequences. By giving massive aid for the \nimplementation of the Plan of Action to Combat Desertification in \nAfrica, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 34/185, the \ninternational community would be fulfilling its duty to act in \nsolidarity-indeed, to take preventive action-within the framework of \ninternational co-operation. We shall continue to repeat that, in our \nlegitimate desire to perfect the Organization and to make it possible \nfor the majority of Member States to play a full and responsible part \nin solving the serious problems that afflict the world, we consider \nit indispensable to begin to reform the structures of the United \nNations and its operations. As we said two years ago from this very \nrostrum, the vitality of any institution depends on its ability to \nadapt to the times and to events. We still believe that if we wish to \nmake international relations more democratic-and indeed we must do \nso-the democratization of the Organization is essential. We therefore \nreiterate our appeal that the Charter be revised so as to ensure \nequitable representation of all the regions of the world within the \ndiscussion and decision-making bodies. It would then be possible to \ngive the United Nations system the power to intervene effectively in \nthe settlement of conflicts by peaceful means and to promote a policy \nof balanced co-operation among nations on a footing of equality.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. Hollai, allow me to congratulate you on the occasion of your election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly and wish you full success in your most responsible task. We had the opportunity quite recently of complimenting the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, when he visited the Soviet Union and held important talks there. He received a deservedly warm welcome. A session of the General Assembly is a unique opportunity to review the international reality in all its diversity and to sense more profoundly what is of greatest concern to people on different continents. And, one becomes convinced once again that of the multitude of problems in today's world the main problem, the one that stands out, is that of averting the threat of nuclear war. Virtually everyone agrees that world developments have been evolving in an alarming way. People are asking themselves whether the insane arms race can be halted and the slipping towards the abyss prevented. What should be done to counter the policies of those who are playing out various scenarios of nuclear war as if it were some kind of a game of chance rather than a matter that affects the destinies of mankind?\nThose are legitimate questions. The Soviet Union is firmly convinced that peace, which is of the greatest universal value, can and must be preserved; and it must be a just peace, worthy of those heights which civilization on earth has attained. We draw this conviction from history itself, which contains many a tragic page but also examples of brilliantly devised solutions to the most acute international problems. Let us recall how the Charter, which is a universally recognized code of rules that must govern relations between States, came into being. The establishment of this Organization and the Charter crystallized, as it were, the experience of the struggle against and the great victory over fascism. At that time the hope was held out to the world that it would be possible to avert another global tragedy. For almost 40 years now, that hope has been a reality. Now let us look at the changes in international relations brought about in the 1970s, when the peoples of the world were given an opportunity to breathe the air of detente. Surely the differences in social systems and ideologies or in the world outlook were no less then than they are today. But even taking these differences fully into account, States and the leaders who guided their policies did find ways leading to constructive relations between nations. This constant in the experience of peaceful coexistence has taken root in the minds of peoples and in the fabric of inter-State relations, and it is not easy to discard. The urge to give orders to other countries, to dominate the world, must not be allowed to overshadow the experience of the past or muffle the voice of reason.\n\tThe Soviet people reject the gloomy view that mankind has no other path to follow than building up piles of armaments and preparing for war. It would be a mistake to underestimate the rising menace of war. But it is an even greater mistake to fail to see that possibilities do exist for putting up an insurmountable barrier against war. The Soviet Union and the Soviet people are placing all their political and moral potential and all the prestige of their policy on to the scales of peace. This is surely demonstrated by the obligation unilaterally assumed by the Soviet Union not to be the first to use nuclear weapons, an obligation solemnly stated in the message of Leonid Brezhnev at the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament the twelfth special session [12th meeting]. That was an act of historic importance and it was seen as such throughout the world. Is it not time for our Western partners, the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO], to assess in earnest the opportunities opened up by the Soviet Union's initiative? We expect them to weigh it carefully once again. In seeking to minimize the importance of the Soviet Union's peace initiatives, many Western leaders speak of the need for trust in relations between States. But how would that purpose best be served? It would be best served by renouncing preparations for war, the policy of the arms race and of whipping up world tensions. Why do they not assume the obligation, as the Soviet Union has done, not to be the first to use nuclear weapons? It is sometimes said that it is not merely a question of nuclear weapons alone, for there are conventional weapons as well. Yes, there are. But there is a convincing reply to that, too: we insist that all States assume an obligation to renounce any use or threat of force in their relations. As far back as 1976 the Soviet Union proposed that a world treaty be concluded on the non-use of force in international relations and it submitted a draft treaty to the General Assembly for its consideration. \nThe draft treaty expressly provides that States would refrain from the use of force involving any types of weapons \u2014 and I emphasize, any types of weapons. It would be a good idea to inscribe this on the doors of every agency in Washington that is concerned with United States foreign policy. We note with satisfaction that the initiative concerning the non-use of force was endorsed by the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations. Indeed, the Special Committee on Enhancing the Effectiveness of the Principle of Non-Use of Force in International Relations was even established to draft such a treaty. Why, then has no such treaty been worked out? Because State members of NATO are thwarting it. Can the situation be remedied now? Yes, it can. The Soviet Union is prepared even today to come to the negotiating table in order to formalize strict obligations not to use force in settling disputes and differences which exist between States. No one would venture to deny that quite a few such disputes and differences have accumulated. But there are no problems among them that would not lend themselves to peaceful solutions. There are none in any part of the world or in any area of world politics \u2014 if, of course, one is motivated by the objectives of peace. It has to be noted, however, that the United States of America has chosen a different policy for itself. The essence of this policy is the desire to impose its will upon other States and peoples. That desire underlies all plans for the production of weapons and underlies United States foreign policy. \nThe Soviet Union has repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that such a policy poses a serious threat to peace. The objective of gaining an edge in armaments has been openly proclaimed in the United States. The idea that it has to be number one militarily has become something of an obsession. Huge sums are being allocated for building up the United States war machine and the pyramid of weapons is getting higher and higher. In the mean time there is continuously at work an assembly line fabricating all kinds of falsehoods about the Soviet Union's armed forces and its foreign policy. People are being deliberately misled. Why is all this being done? Simply because in an atmosphere of lies, hysteria and chauvinistic intoxication it is easier to get astronomical military budgets approved; it is easier to divert the country's resources to war preparations and away from peaceful purposes such as eliminating unemployment and fighting inflation, away from using them for the benefit of people, which is what the Soviet Union is calling for. There is no dearth of versions of nuclear war being planned by the apostles of the arms race: a blitzkrieg, a protracted war, a limited war, an all-out war. Every conceivable and inconceivable definition is being put into circulation. With the cold-blooded composure of grave diggers, they are speculating on the number of casualties each side would sustain in a nuclear catastrophe. They deliberately hush up the fact that if a nuclear war were to break out under present conditions, there would be no winners, and few people today would disagree with that. \nThe Soviet Union has, on a number of occasions, including the sessions of the General Assembly, pointed to the dangerous nature of Washington's course aimed at upsetting the military equilibrium which has evolved between the USSR and the United States of America, and on the whole, between the Warsaw Treaty Organization and NATO. Everywhere, on land and on sea, the United States is seeking to impose or strengthen its military presence and to set up new bases. Look at the bloody orgy that is taking place in the Middle East where a frantic search is under way for new clients to be harnessed to the Pentagon's militaristic strategy. It should, of course, be clear that the Soviet Union does not recognize anyone's fight to military superiority. And it will see to it that that does not happen. One of the principles recognized by the United Nations is non-interference by States in the Internal affairs of other States. It has been reiterated many times in United Nations decisions. However, the world is witnessing today a flagrant flouting of this principle. Who, we might well ask, has given Washington the right to tell sovereign States what they should and what they should not do in their own house? Who has given it the right to try to punish those who cherish their sovereignty and would not yield to pressure, to apply all kinds of sanctions, to impose economic blockades, and even to brandish arms? From what some say, it would appear that United States interests are being endangered almost everywhere in the world. This is an absurd thesis. Yet it is being used to justify crude interference in the affairs of others, used on a sweeping geographic scale, as regards both nearby countries and those situated many thousands of kilometres away from the United States. The Soviet Union has never permitted, nor will it ever allow, anybody to interfere in its internal affairs. This is the stand of the States of the socialist community, as well as of other countries which respect their independence and their legitimate rights. \nI should like to express the hope that no calls for outside interference in the affairs of other sovereign States will be made from this rostrum either. Otherwise, this high rostrum will cease to be what it is intended to be. And may the United Nations emblem, which is before the eyes of all those present in this Hall, serve as a warning to those who fail to distinguish between what is theirs and what belongs to others. No review of the international scene can overlook the situation taking shape in some regions of the world. In the first place, attention is riveted on the Middle East, for this session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when ashes have not yet settled in the streets of the ruthlessly destroyed ancient city of Beirut and when the blood of tens of thousands of victims of aggression has not yet been completely absorbed by the soil. An honest people all over the world feel outrage and disgust over the orgy of bloodshed staged by the aggressors in the Palestinian camps in west Beirut where defenceless Palestinians, mostly women, children and old people, were massacred. Could Israel commit aggression and perpetrate genocide against the Palestinians but for its so-called \\\"strategic consensus\\\" with the United States? As far as one can judge, in Israel they are now rubbing their hands gleefully. But this is what is called a Pyrrhic victory. The aggression was bound to turn, and has in fact turned, into a serious political and moral defeat for Israel. The rift between Israel and its neighbours has widened. New seeds of hatred and animosity have been sown, and they can bear the grapes of wrath. Those who determine Israel's policies seem to give little thought to the future of their country. And that is too bad, indeed. They are clearly hampered by chauvinistic intoxication. \nThe root cause of the Lebanese tragedy lies in Camp David. It should be clear now to every unbiased person that separate anti-Arab deals only put off the establishment of a just peace in the Middle East. The aggressor and its accomplices say that Camp David means peace. Such an assertion makes a mockery of the profound, humane and noble idea of peace. What kind of peace it makes is evident from the fact that more blood has been shed since Camp David than during the Israeli aggression in 1967. Washington's recent statements, which it is serving up as a Middle East settlement plan, confirm that they are still thinking there in terms of diktat and enmity with regard to the Arabs, rather than in terms of peace. The overwhelming majority of States hold it as a political axiom that there can be no durable peace in the Middle East unless the question of an independent Palestinian State is resolved. The Washington plan, however, states explicitly that the United States is against the creation of such a State. It is widely accepted and recorded in United Nations decisions that the problem of fulfilling the national aspirations of the Palestinians cannot be solved without the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], whereas the American plan makes no mention at all of the PLO as a party to the settlement. In fact, Washington also fully evades such a fundamental matter as Israel's withdrawal from all the Arab territories seized by it. \nAll decisions taken by the United Nations proceed from the premise that genuine security in the Middle East can only be such as would be common to all States and peoples in that region. The so-called Washington initiative focuses everything on the security of Israel alone, and its interests are made paramount, with the United States itself, naturally, maintaining its arrogant and unjustified claims to a leading role in Middle East affairs. We regard positively the views on a Middle East settlement expressed at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez. On the whole these views are on the same lines as those of the Soviet Union regarding a Middle East settlement. \nAs Leonid Brezhnev has recently stressed once again, a just and durable peace in the Middle East can and must be based on the following principles. First, the principle of the inadmissibility of seizure of foreign lands through aggression must be strictly observed. That means that all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 the Golan Heights, the West Bank of the Jordan river and the Gaza Strip, the Lebanese lands must be returned to the Arabs. The borders between Israel and its Arab neighbours should be declared inviolable. Secondly, the inalienable right of the Arab people of Palestine to self-determination and to the establishment of its own independent State on the Palestinian lands which will be freed from the Israeli occupation on the West Bank of the Jordan river and in the Gaza Strip must be ensured in practice. Palestinian refugees must be given the possibility envisaged in United Nations decisions to return to their homes or be given appropriate compensation for the property they left behind. \nI ask the following in this connection: has anybody annulled the decision adopted by the United Nations in 1947, which envisages the establishment in the former mandated territory of Palestine of two sovereign States an Arab State and a Jewish State? Nobody has annulled it. Then what are the grounds for talking about the legitimate existence of the Jewish State alone, while impeding in every way the establishment of the other, Arab, State for over three and a half decades? There have been no such grounds, nor are there any now. Thirdly, the eastern part of Jerusalem, which was occupied by Israel in 1967, where one of the main Moslem shrines is located, must be returned to the Arabs and become an inseparable part of the Palestinian State. Freedom of access by believers to the holy places of the three religions must be ensured throughout Jerusalem. Fourthly, the right of all States in the region to a safe and independent existence and development must be ensured, naturally on the condition of full reciprocity, for the security of some cannot be ensured by flouting the security of others. Fifthly, the state of war between the Arab States and Israel must be terminated and peace between them must be established. That means that all parties to the conflict, including Israel and the Palestinian State, must assume an obligation reciprocally to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of each other and to settle the disputes that may arise by peaceful means through negotiations. Sixthly, international guarantees of the settlement must be worked out and adopted. The role of the guarantor could be assumed by, say, the permanent members of the Security Council or by the Security Council as a whole. The path to a durable peace in the Middle East lies through collective efforts by all the parties concerned, including the PLO, and the best way towards this end is to convene an appropriate international conference. \nFor almost two years now bloody hostilities have been going on between Iran and Iraq. This is a senseless war from the point of view of the vital interests of the peoples of the two countries. This conflict is also fraught with grave consequences. The fire should be put out before it spreads farther. The most reasonable thing to do would probably be for Iran and Iraq to put aside arms, to slip covers over the muzzles of their guns and to settle their differences at the negotiating table. \nThe Soviet Union has invariably come out in favour of putting an end to the war between the two States, with which our country has maintained traditional ties, and it is doing all in its power to bring that about. We expect that other major Powers will abandon attempts to take advantage of the conflict. Dangerous scheming is still going on around the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The foes of the Afghan people, including those who flaunt their commitment to democracy, are trying to hinder the building of a new and truly democratic life in that country. While in words a political solution to the problems which have arisen around Afghanistan is being advocated, in deeds the achievement of such a solution is being impeded in every possible way. Opportunities for such a solution do exist. They are embodied in the constructive proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, which the Soviet Union fully supports. Only one thing is required, and that is to stop the armed intervention from outside against Afghanistan and not interfere in the internal affairs of that sovereign non-aligned State. In the Soviet Union we view as a step in the right direction the start of negotiations in Geneva between representatives of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and Pakistan through a personal representative of the Secretary-General. We fully understand the legitimate concern of the coastal States of the Indian Ocean over the expansion there of the United States military presence. \nOne can literally watch it grow, posing a threat also to the security of the USSR from the south. We cannot but draw our own conclusions from this. The Soviet Union endorses the idea put forward by the non-aligned countries to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. If it were not for the attempts by certain Powers, above all the United States of America, to frustrate implementation of General Assembly resolution 34/80 B on this matter, an international conference which could be of tangible benefit to the whole of that vast region would have been convened long ago. Even now, without waiting for the conference to be convened, we call upon all the States whose ships use the waters of the Indian Ocean to refrain from any steps that could complicate the situation in that region. This means not sending there large naval formations, not conducting military exercises and not expanding of modernizing military bases of those non-coastal States which possess such bases in the Indian Ocean. One example of the way in which States with different social systems can fruitfully co-operate to mutual advantage and in the interests of universal peace can be seen in Soviet-Indian relations. This co-operation is a concrete and impressive contribution to the cause of security on the South Asian subcontinent and in the international arena as a whole. A new and powerful impulse has been given to it by the results of the recent talks in Moscow between Leonid Brezhnev and the Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi. \nIn another part of the Asian continent, South-East Asia, the Soviet Union supports the efforts aimed at turning that region into a zone of peace. A series of initiatives put forward jointly by Viet Nam, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Kampuchea opens up prospects for both deepening the dialogue between them and the member ; of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] and in general normalizing the situation in the area. These initiatives have been reaffirmed by such a display of goodwill as the partial withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea. The peoples of Viet Nam, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Kampuchea have chosen their own road of social development. In their march along that road they are repelling those forces which are seeking to prevent them from building a new life. The USSR resolutely sides with those States. It is rendering and will continue to render them necessary assistance and support. The Soviet Union is prepared to seek, together with all the Far Eastern States, ways of enhancing the security of that region. Not so long ago we proposed that the time-tested experience gained in carrying out certain measures to build mutual confidence in Europe be considered from the point of view of its application to the Far East. The Soviet Union is ready to discuss this matter in a practical vein with the participation of the People's Republic of China and Japan. For decades now the situation on the Korean peninsula has not been normalized, which increases tensions in the Far East. The Korean problem can and must be settled by peaceful means without any outside interference, as is proposed by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Socialist countries are taking the initiative in strengthening security on a scale embracing the entire Asian continent. This is the intent of the proposal made by the Mongolian People's Republic for the conclusion of a convention on mutual non-aggression and non-use of force in relations between the Asian and Pacific States.\n The Soviet Union supports this useful initiative. When a centre of tension appears in some part of the globe there can be no doubt that it is caused by the actions of those who have no regard for the legitimate interests of others. Not infrequently they are inspired by attempts to retain by force positions inherited from the colonial past. One case in point is the South Atlantic. It is to be hoped that the peoples have drawn appropriate conclusions from the recent events in that region. The Soviet Union has on a number of occasions publicly stated its position that a just settlement of the problem that has arisen there can be achieved through negotiations within the United Nations framework and on the basis of United Nations decisions. That continues to be our position today. Another case in point is southern Africa, where the South African racist regime, with the connivance of Western Powers, is actually waging an undeclared war against Angola and some other States of the region. Pretoria has been blatantly defying United Nations decisions on the granting of independence to Namibia. There is no doubt, however, that the Namibian people will attain freedom and independence. \nStill another case in point is the region of Central America and the Caribbean, where a campaign of pressure and threats is going on unabated against Cuba and Nicaragua, whose only fault is that they want to live according to their own standards. Attempts are being made to portray them as the trouble-makers in that region. Those are attempts made in bad faith. Together with other peoples and States of the Caribbean, Cuba and Nicaragua are in favour of turning it into a zone of peace, independence and development, and the Soviet Union has full sympathy for this goal. Is there anyone who does not know whose advisers and instructors, both uniformed and other-wise, are now in El Salvador, and who rules the roost there, trying to prop up the corrupt and unpopular regime? The USSR has opposed and will continue to oppose such actions. The sympathy and support of the Soviet people are entirely on the side of all the peoples fighting for their freedom and for national and social progress. \nIf there was any lack of evidence that the peoples and States consider the continuing arms race to be one of the most critical issues of our time, the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament has provided such evidence in abundance. Ardent appeals to avert nuclear war and halt the arms race were voiced from its rostrum. The Assembly failed to reach agreement at that session on concrete steps in this field, and it is well known who is responsible for that. Still, the determination of the overwhelming majority of States to ensure peace and achieve disarmament was expressed in no uncertain terms. At that session the Soviet Union submitted a detailed programme of measures to curb the arms race, ranging from nuclear and chemical weapons to limiting conventional weapons and naval activities of States. As has been repeatedly emphasized by Leonid Brezhnev, there is no type of weapon which our country would not be prepared to limit or ban on the basis of reciprocity. And if the accumulation of arms is not only continuing but accelerating, if this tragic competition is proceeding at a pace that leaves behind accords on arms limitation, and if the agreements already reached in this field are called into question, all this is the direct result of the United States policy aimed at building up its military muscle. It makes no secret of this policy line; indeed, it is bragging about it. \nTo take a problem such as the limitation and reduction of strategic arms, that is, the most destructive weapons, the problem which is of utmost importance under present-day conditions, there had been many delays on the part of our partners before the Soviet-American talks started. Undoubtedly, the fact that they are being held is in itself of positive significance. But Chat alone is not enough. What is required is the desire on both sides to seek agreement. Without going into the details of the talks, it should, however, be emphasized that so far the other side has failed to show the desire to come to agreement. Surely one cannot take for such a desire the attempt to single out from the totality of weapons possessed by the USSR and the United States only those types of weapons in this particular case land- based missiles which constitute the backbone of the Soviet Union's strategic potential, and to make them alone the subject of reduction, leaving out all the rest, that is, submarine-launched missiles, strategic bombers and cruise missiles, where the United States preponderance is obvious. Certainly this lopsided approach promises no hope for the success of the negotiations. The principle of the equality and equal security of the sides must remain their unshakable foundation. Accuracy, science, balance of parameters, together with a careful evaluation of all elements of the problem \u2014 all these must be taken into account. There must be no room for deception, guile or juggling with facts, either in large or in small doses. It should be recalled that the Soviet Union has put forward an important proposal, namely, to agree to freeze the strategic armaments of the USSR and the United States quantitatively as soon as the talks begin, and at the same time to restrict their modernization to the utmost. We have proposed that for the duration of the talks the sides should take no actions that might upset the stability of the strategic situation. That is our concrete response to the mounting feeling in many countries of the world in favour of a freeze on the existing levels of nuclear arms, to be followed by their drastic reduction, which is advocated by the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, those who are conducting negotiations with us on this problem shudder at the mere words \\\"a freeze on arms\\\". \nWhat has actually been frozen on their side, and quite deeply at that, is the realization that the talks must be frank, in good faith and free from any lopsidedness. What is the state of affairs at the Soviet-American talks on the limitation of nuclear arms in Europe? Sometimes encouraging statements are heard from the United States side in this respect. But this is an assumed optimism. The so-called zero option \u2014 or, to be more precise, pseudo-zero option proposed by the United States does not offer a solution to the problem. It provides for the elimination only of Soviet land-based missiles, including those which the Soviet Union has possessed for over 20 years now. As to the medium-range nuclear forces of NATO, they are not to be subject to reduction by a single unit and can even be built up. We have no doubt that Washington realizes that the Soviet side would not agree to a one-sided solution that would run counter to the security interests of the USSR and its allies. Therefore, what is doubtful is whether Washington is really seeking an agreement. \nThe Soviet Union's desire to come to agreement with the United States is buttressed by practical steps. As is well known, it has unilaterally discontinued further deployment of medium-range missiles in the European part of the USSR. And, what is more, ii is carrying out the reduction of a part of that force. Finally, we are not stationing any additional medium- range missiles beyond the Urals, from where Western Europe would be within their reach. The Soviet Union has faithfully kept its word in this matter too. Throughout the post-war period, since the emergence of the first atom bombs, the Soviet Union has been persistently seeking approaches to putting an end to the nuclear arms race. At that time it was much easier to ban the atomic weapon than it is nowadays, when there exists a huge arsenal of nuclear armaments. But even today this problem can be resolved. Mankind has no other reasonable option but to reduce the nuclear threat gradually though consistently, step by step, and ultimately eliminate it. In this context, it is extremely important to erect a barrier against the development of ever new types and systems of nuclear weapons a process which tends to destabilize the strategic situation for it entails the emergence of weapons which, because of their characteristics, would hardly lend themselves to verification. If this is so, the working out of relevant international agreements on their limitation and reduction is becoming more difficult. That is the reason why it is becoming increasingly urgent to stop nuclear-weapons tests and to erect a tangible physical barrier to the development of ever new kinds of nuclear weapons and thus slow down the arms race. The States of the world, with very few exceptions, demand a ban on all nuclear-weapon test explosions in all environments and for all times. Their will was reflected in a series of decisions adopted at the United Nations. \nMoreover, when signing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, all the parties to it, including the United States, undertook to do away with nuclear-weapon tests for good. In our view, it is the direct responsibility of the United Nations to demand that all countries, and the nuclear Powers in the first place, do their utmost to achieve that goal. As a nuclear Power, the Soviet Union declares that for its part, it is ready to do that. We propose the inclusion in the agenda of this session of an important and urgent item entitled \\\"Immediate cessation and prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests\\\". What is proposed specifically? It is proposed to speed up the working out and signing of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear- weapon tests and to put the talks on that subject in the Committee on Disarmament on a practical footing. The Soviet Union is submitting to the Assembly for its consideration \\\"Basic provisions of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear- weapon tests\\\" [see A/371243], a document which takes into account the measure of agreement reached during the discussion of that problem in recent years. It also takes into account the views and suggestions advanced by many States, inter alia on questions of verification. In order to create more favourable conditions for the elaboration of the treaty, we propose that all nuclear-weapon States declare a moratorium on all nuclear explosions, including peaceful ones, as of a date to be agreed upon among them. Such a moratorium would be effective pending the inclusion of the treaty. \nIn the context of the problem of the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests, I wish to single out two more aspects of importance. First, the Soviet Union is prepared at any time to ratify \u2014 on a reciprocal basis \u2014 the treaties concluded with the United States on the limitation of underground nuclear-weapon tests and on nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. Secondly, we are in favour of the resumption of the trilateral talks between the USSR, the United States and the United Kingdom. Those talks were under way. Then they were broken off, and it is public knowledge who was responsible for that. In the context of the struggle to lessen the nuclear threat, there is still another important problem to which the Soviet Union would like to draw the Assembly's attention. The number of non-military nuclear facilities, above all power installations, is increasing in various countries. This is an inevitable process, which is bound to grow in scope in the future. However, intentional destruction, even with the help of conventional weapons, of atomic power plants, research reactors and other similar installations might cause the release and dissemination of a huge amount of radioactive substances, which would have fatal consequences for the population. In other words, it would be tantamount in its effect to a nuclear explosion. \nAs calculated by experts, the consequences of the destruction of a large atomic power plant are comparable to the radioactive contamination occurring after the explosion of a one-megaton nuclear bomb. Therefore, the need for ensuring a safe development of nuclear energy is closely linked with the task of preventing the unleashing of nuclear war. Being desirous of lessening the nuclear threat in this area, too, the Soviet Union proposes the inclusion in the agenda of this session of an urgent item entitled \\\"Multiplying efforts to eliminate the threat of nuclear war and to ensure a safe development of nuclear energy\\\". \nThe Soviet Union proposes that the General Assembly declare the destruction of peaceful nuclear facilities with conventional weapons equivalent to an attack involving the use of nuclear weapons that is to say, it should equate such destruction with those actions which the United Nations has already qualified as the gravest crime against humanity. The question of a speedy elimination of chemical weapons presents itself in all its magnitude. This weapon is one of the means of mass annihilation. The unrestrained build-up of chemical weapons in the West, far from enhancing anybody's security, is only aggravating the risk of military conflicts with the use of these lethal weapons. The Soviet Union has consistently been advocating the exclusion of chemical weapons from the arsenals of States. The relevant proposals submitted by it have been referred to the Committee on Disarmament. We hope that its members will proceed, with all due sense of responsibility, to the elaboration of an international convention on the prohibition and elimination of these barbaric weapons. There is an increasing danger that the arms race will acquire a qualitatively new dimension unless the necessary measures are urgently taken. Washington is now planning a military thrust into outer space. We are convinced that the arms race must not be permitted to spread into the boundless expanses of outer space. The United Nations can and must play its part in this respect. \nFor a number of years now the Soviet Union has been seeking the conclusion of an international treaty prohibiting the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space. The expanses of outer space should be an area only for the peaceful co-operation of States. A separate question and a major one is the reduction of conventional armaments and of the numerical strength of armed forces. The Soviet Union wishes to see this problem, too, firmly integrated into the fabric of international negotiations and agreements. In relation to Central Europe, these problems are under discussion at the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces, Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. For nine years now, these talks have been, figuratively speaking, marking time, and the time to find agreements that would ameliorate the situation in an area with the highest concentration of the opposing armies is long overdue. \nThe Soviet Union and its Warsaw Treaty allies are doing their utmost to achieve that. It is a favourite allegation in the West that the Warsaw Treaty countries are superior to NATO in terms of conventional armaments in Europe. Yet at the Vienna talks the socialist countries are proposing to establish for both sides equal levels of armed forces stationed in Central Europe. Unfortunately, the conduct of our Western partners in the negotiations is not conducive to reaching such an agreement. Although some rouge, figuratively speaking, has recently been applied to their position, the essence has remained unchanged. So what is left of the so-called concern of the Western countries regarding the alleged superiority of the Warsaw Treaty over NATO? And what is worse, steps are being taken out-side the framework of the talks, which can only be described as provocative. What is there to say, for instance, about the recent agreements between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States concerning the bringing from overseas of additional contingents of American troops under far-fetched pretexts? In other words, instead of reducing forces in that region, conditions are being prepared for increasing them by several more divisions. That is, of course, a mockery of common sense. \nThe same applies to the planned redeployment of United States military units to the immediate vicinity of the borders of the German Democratic Republic. In Europe, as well as on other continents, the Soviet Union is countering the policy of confrontation with the policy of good-neighbourliness and co-operation. We understand and appreciate the desire of the Europeans to follow the path opened up by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. There exists a possibility of further progress towards making Europe a continent of peace and stability. The attainment of this goal would be largely facilitated by the implementation of the idea of convening a conference on confidence-building measures and disarmament in Europe. That is one of the principal issues at the Madrid meeting of the States participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. If all its participants adopt a constructive approach at its resumed session in November, general agreement could be reached both with regard to the convening of the conference and to ensuring the success of the Madrid meeting. Seeking to alleviate tension throughout the world, we have recently proposed that the decision-making bodies of NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization make declarations on the non-extension of the sphere of action of the two military and political groupings to Asia, Africa and Latin America. That would constitute a major step towards detente. \nAll the members of the Warsaw Treaty support this proposal. We hope that the NATO countries will study this proposal and respond to it in a positive manner.\tIn recent years serious obstacles have emerged in restructuring international economic relations on a democratic and equal basis. The root cause lies in the policies of certain Western Powers aimed at keeping the developing countries in an unequal position, at facilitating the attempts of the monopoly capital to exercise its sway over those countries. A recent vivid example of that is the attitude of some Western Powers to the enormous work accomplished by States in preparing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Many years of effort have produced a document whose provisions do not prejudice anybody's interests. And what has become of it? The United States is hampering the adoption of that convention. We would like to express the hope that it will stop being in opposition to a vast majority of States and will adhere to the convention.\n\tThe USSR is in favour of democratization of both political and economic relations between States. As to our participation in rendering assistance to the newly freed States in overcoming their economic backwardness, in this respect to the Soviet Union is doing at least as much if not more than any of the developed capitalist countries. It is common knowledge that the foreign policy course of any State is an extension of its domestic policy. Our country sets itself economic and social tasks of vast magnitude. We need peace to accomplish them. The Soviet Union is extending its hand to every State which, for its part, is willing to maintain and develop good relations with us. That applies to Europe. We are prepared for a further expansion of co-operation with Western European countries on a peaceful and mutually beneficial basis. That applies to Asia, where the Soviet Union has long-standing and stable ties with many States. That applies to Latin America, where normal, business like relations are being established between the USSR and a number of countries, including Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. The same applies to the United States of America. We are convinced that from the viewpoint of a long-term policy of principle the deterioration of relations between the USSR and the United States is not in the interests of the United States itself. The American people is hardly different from other peoples as far as the desire to live in peace is concerned. Our country has on several occasions pronounced itself - in particular at the Congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and at the USSR Supreme Soviet \u2014 in favour of developing normal relations with the United States. The policy of the Soviet Government aimed at preserving and strengthening peace and preventing another war is endorsed by all Soviet people, since all they aspire to is a peaceful \u2014 and only peaceful \u2014 future. At the end of this year the Soviet people will mark an important event the sixtieth anniversary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The Land of the Soviets is invariably faithful to the peaceful behests of the founder of our State, V. I. Lenin. As Leonid Brezhnev has recently stressed once again, \\\"concern for peace is paramount in the policy of the Soviet Union\\\". This concern determines the fundamental direction of all foreign policy activities of the Soviet State, which are based on the Programme of Peace for the 1980s adopted by the twenty-sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This Programme is being implemented by the Soviet Union together with other countries of the socialist community, cemented together as they are by a common political system and world outlook, by the identity of goals and ideals. \nAll the activities of socialist countries convincingly prove that peace is their policy aim. Every step, every foreign policy move made by them, serves the attainment of that noble goal. The Soviet Union has rebuffed and will continue to rebuff policies based on the cult of force. Those who come out for preventing a nuclear disaster and for strengthening peace can always count on its support and co-operation. All our actions in the international arena will continue to be inspired by our deep-held belief in the necessity and the possibility of saving the present and succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\n"

        "file_text": "I take great pleasure in congratulating, on behalf of my delegation, \nthe President on his election to preside over this thirty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. We are convinced that his qualities \nas an experienced diplomat and his deep faith in the principles and \npurposes of the Charter will enable him to direct the work of the \nAssembly successfully. I should also like to pay tribute to the \nPresident's predecessor, Mr. Kittani, of the fraternal country of \nIraq, for the outstanding way in which he led the work of the last \nregular session as well as of the special sessions. I also take great \npleasure in paying a particular tribute to the Secretary-General for \nhis constant efforts to promote international peace and security. My \ndelegation is pleased to express to him its appreciation of his \nstruggle to preserve the principles of the Charter and to strengthen \ninternational solidarity for the progress and development of mankind.\n\n229.\tThe thirty-seventh session of the general Assembly is being \nheld at a time when the international situation is steadily \ndeteriorating. The harmful world conditions that we are experiencing \nencourage the super-Powers to acquire zones of influence and make \ntheir rivalries ever sharper. The super-Powers are using their \neconomic, scientific and technological advances to achieve their \nobjectives and designs.\n\n230.\tIn this atmosphere of constant tension we remain concerned \nand alarmed at the escalation of tension which is creating several \nflashpoints in many parts of the world, especially in the third world.\n\n231.\tIn spite of the constant efforts of the international \ncommunity in the quest for peace, we are every day confronted with \nincreasingly sophisticated wars, wars of attrition and of the \nannihilation of nations. Never before in history have there been so \nmany wars in third world countries, with such great human, financial \nand material losses. It is as if by some master plan they are \nintended to exchange the natural resources of developing countries \nand prevent them achieving their economic take-off.\n\n232.\tIt is an act of treason towards that part of mankind living \nin wretched circumstances to tolerate the useless waste of incredible \nquantities of financial, scientific, technological and human \nresources, when two thirds of the world's population are doomed to \nlive in dire poverty, suffering grave economic difficulties and \nsocial imbalance. Moreover, there are a large number of refugees on \nall the continents, half of them in Africa. Those refugees often come \nto an environment where they still have to struggle to satisfy their \nmost basic needs-food, medical care and shelter.\n\n233.\tWhat human wisdom can allow for such waste, whose only \npurpose is the destruction of all the best that world civilization \nhas been producing for the good of mankind? We cannot separate acts \nleading to the waste of such immense human and material wealth from \nthose which are delaying the establishment of a new international \neconomic order.\n\n234.\tInternational economic relations are experiencing in our time \na grave crisis, which is becoming an obstacle in negotiations between \nthe rich and poor countries, a number of which-the least developed \ncountries-are living in precarious conditions. It is up to us to \nexchange new ideas and co-ordinate our efforts with a view to \nstriving together towards a better life.\n\n235.\tAfter eight years of hard work the Third United Nations \nConference on the Law of the Sea achieved its objective. The adoption \nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea constitutes a \nland-mark in the history of mankind. The success of the Conference \nhas enhanced the prestige and credibility of the United Nations, \nwhich can be an effective framework for dealing with all questions of \nvital importance to all States and the international community.\n\n236.\tThe political climate and security in the Indian Ocean area \nhas gravely deteriorated recently. The littoral and hinterland States \nare worried about the increase in tension in the area, as a result of \nthe rivalries of the great Powers. There is an extremely urgent need \nto implement the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, \npursuant to resolution 2832 (XXVI) of 12 December 1971. The situation \nof insecurity and instability prevailing in the Indian Ocean requires \nthe speedy holding of the relevant conference in Colombo.\n\n237.\tSince its independence the Republic of Djibouti has expressed \nits devotion to international peace and security. The objectives that \nit has set itself are national unity, equality and peace.\n\n238.\tIn accordance with our foreign policy, based on dialogue and \nco-operation, we have chosen to live in peace with our neighbours, \nwith absolutely no interference or intervention. Our neutrality is \nreflected by a policy of non-alignment, good-neighbourliness and \npeaceful coexistence. We urge our neighbours to settle any disputes \npeacefully, for we remain convinced that peace and stability alone \ncan guarantee the emancipation of peoples. Moreover, we urge all \nleaders in the Horn of Africa to struggle for the creation of the \nright circumstances to foster tolerance, understanding and confidence \namong the peoples of the region.\n\n239.\tWe attach great importance to regional and interregional \neconomic co-operation, and we are prepared to take an effective part \nin those efforts, in accordance with the Lagos Plan of Action for the \nImplementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Development of \nAfrica' and the Charter of National Economic Action, adopted at Amman.\n\n240.\tIn spite of its economic difficulties and its meagre \nresources, the Republic of Djibouti takes in a considerable number of \nrefugees. The situation has worsened because of the devastating \nconsequences of a prolonged drought, which has displaced a third of \nour population who have lost all means of subsistence.\n\n241.\tThe Republic of Djibouti has embarked on comprehensive \nprogrammes of revitalization and modernization of existing sectors of \nthe service economy as well as on the creation of a sound basis for a \nproductive, diversified economy through the development of new \nsectors in industry, agriculture, animal husbandry and fisheries.\n\n242.\tMy Government, which has decided to use every means available \nto extricate itself from its socioeconomic difficulties, appreciates \nthe assistance and aid of friendly countries to help in achieving \nthose objectives.\n\n243.\tAfter 34 years of bloody wars, 34 years of sacrifices, 34 \nyears of tireless and uninterrupted efforts, the international \ncommunity has just reaffirmed its support for the Palestinian cause, \nby declaring that no just and lasting solution can be achieved \nwithout recognition of the legitimate, inalienable rights of the \nPalestinian people. It is with that in view that concrete proposals \nfor an overall peaceful solution have been formulated.\n\n244.\tUnfortunately these peace efforts are still pitted against \nthe political ambitions of the Zionists, who wish to relegate the \nPalestinian cause to historical oblivion so as to promote their \nexpansionist policy. The Zionists do not wish to accept or tolerate \nany talk of national rights for Palestinians; they wished to bury the \nnatural aspirations of an entire people under the ruins of Beirut. In \norder to do that the Zionist war-lords unleashed the most devastating \nand the most bloody aggression against Lebanon, using the most \nsophisticated weaponry, with the avowed intention of annihilating the \nPalestinian people, of liquidating the PLO and destroying its \norganizational structure.\n\n245.\tFor more than two months Lebanon has been subjected to the \nmost merciless destruction. Beirut, besieged, deprived of water, \nfood, electricity and medicines, constantly bombarded from land, air \nand sea, has undergone an ordeal which no city has experienced since \nthe Second World War.\n\n246.\tDuring the first half of this century the Nazis, in their \nwanton campaign for racial superiority, arrogated to themselves the \nright to determine who should live and who should be deprived of \nlife. They institutionalized terror and mass killing as means of \nachieving that goall.\n\n247.\tIn the second half of this century the Zionist neo-Nazis have \nespoused a similar concept, although more limited in scope. They wish \nto eliminate the Palestinian people from the land where they have \nalways lived. For the Zionists, Palestine was a land without any \npeople awaiting the arrival of Jewish settlers to colonize it. \nHistory has been falsified; the physical characteristics, the \ndemographic composition and the institutional structures of the \noccupied territories are being altered so as finally to leave no \ntrace of the Palestinian heritage.\n\n248.\tIn spite of that and in defiance of the aims of the Zionist \nplan, the Palestinian reality asserts itself more each day, because \nthe Palestinian people, under the aegis of the PLO, its sole, \nlegitimate representative, has shown its unshakable determination to \nstruggle for the life of its cause.\n\n249.\tStrengthened by that determination, Arab Kings, Sovereigns \nand heads of State were at one in making it crystal clear to the \nworld that just and lasting peace has always been their objective, an \nobjective that Israel has rejected and continues to reject, wishing \nto deprive an entire people of its existence and of its identity.\n\n250.\tIn Fez, the Arab leaders agreed on concrete and realistic \nproposals aimed at restoring a just and lasting peace in the region. \nThese proposals, contained in what is now called the  Fez Charter , \nhave created a legal framework which, without the slightest doubt, \nhas aroused hoper in the international community, which is determined \nto find a solution to this painful problem.\n\n251.\tAs usual, Begins response was to order the massacre of \nchildren, women and old people. Once again, in defiance of \ninternational public opinion, Israel has revealed its true face. Once \nagain Begin dashed the hopes of all peace-loving countries and \npeoples by organizing the genocide at Shatila and Sabra. These \nZionists have unfortunately made us relive a tragedy which history \nwished to bury at Nuremburg and which we thought had been removed \nfrom our memories for ever.\n\n252.\tIn the face of this situation which threatens international \npeace and security, in the face of this genocide which definitely \ncould not have been carried out without the  assent and support of a \ngreat Power, in the face of this holocaust of which the Palestinian \nand Lebanese peoples are that victims, we reaffirm that a just peace \ncannot be established without the recognition of the legitimate and \ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people, without the withdrawal \nof Israeli forces from the borders of Lebanon as well as from the \noccupied Arab territories, including the Holy City of Jerusalem.\n\n253.\tLebanon, whose only crime was to grant asylum to the \nPalestinians who, because of Zionist terrorism, had had to flee from \ntheir national land, must never again be the scene of these wars and \nmassacres. The international community must help Lebanon to regain \nits sovereignty and its territorial integrity and in its \nreconstruction.\n\n254.\tWe note with deep concern the continuation of the Iraq-Iran \nwar, in spite of the efforts made by the Organization of the Islamic \nConference, by the non-aligned movement and by the United Nations.\n255.\tWe hail the positive initiative taken by the Iraqi Government \nin withdrawing its forces to the internationally recognized borders \nas a sign of a desire for peace and we appeal to these two countries \nto settle their dispute peacefully.\t'\n\n256.\tThe situation in South Africa and in Namibia remains of \nconcern. Tensions and confrontations will not be eliminated nor will \npeace be established in that region so long as apartheid is not \ndismantled and the black majority in South Africa is not liberated. \nApartheid must be condemned without hesitation, and all political, \ndiplomatic, moral and material means must be provided to the \nliberation fronts. The peoples of South Africa and of Namibia are \nentitled to use all means-including armed struggle-against the \npractices of segregation, racism and racial discrimination, genocide \nand exploitation.\n\n257.\tWe strongly denounce the policy of baniustanization being \ncarried out by the Pretoria regime. We condemn also the criminal acts \nof terrorism and the acts of armed aggression against independent \nneighbouring countries. We state that the front-line countries have \nthe legitimate right to protection against the repeated acts of \nintimidation and aggression perpetrated by the South African regime, \nwhose sole purpose is to destabilize those States so as to weaken \ntheir moral and material efforts to assist the peoples of South \nAfrica and Namibia and their national liberation movements.\n\n258.\tThe Pretoria regime has clearly demonstrated its belligerence \nby accumulating arrangements and other means of oppression, by \nacquiring a nuclear capability and by continuing political, military, \neconomic and cultural Collaboration with Israel.\n\n259.\tIt is regrettable that South Africa, despite repeated appeals \nby the international community, continues to practise apartheid in \ndefiance and flagrant violation of the Charter and of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights.\n\n260.\tThe question of Namibia remains unsolved because of the \nillegal occupation by the South African regime, which is denying the \nNamibian people the exercise of its inalienable rights to \nself-determination and independence, in spite of United Nations \nresolutions. This gravely threatens international peace and security.\n\n261.\tThrough its political, economic and military activities the \nracist Pretoria regime is trying to delay Namibia's accession to \nindependence. The policy of collaboration with the apartheid regime \nof South Africa can only harm and betray the legitimate struggle of \nthe Namibian people to obtain its freedom.\n\n262.\tIt is up to the United Nations to ensure that its decisions \nare respected by South Africa. The United Nations must alert the \ninternational community to South African manoeuvres designed to upset \nthe peaceful initiatives under way for Namibian independence.\n\n263.\tWe applaud the initiatives taken by SWAPO, the sole \nrepresentative of the Namibian people, to facilitate the negotiations \nunder way, as well as its constant readiness to take part in free and \nfair elections in Namibia in accordance with the relevant resolutions \nof the United Nations.\n264.\tThe Republic of Djibouti believes Security Council resolution \n435 (1978) to be the only acceptable basis for negotiations on \nNamibia's peaceful transition to freedom and independence. We, \nsincerely hope that all the parties concerned will make a concerted^ \nco-operative effort to ensure implementation of that resolution.\n\n265.\tAs regards the issue of Western Sahara, my Government \nsupports the efforts of the OAU to promote a just and lasting \nsolution and also welcomes the measures taken to organize a \nreferendum to enable the population of Western Sahara to express \nitself freely and democratically in the exercise of its right to \nself-determination.\n\n266.\tAlthough we support the principle of self-determination for \nthe Sahraoui people, we assert that the decision of the heads of \nState and Government of the OAU taken in Nairobi is the only \nauthentic one.\n\n267.\tWithout unity, Africa beset as it is by economic difficulties \nand social instability-will remain a prey to foreign influences, \npolitical blackmail and economic exploitation. Lack of un ty will \nlessen the ability of the independent countries of Africa to assist \nthose which are still under the sway of colonization.\n\n268.\tFor a long time now Chad has continued to be the scene of \nfratricidal wars that have destroyed its human and material resources \nand endangered its unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We \ntherefore urge all the forces concerned to enter into a constructive \ndialogue and to make a common endeavour. We believe that to be the \nonly way that hostilities can be halted and order, peace and security \nrestored. We hope that the United Nations and the OAU will work \ntogether to achieve that goal and will help in the reconstruction of \nChad.\n\n269.\tAs regards Afghanistan, my Government expresses its great \nconcern over the military occupation of that country despite the \nrepeated appeals of the international community for an immediate and \nunconditional withdrawal of foreign forces. We reiterate our appeal \nfor an immediate and total withdrawal of all foreign troops from \nAfghanistan so as to enable its people to exercise its right to elect \na government of its choice. We advocate an overall political solution \nbased on full respect for the independence, sovereignty, territorial \nintegrity and non-aligned status of Afghanistan.\n\n270.\tThe situation in Kampuchea is a problem of concern to my \nGovernment, which is firmly opposed to foreign armed intervention and \nto the presence of foreign forces in Kampuchea. The presence of \nforeign troops makes it impossible for the Kampuchean people to \nexpress its will through free elections. We therefore reaffirm the \nimperative need for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from \nKampuchea. '\n\n271.\tWith reference to the question of Korea, my Government firmly \nbelieves that inter-Korean negotiations constitute the only political \nmeans of solving all the problems that have arisen out of the \npolitical division of that country. The earliest possible resumption \nof the dialogue is essential to deal with the urgent need to reduce \nthe climate of tension, renew mutual confidence and establish lasting \npeace in the Korean peninsula, which might finally lead to a solution \nacceptable to the Korean people.\n\n272.\tWe are convinced that the United Nations remains the most \nappropriate forum for voicing our ideas, because all of us here share \nthe same concern and undertake the same efforts to preserve the noble \nideals of the Charter, indeed, to defend the Charter of the United \nNations is to defend the cause for which millions of people have \nperished; it is to defend the cultural and political expression of \nhuman dignity.\n\n273.\tUnfortunately, at the present time the world is beset by \ngrave crises which, if not solved, could threaten peace and security. \nThe crises are especially dangerous because they seriously diminish \nthe United Nations system's ability to act; moreover, they challenge \nthe ideals on which the Charter was based.\n\n274.\tWe have in mind here the Shatila and Sabra massacres;\twhich \nhas been made into a political alternative; and the occupation of \ncountries by force. Is not threatening and shooting innocent people \nin camps and treating people as subhuman the sort of thing that \nprompted the creation of the Organization on the morrow of the last \nworld war?\n\n275.\tIn conclusion, I wish the Assembly every success at the \nthirty-seventh session. Members may be assured of my delegation's \npositive contribution. For my part, I remain convinced that all the \nnations represented here will fulfil their responsibility by \nresponding to the hopes of the millions of people who are looking to \nus.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like at the outset, on behalf of the \nIndonesian delegation and on my own behalf, to \nextend heartfelt con-gratulations to Mr. Hollai \non his election to the presidency of the \nthirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. \nHis vast experience and the competence that he \nhas exhibited in the realm of multilateral \ndiplomacy give us the assurance that under hi \nguidance solid and substantive progress will be \nachieved during this crucial session.\n206.\tWith one regular session and no less than \nfour special and emergency sessions, the past \nyear has indeed been an exceedingly busy and \ndemanding one for the outgoing President, Mr. \n2smat Kittani. He has discharged his manifold \nresponsibilities with great skill and patience \nand has contributed substantially to what has \nbeen achieved in difficult circumstances. We wish \nto register our deep appreciation of his \nleadership.\n207.\tIn the course of the past year the cause \nof international peace and security has, \nregrettably, suffered further serious setbacks. \nCompounding this trend, the world economy \ncontinues to deteriorate and global economic \nco-operation has been stalemated, while the \nUnited Nations itself has been repeatedly \nbypassed. Resort to force to settle disputes, \ndespite the Charter provisions to the contrary, \nhas continued unabated and has even increased. \nDetente, always fragile and too limited in scope \nand substance to begin with, is now a shambles \nand each local conflict now potentially poses a \ngreater threat to world peace than ever before. \nIn South-West Asia, South-East Asia, the Middle \nEast, Africa, Central and South America and other \nregions people continue to suffer the \nconsequences of violence and conflict. Yet, \ndespite the devastation and hardship that are \nvisited upon both the victor and the vanquished \nin war, States persist in their preparations for \nmilitary confrontation.\n208.\tLocal and regional conflicts have become \nincreasingly intractable owing to the marked \ntendency of the major Powers to view those \nconflicts from the perspective of their global \nrivalries and to link eventual solutions to their \nwider strategies of mutual containment. As a \nresult, the risk of the lesser Powers and the \ncountries of the third world being dragged into \nthe East-West polarization have grown \ncorrespondingly.\n209.\tIt is manifest that in an increasingly \ninsecure and perilous world the present \ninternational system has proved to be incapable \nof dealing effectively with the multitude of \nproblems. Indeed, the international community has \nlong recognized this reality by calling for the \nrestructuring of the prevailing system and the \nestablishment of a new international order. \nHowever, despite the new political realities in \nthe world and the growing consensus on change, \nthe present system is being perpetuated, to the \ndetriment of the newly emergent States. It is \nonly by recognizing the interests of the \ndeveloping countries and their vast potential for \ncontributing to a more peaceful and prosperous \nworld of genuine independence that we can begin \nto address the global problems before us.\n210.\tIt is our deep conviction that as long as \nthe great Powers seek to enhance their security \nin disregard of the interests of the smaller \nPowers, the question of universal collective \nsecurity envisaged in the Charter will continue \nto elude us. One of the cardinal features of the \nnew international system must be greater equality \nand a greater voice in decision-making on vital \nissues for all members of the international \ncommunity.\n211.\tThe multiple crises afflicting our world \ntoday and the perception of a growing paralysis \non the part of the United Nations in the attempts \nto find effective solutions to them have further \ndeepened the crisis of authority in which the \nOrganization has found itself for quite some time.\n212.\tIn this context, I should like to express \nmy delegation's great appreciation of the frank \nand lucid report of the Secretary-General, which \nhighlighted the alarming erosion of the \nOrganization's influence over issues of world \npeace and progress. My Government shares his \nconcern for whathe has rightly called the crisis \nof the multilateral approach in coping with the \nmyriad of problems that confront us. It is only \nthrough a renewed commitment and dedication to \nthe multilateral approach through the United \nNations, through dialogue and negotiation, that \nwe can reverse the dangerous drift towards global \ndisorder, heightened polarization and the revive \nof blatant power politics.\n213.\tIt is imperative to restore the capacity \nof the United Nations to fulfill its mission as \noutlined by the Charter, and our first task must \nnecessarily be to ensure a strengthened role for \nthe Security Council in settling conflicts. One \nessential component for such a strengthened role, \nin our view, should be the establishment of \nworkable machinery for the conciliation of \ndisputes and the diffusion of crises before they \nbecome full-blown wars. But for this and other \nimprovements in the operational procedures of the \nSecurity Council to become possible, there should \nfirst be a conscious readjustment in the nature \nand extent of the commitment by Member States, \nespecially by the permanent members of the \nSecurity Council, to the wider global \nresponsibilities inherent in our common \nacceptance of the Charter.\n214.\tIn his report, the Secretary-General has \ngone beyond analyzing the difficulties the \nOrganization is facing and has suggested a number \nof pertinent ways in which Governments of Member \nStates could assist, in particular, in developing \na more viable system of collective security, in \nstrengthening United Nations peace keeping \noperations and in enhancing the validity and \nutility of United Nations organs as negotiating \nforums. It is appropriate, therefore, that at \nthis critical juncture in the life of the \nOrganization we, the Member States, likewise move \nbeyond the perfunctory expression of praise and \nsupport for the Secretary-General's initiative \nand make active conceptual and concrete \ncontributions to the elaboration and the early \nrealization of the required reforms. As far as \nIndonesia is concerned, it stands ready to extend \nits full co-operation towards this end.\n215.\tIt cannot be said that the past year has \nwitnessed any impressive progress on the main \nissues confronting us. Indeed, the lack of \nprogress is distinctly disappointing and is in \nstrong contrast to the obvious urgency of these \nproblems.\n216.\tAmong the central issues confronting the \ninternational community, particularly in my own \nregion of South-East Asia, is the plight of \nKampuchea.\n217.\tThe situation in Kampuchea has not \nchanged substantially and remains a matter of \nserious concern to all of us. Indeed, no \nmeaningful progress has been achieved in seeking \na political solution of the problem. Foreign \ntroops are still in Kampuchea, despite repeated \ncalls by the international community for their \ntotal withdrawal. The United Nations supervised \nelection to enable the people of Kampuchea to \ndetermine their own future has not taken place. \nThe efforts by the United Nations and the \nInternational Conference on Kampuchea to seek a \npolitical solution have yet to yield meaningful \nresults.\n218.\tDespite the lack of progress, however, \nthe national forces of Kampuchea have formed the \nCoalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea \nunder the leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, \nwhich is a clear expression of the will and \ndetermination of the Kampuchean people to regain \ntheir sovereignty, independence and territorial \nintegrity. It is important to note that the \nCoalition Government has pledged to work for the \nimplementation of all decisions of the United \nNations and the International Conference on \nKampuchea. It remains the sincere conviction of \nmy Government that it would be in the interest of \nall the parties to seek a peaceful and negotiated \npolitical solution to the Kampuchean problem and \nthat the United Nations and the International \nConference on Kampuchea provide the best forum to \nseek the achievement of such a political solution.\n219.\tThe Association of South-East Asian \nNations  is committed to seek a just political \nsolution to the conflict. Once the Kampuchean \nquestion isresolved, we are confident that \nsuspicion and mistrust will be removed from the \narea, thus paving the way for the resumption of a \nmeaningful dialogue and co-operative relations \namong the States in the region. We could then \nlook forward with greater confidence to the \nestablishment of a zone of peace, freedom and \nneutrality in South-East Asia, thereby fulfilling \nthe hopes and aspirations of all peoples in the \nregion for stability, progress and prosperity.\n220.\tThe crisis in Afghanistan has also \naffected the process of detente. Indeed, it has \nexacerbated tension and anxiety throughout the \nworld and has hindered the resolution of a number \nof issues of world-wide concern. In line with \nUnited Nations efforts, the non- aligned movement \nand the Organization of the Islamic Conference \nhave reiterated the urgent need to seek a \ncomprehensive political solution to the problem \non the basis of the withdrawal of foreign troops \nand respect for the independence, sovereignty, \nterritorial integrity and non-aligned status of \nAfghanistan. The Secretary-General has also taken \nconstructive steps in seeking a solution of this \nproblem. We believe that any such solution should \nensure that the Afghan people wilt be able to \ndetermine their own future, free from foreign \nintervention and interference.\n221.\tSince June 1982, the world has witnessed \nwith anger and dismay the Israeli invasion of \nLebanon. We were shocked at the toll in human \nlives, especially all the Chilean population and \nthe incalculable deduction it has wreaked on \nLebanon. My Government has strongly condemned \nIsrael's aggression against the Lebanese and the \nPalestinian peoples and demanded the restoration \nof the sovereignty, territorial integrity and \npolitical independence of Lebanon. In his \nNational Day speech on 17 August President \nSoeharto reiterated.\n'Our stand remains as clear and unambiguous as \nbefore: that is, we continue to be on the side of \nthe Arab nation in its struggle against Israeli \naggression and stand should 2r to shoulder with \nthe Palestinian people in their legitimate quest \nfor self- determination and to regain their \nhomeland .'\n222.\tThe appalling massacre of the Palestinian \ncivilians in west Beirut, which is a direct \nconsequence of Israel's invasion, has evoked \nuniversal condemnation. The resumption of the \nseventh emergency special session last week and \nthe adoption by consensus of resolution ES-7/9, \nin which the Assembly calls on the Security \nCouncil to investigate the circumstances and \nextent of the massacre, was a reflection of the \nworld's horror over the massacre, for which \nIsrael cannot evade responsibility.\n223.\tIt is clear that the aim of the Israeli \ninvasion was to destroy the national identity and \naspirations of the Palestinian people and their \nsole and legitimate representative, the PLO, as \nthe standard bearer of Palestinian rights to \nsovereignty and statehood. Israel cannot take \nupon itself the function of a policeman in the \nMiddle East, violating as it pleases the \nterritorial sovereignty of its neighbors, \ndestroying the people of Palestine and imposing \nits will on the Arab world. Israel's expansionism \nand arrogance must be stopped.\n224.\tMy delegation believes that the only hope \nfor peace is for Israel to accept Palestinian \nindependence and sovereignty as called for and \nsupported by nearly all mankind. The question of \nPalestine remains at the heart of the conflict in \nthe Middle East, and without a solution to this \nproblem no comprehensive settlement can ensure \npeace in the region. The realization of a just \nand lasting peace requires the unconditional \nwithdrawal of all Israeli forces from all \noccupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem.\n225.\tWe commend the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference, held Fez this month, which has \ndemonstrated the unified approach of the Arab \nStates to the problem of the Middle East. The \nmeeting enumerated /4/J7/6P6] serious and \nreasonable proposals to achieve a solution of the \nPalestinian question. On the other hand, as a \npower which could restrain Israel's aggression, \nintransigence and expansionism, we believe that \nthe United States should continue to insist on \nIsrael behaving in a more responsible and \npeace-loving manner, befitting a Member of the \nUnited Nations. It is our sincere hope that the \nproposals of the Fez Summit will receive a \npositive response from all the parties concerned \nso that the long-standing conflict in this region \nwill soon be resolved, thereby inaugurating a \nnew era of peace for the region as a whole.\n226.\tThe second special session on disarmament \nwhich was convened, with great expectations, to \nfollow up the decisions of the Final Document of \nthe Tenth Special Session of the general \nAssembly, adopted in 1978, has become a casualty \nof the present climate of distrust and tension \nand has degenerated into a series of platitudes, \ndevoid of substantive commitments. The inability \nto adopt a comprehensive program of disarmament \nat the session, regarded by many States, \nincluding my own, as crucial to our efforts for \nan integrated approach, was a great \ndisappointment. It was, moreover, regrettable \nthat some of the leading Powers disregarded their \ncommitments undertaken in the 197% Final \nDocument and were unwilling to use the United \nNations as an instrument for genuine disarmament \neffort. These developments have prevented \nmeaningful progress in stemming the tide of the \narms race.\n227.\tDespite that failure, however, the \nsession has served as a focal point for \nwidespread expression of public concern about the \narms race, and in particular about the danger of \nnuclear weapons. The proposals for a ban on the \nuse of nuclear weapons, and for a freeze on their \ndevelopment and production, and the renewed call \nfor a comprehensive ban on nuclear- weapon tests, \nfully reflected world opinion. It is our hope \nthat the bilateral talks between the United \nStates and the Soviet Union will be pursued with \na sense of urgency and lead to meaningful \nlimitations and significant reductions in nuclear \nweapons. The nuclear Powers should, moreover, \nrecognize that it :s no less important to pursue \nmultilateral negotiations, by enabling the \nCommittee on Disarmament to discharge its \nresponsibilities and renew efforts to negotiate \non the priority issues.\n228.\tThere is a growing apprehension that the \nregion of the Indian Ocean is rapidly become the \nfocus of a new cold-war rivalry between the \nsuper-Powers. As a littoral State, Indonesia is \nconvinced that the convening of the \nInternational! Conference on the Indian Ocean is \nar\\ essential step towards the establishment of a \nzone of peace. We are fully aware of the \nramifications of the conflicts and tension that \nengulf the region. It is precisely for this \nreason that the Conference, as stipulated in \nrelevant General Assembly resolutions, should be \nthe forum to discuss all relevant issues, with a \nview to opening the constructive dialogue that \nheretofore has eluded us. It is a truism that the \nconvening of one conference might not suffice to \nresolve all the problems pertaining to the Indian \nOcean. However, the Conference should be a first \nstep towards improving the political and security \nclimate in the region.\n229.\tIn recent months the international \ncommunity has witnessed renewed large-scale \nmilitary operations by South Africa against SWAPO \nin a desperate attempt to eliminate the sole \nauthentic and internationally recognized \nrepresentative of the Namibian people. It should \nbe noted that there is nothing new in these South \nAfrican tactics. The racists in Pretoria have on \nnumerous occasions used their military forces to \nthwart any progress in the negotiations to \nimplement Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\n230.\tSouth Africa has clearly demonstrated \nthat it is prepared to use every maneuver, and to \nexploit every opportunity to employ force, to \nundercut all efforts towards a negotiated \nsettlement leading to the establishment of an \nindependent Namibia.\n231.\tThe most expeditious means to bring about \nNamibian independence is contained in the Arusha \nDeclaration and Programme of Action on Namibia \nadopted by the United Nations Council for Namibia \nin May this year. It urged the Western contact \ngroup to accept SWAPO's constructive proposal \nfor the early implementation of the United \nNations plan and to exert firm and genuine \npressure on South Africa. In this regard, my \ndelegation will firmly oppose any effort by South \nAfrica to impose any fraudulent electoral, \nconstitutional or political schemes, and any \npretext to link the solution of the Namibian \nproblem to any other issue that would be in \ncontravention of resolution 433 (1978), all of \nwhich are designed to perpetuate South Africa's \ndomination of the Territory. Furthermore, at the \nArusha meeting my delegation endorsed the call \nfor a Geneva-type conference at which all \noutstanding issues should be discussed and \nresolved together in a comprehensive manner. The \nearly scheduling of such a conference may help \nintensify current efforts to overcome South \nAfrica's intransigence. Despite the many \nobstacles that continue to block the way to \nsecuring Namibia's independence, the negotiating \nprocess has shown some signs of progress, as \nnoted in the Secretary-General's report. Every \neffort should be made, however, to compel South \nAfrica to negotiate in good faith and within the \nguidelines established by resolution 435 (1978).\n232.\tIt is disturbing to all of us that, \ndespite the condemnation of the system of \napartheid by almost all Member States, South \nAfrica continues to ignore the repeated appeals \nof the international community to end the \npractice of\n233.\tGuided by the important decisions adopted \nat the International Conference on Sanctions \nagainst South Africa, held in Paris in 1981, my \ndelegation is convinced that the international \ncommunity should intensify its solidarity with \nthe people of South Africa by maintaining and \nstrengthening the agreed set of sanctions \ndesigned to isolate South Africa in all spheres \nof international relations.\n234.\tOn 30 April 1982 the Third United Nations \nConference on the Law of the Sea adopted a \ncomprehensive Convention on the Law of the Sea.^ \nThis was a monumental achievement in multilateral \nnegotiations under the auspices of the United \nNations. The fact that the draft Convention was \nadopted by 130 countries and was opposed by only \n4 indicates that each provision is acceptable to \nthe overwhelming majority of the States in the \nworld. It is conceivable that, taken separately, \nall provisions of the Law of the Sea Convention \nare not acceptable to a particular country. But \ntaken as a whole, being a compromise text in a \npackage, the text is obviously acceptable to the \nworld community. My delegation believes that the \nLaw of the Sea Convention is extremely important \nto maintaining law and order in ocean affairs as \nwell as to promoting national development and \nmanagement of ocean uses and resources. My \ndelegation therefore would like to appeal to the \nsmall number of countries which have not adopted \nthe Convention to reconsider their position, so \nthat the Law of the Sea Convention, being the \nproduct of long years of negotiation, can become \ntruly universal in nature and application.\n235.\tConcurrent with the continuing critical \nclimate in international politics, the \ninternational economy has plunged to one of the \nlowest depths in several decades.\n236.\tAggravating the situation is the serious \nerosion of multilateral economic co-operation, \nmainly through the regressive policies of some \ndeveloped countries, which run counter to the \nbasic goals and objectives of an increasingly \ninterdependent world.\n237.\tThe seemingly hopeful signs generated at \nthe Cancun and Versailles Economic Summits in \nseeking a breakthrough in the stalemated global \nnegotiations have proved to be illusory. It has \nto be acknowledged that there was indeed some \nmovement towards launching the global \nnegotiations through an enabling resolution. \nHowever, the informal consultations so far have \nregretfully not yielded any substantive \nprogress. My delegation endorses the search for \nnew initiatives to reach a consensus on some \ncrucial procedural issues. These efforts can be \nsuccessful only if some developed countries \ndemonstrate the political will to take positive \nstep towards an early launching of these \nnegotiations.\n238.\tAn important feature underlying the \neconomic system today is that of interdependence. \nWe believe that interdependence does not imply \nonly a mutuality of benefits for both the rich \nand poor countries. It also means that the \nself-sustained economic development of the \ndeveloping countries could contribute towards the \neconomic well-being of the developed countries.\n239.\tWe are pleased to note that there has \nbeen a gradual increase of understanding by some \ndeveloped countries on the inevitability of \ninterdependence. It is our sincere hope that \nthese countries would be willing to undertake the \nadjustments needed to achieve this concept.\n240.\tWe are convinced that piecemeal, \ndomestic- oriented and bilateral remedies for our \nglobal problems are a futile exercise in a world \nof increasing interdependence. Restructuring, \ntherefore, under the aegis of our universal body, \nthe United Nations, should no longer be deferred.\n241.\tHaving said that, I wish to emphasize \nthat this does not mean that the global \nnegotiations or the efforts to launch them should \nin any way divert our attention from the ongoing \nnegotiations in other sectoral forums.\n242.\tThe restructuring of international trade \nis a vital vehicle for achieving self-sustained \ndevelopment. And above anything else, access to \nmarkets is crucial. Regretfully, the escalation \nof protectionist measures practiced by some \ndeveloped countries has seriously eroded the \nefforts of the developing countries to expand \ntheir exports. The sharp deterioration of their \nterms of trade continues to aggravate their \nalready serious economic plight.\n243.\tIn this context, the forthcoming \nministerial meeting of GATT provides an excellent \nopportunity and a historic turning point for the \nestablishment of fair international trading \npractices. Such action is imperative for the \nexpansion of trade of the developing countries.\n244.\tThe sixth session of UNCTAD, scheduled \nfor late next spring at Belgrade, will, we \nbelieve, be of crucial importance for remedying \nthe central problems and the current disruptions \nin world trade and development which could lead \nto the revival of the world economy. If, however, \nthe impasse continues with no concrete results \nemerging from these important meetings, we will \nonce again be witnessing another lost chance in \nwhich the international community will have \nfailed to grasp the opportunity for progress.\n245.\tGiven the slow pace of the North-South \nnegotiations, the measured progress of \ncollective self-reliance among developing \ncountries is more indispensable now than ever. \nIndonesia is committed to this process, not only \nbecause it is transforming the patterns of \ndevelopment, but because it constitutes an \nessential ingredient for the rapid advancement of \nthe developing countries.\n246.\tIn this connection, we endorse the \nresults of the meeting of the Intergovernmental \nFollow-up and Co-ordination Committee on economic \nco-operation among the developing countries held \nin Manila in August. Its recommendation to start \nnegotiations on a global system of trade \npreference among developing countries and the \ndevelopment of food security reserves deserves \nour particular attention. In our opinion, the \nimplementation of the global system of trade \npreference, through a gradual approach, will \nultimately help the efforts for trade expansion \namong developing countries.\n247.\tIn so far as co-operation on food \nsecurity reserves is concerned, we believe that \nit can best be implemented through sub-regional \nand regional arrangements, which could then be \nextended on a world-wide scale. We in ASEAN have \ninitiated such an arrangement and are in the \nprocess of trying to develop further the ASEAN \nfood security reserve co-operation.\n230. Turning briefly now to some social aspects \nof the United Nations activities, the \npreparations for the International Youth Year in \n1985, which are now in progress, are commendable. \nAn increased participation of non governmental \nyouth organizations in the International Youth \nYear would greatly encourage them to share in the \nresponsibilities of solving global youth problems \nand thereby help to promote world peace. Such an \nexercise would also increase their ability to \nparticipate in the national youth development \nprogram. The Indonesian Government, therefore, \nfully supports the Specific Programme of Measures \nand Activities.\n251.\tWith reference to the status and role of \nwomen, there is an increased recognition of their \ncontribution towards development as reflected in \nthe Mexico, World Plan of Action for the \nImplementation of the Objectives of the \nInternational Women-Year. This positive trend is \nfurther stimulated by the adoption of the \nConvention on the Elimination of AH Forms of \nDiscrimination against Women. We sincerely hone \nthat the 1985 World Conference on the United \nNations Decade for Women will be able to review \nand appraise constructively the implementation of \nthe Plan of Action.\n252.\tThis year that has witnessed its abundant \nshare of world-wide turbulence and tragedy, and \nthe inca-pacity of the United Nations to prevent \nthem or to provide timely redress, and there is \nalways the temptation to lapse into cynicism and \ndisaffection. But the reforming impulse, the \nhopes and yearnings of peoples everywhere for a \nmore peaceful, just and prosperous world order \nbased on the ideals and principles of the Charter \nremain alive and cannot be quieted.\n253.\tIndonesia remains convinced 'hat despite \nits present inadequacies, the United Nations \nstill represents the best instrument to \ntransform these hopes into reality and to fashion \nat least the minimum conditions for a better \nlife for all in the decades to come. Therefore, \nif the Organization is to fulfill its role as the \nfocal point for the global management of the \ncritical problems of our time, it is imperative \nthat a new sense of purpose be instilled in its \nmechanisms and procedures so as to prevent it \nfrom degenerating into a sterile debating forum. \nMy delegation further believes that in this \neffort the non-aligned movement to which \nIndonesia belongs could and should make an \nimportant contribution, both at the conceptual \nlevel and in initiating concrete proposals, as it \nhas consistently done in the past on the global \nissues of peace, security and international \neconomic co-operation.\n254.\tIn a rapidly changing world of disparate \ninterests and contending visions, the only \nalternative to re-storing the United Nations as a \nrelevant organization capable of meeting the \nchallenges of our time is to allow an unmanaged \nand uncontrollable slide into international chaos \nand anarchy. As the Secretary-General has warned, we appear to be perilously close to that point.\n255.\tThus, for once, the task before us should \nnot be seen in terms of a demand by one side and \nan act of generosity by the other. For it may not \nbe just our mutual interest that is at stake, but \nour common survival, and none of us can afford to \nevade this challenge and refuse to bear this \nresponsibility.\n"

I \nam confident that his ability, experience and \nwisdom will lead to the desired success of our \nwork at this session. My country's delegation \nwill do its utmost to co-operate with him towards \nthat end, especially since the development of \ncordial relations between our two countries will \nrender our co-operation closer and more \ncomprehensive.\n189.\tI wish to laud the achievements of the \nout\u00acgoing President, Mr. Ismat Kittam, during \nwhose tenure the General Assembly held several \nspecial and emergency special sessions, in \naddition to the regular thirty-sixth session. Mr, \nKittani conducted the work of the various \nsessions in an efficient manner that is worthy of \nour full appreciation and praise.\n\n190.\tI also laud the Secretary-General, during \nwhose term of office we hope that the \nOrganization will take longer strides towards the \nattainment of its purposes and objectives.\n191.\tThe present session is being held at a \ntime when our international community is facing \nextremely dif\u00acficult circumstances. Danger is \nthreatening around every comer. Hotbeds of \ntension and acts of violence and aggression are \nintensifying and expanding, in the Middle East in \nparticular, but also in Asia, Africa and Latin \nAmerica. All these situations pose a major threat \nto international peace and security.\n192.\tThere is no doubt that the imperialist \ncamp is directly responsible for the \nintensification of tension and aggression in and \nagainst those continents. It wants to use those \ncountries as a testing ground for its lethal arms \nso that those countries will remain helpless, the \nvictims of ruin and destruction. By the same \ntoken, their peoples will remain backward and \nunable to catch up with the achievements of \nciv\u00acilization. The imperialists wish to keep a \nvast domain at their disposal for exploitation, \nboth political and economic. Needless to say, \nneo-colonialism has perfected its methods and \ntechniques in this field.\n193.\tThe imperialist camp is spending hundreds \nof billions of dollars on arsenals of war and \ndestruction. This is at a time when 600 million \nhuman beings on our planet are suffering from \nmalnutrition, when 1.5 billion people are without \nshelter or are living in tragic circumstances, \nand when more than one quarter of the world's \nchildren are deprived of education and proper \nnutrition. It would have been far better for \nthose many billions spent on menacing humanity \nwith a horrible world massacre to have been spent \non meeting the needs of the poor countries and \nraising the living standards of their peoples.\n194.\tMost of the statements delivered at the \nsecond special session on disarmament last June \nportrayed a tragic picture of today's world. They \nurgently and sincerely drew attention to the \ndangers facing humanity because of the \nuncontrollable armaments problem. They also \npointed to the gloomy fate awaiting all mankind. \nThey expressed the desire of the non- nuclear \ncountries\u2014which constitute the great majority of \nthe world community\u2014to protect themselves against \nthe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. They \ncalled for the banning of nuclear tests and for a \nhalt to the manufacture of chemical and \nbiological weapons and the destruction of the \npresent stockpiles. They advocated the \nestablishment of zones of peace, as well as \nnuclear-free zones in the Middle East, Africa, \nSouth-East Asia and other parts of the world.\n195.\tNone the less, despite all these sincere \nand con\u00actinuing calls and appeal, we are in fact \nwitnessing the transfer to the aggressor \ncountries of the most sophis\u00acticated equipment of \naggression. We can see that internationally \nbanned weapons are being used. The world has \nrecently witnessed tens of thousands of \nPalestinian and Lebanese citizens\u2014mostly \nchildren, women and elderly people\u2014falling victim \nto cluster bombs, vacuum bombs and nerve gases \nmade in the United States of America, during the \nIsraeli invasion of Lebanon and its capital, \nBeirut.\n196.\tDomination, exploitation, the plundering \nof national resources, persecution, aggression \nand the protection of the aggressor have become \nthe rules guiding the conduct of imperialist, \nracist and Zionist threes in international \nrelations. Most States Members of the United \nNations and the world public have declared that \ninternational peace and security cannot be \nrealized and stabilized until the principles of \nthe Charter and international law replace the law \nof the jungle, and unless injustice, persecution \nand oppres-sion are eliminated and all forms of \nracism, including Zionism, are uprooted, unless \npeoples regain their usurped rights, and unless \ncolonialism, neo\u00accolonialism, domination, \nhegemony and the plundering of the peoples' \nnational resources are eradicated root and \nbranch. We thus consider that the interna\u00actional \ncommunity must strive to realize the following \nobjectives if we want to attain a better world, \nfree from the tragedies and woes of war.\n197.\tFirst, colonialism and neo-colonialism \nand all forms of racism and racial discrimination \nmust be eliminated.\n198.\tSecondly, in relations among countries, \nsover\u00aceignty and the rule of international law \nand the prin-ciples of right, justice and equity, \nincluding respect for the principle of the \npeoples' right to self- determination, must be \nconsolidated. This would eliminate hegemony, \noppression and aggression and remove the \nimmediate and secondary causes of inter\u00acnational \ncrises and problems.\n199.\tThirdly, the United Nations must be \nstrength\u00acened so as to prevent it from becoming \nimmobilized and so as to affirm the credibility \nand effectiveness of its resolutions and enhance \nits capabilities to address and solve various \nissues, guided by the Charter and the principles \nfor which it was created.\n200.\tFourthly, the specter of the cold war and \nof international tension must be banished and the \nmad race in both conventional and nuclear weapons \nhalted, and we must persist in our efforts to ban \nthe produc\u00action, stockpiling and use of nuclear \nweapons.\n201.\tFifthly, an economic world order based on \nthe relevant General Assembly resolution must be \nestab\u00aclished, in order to bridge the great gap \nand remove the major discrepancies between the \nadvanced and developing countries and to create a \ngreater balance in relations between the \ndeveloped countries and third world countries.\n202.\tA review of the current international \nsituation shows very clearly the great distance \nseparating the present status of international \naffairs from the status we desire and hope for. \nWe notice, rather, that problems are increasing \nand being further complicated and that sources of \ntension in the world are being dangerously \naggravated and becoming a serious threat to \ninternational peace and security.\n203.\tThe racist regime in Pretoria, like the \nracist Zionist regime in Palestine, has not only \ndetonated explosive situations of conflict and \ntension, but its practices have always been an \naffront to humanity and a blot on its history. \nThe peoples of South Africa and Namibia are still \nbeing made to labour under the yoke of injustice \nand colonialism by the racist minority regime. \nThe Organization must take a firm stand in \nconfronting the conspiracies and manipu\u00aclations \nof the imperialist forces, in order to save those \npeoples from their enslavers and oppressors by \nsup\u00acporting and backing their national liberation \nmove-ments and by extending to them effective \nmaterial aid in their struggle for their rights \nto self-deter-mination, independence and national \nsovereignty and in order to deter that racist \nregime from persisting in its acts of aggression \nagainst neighbouring coun\u00actries, particularly \nAngola. We appeal to the Security Council to take \nthe measures provided for in the Charter in order \nto put an end to this regime and to its practices \nand acts of aggression.\n204.\tThe Assembly is still considering an item \non the situation in Afghanistan and its \nconsequences for international peace and \nsecurity. It is our opinion that the Afghan \nGovernment has the right to defend the \nindependence of Afghanistan against all types of \noutside intervention in its internal affairs. We \nhave close historical and cultural relations with \nAfghanistan; moreover it is a member of the \nnon-aligned movement, and we are keen that it \nshould always remain so. The Afghan people are \nfully entitled to choose their own system of \ngovernment. We therefore attach great importance \nto the conducting of negotiations between the \nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of \nAfghanistan and its neighbors in order to achieve \npeaceful solutions that would guarantee the \nsecurity and stability of that region and \npreserve the unity, independence and \nnon-alignment of Afghanistan.\n205.\tThe question of Cyprus is at a standstill \nto this very day despite the number of years that \nhave passed since it first arose. We sincerely \nhope that negotiations between the two Cypriot \ncommunities will resume under the auspices of the \nSecretary-General, in accordance with United \nNations resolutions, on the basis of respect for \nthe sovereignty, independence, territorial \nintegrity, unity and non-alignment of Cyprus.\n206.\tThe problem of the unification of Korea \nis still unsolved, despite the new initiative and \nproposals submitted by the Government of the \nPeople's Demo\u00accratic Republic of Korea. We \nsupport the unification of Korea on the just and \npractical bases suggested by the Pyong Yang \nGovernment.\n207.\tA sad and regrettable war took place in \nthe South Atlantic. The question of the Falkland \nIslands (Malvinas) awaits discussion during this \nsession of the General Assembly. We call for the \nresumption of negotiations between the two \nparties concerned, namely, Argentina and the \nUnited Kingdom, under the auspices of the United \nNations, in order to find a peaceful settlement \nbased on the relevant United Nations resolutions \nand the principles of the Charter. The efforts of \nthe Secretary-General in this respect are both \nnecessary and desirable in order to facilitate \nthe realization of the desired peaceful \nsettlement.\n208.\tThe dangerous and tragic situation in the \nMiddle East clearly reflects the disruption which \nthe interna\u00actional community has undergone as a \nresult of the constant Israeli aggression. The \ntragedy of the Pal\u00acestinian people and the whole \nMiddle East region dates back to the \nestablishment of Israel on the soil of Palestine. \nMuch suffering and bleeding continue as a result \nof the plots of world Zionism to establish a \nracist empire starting in Palestine and extending \nto other parts of the Arab world, defined by the \nZionist doctrine as being from the Nile to the \nEu\u00acphrates\u2014an empire that would dominate the \nMiddle East and control the international \nsituation through such hegemony, because of the \nstrategic and economic importance of the Middle \nEast, which is the meeting point for three \ncontinents in the heart of the Arab World, \nadjacent to the strategic interests of the great \nPowers, in addition to the known huge energy \nreserves and revenues of this region.\n209.\tThe Zionist peril, with its racialist \nnature and expansionist aims, is not confined to \nthe Arab world. It has, rather, become a growing, \nimmediate danger jeopardizing the security and \ninterests of all the peoples of the world.\n210.\tWorld Zionism is plotting to become, \nthrough its control of the region and its natural \nresources\u2014energy ranking foremost\u2014a force \ncontrolling this basic com\u00acmodity and forcing the \nworld to deal with the region through it. This \nexplains the aggressive attitude of world Zionism \nand its base, Israel, built on a permanent \ncallous contempt of the nations, organizations \nand international institutions of the world.\n211.\tFrom the beginning of this year, Israel \nhas refused to implement the following Security \nCouncil resolutions: 497 (1981), and resolutions \n508 (1982), 509 (1982), 511 (1982) to 513 (1982) \nand 515 (1982) to 521 (1982). It has also refused \nto abide by the reso\u00aclutions of the General \nAssembly passed at its special emergency sessions \nthis year. AH this should be added to the long \nlist of United Nations and other interna\u00actional \nresolutions.\n212.\tThe Arab Palestinian people have paid a very dear price for the scandalous \ncollusion between British imperialism in \nPalestine and world Zionism, which led to opening \nthe gates of Palestine for Jewish immigration and \nfacilitating the establishment of Israel at the \nexpense of the Arab Palestinian people and their \nhomeland. The Palestinians are still being forced \nto continue to pay the price in the form of \nexpulsion and mass murder. They still suffer from \nhomelessness, deprived of their lands and their \nhomes. They still aspire, with great yearning and \ndetermi\u00acnation, to the restoration of the \nhomeland which has been usurped and the rights \nwhich have been violated. The Arabs have paid \nvery dearly for the collusion between world \nZionism and the Western countries, which have \nrenounced all their commitments towards the Arabs \nand supported the establishment of the Hebrew \nState, extending to it all means of aggression.\n213.\tIn 1948 the Israelis introduced the \nslogan of \\\"negotiating peace with the Arabs\\\" and \nunder this false pretext occupied the \ndemilitarized zone, which was under Arab control \nand supervision. In 1967, under the motto of \n\\\"security\\\", the Israelis launched the June \naggression and then began to build settlements in \nthe newly occupied Arab territories. Now they \ndemand security for these settlements, built on \nthe occupied Arab lands, contrary to \ninternational instru\u00acments, the principles of \ninternational law and United Nations resolutions.\n214.\tIsrael has refused to implement all \ninternational resolutions calling for its \nwithdrawal from the Arab lands that it occupied \nin 1967, and it has rejected all peace \ninitiatives, including the American initiatives. \nIt rejected and foiled both the Jarring and \nRogers initiatives. AH international efforts to \ndetermine the borders of the State of Israel have \nfailed. A num\u00acber of Israeli leaders have \nintroduced an insolent, dangerous and arrogant \ndefinition of borders, unpre\u00accedented in history, \nby declaring that Israel's borders stretch to \nwherever the Israeli soldier can reach. Such a \ndefinition simply means continued aggression and \nconstant expansion until the dreams of world \nZionism are achieved by the establishment of the \nZionist empire in the Arab world. In a notorious \nstatement, reminiscent of the Nazi concepts which \nwere de\u00acnounced by all mankind, the Israeli \nMinister of Defense states that he believes that \nIsrael's lebensranum will stretch to include \nPakistan in the east and North African countries \nin the west.\n215.\tOn 14 December 1981 Israel's Knesset \nenacted a \\\"law\\\" annexing the Syrian Golan \nHeights. This annexation was rejected by the \nSecurity Council in its resolution 497 (1981) and \nby the General Assembly in resolution ES-9/1 of 5 \nFebruary 1982 at its ninth emergency special \nsession. During this year Israel's threats \nagainst the Arab countries and Palestinian people \nhave escalated. Israel has continued to pursue \nits aggressive policy by bombarding Lebanon's \ntowns and villages, and the whole world knows \nabout the savagery of Israel's shelling of \nBeirut, which killed hundreds of innocent \nvictims. On 4 June Israel's army launched an \nall-out attack on Lebanon, preceded by air and \nsea raids on various Lebanese areas.\n216.\tDespite Security Council resolutions 508 \n(1982) and 509 (1982), the Israeli invaders \ncontinued their advance till they besieged Beirut \nand unleashed on it an inferno of bombs from the \nair, land and sea in a way unprecedented in the \nhistory of war. In one day the Lebanese capital \nwas hit by over 250,000 Israeli bombs and \nrockets, as reported by the world news agencies \nat the time.\n217.\tIn this war, the Israelis killed tens of \nthousands of people, mostly civilians\u2014women, \nchildren and elderly people. They also displaced \nhundreds of thousands and destroyed villages, \ntowns and civilian installations. Even hospitals \nand places of worship were not spared. They used \ninternationally banned weapons. And all this came \nunder the title of \\\"Peace for Gallilee\\\".\n218.\tA survey of Israeli decisions, together \nwith the statements of Israeli leaders, shows us \nthat the aggres\u00acsion on Lebanon had the following \nobjectives: first, to liquidate the PLO and \ndisplace the Palestinians anew; secondly, to \ncontrol Lebanon through what they call the \nestablishment of \\\"a strong Government\\\", as if any \nGovernment installed by foreign occupation can \never be \\\"strong\\\"; thirdly, to impose a \\\"peace \ntreaty\\\" on the State of Lebanon; fourthly, to \nusurp parts of Lebanon\u2014witness Israel's current \nmeasures in the occupied Lebanese territory, \nwhere attempts are under way to plunder the \nwaters of the Litani river and to create a new \nsettlement; and, fifthly, to deal a military blow \nto Syria, and weaken it in order to weaken Arab \nresistance to Israeli aggression, since Syria is \nthe base and pivot of this resistance.\n219.\tTo realize those aims, Israel began its \ninvasion of Lebanon, in which tens of thousands \nof Palestinians and Lebanese were massacred and \ntowns and villages were destroyed. To realize \nthose aims, Israel's forces entered Beirut, in \nspite of an agreement arranged by President \nReagan's envoy, Mr. Philip Habib, in spite of the \nUnited States guarantees that the Israeli forces, \nafter the implementation of the agreement, would \nnever enter Beirut, and although we were \nrepeatedly in\u00acformed that the Israeli forces \nwould start withdrawing from around Beirut as a \nfirst step towards complete withdrawal.\n220.\tThen came the horrible massacre \nperpetrated by the Israeli forces of occupation \nin the refugee camps of Sabra, Shatila and other \nlocalities. Israeli forces beat burned and \nmassacred more than 1,400 innocent Palestinian \ncitizens, mostly women and children, in a \nbloodbath reminiscent of the massacre of Deir \nYassin, perpetrated by Begin on 9 April 1947. \nThis horrible carnage, which exceeds all the \ncrimes of nazism, confirms that a genocidal war \nof extermination is being waged by Israel against \nthe Palestinian and Lebanese people before the \nvery eyes of the whole world.\n221.\tThe storming of Beirut and the horrible \nmassacre committed there despite the \naforementioned agree\u00acment, and despite American \npledges, calls into ques\u00action the value and \ncredibility of the guarantees given by a \nsuper-Power like the United States of America. It \nalso casts grave doubts on the validity of such \nguarantees whenever Israel is involved m a \nproblem.\n222.\tThe practices of the leaders of Israel \nshow that they are indeed a terrorist gang that \nhas not learned the lessons of history. They have \nnot learned from past records, nor do they wish \nto understand the present or future. Crime has \nblotted out their vision, and racism has \ncompletely blurred their perception of the \npresent and the future.\n223.\tThose leaders must realize that the Arab \nmasses, which throughout history ha ve gone into \nbattle for their cause and their dignity, will \nnot be cowed by Israeli terrorism or by the \ncrimes of the Israeli leaders. They must realize \nthat sooner or later they will pay a high price \nfor the hideous crimes they have committed and \ncommit still, and that a just punishment will be \ninflicted sooner or later. Never in history has a \ntyrant escaped punishment. The crimes the \nIsraelis are committing against the Arab nations \nwill only strengthen cur determination to resist \naggression and strengthen our commitment to our \ncause and to final victory. We are aware that we \nhave chosen the hard path, the path which is \npaved with suffering, blood and sacrifice. But we \nshall pursue our march regardless of the \nimmensity of the sacrifices and the difficulties. \nWe have no choice but to struggle to liberate our \nland and preserve the future of our nation. Our \nroad is long and agonizing, the road of freedom \nis always difficult and bloody, but it is the \nroad to victory.\n224.\tThe international community has rejected \nthe Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and that \ninvasion has been condemned by all nations and \npeoples of the world, individually and \ncollectively. But is that enough, in the face of \nthis perilous situation?\n225.\tThe countries which voted in favor of \nadmitting Israel to membership of the \nOrganization based their approval on the Israeli \npledge that Israel would be a peace-loving State, \ncommitted to the Charter and the principles of \nthe United Nations. Are not Israel's racist \ncrimes, its barbarous acts of aggression, its \ninvasion of Lebanon and the war of extermination \nit is waging against the Palestinian and Lebanese \npeoples enough to make those countries reconsider \ntheir attitude to that State, which was \noriginally founded on aggression and which has \ngrown and expanded through ag\u00acgression?\n226.\tAnother question is directed specifically \nto the United States of America, since it \nsupplies the ag-gressors with all the means of \naggression, killing and destruction in the form \nof the most modem products of the American \narsenal. Are the Israelis committing these \ncriminal acts to serve their racist Zionist \ninterests or on behalf of the United States and \nits interests?\n227.\tIf Israel's crimes against the Arabs are \nnot com\u00acmitted on behalf of the United States or \nits interests, why does it provide this support \nand backing to Israel? Why does it give Israel \nthe most modem American aircraft and missiles, \nand reconnaissance, detection and jamming \nequipment? Why does it give Israel cluster bombs \nand chemical weapons, which are interna\u00actionally \nprohibited? Is this consistent with the \nresponsi\u00acbilities of the United States, a \npermanent member of the Security Council, under \nthe Charter?\n228.\tIs peace in the region and throughout the \nworld achieved through wars, by killing tens of \nthousands, by rendering millions homeless and by \ndestroying towns and villages?\n229.\tThe United States of America bears a \nspecial responsibility for all Israel's crimes \nand acts of aggres\u00acsion against the Arabs. \nTherefore, the United States should immediately \nwithdraw its political and military protection \nfrom Israel and should pave the way for the \ninternational community to impose sanctions \nagainst that racist aggressor State, to end all \ntypes of assist\u00acance, including military and \neconomic aid, and to suspend the participation of \nIsrael in the Organization.\n230.\tThose who have not helped in the past to \nisolate Israel and impose sanctions against it \nare today required to translate their \ncondemnation of the aggres\u00acsion into punishment \nof the aggressor.\n231.\tThe history of the First and Second World \nWars proves that condoning aggression has always \nencouraged the commission of further aggression. \nThe lenient attitude towards the Nazis during the \ninvasion of Austria and Czechoslovakia encouraged \nthem to invade Poland, an act which led to the \neruption of the Second World War. Taking a \nlenient attitude towards the aggressor on the \npretext of leaving the possibility open of \npersuading it to desist from its aggressive \npolicies can lead only to more acts of \naggression, more crimes and more disregard of the \nwill of the international community.\n232.\tNo country in the world\u2014either in the \nancient or in the modem world\u2014has a record as \ndark as Israel's. It is a record abounding in \nracist crimes, acts of aggression, wars and \ncrimes against humanity. Israel has thus exceeded \nall the crimes perpetrated by the Nazis and the \nFascist forces during the first half of this \ncentury. Recent history has not seen another \naggressor like Israel, which has shelled houses \nwith bombs of a type never before used in war, \nthereby killing countless innocent women, \nchildren and elderly people. A look at the \ndestroyed, burnt and bereaved city of Beirut is \nproof enough of the nature of Israel and of its \naims.\n233.\tIn spite of all this the Israelis still \nclaim that they want peace. Is that any different \nfrom what the Nazis used to say when they were \ndestroying towns and villages and killing the \ninnocent population, including women and \nchildren? Israelis claim they want peace; what \nthey want is the peace of the grave.\n234.\tPeace cannot be bused on aggression, \noppres\u00acsion, killing and destruction; nor can it \nbe based on racist and aggressive doctrines. The \nArabs believe in the importance of establishing a \njust and lasting peace in the region. They also \nunderstand the repercussions of events in the \nregion on the interests and the future of the \npeoples of the world. But they should not have to \npay a price for their belief in peace, justice \nand right.\n235.\tDespite all the tragedies suffered by the \nArabs as a result of the aggressive presence of \nthe Israelis in the region, and in spite of the \nwars waged by Israeli troops in Lebanon against \nthe Arab nation, at the recent Twelfth Arab \nSummit Conference, held at Fez, a peace plan was \nannounced based on the following principles: \nfirst, complete Israeli withdrawal from all the \noccupied Arab territories; secondly, recognition \nof the inalienable national rights of the \nPalestinian Arab people, including their right to \nreturn, to self-determination and to establish \ntheir own inde\u00acpendent State under the leadership \nof the PLO, their sole legitimate representative; \nand, thirdly, the formulation by the Security \nCouncil of the guarantees of peace. The Security \nCouncil would guarantee the implementation of \nthese principles, which are based on two things: \nthe relevant United Nations resolutions and the \nCharter, and the Arabs' conviction that peace is \nimportant and necessary for the international \ncom\u00acmunity.\n236.\tIn announcing these principles, which are \nrecog\u00acnized by the United Nations and by most \ncountries of the world, the Arabs are well aware \nthat Israel is seeking not peace based on right \nand justice, but rather to impose capitulation by \nforce, aggression and oppression.\n237.\tToday more than ever before we are \nconfident that the Arabs will defeat the \naggressor. They will struggle by all means \npossible to recover their rights and resist \naggression, for in doing this they will be \ndefending not only their rights, interests and \ndignity, but those of all other nations as well.\n238.\tThe night of the aggressor shall not \nweaken our struggle against aggression; it will \nonly strengthen and consolidate this struggle. We \nare confident that our Arab nation, despite its \npresent state of affairs, will concert its \nefforts and potential to repel aggression and \ninjustice and to fight humiliation and \nsubjugation.\n239.\tThe States Members of the United Nations \nare required today to take a clear and specific \nstand to protect international peace and security \nand to safeguard the Charter. Such a stand \nrequires a reso\u00aclution that provides for, first, \nceasing all kinds of dealings between the Members \nof the Organization and Israel; secondly, asking \nthe United States of America to stop all forms of \nmilitary, economic and political assistance to \nIsrael; thirdly, adopting a resolution abrogating \nGeneral Assembly resolu\u00action 273 (III) of 1949 \nunder which Israel was admitted to United Nations \nmembership; fourthly, extending all forms of \nassistance and backing to the Arab coun\u00actries to \nresist and confront the aggression.\n240.\tA resolution to that effect would not \nonly repel the aggression but would consolidate \nthe role of the Organization and prevent the \nthreat to peace and security not only in the \nMiddle East region but also throughout the world. \nIt is high time that the Organiza\u00action adopted a \npractical position to face the series of Israeli \nacts of aggression; otherwise one would be \nskeptical about the usefulness of the \nOrganization.\n241.\tWhile asking all countries of the world \nto back up and support Arab rights, which are the \nvictim of Israeli aggression, we renew our \ndetermination to continue the struggle by all \nmeans to defend our threatened existence and to \nrestore our usurped rights, no matter how \ndifficult, arduous and long our path may be. \nDifficulties and hardships will never hinder or \nrestrict the struggle of the people for their \nliberty and dignity.\n"

It is our profound hope that your presidency will be carried \nout with the equanimity, foresight, wisdom and high diplomatic skills \nwhich have always characterized you and won for you the respect and \nesteem of us all. I should also like to transmit to your illustrious \npredecessor, Mr. Kittani, our appreciation for the effective manner \nin which he discharged his functions during the last session. We \nparticularly wish to congratulate Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the \nSecretary-General, on his election to the lofty responsibility of \nensuring the administrative and political functioning of the Head \nquarters of our great community. We are certain that his stature as \nan accredited diplomat and his vast knowledge of the machinery of the \nUnited Nations system will ensure that the difficult tasks entrusted \nto him will be carried out with guarantees of certainty and \neffectiveness.\n\n3. On my delegation's behalf, it is my pleasant duty to express our \nsincere gratitude to the Government of the United States of America, \nand in particular to the authorities of the State of New York, for \nthe hospitality that has always been lavished upon us and for making \navailable to us the material and spiritual conditions necessary for \nthe success of sessions of the General Assembly.\n\n6.\tThree years ago a representative of the people of Equatorial \nGuinea came before the Assembly at this podium to announce to the \ninternational community the action taken by the Equatorial Armed \nForces which, on the dawn of 3 August 1979, decided to do away with \nthe blood-stained regime of the wretched tyrant Macias Nguema.\n\n7.\tThree years ago, in the same statement, the Government of the \nSupreme Military Council, established by that liberating action of \nthe people of Equatorial Guinea undertook freely and resolutely, \nbefore the world and history, the sacred obligation of making every \nnecessary effort to remove my people from the abandonment and \ndestruction in which it had been plunged by the former regime.\n\n8.\tOf course, the Government of the Supreme Military Council had \nno idea of the enormous difficulties that would later arise in the \ncountry's reconstruction. Indeed, the difficulties were and are \nenormous and multiple, since our task consists in eliminating the \ntrauma from the minds of the citizens of Equatorial Guinea and \nbuilding a new and different society. To this end, we have the urgent \nneed to give priority to rehabilitating those fields of activity most \nimportant to the normalization of life in Equatorial Guinea, namely, \nhealth, education, agriculture and, above all, the economy-the \ndecisive factor in the entire process of our reconstruction and \ndevelopment.\n\n9.\tToday we can be proud of having worked honestly and \nresolutely, facing every difficulty and overcoming all kinds of \nobstacles to achieve some positive goals along the Ions and difficult \nroad of reconstruction. Our achievements can be seen by all in \nEquatorial Guinea, and it would be too much for me to try to list \nthem here, achievements which, I must add, would not have been \npossible without the decisive support of the international community.\n\n10.\tWhen, in order to bring about the economic relaunching of \nEquatorial Guinea and in response to the pathetic appeal made by my \ncountry, the United Nations approved the holding of an international \npledging conference at Geneva, we could not have guessed the \nsignificance it would have for our country. That Conference, held at \nGeneva in the month of April last-and attended personally by Colonel \nObiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of the Republic-represented for my \ncountry a propitious opportunity for us to present in a clear, \nconcise and detailed manner to the international community an \ninventory of our most urgent needs and the projects we have for \nsolving them gradually, and at the same time to request assistance \nfrom international financial circles in obtaining contributions for \nthe financing of those projects.\n\n11.\tThrough not only the assistance but also the interest and \nunderstanding of the international community, we were able to revise \nour forecasts, which were a source of great satisfaction to us, and \nwe are very grateful to the countries which attended the Pledging \nConference and showed interest in several of the projects we \nsubmitted there. We are also grateful to the governmental and \nnon-governmental organizations which also showed an interest in our \nprojects and to the United Nations system which, with special zeal \nand sincerity, worked ceaselessly to ensure the smooth running and \nsuccess of the Conference, whose results are already being made \nvisible in Equatorial Guinea through the large number of \nrepresentatives of countries and international organizations who have \ncome to maintain the first contacts and evaluate on the spot the \npossibilities of carrying out the proposed projects within the \ncontext of that Conference.\n\n12.\tI have been specially asked by the President of the Republic \nto avail myself of this opportunity to express, on behalf of the \nGovernment and people of Equatorial Guinea, our sincere gratitude to \nall those who participated in or contributed in any way to that \nConference, and our thanks for the fruitful results it achieved. It \nis an obvious proof of solidarity which the people of Equatorial \nGuinea will never forget, and we are confident that the spirit of \nthat Conference will be kept alive and fervent, and that there will \nbe increasing interest in assisting our country both on the part of \nthe countries which attended the Conference, and on the part of those \nwhich, while not having been able to attend, feel a sense of \nsolidarity with the cause of my country's reconstruction.\n\n13.\tOne of the most serious injuries suffered by the people of \nEquatorial Guinea during the dictatorship was the undisguised and \nunprecedented suppression of our fundamental rights, leaving the \ncitizen of Equatorial Guinea deprived of his minimum rights. There \nare numerous examples that bear eloquent testimony to the acts of the \npast regime which with impunity cruelly jeopardized those rights. \nTherefore, one of the main goals of the Supreme Military Council, \nwhen it took power on 3 August 1979, was to restore those fundamental \nrights to the people of Equatorial Guinea; and from that very year a \ngradual but firm process of democratization of the country was \ninitiated and measures adopted for the scrupulous and strict respect \nof the human person. On past occasions we listed in various \nstatements the measures we have taken, from the liberation of all \npolitical prisoners to the drafting and presentation to the people of \na Constitution, which our Government has been implementing \nfaithfully, to comply with the promise and commitment entered into \nbefore our people and history.\n\n14.\tIndeed, the Government of the Supreme Military Council, \nfaithfully following the line of conduct it established when it first \ncame to power, and in compliance with General Assembly resolution \n34/123 which established the programme for the gradual \ndemocratization of our country, has lived up to its promise made to \nthe people on the occasion of the second anniversary of the  freedom \ncooup , and has drafted the text of a constitution which, in order to \ncomply with the requirements of our time regarding guarantees of \nhuman freedoms and the principles of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights, it submitted for revision to United Nations experts \nappointed for that purpose by the Division on Human Rights.\n\n15.\tOn 2 August 1982 that Constitution was officially and \nsolemnly presented by Colonel Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of the \nRepublic, to the people of Equatorial Guinea. On 15 August the people \nwas consulted in a popular referendum about whether or not it \naccepted the text of the Constitution. On 21 August, the National \nReferendum Committee announced the official results of that \nreferendum.\n\n16.\tIt is my pleasure here to announce with pride to the \ninternational community that the people of the Republic of Equatorial \nGuinea, in a referendum conducted through a direct, free and secret \nballot, has provided itself with a new democratic constitution, \nsupported by an overwhelming majority of 95 per cent of the votes \ncast, or the basis of a 96 per cent voter turnout.\n\n17.\tOn the same occasion, and in accordance with another \nprovision of the Constitution, Colonel Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, by the \nacclamation of the people and in expression of its free will, was \ncharged with guiding the sacred destiny of Equatorial Guinea for the \nseven years following the adoption of the Constitution.\n\n18.\tThat massive, unanimous election of Colonel Obiang Nguema \nMbasogo to the nation's highest office was free from any trickery and \nresulted from the desire of the people of Equatorial Guinea to \nmaintain continuity in the process of democratization it has \nundertaken, and that the same guiding hand should complete it, before \nproceeding to the general elections to take place at the end of the \nseven-year term of the presidential mandate.\n\n19.\tOur Constitution, the basic code which now rules and guides \nthe sacred destiny of my people, provides for a Council of State, a \nPeople's House of Representatives, a Court of Justice, a National \nCouncil for Economic development and Community Councils. The latter \nare adapted to our national situation for democratization by giving \nthe power structure its roots in the communities, in the countryside.\n\n20.\tWe think we have kept our word to the international \ncommunity, given in the Assembly, and are pleased to have done so \nbefore the time set in a programme drawn up in collaboration with the \nUnited Nations. Our devotion to the people, and our historic \ncommitment to it, have enabled us to provide that people, only three \nyears after taking power, with a democratic constitution, with all \nthe organs and conditions required to ensure scrupulous respect of \nits basic rights and the enjoyment of a state of law, in keeping with \nthe standards of the second half of the twentieth century.\n\n21.\tWe are fully convinced that, just as it responded massively \nand affirmatively in favour of the Constitution, our people will also \nbe able to live up to it by safeguarding and respecting it, so that, \nwith the Constitution as our cornerstone and beacon, we shall go \nforward together in peace and national harmony to accomplish the very \ndifficult task of reconstructing the country.\n\n22.\tBasic difficulties-such as those we face in the area of food \nand, above all, in restoring the country to economic health-have \nshown us that our strength is limited, although our efforts are \nenormous. We are therefore certain that we cannot travel this hard \nroad on our own, without the steadfast assistance of the \ninternational community, whether bilateral or multilateral.\n\n23.\tRegarding bilateral relations, we have sought to break with \nthe isolation which the past regime imposed on our people for more \nthan a decade, and we have not only succeeded in re-establishing \ninternational credibility and trust, but have greatly strengthened \nthe links that unite us with neighbouring countries, with the African \ncontinent, and the world in general, without ideological or bloc \ndiscrimination.\n\n24.\tin this connection it is my honour to mention the excellent \nrelations of co-operation between the Republic of Equatorial Guinea \nwith Spain, whose assistance has always been decisive for our \ncountry, as well as the relations we maintain with France, the United \nStates of America, the People's Republic of China, Morocco, the \nFederal Republic of Germany, Switzerland and Egypt, to name but a \nfew. These are countries whose co-operation has already taken \npositive form in Equatorial Guinea.\n\n25.\tOur relations of co-operation with the neighbouring brother \ncountries of the United Republic of Cameroon, the Republic of Gabon \nand the Federal Republic of Nigeria are excellent, for those \ncountries have spared neither effort nor moral and material means to \nencourage us and spur us on to continue resolutely the great task of \nreconstruction express, before the Assembly, our deepest gratitude to \nthem. We have signed agreements on bilateral co-operation with Sao \nTome and Principe.\n\n26.\tAs to the community of Hispanic nations, we are aware of the \naffinities and identity which unite us to it, and we are making every \neffort to achieve greater integration and to establish solid links \nwith our brothers in Latin America and the Caribbean region. There \nare already joint projects with the Argentine Republic, and our ties \nwith other countries such as Venezuela, Cuba and Mexico, are \nstrengthening and are becoming increasingly positive.\n\n27.\tIn a world like ours in the second half of the twentieth \ncentury, our concerns can only grow. We believe that this rostrum-the \nAssembly-is the most appropriate place to denounce the alarming and \ngrowing abandonment by nations of the principle of dialogue in favour \nof the spirit of war and confrontation. The cold war, which, during \nthe post-war years, had itself been a threat hovering over the \npeoples, has dangerously given way to the proliferation of armed \nconfrontations.\n\n28.\tNational leaders are growing more intransigent, and the \nresults of this are there to be seen: self-destruction and the tens \nof thousands of human beings who are paying with their lives for wars \nwaged for sterile claims. Such problems are of profound concern to my \nGovernment; they are to be seen far beyond the walls of this Hall, \nand it is imperative that practical solutions be found. I refer \nespecially-but only by way of example-to the conflict between Iraq \nand the Islamic Republic of Iran, the question of the Malvinas, the \noccupation of Cyprus, the situation on the Korean peninsula, a \npractical satisfactory solution for which has been sought since 1966 \nwithout success, the untenable status of Namibia.\n\n29.All these problems have a significant effect on the noble \nprinciples of the self-determination of peoples, respect for human \nrights and non-interference in the internal affairs of States, \nprinciples to which my Government adheres and abides by. Along with \nthis, there is the constant tension in the Middle East, which has \nbecome more acute with the invasion of Lebanon and the killing of \nPalestinians by Israel forces, which constitute flagrant flouting of \nthe inalienable rights of an entire people. Further, terrorism runs \nrampant in Europe.\n\n30.\tThe African continent continues to be the theatre for \nmilitary operations and adventures by non-African Powers. Those \nPowers are fomenting discord and confrontation among our States, in \norder to weaken us and freely to exploit our resources, imposing on \nus truly humiliating trading conditions.\n\n31.\tThe tensions which exist are well known and do not need a \nspecial review at this time, for they are always a part of the daily \nlife of our continent and pose a grave threat to the Organization of \nAfrican Unity [OAU]- This is not the time for a detailed analysis of \nthis tragic problem, for we believe that that analysis and a solution \nto the problem are an inter-African responsibility.\n\n32.\tNevertheless we appeal to African States to show maturity and \nfind a single firm and decisive solution to the crisis, one \nrespecting the integrity and inviolability of the fundamental \nprinciples of the charter of the OAU. We cannot permit the \ndisintegration of the OAU because our solidarity would thereby be \nprofoundly affected, as it is our best weapon in our struggle against \nthe political, economic and social injustices from which the African \ncontinent suffers.\n\n33.\tWe are pleased at the return to order in Chad and we wish \nthat brother people peace and prosperity.\n\n34.\tIn accordance with this line of thinking, the people of \nEquatorial Guinea, in the person of its President, Colonel Obiang \nNguema Mbasogo, whom I have the honour to represent in the Assembly, \nis in favour of finding immediate and positive solutions to these \ndisputes by way of dialogue and mutual understanding, involving the \nconsistent, clear, and literal implementation of the relevant \nresolutions on these disputes adopted by this great Organization.\n\n35.\tAs Vice-President of the Supreme Military Council, and having \nthe honour of representing the President of the Republic, it remains \nonly for me to reiterate to the Assembly that my Government is \nresolutely determined to promote the social and economic development \nof our country, strictly and faithfully to comply with the process of \ndemocratization which we have started, to respect the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights and to make every effort to help \nestablish solid foundations for peace in the world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great and significant honour for me to come to this rostrum \nrepresenting my country before the world.\n\n38.\tMy first words go to you, Mr. President, to congratulate you \non your well-deserved election as President of this session of the \nAssembly. Your unmistakable gifts as an experienced diplomat \nguarantee the success of our work. It is a pleasure, and not merely a \nformality, for me to convey the thanks and congratulations of my \nGovernment to Mr. Kittani of Iraq for the wise and successful way in \nwhich he carried out his duties as President of the thirty-sixth \nsession.\n\n39.\tRecently the United Nations has seen its mission even further \nenriched by the appointment as Secretary-General of one of its most \ndistinguished officials, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, a most worthy \nrepresentative of Peruvian diplomacy. Bolivia reiterates its pleasure \nat his appointment and its congratulations and best wishes to him, \nthe first Secretary-General representing Latin America, and the \nbrotherly and ancestral ties between Bolivia and Peru and the Andean \ncountries are well known. His presence as Secretary-General is a \nsound guarantee for the fulfilment of the purposes of the \nOrganization.\n\n40.\tFor years we have been expressing our faith and reiterating \nour purposes. Every year we come here and repeat our intention to \ncarry out the purposes and principles of the Charter. We announce \noptimistic outlines for the future and the definite achievement of \nour aims. However, realistically and objectively I think we must now \npause on our way to see whether we have really moved beyond mere \nstatements to concrete achievement.\n\n41.\tPeace is still an unachievable goal and perhaps, sad to say, \na nostalgic dream of Utopia. Colonialism still seeks to broaden its \nareas of domination, with aggressive and even bloody usurpation; \nhegemony and the use of pressure by the powerful still persevere and \nindeed show a disturbing tendency to increase. Inequalities and \ninjustices continue to show their ugly faces. Terrorism and new \ntreacherous forms of aggression, under cover of the advocacy of \nchange, disrupt every form of coexistence. Racial discrimination \ncontinues as a flaw of mankind in our time. Territories conquered by \nforce of arms remain in foreign hands.\nArms manufacture and the development of new and powerful means of \ndestruction cast gloom over the positive achievements of our \ncivilization, and now there is a real danger that tomorrow, just as \nthe twenty-first century is about to begin, we may find ourselves \nwith a world in ruins unless common sense prevails.\n\n42.\tThese are some glimpses of the realities of today's world, \nwhich persist despite the efforts of the Organization. My delegation \nwould like to state certain views on these matters, as an expression \nof the unswerving Bolivian position on principles and international \npolicies.\n\n43.\tBolivia is one of the non-aligned countries, for compelling \nreasons of principle and also because we advocate the elimination of \ndogmatic compartmentalization and hegemonic bonds and because \nself-determination and the inviolability of sovereignty are the \nproper response to the efforts of the various forms of imperialism to \nabsorb others. The non-aligned countries advocate a role of balance \nin defence of the rights of the weaker countries in the face of the \ncold struggle by the great Powers for supremacy.\n\n44.\tThose who supply raw materials and make great sacrifices in \ntheir struggle to achieve their development have their spokesmen in \nthe non-aligned countries. The demands and claims made by many of our \npeoples have received a positive echo in the voice of the non-aligned \ncountries. That is the case, forexample, with Bolivia's demand for \nthe restoration of its sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. Only an \nequidistant position between the imperialist forces, avoiding \nsubjugation and imposed conditions, can grant a country moral \nauthority and consideration in international affairs, and that is \nprecisely the position which the non-aligned countries seek.\n\n45.\tIt is this unswerving support for the principles of self-determination \nand sovereignty which has led the Government of Bolivia, presided \nover by General Guido Vildoso Calderon, to apply a policy of a return \nto democratic institutional rights for our people.\n\n46.\tIn Bolivia we have set in motion the pre-electoral process, \nwith the scheduling of a general election for April 1983. The \nconsensus achieved among the political parties on the basis of the \ninvitation to participate made by the Government without any \ndiscrimination has led to the constitution of a National Electoral \nCourt. We have also started on the study of a plan for economic \nrecovery in order to apply emergency provisions to overcome the \nsituation of deficit and the serious crisis inherited by the present \nGovernment. As a result of a study, the economic plan was, also on \nthe basis of consultations, brought to the notice of the political \nforces and the trade unions; a political and economic dialogue thus \ntook place.\n\n47.\tGiving effect to the general feelings expressed by the \npolitical parties and labour representatives, who requested an \nimmediate transition to a democratic system, the Bolivian Government \nhas decided to convene the representative Parliament elected in the \n1980 elections, which had been suspended by a military coup at the \ntime, so that that Parliament will, in accordance with the norms of \nthe political Constitution of the State, appoint the new office \nholders who will have charge of the nation from 10 October next. For \nthem and their arduous task in government we request the solidarity \nof all nations, particularly on account of the grave economic crisis \nthat my country is experiencing. The new constitutional authorities \nwill have to overcome that crisis and will need all the co-operation \nthat they can possibly obtain from friendly countries-combined, of \ncourse, with Bolivia's own efforts-in order that Bolivia may progress.\n\n48.\tAll this process of transition to democracy has taken place \nwithin the framework of an unchanging respect for human rights and \nthe prerogatives of the citizens and on the basis of the fulfilment \nof the treaties and international commitments entered into by Bolivia.\n\n49.\tOn 10 October next the armed forces of Bolivia will restore \nthe political control of the nation to a civilian Government. This \nvoluntary gesture, in keeping with the wishes of the Bolivian people, \nis worth emphasizing in this international forum.\n\n50.\tAnother subject which I cannot refrain from mentioning is \nthat of the progress of integration. Happily, we are living in a time \nof integration and economic co-operation, of interdependence. All \nnations-literally all-need something from others. There is inevitably \na need for raw materials, goods and services, technology, credits and \nassistance of all sorts. What is important is that the prices should \nbe fair, exchanges just and that co-operation have but one aim-to \nsecure the goal of shared development and common benefit. ..\n\n51.\tIn the regional and sub-regional spheres Bolivia has been \ntaking part in all the programmes of integration and co-operation. \nIts special geographical location in South America and the fact that \nit is a country with tributaries of three of the four major river \nbasins of the continent has given it a unique status as a signatory \ncountry of all the sub-regional agreements as well as the regional \ntreaties of the Latin American Integration Association and the Latin \nAmerican Economic System. For example, we are a member of the \nCartagena Agreement, binding on the Andean nations, and a signatory \nof the Treaty for Amazonian Co-operation and the Treaty of the River \nPlate Basin.\n\n52.\tThe Bolivian position with regard to the process of \nintegration is clear. We uphold the need to preserve, expand and \nimprove the machinery of the integration process. Integration and the \nprogrammes and actions for co-operation are only a means towards the \nends of development and the harmonious progress of our nations. We \nmust also nurture, strengthen and improve those instruments of \neconomic and social progress, whose sole beneficiaries must of course \nbe our peoples and their future.\n\n53.\tWe must also make the North-South dialogue a reality and seek \nways to give viable form to the new international economic order. \nThis scheme has so far not had the acceptance, the solidarity and \nparticularly the political will of the industrialized nations, which \nit needs if its basic objectives are to be met.\n\n54.\tThese problems, therefore, should be seen as part of the \nstruggle for economic, political, social and cultural liberation of \npeoples who, like those of Bolivia, are currently engaged in their \nown development. If manifest unwillingness and delaying tactics \ncontinue to be shown, it will be impossible to intensify the \nco-operation which at the international level should promote the \ndevelopment of nations in a setting of justice and equity. We \ntherefore look forward very much to the prompt initiation of the \nglobal negotiations.\n\n55.\tUnderstanding, co-operation and the processes of integration \nhave another requirement in order to be perfect-the redressing of \ninjustices and inequalities, I must refer once again, before the \nworld community assembled here, to our geographical condition-the \nfact that we are landlocked, a fact that has been forced upon us for \nthe past 103 years. This reference also derives from the imperative \nmandate given by my people, who for more than a century have pressed \nfor their rights to return, with sovereignty, to the shores of the \nPacific.\n\n56.\tWe all know that when they have the stamp of legitimacy the \nrights of nations are never exhausted. Therefore, the return of \nterritories which have been usurped in so many latitudes of the world \nis essential.\n\n57.\tWith regard to the maritime problem of Bolivia, the time of \nour return to the Pacific Ocean is bound to come. But good faith is \nnecessary for this, together with a clear readiness by the other \nparty to make reparations. We also need action and the encouragement \nand support of the international organizations, particularly if, as \nis fortunately the case, we have the firm support of the majority of \nthe world community for our just cause.\n\n58.\tHumanity has virtually put an end to one of the most \ndegrading and odious systems adopted by man in the past-slavery. But, \nlate in the twentieth century, still other grievous vestiges of the \npast remain as an affront to mankind-colonialism and racial \ndiscrimination.\n\n59 Twenty-two years have elapsed since the general  Assembly adopted \nthe Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries \nand Peoples. Each year we revert to the terms of that declaration and \nthe general  Assembly adopts new resolutions on specific cases. \nNevertheless, new forms of colonialist aggression can be clearly \nseen, not simply disregarding the principles and purposes of the \nCharter but clearly violating them. A recent example was the case of \nthe Malvinas Islands, with its bloody epilogue, leading to the \nrestoration of colonialism, which should give us food for serious \nthought.\n\n60.\tFaithful to its position of principle on the rejection of any \nform of colonialism, Bolivia supported the Argentine cause and will \ncontinue to support the demands for repossession of its territory \nmade by our brother nation of the River Plate, as we have done since \n1833, when the President of Bolivia at that time was the first to \nspeak up against the British usurpation of that era.\n\n61.\tWe can never try hard enough in the Organization to put an \nend to colonialism and all forms of seizure of territories and the \nimposition of tutelage and foreign rule on peoples. On the day we \ndispose of these last vestiges of colonialism mankind will be able to \ntake pride in having taken an enormous step towards a world of truly \nfree communities, such as those for which the Liberator Bolivar \nfought. His bicentenary is to be commemorated next year, and I am \nsure that the Organization will wish to participate in commemorating \nthat anniversary, thereby confirming the universal nature of \nBolivar's thinking and deeds.\n\n62.\tWith regard to racial discrimination and apartheid my \ncountry's consistent attitude has been one of opposition and \ncondemnation of thatsituation and system, which are a breach of the \nelementary principles of equality and human rights.\n\n63.\tMan holds certain rights even before his birth. if we commit \na breach of those rights; we offend God, who modelled our spirit on \nHis image and in His likeness.\n\n64.\t1 said at the beginning of this statement that peace was an \nobjective that the wortd had not yet achieved. The recent distressing \nevents in the Middle East, particularly those in Lebanon, give some \nidea of the deplorable situation.\n\n65.\tI must express here the deep concern of the Bolivian \ncommunity and its Government over the now long-drawn-out crisis in \nthe Middle East, which has so grievously affected various peoples in \nthe region. We must strive to find there an understanding which, with \nrecognition of the rights of the countries involved, will bring about \na return to peaceful coexistence and mutual respect.\n\n66.\tViolence can only give rise to greater violence and peace is \nnot a free gift; it must be built carefully, with sacrifice and \nmagnanimity.\n\n67.\tThe mission of the United Nations with regard to the problems \nof the Middle East and of the world in general  is still an arduous \none requiring unswerving commitment. We must all be committed to this \ntask if we want to show that man is capable of thinking of the \nfuture, using his intelligence to coexist and to build, to reconcile \ndiffering views and not to hate, thus overcoming a shameful recent \npast, which paradoxically encompassed the greatest examples of \nbarbarity and tragedy as well as the greatest achievements of the \ntechnological era. The answer to the challenge of the years to come \nties within us; it is the possibility of offering the coming \ngenerations a world of harmony, peace and justice.\n\n68.\tThese difficult problems concerning peaceful coexistence lead \nto another major theme of our age. I am referring to the problem of \ndisarmament. A Bolivian writer has said:\n\n  Two of the greatest mistakes made by mankind were to condemn \nSocrates and to manufacture the atomic bomb. The first did violence \nto, the meaning of justice; the second showed man the road to his own \ndestruction.\n\n69.\tInstruments have been adopted by the United Nations and at \nthe multilateral and bilateral levels on the need for disarmament and \nthe prohibition of nuclear weapons including resolutions banning test \nexplosions in the atmosphere and under water. In open contradiction \nwith these commitments, however, the arms build-up, the \nsophistication of weapons and the production of new and menacing \nmeans of destruction have continued. Unfortunately, each conflict \ngives rise to improvements in and new uses for the means of warfare, \nas was the case in the recent painful conflict over the Malvinas.\n\n70.\tPerhaps what is needed to stop the arms build-up is in the \nfirst place spiritual disarmament: the elimination of hatred and \nprejudice; the liquidation of barriers of ideological animosity; the \npromotion of fellowship, bearing in mind that mankind is after all a \nsingle entity and that fraternal understanding is possible.\n\n71.\tThe period of multiple crises which mankind is once again \nexperiencing is straining our capacity to face up to the challenge it \npresents and our courage. The Organization is again being put to the \ntest and we the Members must not evade this tremendous challenge but \nmeet it head on. The principles of the Charter and all the \nresolutions and declarations generated by the problems of the word \nform a basic body of norms accepted by all the word. We must now show \nthat we can go beyond the spirit and the letter of those documents \nand are capable of establishing peaceful coexistence, with freedom, \nbread and love for all the people of our earth.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, please accept my warm congratulations on your election \nto your high office. It is a great pleasure to see the representative \nof the fraternal Hungarian People's Republic presiding over the \nthirty seventh session of the General Assembly and we wish you every \nsuccess in your work.\nThe period since the last regular session of the Assembly has been \nfilled with complex and contradictory events. The peoples have \npersistently demanded that the threat of nuclear war be averted, the \narms race curbed and disarmament achieved, but those in the \nbelligerent circles of imperialism have been accelerating the arms \nrace and pushing the world towards nuclear catastrophe. Mass anti war \ndemonstrations have gained in strength, and we have been deafened by \nthe explosion of the bombs of the aggressors. The national liberation \nmovements have broadened in scope, and the colonialists and racists \nhave mounted ominous plans for suppressing, those movements. Peace \nloving peoples have won new and constructive victories, while the \nforces of imperialism and reaction have developed monstrous doctrines \nand programmes for the mass extermination of human beings and to \nundermine the process of detente and co operation. In this new tense \ninternational situation the peoples of the world are once again \nrealizing that there is no task more important or more urgent today \nthan that of defending peace and averting the threat of nuclear war. \nThat cannot be refuted by those whose statements at this session have \nconstituted merely another routine attempt to distort the real \npicture of the present day world and to shift all the blame for its \ntroubles from themselves to innocent parties.\nAs has already been noted during this session of the General \nAssembly, the current aggravation of the international situation and \nthe mounting threat of war are due to the fact that some Western \nStates, above all the United States, persist in policies inimical to \nthe interests of peace. The situation is all the more alarming in \nthat some of those States are permanent members of the Security \nCouncil and their policies are totally in conflict with the \nparticular responsibility for international security and the \npreservation of peace that the Charter places upon them.\nA close analysis of statements by leading United States officials on \nthe substance of the military and political problems, in the world \ntoday and a careful analysis of the goals of the intensive rearmament \nprogramme that has been launched in the United States and of the \nstrategic concepts being put forward cannot but show that \nWashington's present course is by no means peace oriented. We have \nall heard the frank statement at the 11th meeting by the United \nStates Secretary of State, Mr. Shultz, that the United States is \nguided in its actions by the principle of the position of force and \nwill be unswerving in its use of it. Is this not an express policy of \nmilitary and political confrontation, a policy of seizing dominant \npositions on a global scale is it not making this all part of a \nfundamental principle\nIt would be difficult to imagine a political credo in greater \nopposition to the requirements of the Charter. The policy of \ndiscarding in practice the principle of equality and equal security, \nwhich, in this nuclear age, is an absolutely vital principle, erodes \nthe mainstays of the structure of relations between States and \ncontributes to the threat of war.\nThe United States is provoking tension and protracting conflicts; it \nacts on its own behalf and through proxies in order to justify the \nfurther buildup of arms and its growing demand that its allies toe \nthe line. The United States is instigating an anti communist crusade \nand is spreading lies about an alleged Soviet threat and other \nfabrications in order to impose its latest missiles on the \nterritories of others and to cause an impasse in disarmament talks. \nThose provocative actions are camouflaged by demagogic utterances \nabout a commitment to peace through strength; to the prevention of \nwars in general. But the legitimate question arises of whether the \nauthors of those pronouncements did not indeed have an opportunity, \nfor example, to prevent or halt the Israeli aggression in Lebanon.\nActing at variance with the commitment to prevent nuclear war they \nentered into in the 1970s, Washington's strategists are now \nproclaiming the admissibility and even the acceptability of a nuclear \nconflict. The world has been subjected to cynical bombast about \nfirst, second and subsequent nuclear strikes, about nuclear \nescalation in doses, about demonstrative and selective use of nuclear \nweapons, and so forth. Over the past year and a half, the United \nStates has put forward more different concepts of the use of force \nprimarily in a nuclear context than in any preceding decade. They \ntalk about a secured nuclear war, then they talk about limited war, \nabout blitzkrieg, and about protracted war.\nAll these statements and actions are permeated with the idea of the \nfirst use of nuclear weapons and an insane reliance on winning a \nnuclear victory. Such notions are the sheerest adventurism, fraught \nwith enormous dangers for mankind. They constitute nothing but naked \nwar propaganda. There can be no doubt that any use of nuclear weapons \nwill cause a chain reaction. That being so, strategic planning of \nthis kind, in any of its versions, represents in actual fact planning \nfor a nuclear catastrophe. But those so called planners ought to be \nreminded that planning and preparation for of aggression are \nqualified in international instruments specifically in the Charter of \nthe United Nations, in the judgment of the Nuremberg International \nMilitary Tribunal, and in the Definition of Aggression and other \nUnited Nations documents as a crime against peace and against \nhumanity. Military political stereotypes inherited from the time of \nthe former monopoly on the atom bomb are now outmoded. In his message \nat the twelfth special session the second special session of the \nGeneral Assembly devoted to disarmament, the General Secretary of the \nCentral Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and \nPresident of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Mr. \nLeonid Brezhnev, described as indisputable and determinant the fact \nthat nuclear war, should it break out, could, in the current \ninternational situation, mean the destruction of human civilization \nand perhaps  en the end of life on Earth.\nSuch is the harsh imperative of this nuclear age: there can be no \nsecurity for anyone through nuclear adventurism. A nuclear Power can \nbe secure only if its foreign and military policies pose no threat to \nany other country. As to notions that one's own security can be \nstrengthened by chasing the phantom of military supremacy, plans to \nachieve such supremacy simply cannot be carried out, and measures \nundertaken to that end can only aggravate military nations and lower \nthe level of security for all.\nWhile, in this nuclear age, strategic stability based on an \napproximate balance of forces is an extremely important basis for \nuniversal security, it is no guarantee of that security. Mankind can \nfree itself from the deadly threat only by gradually lowering the \nlevel of military confrontation, through the implementation of agreed \nmeasures on the limitation and reduction of armaments and on \ndisarmament. There is no other way, for security and disarmament are \ninseparably linked.\nToday's realities demand the adoption of urgent and effective \nmeasures for the prevention of nuclear war. Particular responsibility \nfor that lies with the permanent members of the Security Council \nwhich are in addition nuclear weapon Powers. In present conditions. \nthe commitment by each nuclear weapon Power not to be the first to \nuse nuclear weapons would be of key significance for removing the \nthreat of nuclear war. That is the express duty of the nuclear \nPowers; it is their primary responsibility towards mankind.\nAs is known, the USSR, which takes a. very serious view of its status \nas a nuclear Power and as a permanent member of the Security Council, \nhas already shouldered that responsibility. The step taken by the \nUSSR is a powerful stimulus for the drastic of the threat of nuclear \nwar and for the strengthening of trust in relations between States. \nThe exclusion from international relations of force in all its \nmanifestations, both nuclear and conventional, would be fostered by \nearly completion of the work on a world treaty on the non use of \nforce in international relations, a draft of which was submitted by \nthe Soviet Union in 1976 for consideration by the United Nations. A \nset of specific and constructive proposals set out in the memorandum \nof the USSR on Averting the growing nuclear threat and curbing the \narms race, which was submitted to the Assembly at its second special \nsession devoted to disarmament creates possibilities for making \nprogress along all avenues leading to the limitation and radical \nreduction of armaments, whether nuclear weapons, other weapons of \nmass destruction, including chemical weapons, conventional weapons, \nor naval activities. There is no kind of weapon which the Soviet \nUnion would not be prepared to limit or ban on a basis of \nreciprocity. Further evidence of the readiness of the USSR to reduce \nthe nuclear threat, to curb the arms race and to make our planet \nsafer for life and for constructive work is provided by the proposals \naimed at the speedy cessation and total prohibition of nuclear \nweapon testing; these were formulated with due regard for the views \nand suggestions of many countries, including suggestions regarding \nverification and regarding an appeal to all the nuclear Powers to \ndeclare, within an agreed time frame, a moratorium on all nuclear \nexplosions, pending the conclusion of a treaty banning them \ncompletely.\nThe USSR initiative entitled Intensification of efforts to remove the \nthreat of nuclear war and to ensure a safe development of nuclear \nenergy is also of vast significance. That proposal develops further \nthe work already begun on questions of preventing nuclear war and of \nnuclear disarmament ranging from a simultaneous freeze on the \nproduction and deployment of nuclear weapons and their delivery \nvehicles to the elimination of existing nuclear capabilities as well \nas of strengthening the security of non nuclear countries. It is \ndesigned to ensure the safe development of nuclear energy for \nconstructive purposes in all countries. Any destruction of non \nmilitary nuclear facilities should unquestionably be qualified as a \nnuclear attack, which, in the definition of the United Nations, is \nthe gravest crime against humanity.\nThe aggressive actions of the imperialists and their henchmen even \ntoday are leading to bloodshed in many flashpoints on our planet. A \ntypical example of this reign of bloody terror a war of annihilation \nwhich is nothing short of genocide is the aggression launched by \nIsrael against Lebanon and the Arab people of Palestine. The tragedy \nin Lebanon has shaken the entire world and provided yet further \nevidence that in this latest criminal adventure, in addition to all \nthe others, the strategic allies, Israel and the United States, acted \nhand in hand.\nScores of thousands of human beings and the destiny of hundreds of \nthousands more, have fallen victim to the most sophisticated American \nmilitary technology, tried out with the help of Israel in Lebanon. In \nshamelessly arming the aggressor, which has repeatedly been condemned \nby the United Nations, and overtly and covertly acting as its \naccomplice, the United States contrary to its obligations as a \npermanent member of the Security Council is doing everything possible \nto establish in that area an order which would enable it and its \nhenchmen to do as they please in other people's territories.\nHowever, they should know better than to labor under such a delusion. \nAttempts to rule the destinies of the peoples of the Middle East from \nWashington or Tel Aviv are inevitably doomed to failure. The selfless \nstruggle of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the \nPalestine Liberation Organization, the courage and determination of \nthe Syrians and the Lebanese, have clearly demonstrated this. The new \nplan for a Middle East settlement which has been announced by the \nPresident of the United States and widely publicized does not contain \nanything new. The United States proposals are flawed in their very \nessence. They fail to provide for the liberation of all Arab \nterritories seized in 1967, deny the right of the Palestinians to \ncreate their own State and disregard the PLO, This is nothing but a \ncontinuance of the treacherous Camp David policy of acquiescence, \ndesigned to enslave the peoples of that region.\nOur position on the Middle East problem has always been and continues \nto be crystal clear. The complex problem of the Middle East can be \nresolved only by the concerted efforts of all the parties concerned, \nwhich must certainly include the PLO, the sole legitimate \nrepresentative of the Arab people of Palestine. This problem cannot \nbe resolved without strict observance of the principle of the \ninadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by forces; the \nrecognition and exercise of the right of the Arab people of Palestine \nto self determination and to create their own independent State on \nPalestinian soil, which must be freed from Israeli occupation; and \nensuring the right of all States of the region to a secure existence \nand development in conditions of mutual respect for sovereignty, \nindependence and territorial integrity, with appropriate \ninternational guarantees.\nThis is the only course that will lead to a settlement, as envisaged \nin the Soviet proposal on the convening of an international \nconference on the Middle East. The results of the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference at Fez constitute a constructive contribution to the \nsettlement process. We take a positive view of the principles that \nwere adopted at that Conference for the solution of the Palestinian \nquestion and the Middle East problem as a whole.\nNowadays it is more necessary than ever before for political leaders \nto demonstrate common sense, clear sightedness, prudence and genuine \nrealism in their approach to the problems that arise. We should also, \nof course, be guided always by the fact that international detente \ncalls for peaceful co operation with other States, not military \npreparations or hostility toward other States. Detente is a \nconscientious observance in good faith of the norms of international \nlaw and the principle of non intervention in the internal affairs of \nothers. It also implies a constant desire to contribute by practical \naction to curbing the arms race in the world and strengthening \nsecurity by gradually building up mutual confidence on a just and \nreciprocal basis. This is exactly what the States of the socialist \ncommunity are doing. Unfortunately, this cannot be said for the \nUnited States and its partners in aggressive blocs.\nYet another example of the fact that the Washington Administration \nadheres to diametrically opposite principles is its policy with \nrespect to Afghanistan, South East Asia and the Caribbean. They are \ntrying to achieve their aim of barring the way to social reforms by \nstaging military adventures against peoples seeking freedom and \nprogress. This is clearly demonstrated by the continuing hostile \nactions of the United States of America against Cuba, Afghanistan, \nthe countries of Indo China; Nicaragua and other States of the world, \nand this should serve as a warning. It is also shown by its support \nfor reactionary anti people regimes in Chile, South Korea, El \nSalvador and other countries.\nThe long chain of irrefutable facts indicative of the dangerous \ncourse followed by the foreign policy of the United States, which is \na threat to peace and social progress, includes the well known action \nof that country against the anti colonialist struggle of the peoples \nof the world. When in August 1981 the racists of Pretoria launched \ntheir large scale aggression, which is still going on now, against \nthe People's Republic of Angola, the United States chose to act as a \nforthright advocate of that naked act of aggression. In the Security \nCouncil it vetoed the draft resolution strongly condemning the \naggression and calling for its immediate cessation. The veto was in \nno way accidental; it constituted the implementationof what had \nearlier been proclaimed the new regional strategy of the United \nStates regarding southern Africa.\nThe basic tenets of this strategy, which in its very essence is a \ndoctrine of recolonization, amount to nothing less than a naked \nthreat to use South Africa to bring about the destabilization of \nindependent African States. As regards the Namibian problem, the so \ncalled new doctrine basically encourages the South African racists to \nretain Namibia as a colony of South Africa and to impose on the \nNamibian people conditions that are advantageous to Pretoria. The \nApartheid regime is allowed to use force in pursuing its colonial \npolicy, to employ the piratical methods of the Israeli militarists in \nLebanon, and to attempt to destroy the South West Africa People's \nOrganization and to exclude it from participating in decisions on the \nfuture of its homeland. The task of the United Nations is to prevent \nthis and to work for the early attainment of independence by the \npeople of Namibia.\nWashington is known never to have fulfilled its obligations as \nregards the developing countries. When the conflict between the \nUnited Kingdom and Argentina erupted as a result of the stubborn \nopposition of the United Kingdom to the decolonization of the \nFalkland Islands (Malvinas), the United States ignored its \nobligations as far as Argentina was concerned, extended the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization to Latin America and took advantage of \nthe situation in order openly to assist in the colonialist plunder \nand to penetrate the South Atlantic region.\nA vivid example of the policy of force and blackmail as a means of \ncarrying out imperialist plans on a global scale is provided by the \nactions of the United States aimed at undermining the regional \norganizations of the developing countries, nullifying the United \nNations decision to convene the Conference on the Indian Ocean, \nopposing the drafting of a world treaty on the non use of force in \ninternational relations and refusing to sign the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea.\nThe same strategy of force is being carried out by the United States \nin the realm of international economic relations. It is precisely \nthose in the ruling circles of that country that impede by every \nmeans available the implementation of United Nations decisions on the \nestablishment of a new international economic order, obstruct the \nlaunching of global negotiations and defend in every possible way the \nactivities of transnational corporations, which are detrimental to \nthe sovereignty and the economies of the developing countries.\nThe policy of blackmail and threats is being employed not only \nagainst socialist States but also against those developing countries \nthat have chosen the road of independent development and social \nprogress. Attempts are being made to split the non  aligned movement, \nto play down its significance as a major factor in improving the \ninternational situation. The weapon of coercion is being used also \nagainst the developed countries allies of the United States. One \nrecent example of this in addition to the constant demands for an \nincrease in their military budgets, is the unseemly efforts of the \nUnited States Administration directed against a mutually advantageous \nproject for a gas pipeline between Siberia and Western Europe. We \nalmost have the impression of hearing a cowboy's lasso whistle over \nsome countries of Western Europe. AU this is a significant lesson for \nthe young developing countries, which should indeed think twice \nbefore developing ties, especially economic ties, with the United \nStates.\nThe Soviet Union and other socialist States oppose that policy of \ndiktat and blackmail by a clear and unequivocal policy of developing \ninternational economic co operation on a basis of equality and in the \ninterest of all the participants and with due regard for the special \ninterests of the developing countries, at the same time providing \nthem with assistance on a scale greater than that recommended by the \nUnited Nations.\nGiven the deterioration in the international situation caused by the policy of imperialism, \nof overriding importance for the destiny of mankind is the positive \nimplementation of the Leninist strategy of peace, the Peace Programme \nfor the 1980s worked out by the twenty sixth Congress of the \nCommunist Party of the Soviet Union and promoted by the Soviet Union, \nwhich is celebrating its sixtieth anniversary. The creation and the \nsuccessful development of the Soviet Union are of undying \ninternational significance and an important historic landmark in the \nage old struggle of progressive mankind for equality, the progress of \nnations and world renewal.\nFaithful to the principle of peace and friendship among peoples, to \nwhich it pledged itself at the hour of its birth, the Soviet State \ntakes this as the basis of all its activities in the international \narena. It underlies all its successes and achievements. Leninist \nideals and principles embodied in the decisions of the Communist \nParty of the Soviet Union and the highest State bodies of the Land of \nthe Soviets and in the Constitution of the USSR determine the \napproach of the Soviet State to all problems of relations between \ncountries and peoples.\nThe sixtieth anniversary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics \nis clear testimony to the triumph of the Leninist national policy and \nto the historic achievements of socialism. The workers of the \nByelorussian SSR cherish the fact that they belong to the unified \nfamily of Soviet peoples. They realize that everything we have done \nand achieved has been brought about by the concerted efforts of all \nthe peoples of our multinational homeland. We have every reason to be \nproud of our achievements in political, economic and social \ndevelopment. In this period Byelorussia has become a Republic with a \nhighly developed industry and intensive agriculture. At present our \nindustry produces 30 times more than in the pre war year, 1940, \ndespite the fact that it was almost totally destroyed by the Hitler \naggressors in the Second World War and that those aggressors murdered \na quarter of its population. Education, science, health care and \nculture have made great strides in the Republic. We live and work in \na socialist democracy which guarantees genuine rights and freedoms \nfor every human being. In order to continue their successful and \nconstructive work the Byelorussian people, like other peoples of the \nUSSR and of the entire planet, need above all lasting peace.\nDeadlocks in the international arena do  not occur of themselves. It \nis well known that they are created deliberately. This can be said \nabout almost every situation of conflict and outstanding problem the \ncontinuing conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran, \nopposition to the peaceful reunification of Korea free from outside \ninterference, and to the withdrawal of foreign troops from South \nKorea, the refusal to take part in, or the obstruction of, \ndisarmament talks, the desire to put weapons into outer space and \nother pressing problems.\nLet us take as an example the problem of Cyprus. Here again we see \nwho is doing what to impede United Nations efforts to defend the \nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic \nof Cyprus and to demilitarize the island by withdrawing all foreign \ntroops and eliminating all foreign bases; how attempts are being made \nto impose on the Cypriots a solution alien to them. In those \ncircumstances United Nations efforts should be directed towards \nmaking the intercommunal talks a success, while fully respecting the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Cypriot State and its \npolicy of non alignment.\nThus in the final analysis underlying all these deadlocks there are \nselfish imperialist interests and a reluctance to take account of the \nreal situation in an evolving world and of the will of the peoples.\nToday political wisdom lies in concerted, persistent and patient \nefforts to solve the problems threatening universal peace. In that \nway, even if not all the problems are solved at once, many will be. \nIt is particularly important, of course, to solve the most pressing \nproblems of our time: that of averting a nuclearwar, curbing the arms \nrace and achieving disarmament. If we do not, the wise sphinxes to \nwhich the United States Secretary of State recently alluded in \njustifying Washington's policies will no longer be there.\nThe delegation of the Byelorussian SSR, guided by the testament of \nLenin that the Soviet State wishes to live in peace with all peoples \nand directs its efforts to the building of its own State, will \nactively promote the preparation and adoption of measures designed to \navert the threat of nuclear war, strengthen peace, bring about co \noperation among peoples and solve other problems on the agenda of \nthis session of the General Assembly in accordance with the Charter \nof the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, like my colleagues who preceded me \non this rostrum, 1 should like, on behalf of my \nGovernment and of myself, to convey to you our \nmost warm congratulations on your election to the \npresidency of the present session of the General \nAssembly. Your dedication to the multilateral \nap\u00acproach to international relations, to the \nauthority and prestige of global and regional \nintergovernmental institutions and to the unique \nrole of the United Nations constitutes the best \nguarantee that this session will take place in a \nmost propitious atmosphere. May I convey to you \nmy good wishes for the success of your endeavors \nand assure you of the full co-operation of my \nGovernment and myself.\n232.\tThe efficiency of your actions may be \nmuch enhanced by the fact that they take place \nwithin an exceptional framework: that of the \nreport sub\u00acmitted to us by the Secretary-General \nto guide us in our work. Mr. Secretary-General, \nthe Belgian Govern\u00acment has in the past conveyed \nto you the importance it attaches to the fact \nthat you have been called upon to assume these \nhigh functions. It told you that Belgium was \nready to assist you to the best of its ability in \nthe difficult but vital task that you were \nassuming. Today, the Belgian Government is \nfamiliar with your report on the work of the \nOrganization, which I would not hesitate to term \na milestone for the Organization. It has come at \nthe right moment. It reflects the uneasiness \ncreated by the growing tendency to seek solutions \nto crises outside the framework of the United \nNations and the inability of the Organization to \nhave its decisions implemented. We must thank you \nfor having put on the agenda the central problem \nof the Organization, that is, its \\\"capacity to \nkeep the peace and to serve as a forum for \nnegotiations.... its evident difficulties in \ndoing so, difficulties related to conflicts \nbetween national aims and Charter goals and to \nthe current tendency to resort to confrontation, \nviolence and even war in pursuit of what are \nperceived as vital interests, claims or \naspirations\\\". I can tell you, Sir, that from the \noutset my country can sub\u00acscribe to every \nstatement contained in your report.\n233.\tBelonging to the generation which spent \nits youth during the tragedy of the Second World \nWar, I am among those who, 37 years ago, \nenthusiastically greeted the birth of the \nOrganization. At the end of the nightmare during \nwhich humanity suffered every possible anguish to \nan extent previously unequalled, States\u2014from the \nlargest to the smallest, from the strongest to \nthe weakest, from the wealthiest to the most \ndeprived, belonging to different systems\u2014 pledged \nto work together to free mankind from all the \nhorrors it had just experienced, to free it from \nwar and genocide, to free it from torture and \nhunger, to free it from discrimination, to free \nit even from the fear of all those horrors.\n234.\tHowever, at a time when the shortcomings \nof the Organizations are being denounced, it \nseems important to me to recall its positive \naspects. The work that it has accomplished is \nconsiderable. One could recall the part that the \nUnited Nations has played in decolonization. But \nI could also refer to its action on behalf of \neconomic development of the so-called \\\"new \ncountries\\\", the efforts it has made in the field \nof control, limitation and reduction of armaments \nas well as in nuclear non-proliferation and its \ninitiatives to assure better understanding among \nnations or between groups of States from East to \nWest and from North to South. Under its flag, the \n\\\"blue helmets\\\" have tried to come between hostile \nforces and to prevent the escalation of \nconflicts. Despite the dif\u00acficulties they have \nencountered, their importance and the unique \ncharacter of their role have not changed.\n235.\tNone the less, the essential goal that \nthe sig\u00acnatory States set for themselves at San \nFrancisco and to which those that joined later \nadhered has still not been attained. I ask myself \nwhy it is that, despite its important partial \nsuccesses, the United Nations has not fulfilled \nthe hope its founders placed in it. For my \ncompatriots, for the Government 1 represent and \nfor me personally, this Organization is and \nremains the most courageous and generous attempt, \nand the only adequate one that has been launched \nsince the dis\u00acappearance of the League of \nNations, to assure the world of a modicum of \norder, understanding and co\u00acoperation, without \nwhich it would not be able to survive.\n236.\tMoreover, I share the hope expressed by \nthe Secretary-General when he states that \\\"we now \nhave potentially better means to solve many of \nthe major problems facing humanity than ever \nbefore\\\". Nevertheless, we find that not enough \nuse is being made of these means. The fundamental \nproblem does not lie in the functioning of the \ninstitutions of the Organization, nor does it lie \nin the application of one or another Article of \nthe Charter or in the work methods of its organs \nor the actions of the Secretary- General. No\u2014the \nfundamental problem rests with us, the Member \nStates. We have too often let ourselves be \nswamped by immediate problems and taken advantage \nof by interests which are often purely national \nin character.\n237.\tWe have forgotten that the Organization \nwas not created by us in order to perpetuate in a \nnew institution the habits and practices which \nhad led to the failure of the former one. We nave \nforgotten the fact that we did not create it in \norder to have it serve as a forum for our \ndiplomatic games, for the defense of our own \ninterests, or for the confrontation of our \nrivalries.\n238.\tWhat is worse, we have forgotten that we \ncreated the Organization for mankind, not for \nthose of the East or the West, not for those of \nthe North or the South, but regardless of \nfrontiers, for all mankind.\n239.\tMankind is today the victim of three \ntypes of scourges, which unfortunately are often \ncombined. The first is war, or the threat of war, \nincluding civil war, which has become \nincreasingly cruel and deadly through the \never-greater sophistication, multiplication and \nwider commercial distribution of armaments. Then \nthere are poverty and hunger, which are, to be \nsure, characteristics of underdevelopment, but \nwhich\u2014let us not delude ourselves\u2014are not the \nexclusive domain of those countries which we call \nthe poor countries. Finally, there is oppression \nand the violation of the most elementary human \nrights.\n240.\tThe existence of these three types of \nscourges seems to me to call for the \nestablishment of three orders of priority, which \nincidentally are interde\u00acpendent. The first order \nof priority seems to me to include essentially \nthe following: first, the solution of so-called \n\\\"local\\\" conflicts, which are so numerous and on \nsuch a scale that they are turning our planet \ninto a planet at war, together with an effort to \nend the civil strife which is tearing so many of \nour countries apart; secondly, an increased \neffort in the limitation, control and reduction \nof all kinds of arms and of the arms trade; \nthirdly, the prevention of international \nconfrontations.\n241.\tThe second order of priority is aimed at \ndeveloping between our States the mutual aid and \nco-operation which alone can provide a stable \nbasis for international understanding and peace. \nWe must act vigorously to reopen the North-South \ndialogue in order to establish among ourselves \nefficient interna\u00actional co-operation which will \nensure for all the fruits of economic \ndevelopment. We must improve and adapt our \nprogrammes of action and of economic development \nin the light of the critical evolution of the \nworld economic situation. We must also fight \npoverty, wherever it is rampant. We must concern \nour Iives not only with those who are the poorest \nin the poorest countries but also with those who, \nin each of our Spates, do not have access to the \nbenefits of society, to schooling, to \nparticipation in the production process, health \nbenefits and housing, who have been described as \nthe \\\"fourth world\\\".\n242.\tThe third order of priority has the \nfollowing aims: first of all, scrupulous respect \nby each of our States for the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Right; then, the acceptance \nand the implementation by the same States of all \nof the rights generally accepted as indispensable \nfor the political, moral, cultural, social and \neconomic fulfillment of human beings\u2014I have in \nmind here, inter alia, the freedoms and rights of \ntrade unions\u2014and lastly, there must be resolute \nco-operation among all countries against \nterrorism, whose blind violence threatens all \npeople.\n243.\tThe definition and the implementation of \nthese tasks have to take place in the context of \na determined effort to ensure respect for the \nCharter and to allow the machinery of the \nOrganization to function as it should. Only this \ntype of effort will allow us to achieve that the \nSecretary-General has assigned to us as the most \nurgent aim: the return to the principle of \ncollective action for peace and security which is \nenshrined in the Charter, so as to make the \nUnited Nations better equipped to carry out its \nessential task. I wish to state this forcefully, \nbecause I, too, believe that without an efficient \ncollective security system, the small and the \nweak will have no secure means of defense or \nprotection.\n244.\tIn the light of these considerations \nshould like to deal with a few aspects of the \ninternational situa-tion. In view of the \nremarkable statement made at the 8th meeting by \nour colleague, Mr. Elleman-Jensen, the Danish \nMinister for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the 10 \nmember States of the European Community, I need \ndeal only briefly with four questions. The first \none, based on the specific proposals advanced by \nthe Secretary-General, concerns the functioning \nof the Organization. The three others relate to \nthe essential aim of combining our efforts to \ndefend man and his dignity. I shall address \nmyself to questions of disarma\u00acment, the \npromotion of the North-South dialogue and the \nglobal negotiations, and the monitoring of \nrespect for human rights.\n245.\tWith respect first of all to the \nuniversal task of the United Nations and the \nactive role it must play in the Held of peaceful \nsettlement of disputes, it seems to me highly \ndesirable that the simultaneous admission of the \ntwo Koreas to the United Nations be con\u00acsidered. \nThat decision would be likely to promote a \ndialogue directed to a peaceful reunification of \nthe Korean peninsula. There was, moreover, a \nproposal made to that effect in January 1982 by \nthe President of the Republic of Korea, which \ncould constitute an adequate and equitable basis \nfor discussion.\n246.\tThe question of the functioning of the \nSecurity Council deserves our full attention \nalso. You, Mr. Secretary-General, in your sombre \nbut accurate analysis of the present evolution of \nthe international situation particularly \nemphasized the main obstacles to the activities \nof the Organization anxious to redress this \nsituation, you informed us of the steps you \nintend to take and of the remedies you would like \nto see applied. I support those proposals. I \nshould like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate you on the constructive role you \nwish to play, which is fully in accordance With \nthe Charter. Indeed, Article 99 of the Charter \nprovides that the Secretary-General \\\"may bring to \nthe attention of the Security Council any matter \nwhich in his opinion may threaten the maintenance \nof international peace and security\\\".\n247.\tI also believe that reactivation of the \npreventive role entrusted to the Security Council \nby the Charter, together with the prerogatives of \nthe Secretary- General, constitute the most \nappropriate measure to ensure that increase in \ntension in certain parts of die world does not \nlead to confrontation, violence, or even war. The \ninitiative that the Security Council should take, \nby virtue of its preventive role under the \nCharter, presupposes, however that it would be \ninformed in time about the development of the \ninterna\u00actional situation and that, in particular, \nits attention would be drawn to the real dangers \nthat the existence of certain sources of tension \nin the world might lead to.\n248.\tThe Independent Commission on Disarmament \nand Security Issues, under the chairmanship of \nOlaf Palme, has produced a report which is \nexcellent. This report proposes that you, Mr. \nSecretary- General, be entrusted with the task of \npresenting periodically a concise report on the \nevolution of the international situation with the \nprecise aim of indicating what action should be \ntaken to ensure that dissension among nations \ndoes not lead to violent confrontations. I \nsubscribe to this proposal which moreover, meets \nthe purposes of the Organization without \nrequiring any amendment of the Charter.\n249.\tI should like to stress in that respect \nthe essential role which is vested in the \nregional organizations. They are in a better \nposition to appraise and to judge the level of \ntension or possible discord which exists in their \nregions. If such be the case, they can help you \nin preparing your informational report and advise \nyou on the nature of the actions that may be \ncon\u00acsidered and of the measures that may be \nproposed to the Security Council.\n250.\tThus it becomes clear that the right to \ntake preventive action should be considered as a \nduty the better to serve the objectives of the \nOrganization.\n251.\tThe problems that confront human society \ntoday are numerous. Several are of such a scope \nthat solutions can only be found on a global \nscale. Thus a heavy responsibility rests on the \nshoulders of all of the Members of the \nOrganization, and particularly on the great \nPowers which have special authority in the \nSecurity Council. From their consensus and their \nsincere understanding with other nations there \nshould emerge a better functioning of the \nOrganization and a better guarantee of the \nestablishment of an ultimate climate of lasting \npeace.\n252.\tThis joint action, supported by the \npolitical will and commitment of all the Members \nof the United Nations, should allow a \ntransformation of the present situation of \nuncertainty and crisis into a climate of mutual \nconfidence, a necessary prelude to the \nestab\u00aclishment of an era of peace and universal \njustice.\n253.\tWith the holding of the second special \nsession of the Assembly devoted to disarmament, \nthe year 1982 seems to mark a new phase in this \nparticular area, which is at the centre of our \nendeavors and affects the universal conscience to \nan ever greater extent. If the essentials of the \ndisarmament effort could have been preserved, \nparticularly the achieve\u00acments of the first \nspecial session, in 1978, whose Final Document \nremains the solid basis on which to build our \nfuture efforts, it would be vain to try to hide \nthe fact that the results of the special session \nof 1982 fall far short of our expectations.\n254.\tWe have tried to check and even reduce \nthe increase in arms at a time when the sense of \ninsecurity was increasing in the world. We have \nattributed that insecurity to the enormous \nover-capacity for mutual destruction, whereas in \nfact its roots lie in the increase in tension, of \nwhich the arms race is but a symptom. Our first \npriority, to ensure the security of States, is \ntherefore the establishment of a more favorable \npolitical climate based on confidence, a sense of \nreality and good faith. Tension must be reduced \nbefore nations are disarmed. That is essentially \na political undertaking, which is within the \npurview of the General Assembly at the \nthirty-seventh session; I urge it to succeed \nwhere the special session on disarmament has \nfailed.\n255.\tEconomic progress is also one of the main \nobjectives of the United Nations. The picture of \nthe international economic situation today does \nnot give rise to an optimistic outlook; \neverywhere one hears only of stagnation, \nunemployment, interest rates, fluctuations in the \nexchange rates, and deficits in the balance of \npayments. Peace and international security are \nthe primary goals of the United Nations, but we \nshould never forget that millions of unemployed \npeople throughout the world follow our debates \nand wonder what the Organization is doing for \nthem.\n256.\tThe economic crisis makes it incumbent \nupon the Organization and the specialized \nagencies to take all possible measures to \nmitigate the havoc caused by this depression, \nwhich is both cyclical and struc-tural, and to \nuse every means at their disposal to alleviate \nthe present situation as quickly as possible. One \ncannot sufficiently underline that absolute \nneces\u00acsity. My country is profoundly convinced \nthat the United Nations, and more specifically \nthe Economic and Social Council, could and should \nundertake this task by making recommendations to \nthe General Assembly, to Member States and to the \nspecialized agencies concerned, in accordance \nwith the principles of the Charter.\n257.\tMay I recall in this connection the \nsupport that Belgium is giving to the action \nundertaken by the Director-General for \ndevelopment and international Economic \nCo-operation, Mr. Ripert, to strengthen and \ndeepen the general economic debates in the \nEconomic and Social Council. Those debates, by \nimproving the co-ordination of economic policies, \ncould provide a new impetus to international \neco\u00acnomic activity.\n258.\tUnderdevelopment was already one of the \nscourges of our world; the financial crisis of \ntoday makes its elimination even more difficult. \nAs far as the dialogue with the developing \ncountries and the global negotiations are \nconcerned, it should be noted that economic \ninterdependence in the world has steadily \nincreased. However, the slowing down of economic \nactivity and the disruption of the international \nmonetary system have seriously affected the \nvolume of transfer of financial resources from \nthe wealthy countries to the poor countries. That \nhas resulted in a further deterioration of the \neconomies of the least-developed nations, already \nstrongly affected by the rise in oil prices.\n259.\tThat interdependence should lead each \ngroup of countries to view the revival of the \nworld economy as a vital objective based on \nmutual interest. That is why Belgium, together \nwith its partners in the European Community, is \nwholly in favor of beginning the global \nnegotiations. A new North-South dialogue can \nsucceed only if it results in a satisfactory \noutcome for all groups. Without such a dialogue, \nthat inter\u00acdependence in the future will be \naccompanied by growing insecurity and antagonism \nbetween nations.\n260.\tBelgium, for its part, would like to see \nnew forms of co-operation substituted for those \nrisks, allowing us to overcome the crisis and \nbring about a common responsibility for world \ninterdependence.\n261.\tThe establishment and the general \nrecognition of rights designed to protect the \nfulfillment of the indi\u00acvidual and his \nintegration within the community are undoubtedly \na great victory for civilization over despotism. \nTherefore, beyond doubt, the initial \nresponsibility for ensuring respect for these \nhuman rights is primarily the duty of each State \nwithin its own territory. Nevertheless, the \ninternational com\u00acmunity should not only endorse \nthose fundamental rights; it should also be able \nto guarantee their observance.\n262.\tIt is not enough for States to endow \nthemselves with the means to implement human \nrights. They need also the political will to \nemploy these means and to allow a procedure of \nrecourse in cases of omission or shortcomings, or \nwhat could be described as \\\"errors\\\" of \ninterpretation of international norms, by the \nrespon\u00acsible national authorities. The \ninternational community has already established \ndifferent forms of monitoring with respect to \nhuman rights. However, we must admit that in most \nof the cases these safeguards produce only meager \nresults, either because they are not binding, or \nbecause of the small number of those who have \nadhered to them. The causes of that deficiency \nare numerous, but I believe that they can be \nnarrowed down essen\u00actially to two.\n263.\tIn the first place, if it is true that \nhuman dignity is universal and that each human \nbeing has the right to enjoy his fundamental \nrights without discrimination, it is also true \nthat the positive expression of this human \ndignity may vary, depending on time and place. \nOur sense of reality requires us to take these \ndif-ferences into account and to achieve a more \neffective protection of certain rights, a better \nresult based on concepts which are less vague. On \nthe whole, would it not be preferable to have a \nwell-defined number of rights accepted in the \ndifferent regions of the world that are \neffectively and fully respected, rather than to \nhave a long list of theoretical rights?\n264.\tIn the same context, one may wish to give \nmore extensive thought to the organic links which \nshould be established between on the one hand the \nregional monitoring machinery over human \nrights\u2014and I am happy to see that they are \nexpanding not only in Europe but also in other \nparts of the world\u2014and on the other hand the \ninternational monitoring devices, whose role \ncould be reviewed in relation to their new link \nwith regional mechanisms.\n265.\tSecondly, more effective protection of \nhuman rights should, it seems to me, take into \naccount the diversity of the international \nmachinery. In a Utopia an independent body of \nmagistrates would be estab\u00aclished to ensure the \nharmonious implementation of human rights all \nover the world while taking local circumstances \ninto account. This body of magistrates would hold \nitself aloof from the partisan interests that are \nso dear to States, with their present egoistic \noutlook.\n266.\tThe way that co-operation between States \nhas evolved within the Organization makes this \nvision still rather remote. I should like to \nsuggest, however, that a number of practical \nmeasures could be taken progressively to bring us \nnearer to that goal. I think it would be \ndesirable first of all for States to make an \neffort to designate, within existing organs or \ninstitu\u00actions, internationally recognized \npersonalities in the field of human rights and to \ngive them a status that would, like that of the \nmagistrates I mentioned earlier, ensure their \ntotal independence. Such personalities already \nexist in those bodies, but their independence is \nnot always safeguarded. Furthermore, I think it \nwould be useful if some of those personalities \ncould participate in the work of more than one \nmonitoring body, in order to establish among them \na personal link of co-operation prior to the \nestablishment of institutional Sinks. Lastly, \ncould we not envisage the simultaneous \nparticipation of such personalities in the \ninstitutions of the regions from which they come \nand in international institutions, or is this \nUtopian?\n267.\tThe Organization was created in the \naftermath of a ghastly war that was the result of \nthe dissemination of ideologies whose principal \ncharacteristics were contempt for and enslavement \nof humanity. Those ideologies plunged our \nuniverse into a nightmare which lasted for 15 \nyears. When it ended the world found itself rent \napart, bloodless and lifeless, and mankind was \nfor a long time traumatized by the horrors it had \nperpetrated and suffered. It is not surprising, \nthere\u00acfore, that the primary concern of the \nfounders of the United Nations at its birth were \nthe protection, the dignity and the fulfillment \nof man, and that in drafting the Charter and \nestablishing its institutions they made man the \ncentre of their concerns. We must remain faithful \nto that original, basic concern, and we must give \npriority to the accomplishment of this task that \nhas been bequeathed to us. Let us remember that \nall of us here are the servants of mankind and of \nits dignity, and that mankind must constitute for \nall of us in our joint action the measure of all \nthings.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with particular pleasure that I join \nprevious speakers in congratulating Mr. Hollai \nmost warmly, on behalf of the Government of \nGhana, on his election to the presidency of the \nthirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. \nHis election is a fitting tribute to his many \nfine qualities, which allow him to bring to this \ndifficult task wide experience and wisdom, from \nwhich we shall no doubt stand to gain. We \ntherefore have every confidence that, with the \ncollective support of all delegations, he will \nskillfully lead the session to a productive \nconclusion. My delegation assures him of its full \nco-operation at all times. I should like to take \nthis opportunity to pay a tribute to his \npredecessor, Mr. Kittani, and express to him our \ndeepest appreciation for his excel\u00aclent \nachievement in steering a difficult thirty-sixth \nsession to such a successful conclusion. I should \nalso like to place on record the profound \nappreciation of my delegation for the competence \ninvariably displayed by the Secretary-General and \nhis able and dedicated staff in promoting the \nbusiness of the General Assembly.\n108.\tSince the thirty-sixth session, the \ninternational political scene has continued to be \nworrying and efforts to find durable solutions to \nmany burning issues have only been met with \nfrustration. The Palestinian question, the war \nbetween Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran, \nthe escalating arms race, the prob\u00aclems of \ncolonialism and racism and the ever-widening \neconomic gap between the North and the South\u2014all \nhave increased in complexity. As we meet at this \nthirty- seventh session, our skills, \ninventiveness and good faith will be fully taxed \nin our quest for a better world.\n109.\tIn drawing attention to the explosive \nsituations around the globe today, I should like \nto touch upon the Middle East, because it is one \nsingle issue which has gravely disturbed \ninternational peace and security. In the wake of \nsome bold steps taken both within and outside the \nUnited Nations system, one would have thought \nthat a significant improvement would by now be \ndiscernible in the Middle East situation. \nUnfor\u00actunately, that situation has been further \ncomplicated by the recent tragic devastation of \nLebanon. The callous Israeli invasion has \nresulted in the loss of thousands of lives; it \nhas rendered hundreds of thousands homeless and \nwithout shelter; it has ravaged towns and \nvillages, wantonly destroyed property and \ndemolished Palestinian refugee camps\u2014and the \nentire world has just looked on as though it was \nall to be expected and all too normal.\n110.\tIt is inadmissible that after 35 years of \nhostility and warfare no durable solution has \nbeen found to the Palestinian question, which is \nundeniably the crux of the Middle East dilemma. \nThe Palestinian people have suffered for far too \nlong. The international community and certain \nGovernments in particular must abandon their fear \nof embarking on new policies which alone can \nensure that the Palestinians have a home. The \nleast that can be done is to implement fully \nrelevant Security Council and General Assembly \nresolutions dealing with the fundamental and \ninalien\u00acable rights of the Palestinians as \ndefined and elabo\u00acrated in General Assembly \nresolutions 3210 (XXIX) and 3236 (XXIX). Those \ntwo resolutions were again emphasized in Assembly \nresolution ES-7/2. Ghana very strongly urges a \nfinal solution of the question in terms of these \nresolutions. We stand our ground and reaffirm the \nprinciples underlying them, the most important of \nwhich are: the right of the Palestinian people to \nreturn to their homes and property in Palestine \nfrom which they have been forcibly displaced and \nuprooted; the right of the Palestinian people to \nself-determination without external interference; \nthe right of the Palestinian people to establish \ntheir own independent and sovereign State in \nPalestine; the right to territorial integrity and \nnational unity\u2014which must apply to all States in \nthe area; and the right of the PLO, the \nrepresentative of the Palestinian people, to \nparticipate on an equal footing in all efforts, \ndeliber\u00acations and conferences on the question of \nPalestine and the situation in the Middle East \nwithin the frame\u00acwork of the United Nations.\nHI. We cannot pretend that the legitimate \naspira\u00actions of the Palestinians will die with \nthe arrogant use of force. The yearning of a \npeople for a home can never die, as the Israelis \nmust know. We call upon Israel to withdraw from \nail Arab lands it has occupied. Until Israel \nheeds the conscience of mankind, it will continue \nto create conditions for its isolation.\n112. Another source of grave concern is the \nongoing war between Iran and Iraq, two developing \ncountries which require all the human and \nmaterial resources with which they are so richly \nblessed to surmount the shackles of \nunderdevelopment and help their less fortunate \nbrothers of the third world. There is no point in \ncontinuing this war, and we should like to \ncounsel our brothers in Iran and Iraq to seek the \nroad to peace.\n113.\tMy delegation is equally concerned about \nthe unsettled regional conflicts in Cyprus, \nAfghanistan and Kampuchea. The early solution of \nthese conflicts will help brighten the \ninternational horizon and replace fear with \nconfidence in the future, thus enhancing the \nchances of our winning true peace for all \nmankind. My delegation would like to support the \ncall for the withdrawal of all foreign troops \nfrom those crisis areas and for respect for the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of all the \nStates therein. The solution of these conflicts \nwill not be possible, however, except within the \ncontext of a comprehensive settlement of the \nconflicting interests of all the parties involved.\n114.\tThe United Nations has, over its 37-year \nhistory, scored a number of successes in the \nareas of decoloni-zation, development assistance \nand humanitarian work. The record, however, is \nrather dismal in the resolution of conflicts and \nthe removal of the under\u00aclying factors that \nengender them. The irony of the situation is that \nall parties involved in the conflicts are \nsignatories to the Charter and all are thus \nlegally and morally enjoined to settle disputes \nby peaceful means.\n115.\tFrom the record of Ghana's participation \nin the deliberations of the Organization, there \ncan be no doubt that my country has supported the \nUnited Nations initiatives for peace. My country \nhas con\u00acsistently made troop contributions to \nUnited Nations peace-keeping forces to serve as a \nbuffer in the effort to contain latent and \npotentially explosive disputes. It is a difficult \nand sometimes dangerous task which the United \nNations has performed with courage and \ndedication, if not successfully on all occasions. \nWith all its faults, peace-keeping continues to \nbe a useful and serious undertaking that all \nMember States should support. It is therefore \nregrettable that countries which are easily in a \nposition to make contributions for peace-keeping \noperations should be in default or refuse \noutright to do so. We therefore appeal to all \nthose countries to honor their commitments in \nthis regard and make good their assessed \ncontributions in the greater interest of world \npeace and security.\n116.\tMy Government is also ready and willing \nto support any move designed to review the powers \nof the Secretary-General with a view to making \nhim better able to deal with conflict situations \nmore decisively. This review is necessary if the \nUnited Nations is not to be further harmed by the \ncrisis in confidence that now envelops it as a \nresult of the tendency of certain Member States \nto play down its importance in finding solutions \nto international problems.\n117.\tA matter of fundamental importance to \nworld peace is disarmament. The outcome of the \nrecent second special session of the General \nAssembly devoted to disarmament was most \ndisappointing. The primary responsibility for \ncontrolling the arms race rests with the big \nPowers. It is intolerable that they should \ncontinue to endanger the security of all of us in \npursuit of superiority.\n118.\tIt is known that the quality of life in \nthe devel\u00acoping countries would take on a new \nmeaning if a portion of current expenditures on \narms were to be released for development \nassistance. However, not only are we being denied \nthat assistance; we stand in danger of being \nannihilated as a result of policies we have no \npart in shaping. It is a misfortune that no \nchange of heart is in sight.\n119.\tTo have the peace and security in which \nharmony and human development can survive is the \nfervent hope of mankind. The delegation of Ghana \nassociates itself with those delegations that \nhave wel\u00accomed the proposals for a nuclear freeze \nand urges the nuclear Powers to seize this \nopportunity and to take those steps which must be \ntaken in order to rid our\u00acselves and posterity of \nthe danger of extinction.\n120.\tIt is not an accident of history that the \nodious policy of apartheid is practiced with \nimpunity in South Africa; it derived its \ninspiration from the imperialism and the racism \nof the industrialized West and it is supported by \ncertain Governments and transnational \ncorporations, whatever they may say to the \ncontrary. The policy of apartheid has been \nconsciously and systematically nurtured into an \ninsti\u00actutionalized racial bigotry that maintains \nthat the black man is little more than an object \nof labour. He works under unjust and \ndiscriminatory laws, suffers arbitrary \nimprisonment and is denied his basic rights and \nprivi\u00acleges as a citizen of his own country. The \neducational structure for the black population is \norganized in such a way as to provide separate \nand unequal levels of education appropriate only \nto satisfy the labour needs of the white society \nand of the transnational corporations.\n121.\tAnd if those conditions were not \ndegrading enough, the South African Government's \npolicy of creating bantust is or independent \nhomelands has been initiated in order to \neliminate the inter-ethnic cohesion that is \nnecessary for collective action on the part of \nthe black majority in defense of their liberty.\n122.\tWhat is happening in South Africa should \nbe a matter of concern to the entire world. Those \nwho gloss over the transgressions of South Africa \nfor whatever reasons and those who pursue profits \nat the expense of human dignity are as guilty as \nthe bigots who hold power in South Africa.\n123.\tThe South African Government's \nprovocative aggression against Angola and \nMozambique, its inter-vention in Seychelles and \nin Lesotho and its threats to other front-line \nStates show how passivity on the part of the \ninternational community can encourage dangers to \ninternational people and security. South Africa \nhas seen fit to refuse to comply with United \nNations resolutions and it continues its illegal \noccupa\u00action of Namibia. South Africa is a \nveritable inter\u00acnational outlaw and it merits the \nimposition of punitive measures from the Security \nCouncil now. The longer we wait the greater the \ndanger that with the develop\u00acment of a nuclear \ncapability in co-operation with other \nracist-minded regimes it will be able to hold the \nworld to ransom.\n124.\tThere is no doubt that an oil embargo is \nnot only feasible but could be effective. \nVirtually all South Africa's petroleum \nrequirements must be imported from abroad and \nrefined oil is indispensable to South African \ntransportation and industry, crucial levers of \nits economic and military strength. An oil \nembargo against South Africa would not have an \nadverse impact on international oil companies. \nThe total interest of the five oil companies that \ndominate the South African oil industry \nrepresents only 1 per cent of their global \ntransactions. Nor is there any major \noil-producing country whose livelihood depends on \noil exports to South Africa. The sanctions \nenvisaged can be enforced not by adopting the \nexpensive method of patrolling the South African \ncoastline but by having recourse to the cheaper \nalternative of the withdrawal of transport \nfacilities for the shipment of oil to South \nAfrica. We do not endorse the cynical argument \nthat the black population stands to suffer most \nif mandatory oil sanctions are imposed on South \nAfrica. I believe I echo the views of the black \nmajority in stating that their plight under the \nyoke of apartheid with all its inhumanity and \ndegradation will come to aspeedier end if \nsanctions are imposed on South Africa.\n125.\tWe are following with interest and some \ndisap\u00acpointment the efforts of the Western \ncontact group to resolve the Namibian problem. \nThe linkage being made between this problem and \nthe withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola casts \ngrave suspicions on the sincerity of some of the \nparties involved. Meanwhile, our whole-hearted \nsupport will continue to be given to SWAPO for \nthe successful liquidation of colonialism and \nracism in Namibia.\n126.\tWhen one looks at the present world \neconomic situation characterized, on the one \nhand, by record levels of unemployment, \nrecession, budget deficits, high interest rates \nand other constraints in the de\u00acveloped world, \nand deteriorating terms of trade, record budget \ndeficits, huge debt burdens and declining rates \nof growth in the developing world on the other, \nit is hard to avoid the conclusion that the \ncrises in the political sphere have their \nparallel in the economic realm as well and that \none can hardly be considered without the other.\n127.\tIn this generally dismal landscape the \ncon\u00acspicuous plight of the non-oil-producing \nAfrican countries, many of whom have long been \namong the poorest of the poor, is nothing short \nof desperate. I need not remind the Assembly that \nmany African countries have actually been \nexperiencing negative rates of growth at the very \ntime when they are under\u00acgoing a population \nexplosion. For them poverty has become a way of \nlife.\n128.\tThe fact that the whole world economy is \nin a general state of disequilibrium and that \neven the most efficient and frugal countries are \nfaced with serious economic difficulties should, \nin our opinion, once more underline the point \nmany of the developing countries have reiterated \nalmost nanseam; that the economic, recovery of \nthe developed countries of the North is \ninexorably linked to the economic prosperity and \nprogress of the developing countries of the \nSouth. The whole world economy, in other words, \nis so interlinked and interdependent that the \nprosperity and well-being of each country is a \nnecessary pre-condi\u00action for the prosperity of \nall. No one country or group of countries can \ntoday pursue economic policies of a narrow, \nself-centered nature without risking economic \ndisaster for itself in the long run. For that \nreason policies of economic blockade outside the \nframework of a United Nations sanctions policy \nare as outdated and reactionary as the gunboat \ndiplomacy of times past.\n129.\tThe old order\u2014which is now facing a grave \ncrisis\u2014in which the developing countries supply \nabundant raw materials at cheap prices determined \nby the markets in the West and are then forced to \nbuy manufactured goods at expensive prices \ndetermined by the same markets, must give way to \na more equitable system in which the benefits of \neconomic activity accrue to all who create the \nwealth of the world and not only to a small \nminority of nations.\n130.\tWe reaffirm that the realignment of \ninternational economic relations, as envisaged in \nthe Declaration and the Programme of Action on \nthe Establishment of a New International Economic \nOrder, adopted by the General Assembly in 1974 , \nis a necessity if the world economy is to \novercome its present malaise.\n131.\tIt is in this context that my delegation \ndeeply regrets the failure of the strenuous \nefforts made to arrive at a suitable basis for \nthe launching of global negotiations on \ninternational economic co-operation for \ndevelopment. We believe that the urgency of the \nsituation requires that this issue should occupy \na central position on the international \ncommunity's agenda for the immediate future. \nWithout the prospect of general economic recovery \nthere cannot be genuine political stability and \nwithout political stability there cannot be \npeace. As long as millions of people continue to \ngo to bed hungry, as long as thousands starve to \ndeath while some nations can afford to spend over \n$600 billion a year on refining the apparatus of \ndestruction, there will be no peace. The \nresponsibility for this will rest squarely with \nthe industrialized countries, particularlyin the \nWest.\n132.\tGhana stands ready to join in any \nmeaningful initiatives to resolve outstanding \ndifferences so that the way may be cleared for a \nserious attempt to address the economic \nimbalances and injustices of the past and present.\n133.\tWhile the North-South dialogue has made \ndisap\u00acpointing progress, Ghana is pleased to note \nthat the developing countries have made \nsubstantial efforts to increase co-operation for \ndevelopment among them\u00acselves. We are \nparticularly pleased that a significant number of \nsectoral meetings have taken place this year in \nconnection with the implementation of the Caracas \nProgramme of Actions for economic co\u00acoperation \namong developing countries, and we are determined \nto give full support to every move in the \ndirection of collective self-reliance, not as a \nsubstitute for global economic reform but as a \ncom\u00acplementary effort. Ultimately, the third \nworld must look to itself to reverse the \nexploitative economic relationships fostered by \ncolonialism and imperialism. This calls for a far \ngreater level of political con\u00acsciousness than \nthe leadership of many a third world country \nwould allow or would be allowed by those who \nstand to lose. It is found to be more convenient \nto be content with a neo-colonial relationship \nthat is beneficial to the class to which the \nleadership belongs but which is damaging in the \nlong run to the interest of the masses. The \nGovernment of Ghana does not intend to be found \nwanting in the effort, co-operation and sacrifice \nthat are necessary for the salvation of the \nunderprivileged nations of the third world.\n134.\tThe adoption on 30 April 1982 of the \nConven\u00action on the Law of the Sea by the Third \nUnited Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea \nrepresents a momentous event in the life of the \nOrganization. It demonstrates the capacity of the \nUnited Nations to forge legally binding \ninstruments for peace, security and development. \nThe Convention itself is a unique blend of old \nand new concepts in international law: the \nconcept of freedom of the seas on the one hand \nand the modem and novel concepts of exclusive \neconomic zones and the common heritage of mankind \non the other.\n135.\tThe delegation of Ghana is firmly of the \nview that the United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea will provide, upon its entry into \nforce, the only form of legality in regard to the \noceans which is known to the world community. Any \nunilateral action intended to preserve the \nprivileges of the few in the exploitation of the \nresources of the seas must be resisted by the \ninternational community.\n136.\tAs we meet at the present session of the \nGeneral Assembly, it would be useful for us all \nto bear in mind that we represent peoples of a \nworld in which the clear majority is yearning for \npeace, security and development; we must also \nremember that we play our respective diplomatic \nroles in a world that has become interdependent \nto a great degree. The situation calls for \nabandoning selfish national interests and making \na moral commitment to the betterment of the \ninter\u00acnational community. The delegation of Ghana \nhopes that this session will help generate that \nmoral commitment.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honor of extending to Mr. Hollai, on behalf of the \ndelegation of Rwanda the warmest congratulation, echoing those \nalready addressed to him from this rostrum by those speakers who have \npreceded me. His election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly is a tribute. Indeed, it duly \nrecognizes the confidence which is owing to his personal qualities, \nparticularly his competence, to which solemn homage has thus been \npaid. His election, moreover, is a mark of recognition of the \nimportant role that his country plays within the international \ncommunity in the promotion of the ideals and principles inscribed in \nthe Charter. In this context, the Rwandese delegation, whose \nreadiness and sincere co-operation are assured him, is convinced that \nunder his presidency the work of the current session will yield the \nresults which the international community is entitled to expect in \nview of the objectives justifying the existence of the United \nNations. May I also pay a tribute to Mr. Hollai's predecessor, Mr. \nKittani of Iraq, who deserved well of the Organization by the wisdom, \ndevotion, talent and dynamism with which he led the debates, which \nwere undeniably long and difficult, that took place during the \nthirty-sixth session, as well as those of the seventh and ninth \nemergency special sessions and those of the special session devoted \nto disarmament. I should also like to take this opportunity to \nreiterate the congratulations of the Government of Rwanda to Mr. \nPerez de Cuellar following his election as Secretary-General. The \nGovernment and people of Rwanda again express their best wishes for \nhis full success in his noble and difficult mission and commit \nthemselves to supporting him and assuring him of their full \nco-operation, within their means, in giving concrete form to the \nideals for which the United Nations remains the guarantor and trustee.\nIn accordance with established tradition, the General Assembly is \ngathered here to take stock of a year of activities by the United \nNations, primarily for the purpose of preparing for the future in \naccordance with the lessons, experiences and results of the past. As \nhappens every year, a privileged opportunity has again been given to \nall Member States publicly and solemnly to express their positions \nwith regard to problems which are currently of concern to the \ninternational community, as well as their hopes for the future-hopes \nwhose realization will depend on the mobilization and contribution of \nall peoples within the framework of increasingly active solidarity, \nabove and beyond pious wishes and simple declarations of intent.\n$53\nThe concerns of the Rwandese delegation bear first of all on the \ninternational economic situation, which scarcely prompts optimism, \nfollowing a structural crisis which is creating an increasingly wide \ngap between the industrialized countries and the developing \ncountries. World recession, monetary upheavals and increasingly heavy \nand crushing indebtedness confront the developing countries with \nproblems that are at times inextricable and they are threatened in \nthe end with bankruptcy.\nDuring the year which is drawing to an end, no tangible development \nhas occurred to modify in any positive or lasting way that tragically \nalarming trend, which the international community has been deploring \nfor several years. The world continues to flounder in this crisis, \nwhich reduces to naught the ambitions and hope of enabling the \nmajority of three quarters of humanity to escape the suffering of \npoverty and wretchedness.\nThe disorder of the international monetary system thus aggravates the \nproblems of the third world countries which, while on the path to \ndevelopment with precarious resources, difficulties which are \ncharacterized notably by the persistence of inflationary pressures, \nthe increasingly marked deterioration in terms of trade and the \nreduction of resources of institutions whose mission is to ensure \nfinancing.\nFor many such countries, the deterioration of the food situation has \nalready gone beyond the point at which they are forced to increase \ntheir dependence on imported products to such a degree that they are \nno longer in a position to make the adjustments necessary to break \nthe spiral of a worsening food shortage.\nIn this context, the countries which can afford to should abandon an \nexceedingly comfortable and simple attitude of inward withdrawal and \nshould devote further efforts to ensuring that their official \ndevelopment assistance reaches the target of 0.7 per cent of gross \nnational product set within the framework of the Second United \nNations Development Decade. In that connection, the Republic of \nRwanda would like to hail the decision already taken by a certain \nnumber of industrialized countries, which intend to devote 0.15 per \ncent of their gross national product to assistance for the least \ndeveloped countries, of which my country is unfortunately a member.\nMy country at the same time welcomes the fact that the target of 0.15 \nper cent has been approved in the Substantial New Programme of Action \nfor the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries, a programme which \nthe General Assembly endorsed in resolution 36/194. My delegation \nventures to hope that donor countries, as well as all potential prime \nlenders, will take adequate steps forthwith so as to ensure the \neffective implementation of the Substantial New Programme of Action. \nMy delegation is thinking particularly of immediate steps making it \npossible to satisfy the most urgent needs of the least developed \ncountries. I should like to refer, by way of example, to the \nprovision of substantial resources to reduce shortages of foodstuffs \nand energy resources, immediate financial assistance in the form of \nthe cancellation or (rescheduling of debts and support for the \nbalance of payments, and the immediate provision of supplementary \nfinancial support, especially for identification of projects, the \ncarrying out of feasibility studies and the detailed preparation of \ninvestment projects.\nThe hardly encouraging picture of the world economy shows that the \nestablishment of a new international economic order based on justice \nand equity is an urgent and imperative need. In that regard, I need \nnot dwell on the disappointment caused by the impasse regarding the \nglobal negotiations. Since the eleventh special session of the \nGeneral Assembly, in August 1980, two years have elapsed without \ndelegations having succeeded in finding a compromise acceptable to \nall parties so as to permit the effective resumption of global \nnegotiations.\nAlthough the present situation is undoubtedly one of impasse, certain \nparties like to praise the therapeutic virtues of the free play of \nmarket forces, which unfortunately benefit only the powerful and the \nstrong, inasmuch as they do not fall within the framework of a real \nstrategy of international co-operation and disregard economic \ninterdependence, thus threatening to exacerbate the disagreements and \ndisparities among States.\nThe Government of Rwanda is firmly convinced that the development of \nthe third world depends on a fundamental restructuring of \ninternational economic relations as a result of reforms designed to \nput an end to the present system, which tends to keep the poor \nmajority subordinated to the wealthy minority. Interdependence is a \ncrucial element which must constantly be borne in mind: it should \ninspire greater solidarity and complementarity in the organization of \nthe economic relations between the industrialized countries, which \npossess the technology, and the developing countries, which possess \nraw materials. To disregard that reality would be to close our eyes \ndeliberately to the facts and risk plunging the international \ncommunity inextricably into a crisis.\nInterdependence should not, however, be limited to North-South \nrelations; it should also be an important element in South-South \nrelations, and should be understood to apply particularly to \nco-operation among developing countries-co-operation which the \neffective implementation of the Caracas Programme of Action would al \nlow to develop and strengthen yet further.\nIn this connection, Rwanda is working unceasingly and with all its \nstrength to promote and strengthen its co-operation with other \ndeveloping countries in general and neighboring countries in \nparticular. With the latter Rwanda is endeavoring to develop \nrelations of friendship and co-operation on the bilateral level and \nalso within the framework of the sub regional communities. The \nRwandese delegation is convinced that such co-operation, which is \nfully in keeping with the objectives set forth in the Lagos Plan of \nAction for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the \nEconomic Development of Africa constitutes, with regard to the \ncountries concerned, an important contribution to the achievement of \ninternational economic relations which serve the interests of all the \nparties. We are also convinced that we must foster exchanges which \ncould enable the third world countries to confront the difficulties \ninherent in the imbalance of the present system, which is reflected \nin persistent disorder and profound structural problems.\nIt is high time all States understood that all hope of peace and \nsecurity will be vain as long as the world is ruled by a system which \nmaintains three quarters of mankind in the worst conditions of \npoverty, malnutrition, hunger and even abject, pathetic and revolting \nsqualor.\nThe conclusions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of \nthe Sea have shown the skeptics that the Organization constitutes an \nideal framework for constructive dialogue on problems and questions \nof world interest. Rwanda welcomed the adoption last April by a great \nmajority of countries of the United Nations Convention on the Law of \nthe Sea. It is not necessary to recall here the entire background of \nthat Conference; its origins are well known to all delegations at \nthis session of the General Assembly. My delegation would simply like \nto pay a well-deserved tribute to all the delegations that took an \nactive part in the work of that important Conference, at which there \nwere lengthy negotiations before arriving, after more than 10 years, \nat the drafting and adoption of an effective international instrument \non the law of the sea.\nAs a representative of a developing country which is, furthermore, \ndeprived of direct access to the sea, I should like to take this \nopportunity to express, on behalf of the Government and people of \nRwanda, our sincere satisfaction with the provisions of the \nConvention concerning the right of access to and from the sea and \nalso the exercise of the rights provided for in the Convention, \nespecially those pertaining to the freedom of the high seas, the \ncommon heritage of mankind and the enjoyment of freedom of transit \nthrough the territory of transit States by all means of \ntransportation. The land-locked countries would certainly have liked \nto see other provisions included in the Convention, but they \nrefrained from insisting on that point so as not to jeopardize or \nblock the consensus which was sought by all parties.\nWe hope that the Convention will enter into force as soon as possible \nand that it will serve as a model for the management and sharing of \nthe wealth of our planet for the benefit of all mankind in general \nand of the poorest in particular. With this in mind, my delegation \nhopes that the delegations that so far have not, for various reasons, \nbeen able to support the Convention on the Law of the Sea will \nreconsider their position and join the majority, so that the \nobjectives which in this sphere are common to all Member States may \nbe achieved.\nWith the same optimism, we hope to see substantial and noteworthy \nprogress made in the sphere of international trade, which for several \nyears has been the object of important negotiations within UNCTAD. \nThe gradual fall in the prices of raw materials and the inexorable \nincrease in the prices of finished products make the economic \nsituation of the developing countries increasingly catastrophic, for \nthe deficits and the gaps to be filled compel them to contract more \nand more crushing debts and thus to become insolvent, which \njeopardizes their future not only socially and economically but also \npolitically.\nI shall not engage in the futile exercise of enumerating all the \nproblems confronting the developing countries in general and the \nleast developed and the land-locked countries in particular. I will \nsimply draw the attention of the Assembly once more to the fact that \nall the defects of the world economy are at present affecting even \nmore seriously this category of countries with weak and vulnerable \neconomies. Therefore I reiterate that the time has come for \nsolidarity and co-operation based on sharing, justice, equity and \ncomplementarity, in the framework of the democratization of \ninternational relations, which is an urgent necessity.\nThe role of the United Nations is to contribute to this and thereby \nto achieve its primary objective, that of promoting and ensuring the \nmaintenance of peace, security and justice, while working for \nindividual and collective well-being and progress, for the benefit of \nall the peoples of the world.\nWe are bound to note and to deplore the fact that the world does not \nseem to be prepared to lead from history and to give concrete form to \nthe noble ideals to which all the Member States freely and solemnly \nsubscribed.\nSince the policy of detente, which would allow different \nsocio-economic and political systems to lay the groundwork for \nfruitful co-operation, is increasingly losing ground to confrontation \nand tension; we face a future fraught with anguish and uncertainty. \nThe arms race in nuclear, bacteriological and classical weapons is \naccelerating at an alarming pace to the detriment of investment that \nmight help save people in developing countries from dire poverty.\nSome references to problems of our times and a rapid overview show \nthat overt conflicts and areas of tension which bring to bear grave \nthreats to international peace and security are very much with us. \nSome are due to anachronistic colonialism or to the hateful and \ncynical policy of apartheid. All are linked to flagrant violations of \nthe Charter and norms established by international law.\nIn Africa, above and beyond socio-economic problems, one of the major \nconcerns remains the situation prevailing in the southern part of \nthat continent and the sufferings, sacrifices and tragedies imposed \non the Namibian people and on black South Africans struggling for \nrecognition of their most basic rights.\nAs regards Namibia, which is still illegally occupied and \nadministered by the minority racist Pretoria regime, the many actions \nundertaken by the United Nations to lead that Territory to \nindependence-a matter for which the United Nations bears \nresponsibility-have thus far come up against the intransigence, \nhesitation and dilatory maneuvers of South Africa, which arrogantly \ndefies the international community. How can we fail to deplore the \nprocrastination and the attempts to torpedo the United Nations plan \nfor Namibia, when every day the Namibian people thirst for \nindependence, for which it will continue to pay a heavy price, \nthrough the sufferings of freedom fighters who go as far as making \nthe supreme sacrifice to emancipate their homeland?\nThe Government of Rwanda, which has had the privilege and signal \nhonor of taking part in the delegation sent by the OAU to the Western \ncountries members of the contact group on Namibia, bitterly regrets \nthat this year is likely to end without the date on which the \nNamibian people is to achieve self- determination and independence \nbeing firmly set. In this connection my delegation would like to \nreaffirm the conviction of the Government of Rwanda that the United \nNations plan for Namibia remains the only realistic framework for any \ninitiative pertaining to the future of the Namibian people. That is \nwhy the five Western countries that make up the contact group cannot \nbow out without betraying the hopes and desires that the overwhelming \nmajority of the international community have for Namibia. That is why \nthose countries should be encouraged to show greater determination, \nwillingness and commitment to compel South Africa to agree to strict \nimplementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\nThe right of the Namibian people to self-determination and \nindependence should not, under any circumstance or any pretext, be \nsacrificed to the selfish interests of certain States Members of the \nUnited Nations, States which, deaf to the repeated appeals of the \ninternational community, happily continue their collaboration with \nthe Pretoria regime in economic, military and other matters.\nThe accession of Namibia to independence is an inevitable process \nwhich goes along with the tide of history. It is thus absolutely \nnecessary for the Namibian people to be able without further delay to \nexercise its right to decide on its future for itself in complete \nindependence and to choose for itself, free of any external \ninterference, the political regime and socioeconomic system that \nwould be in keeping with its legitimate aspirations.\nIn recalling this position the Rwandese delegation once again hails \nthe nationalist and anti-colonialist struggle being waged by that \nvaliant people of heroes and martyrs under the aegis of SWAPO, its \nsole legitimate representative, to which Rwanda solemnly reiterates \nits unflagging support.\nThe return to the policy of gunboat diplomacy and the wanton and \nexclusive quest for spheres of influence, which sacrifice principles \nsacred to the entire international community as well as the \nelementary rights of peoples, will in no way affect the justness of \nthe cause of the Namibian people. It will at the most delay matters; \nit will not at all undermine the heroism of that people.\nI should also like to express the Rwandese Government's solidarity \nwith the front-line States of southern Africa and more specifically \nthe People's Republic of Angola and Mozambique, which are constantly \nvictims of the bloody, barbarous aggressions and acts of sabotage in \nwhich the racist minority regime of South Africa takes pleasure.\nIn South Africa itself the proponents of apartheid-the iniquitous, \nhateful and inhuman policy they have established as a system of \nGovernment, thus enshrining racism and racial segregation as State \npolicy-are attempting to maintain domination without regard for \nmorality and right. So it is-and this is only one of many \nexamples-that they install the majority of the population in \nso-called independent Bantustans and have recourse to ignoble \npractices such as assassination, kidnapping, torture and imprisonment \nagainst nationalists.\nThis regime, which has been abhorred by the great majority of Member \nStates, furthermore stubbornly defies the international community by \nterrorizing all of southern Africa through armed invasions, \nassassinations, massacres, infiltration, political de- stabilization \nand acts of economic sabotage against neighboring States. Quite \nobviously such practices amount to a desperate strategy in the face \nof the sacred cause of the liberation of peoples defense of which is \ndaily mobilizing greater strength and determination within South \nAfrica itself. That tangible progress compels the South African \nFascists to launch escalated guerrilla warfare and frequently to \nresort to the use of bands of mercenaries.\nIn this context, in this International Year of Mobilization for \nSanctions against South Africa it is important that the diplomatic \nworld redouble its efforts to isolate completely the minority racist \nregime in South Africa, politically, economically and militarily.\nThe situation in Chad is also a matter of concern to the African \ncontinent. The fratricidal conflict which has ravished that country \nhas seemed for some months now to have died down to some extent, but \nwhat is temporary threatens to last, jeopardizing the settlement of \nthe crisis, unless all the protagonists abandon once and for all \ntheir bitterness and resolutely commit themselves in a spirit of \nnational reconciliation to the quest for a peaceful solution which \nwill safeguard the higher interests of their country and, especially, \npreserve its territorial integrity. Such a development is an \nimportant prerequisite for the reconstruction and development of that \ncountry, tom by internecine strife. That reconstruction and \ndevelopment will be the taskof all its vital forces, and Member \nStates will not spare their support in this long-term endeavor, \nthereby showing the value they attach to the maintenance of peace and \nsecurity, which the people of Chad so badly need.\nStill in Africa, the question of Western Sahara is also a topical one \nand a major concern for our continent. For my country, the essential \naspect of this issue is the need to apply the universal principle of \nthe right of peoples to self-determination. It is in that spirit \nthat, since 1976, it has recognized the Sahraoui Arab Democratic \nRepublic.\nReference to the principles which inspire and underlie international \nethics and politics requires that the African countries, which have \nalways shown their support for peoples struggling for recognition of \ntheir right to self-determination, bury their disputes on Western \nSahara in order to preserve their vital unity in the OAU, without \ndenying the principles they have freely subscribed to or sacrificing \neither the interests or the rights of the Sahraoui people.\nOther fratricidal conflicts which play their part in the \nproliferation of areas of tension continue in Africa, where they \nseriously threaten peace, security and stability in the regions and \nareas concerned and could encourage outside interference.\nWith full respect for the sovereignty of other States, the position \nof Rwanda with regard to these conflicts and tensions, which \nconstitute grave obstacles to development, is to put its trust in the \nwisdom of the parties involved and hope that the spirit of \nconciliation will prevail over hatred and that recourse to compromise \nsolutions will help to preserve peace, security and stability in \nAfrica, with strict respect for the principles of the charter of the \nOAU and that of the United Nations.\nFor more than 30 years tension and murderous confusion have persisted \nin the Middle East, against the background of the intolerable \nmartyrdom constantly imposed on the Palestinian people. Today more \nthan ever this troubled region is characterized by the intransigence \nand barbarity of the State of Israel, which scorns the decisions of \nthe international community and resorts to the policy of an ostrich, \nburying its head and refusing to recognize the right of the \nPalestinian people to self-determination. In the orgy of fire and \nMood of which Lebanon has recently been the scene, this year has been \nmarked by an unprecedented increase in acts of violence, launched by \nIsrael on the pretext of reprisals against the PLO and of \nself-defense against the other States in the region.\nAt the same time, the repression in the occupied Arab territories has \nnever been so brutal and savage. Armed with its arrogance, which has \nbeen denounced and condemned many times by the Assembly, Israel \narrogates to itself the right to annex the Syrian Golan Heights in \nflagrant violation of the Charter and of the established principles \nof international law. Its invasion of Lebanon, its provocation and \nharassment of all kinds in the occupied territories and the \nestablishment of new settlements are all elements which clearly \nillustrate Israel's contempt for international morality and ethics as \naffirmed in many resolutions of the United Nations, to which that \nungrateful State owes its birth.\nThe many repercussions of the situation in the Middle East \ndemonstrate the absolute and imperative need for a comprehensive \nsolution. In this context, Rwanda remains convinced that any just and \nlasting solution in this region must necessarily involve the \nrestoration to the Palestinian people of its fundamental and \nlegitimate rights, especially its right to self-determination, the \nright to its own homeland to establish there, under the aegis of the \nPLO, its sole legitimate representative, the governmental structures \nof its choice. As long as this key problem is not satisfactorily \nsolved, as long as the State of Israel refuses to return the Arab \nterritories it has been occupying by force since 1967, including the \nHoly City of Jerusalem, as long as it persists in rejecting full \nparticipation by the PLO in the initiatives designed to promote the \npeace process in the Middle East, it will be an illusion to expect \npositive and constructive developments in this region so vital to \ninternational peace and security.\nThe diaspora imposed on the valiant Palestinian people will not give \nthe slightest legitimacy to acts designed to stifle its legitimate \naspirations, any more than the policy of terror and occupation of the \nIsraeli Government will deflect the international community from its \nduty to promote, everywhere and in all circumstances, peace and \njustice, which are the foundations of the Charter.\nAbove and beyond the Israeli-Arab conflict, the state of war which \npersists between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran, despite the \nmany attempts at mediation, also continues to be a cause of deep \nconcern in that already explosive region and for the whole of the \ninternational community. That war, in which the victims can be \ncounted in thousands, is seriously disrupting the economies of the \ntwo parties to the conflict, for which it involves a considerable \nloss of business. The Rwandese delegation pays a tribute to all \npeople of good will who have spared no effort to seek a settlement of \nthis fratricidal conflict. Rwanda hopes that these two non-aligned \ncountries which, furthermore, have the some Islamic faith, will not \nremain deaf to the urgent appeals of the international community \nurging them to find once again the way to concord and co-operation, \ninstead of following the easy way which leads to hatred and \ndestruction, and so that they may seek the honor of promoting peace, \nunderstanding and co-operation.\nIn central Asia, the Afghan crisis persists and clearly shows the \nprecariousness and fragile nature of East-West detente. The events \nwhich have occurred in Afghanistan have in fact provoked a deep \ndivision in the policy of detente, a division which has increased \nfollowing the Polish crisis, exacerbating suspicions which have \nbecome only too commonplace when they involve a struggle for \ninfluence on the international scene.\nRwanda believes in the need to establish and develop a calmer climate \nwhich may allow all nations to make further development efforts. \nRwanda feels at the same time that attempts to promote detente cannot \nexclude the third world in general, and Africa in particular, without \nrunning the risk of being ineffective.\nIn Indo-China, Kampuchea is still torn asunder by a continuing \nfratricidal struggle, with outside interference, for the control of \npower.\nThe Rwandese Government believes that respect for the sovereignty of \nStates, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries \nand the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes should allow for \nan end to such conflicts, which are obstacles to the security and \npeace needed by the international community, for they go hand in hand \nwith the arms race.\nAs regards divided nations, Rwanda supports the right of peoples \ndirectly concerned in this problem to seek ways and means to \nrediscover their unity. They should exercise this right peacefully, \nfree from any interference or outside pressure.\nIt is with this in view that the Rwandese Republic remains firmly \nconvinced that the Korean nation cannot achieve its reunification \nunless all foreign troops withdraw from that area.\nThe Rwandese Government also considers that current relations between \nthe two German States are a reflection of the spirit of detente which \nunderlies their relations. The co-operation established between those \ntwo States should attenuate at least to some degree the effects of \ndivision and gradually create a political climate which will not \nexclude the idea of a free and peaceful reunification of the German \nnation.\nOur concern in the face of an increase of areas of tension and the \npersistence of conflicts should not lead us to forget that the \ngreatest danger to international peace and security is the unbridled \narms race which causes the threat of an unprecedented holocaust to \nloom large over the world.\nThe second special session on disarmament, which was of such great \ninterest to the General Assembly, showed sufficiently that the \nprovisions of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the \nGeneral Assembly were not applied in a satisfactory manner.\nThe dawning of an era of peace, progress and justice for all peoples \nis still impeded by the constant increase and spectacular improvement \nof massive means of destruction. Research programmes and military \ndevelopment in this regard are disquieting, for immense financial, \nmaterial and human resources are being increasingly mobilized to \nrefine the techniques of the extermination of the human race, thereby \nincreasing the risk of conflict and conflagration.\nThe Rwandese Government solemnly reiterates its appeal that this \nformidable scientific and technological potential, as well as the \nfinancial means and human resources which allow for its development, \nbe further exploited for peaceful purposes, especially to reduce the \ngap separating the wealthy from the still developing countries.\nWill the international community be able to face the great challenge \nof our century, that is, the close relationship between disarmament \nand development? This is the outlook which all States Members of the \nUnited Nations-especially the developed countries in general and the \ngreat Powers in particular-should adopt in seeking elements of a \nsolution to the problems of our times, without any ulterior motive or \nevasion, but armed first and foremost with the firm determination and \ngenuine will to promote concord, solidarity and co-operation among \nall peoples.\nThis is the message of hope which I wish to transmit from this \nrostrum on behalf of the Government and people of Rwanda, in the \nconviction that the work of this thirty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly will lead to results specifically in keeping with \nthe expectations of the United Nations, the Organization which is \nresponsible to the whole international community for results which \nwill consolidate and enhance its prestige.\n"

        "file_text": "146.\tOn behalf of the Government and people of Japan, I should like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the thirty- seventh session of the General Assembly. I am confident that with your abundant experience and superior wisdom the current session will be a most fruitful one. Please be assured that the delegation of Japan will spare no effort in co-operating with you as you carry out your important tasks.\n147.\tAt the same time, I should like to express our deep appreciation to the President of the thirty-sixth session of the Genera! Assembly, Mr. Kittani, for the effective manner in which he discharged his awesome responsibilities.\n148.\tI wish also to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar. Although it was only a few months ago that he assumed the highest office of the Organization, the leadership that he has demonstrated in dealing with the harsh realities of the international situation has won him our full confidence. It was a great pleasure for me to welcome him to Japan this past summer and have the opportunity candidly to exchange views on the role which the United Nations should play in the maintenance of international peace and security as well as in various fields of international co-operation.\n149.\tIn today's international community, with its deepening relationships of interdependence, there is a growing need for nations to co-operate for the attainment of world peace and prosperity. But we cannot fail to notice that tension and distrust continue to persist among nations of the world.\n150.\tIn my statement today I should therefore like first to comment on the current international situation and then to present my views on what role the United Nations should play in these circumstances.\n151.\tI believe that one of the major sources of mutual distrust and tension within today's international community is the tendency for one country, as a means of solving international conflicts, to resort to arms and to impose its will on another country by military intervention.\n\n152.\tI shall discuss first of all the situation in Asia, of which Japan is a part. Kampuchea continues to be the victim of foreign military intervention, and its people are still denied the right of self-determination. Consequently, the Kampuchean people are suffering from disease and starvation, and the flow of refugees out of the country has not yet been stemmed. Japan once again strongly urges Viet Nam to end its military intervention in Kampuchea and agree to enter into negotiations, thereby responding to international efforts toward a comprehensive political settlement, which would include the withdrawal of all foreign forces and the holding of free elections under the supervision of the United Nations. Moreover, the United Nations should continue to explore every means of solving the problem of Kampuchea. At the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly, Japan suggested that a representative of the Secretary- General be sent to the countries concerned. That suggestion was implemented during the course of this year, and the Committee of the International Conference on Kampuchea dispatched missions to search for ways of solving the problem. Japan strongly supports such United Nations efforts towards a comprehensive political settlement.\n153.\tI should also like at this time to touch upon the situation in the Korean peninsula, which lies just across the sea from Japan. In that region, too, tensions persist, but last January the Government of the Republic of Korea made a proposal on the unification of the South and the North. I welcome and appreciate that proposal because it outlines a procedure that is of a more concrete and realistic nature than anything that has been proposed so far. It is my hope that efforts towards the realization of a dialogue between the South and the North will continue.\n154.\tThe Soviet armed intervention in Afghanistan has not yet come to an end, which adds to the sufferings of the Afghan people. The Soviet Union must, above all, face up to the fact that its military activities in Afghanistan seriously damage relations of trust and confidence between East and West, and threaten international peace and security. Japan takes this opportunity to appeal once again, in the strongest terms, to the Soviet Union immediately to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan and to restore to the Afghan people its right of self-determination.\n155.\tThis past year has witnessed an alarming increase in tensions in the Middle East. While Japan duly appreciates Israel's returning the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in accordance with the Camp David agreements, it strongly denounces other Israeli actions, such as its annexation of the Golan Heights, the reinforcement of its policy of denying the right of self-determination to the Palestinian people in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, and its invasion of Lebanon, In particular, Japan demands that Israel withdraw its forces from Lebanon immediately.\n156.\tFurthermore, the recent massacre of a great number of innocent Palestinian refugees in west Beirut is an extremely outrageous act of violence. Japan registers its indignation at this cruel act. The Government of Japan strongly urges the parties concerned to guarantee the life and security of the civilian population in the area, including the Palestinian inhabitants, in accordance with the relevant Security Council, and other United Nations, resolutions. In this regard, Japan welcomes the redeployment in Beirut of the multinational force comprising troops from the United States, France and Italy.\n157.\tOn the other hand, Japan highly appreciates, as contributing to the stability of Lebanon, the fact that Mr. Amin Gemayel has been inaugurated as President in spite of various difficulties, and it earnestly hopes that Lebanon will be united under its new President to achieve the early restoration of its internal order on the basis of national reconciliation and that it will embark on the reconstruction of the country. Japan is prepared to extend all possible co-operation to that end.\n158.\tThe recent developments in Lebanon have strengthened Japan's conviction that it is essential to bring about an early settlement of the Middle East peace problem, the core of which is the Palestinian question. In order to achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, it is necessary that Israeli forces be withdrawn from all the territories occupied in the 1967 war, that the right to exist of all the States concerned be respected, and that negotiations be started among the parties concerned, in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). It is also necessary that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, particularly the right of self-determination, including the right to establish an independent state, be recognized and respected in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\n159.\tI wish to express my appreciation for the initiative President Reagan took in his Middle East peace proposal of 1 September, which squarely confronts the question of Palestine, the core of the Middle East problem. Shortly after President Reagan made his proposal, the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference, held at Fez, adopted its own peace proposal. Japan highly values the fact that Arab countries are united in showing their will for peace. It is our earnest hope that the parties concerned will bear these proposals in mind and will resume efforts for a peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem.\n160.\tThe continued fighting between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq is also a source of grave concern to me. Japan renews its appeal to both countries to cease their fighting without delay and to settle the conflict by peaceful means.\n161.\tTurning our attention now to Eastern Europe, we note that the extraordinary state of affairs in Poland persists. This threatens to endanger the relationship of East-West co-operation and exchange which has been pursued to date and is likely seriously to affect the peace and stability of the world. Japan hopes that the present problems will be resolved by the Polish people themselves and that a genuine national reconciliation will be achieved in the near future.\n162.\tIn these international circumstances, Japan is determined to maintain its basic policy of pursuing peace, of refusing to become a military Power and of contributing to the building of world peace and prosperity. In accordance with that policy, Japan has endeavoured to promote friendly and co-operative relations with other countries throughout the world.\n174. From this point of view, Japan sincerely hopes to develop stable relations based on genuine mutual understanding with the Soviet Union, one of its most important neighbours. However, there remains between Japan and the Soviet Union the unsettled problem of the Northern Territories, the reversion of which Japan has consistently demanded from the Soviet Union. It is due to that problem that our two countries have not yet concluded a peace treaty. Moreover, we have been confronted with the extremely regrettable situation of the Soviet Union recently having deployed and strengthened its military forces in the Northern Territories. Measures such as those in no way foster relations of trust between States. The Government of Japan strongly urges the Soviet Union to rectify this situation promptly and to come to the negotiating table with a view to settling the issue of the Northern Territories and thereby to concluding a peace treaty.\n173. The mutual distrust and increased tensions which prevail in today's international community contain the danger of luring mankind into catastrophe. And yet the United Nations, which was created to save mankind from such a danger, cannot claim that it has been discharging its tasks to the full.\n176.\tIn his report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General has deplored this state of affairs, stating that \\\"... we have strayed far from the Charter in recent years.  The Security Council... all too often finds itself unable to take decisive action... and its resolutions are increasingly defied or ignored ... [The] process of peaceful settlement of disputes... is often brushed aside.... We are perilously near to a new international anarchy \\\".\n177.\tIt is precisely times such as these that require a serious re-examination of the ways to build relations of mutual trust between nations and to attain peace and prosperity throughout the world. It is precisely at such times that we must remind ourselves that the Organization was established with the determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war which has brought untold sorrow to mankind.\n178.\tI believe that the United Nations must strengthen whatever functions it can fulfil so that mutual distrust will never again be a threat to our future. With that in mind, I should like to stress the following three requirements for developing relations of mutual trust among States through the United Nations: first, the peace-keeping functions of the United Nations should be strengthened; secondly, United Nations functions in the field of disarmament should be enhanced; and, thirdly, the United Nations role in the fields of economic and social development should be reinforced.\n179.\tI should like first to elaborate on the question of strengthening the peace-keeping functions of the United Nations. The primary purpose of the United Nations is the maintenance of international peace and security. However, as the Secretary-General has pointed out, the Organization has not functioned with sufficient effectiveness to that end. If we regard this situation as inevitable and simply dismiss it, the trust that nations place in the Organization will surely be lost and its foundation undermined. Accordingly,\nI wish now to raise a few issues regarding the United Nations peace-keeping functions and to express my ideas on how to improve and strengthen those functions.\n180.\tOne of these issues relates to the role of the Secretary-General. I should like to urge that, as one of the ways in which the United Nations could function to prevent international conflicts, the Secretary-General, whenever he deems that peace is being threatened, take the initiative and immediately contact the parties concerned in an effort to prevent a worsening of the situation. I believe that all Member States should co-operate so that the authority of the Secretary-General may be utilized to the maximum extent.\n181.\tMoreover, my Government has in the past proposed that the Secretary-General send his representative to investigate the facts In areas of dispute. I should like to stress again that the Secretary-General's authority in this regard should also be fully put to use.\n182.\tIn addition, I am convinced that the Secretary- General's authority in the field of mediation and conciliation must be strengthened. In so doing it is essential that parties to a dispute show courage in accepting and co-operating positively with the mediation and conciliation efforts of the Secretary-General or his representative. The Secretary-General has in fact dispatched his representatives to areas of concern in an effort to settle problems relating to, for example, the question of Kampuchea, the situation in Afghanistan and the conflict between Iran and Iraq; and the mediation efforts of the Secretary-General himself in the conflict over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) were particularly valuable. Therefore, although they may not always bring about immediate results, it is important that the Secretary-General's mediation and conciliation efforts be patiently continued. I believe that such efforts will contribute to the restoration and strengthening of relations of trust between parties, which serve as the basis for the peaceful settlement of disputes.\n183.\tA second issue that I wish to raise in connection with the strengthening of the United Nations peacekeeping functions is the role of the Security Council. As we all know, the Security Council is given the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Regrettably, however, the Council has not performed its tasks effectively. I believe it is vital that the members of the Council, responding to the trust placed in them, strive to restore to that organ its functions as originally envisaged. It is particularly important that its permanent members recognize anew the significance of their duties and co-operate among themselves. In his report, to which I have already referred, the Secretary-General also points out that co-operation among the permanent members of the Council is indispensable for its effectiveness, and he makes a special appeal to them to reassess their obligations and responsibilities. I support that appeal, and would also urge the permanent members to consider seriously the need for strengthening the Security Council's functions. \n184.\tLastly, while the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations have contributed to the quelling of local disputes and the maintenance of cease-fires, there is a definite need to explore ways of enabling these operations to function in a more effective, manner. These peace-keeping operations have been playing an invaluable role; but it cannot be denied that they suffer from the absence of a clear provision in the Charter regarding their activities, which means that they have to be set up each time a conflict occurs. In these times, when conflicts between nations occur frequently, it is necessary to re-examine the peacekeeping operations with a view to enabling them to be deployed with sufficient speed and efficiency.\n185.\tA number of points could be considered, such as a system of prior registration and organization of the personnel, equipment and materials which Member States are ready to contribute to future operations; the holding by the United Nations of study and training exercises relating to peace-keeping operations; and the securing of effective financial backing In his report the Secretary-General, too, suggests that the Security Council should urgently undertake a study of how to strengthen the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations. I earnestly hope that a study on the strengthening of the peace-keeping functions of the United Nations will be made, taking the Secretary- General's suggestions into consideration. Japan, for its part, is ready to co-operate more actively in the strengthening of the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations.\n186.\tWith regard to the United Nations peacekeeping functions, I should like to comment on the role played by the Organization in efforts to achieve the independence of Namibia. We note that in spite of the serious efforts of the parties concerned the process of elections under the supervision of the United Nations has not yet commenced. I strongly hope that the parties concerned will continue to work towards the achievement of Namibian independence, and that the decolonization efforts of the United Nations will be successful. Japan reaffirms its readiness to co-operate with UNTAG by providing civilian personnel, as well as in other appropriate ways, once it begins operation.\n187.\tThe second area that I should like to discuss with regard to strengthening the role of the United Nations is that of disarmament. Today the heightening of international tensions and of distrust among States is accelerating the arms race, and the expanded arms race in turn adds to the mutual distrust and tension, threatening the very survival of mankind. In these circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the calls of nations, including my own, for disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, have reached unprecedented levels.\n188.\tAgainst this background of increased awareness of disarmament issues throughout the international community, the twelfth special session of the General Assembly, the second special session devoted to disarmament, was convened last June, with the participation of the Prime Minister of Japan, Suzuki, and many other heads of State or Government. Although it was earnestly hoped that at that special session the Assembly would adopt a document on a comprehensive programme of disarmament, it was regrettably unable to do so. Nevertheless, the special session unanimously reaffirmed the validity of the Final Document in resolution S-10/2, and the conviction was expressed that the deliberations at the second session would provide a powerful impetus to efforts towards promoting disarmament. \n189.\tThrough the deliberations at the second special session on disarmament, we were once again made; to feel keenly how difficult it is to promote disarmament under the prevailing tense international situation. At the. same time, the special session provided us with the opportunity to strengthen the conviction shared by all Member States that by continuing our disarmament efforts under these , circumstances we shall further solidify the foundations of peace and security of the international community. We must not lose the momentum gained at the second special session, but must promote, step by step, international efforts towards achieving disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament.\n190.\tAt the 5th meeting of the twelfth special session, Prime Minister Suzuki reiterated Japan's national commitment to peace and its refusal to become a military power, while upholding its three non-nuclear principles of not possessing nuclear weapons, not producing them and not permitting their introduction into Japan. On the basis of this fundamental position, he proposed three principles for the achievement of peace through disarmament: first the promotion of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament; secondly, the utilization of the human and physical resources which would be released by disarmament to alleviate poverty and social instability and, thirdly the strengthening and reinforcement of United Nations peace-keeping functions for the promotion of disarmament. Japan is resolved to continue to play a positive role in the United Nations and in other forums so that these principles can be realized as soon as possible. Japan has emphasized that a comprehensive nuclear test ban and the prohibition of chemical weapons are the most urgent tasks to be pursued by the international community and that they should be realized as soon as possible. Japan is determined to continue to contribute to the promotion of negotiations on these items in the Committee on Disarmament.\n191.\tMoreover, Japan has been undertaking steps to implement the proposals which the Prime Minister made at the special session, particularly the proposal to install in the United Nations documentation and materials concerning Japan's atomic bomb experiences? and to extend co-operation under the United Nations Disarmament Fellowship Programme to enable participants to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki.^ Following up the proposal regarding international efforts to ensure and guarantee the security of nuclear facilities for peaceful purposes^ Japan, at the 1983 session of the Committee on Disarmament, submitted an outline of a draft protocol on the prohibition of attacks against nuclear facilities. We are resolved to persevere in these steady efforts for the process of disarmament. \n192.\tIt goes without saying that progress in nuclear disarmament hinges upon those States which have primary responsibility in this field, namely, the nuclear-weapon States, particularly the two nuclear super-Powers, the United States and the Soviet Union. It should be emphasized once again that bilateral efforts between the United States and the Soviet Union, together with multinational efforts, are absolutely necessary in the promotion of nuclear disarmament. The people of the entire world, fearful of the danger of nuclear war and earnestly desiring nuclear disarmament, are united in placing their hopes on the negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces and the strategic arms reduction talks between the United States and the Soviet Union. Japan strongly calls upon both countries to respond to those hopes and to concentrate their efforts to expedite these negotiations so as to produce tangible results as soon as possible.\n193.\tIn this connection, I wish to recall that, as part of his official trip to Japan shortly after the second special session devoted to disarmament, the Secretary-General visited Hiroshima, where he reaffirmed his recognition of the earnest hope of the Japanese people that the nuclear holocaust will never be repeated, and expressed renewed determination to strive for nuclear disarmament. I should like to pay a heartfelt tribute to the Secretary-General and to assure him that I fully share his determination.\n194.\tIn addition to peace-keeping and disarmament, a third area in which the role of the United Nations should be strengthened is that of economic and social development. The world economy is today facing a serious crisis, one which affects developed and developing countries alike, and there is no prospect that the future will necessarily be any brighter. Developing countries in particular are suffering from a considerable slow-down in their economic growth, a deterioration in their balance of payments and an accumulation of external debt, and it was reported in the United Nations this year that the per capita domestic product of these countries as a group recorded negative growth for the first time since the 1950s.\n195.\tThis situation must not be allowed to remain as it is. My country, recognizing that the revitalization of the world economy, along with the further development of the developing countries, is essential for the attainment of world peace and prosperity, has actively participated in the North-South dialogue in various United Nations forums, including UNCTAD, and has thus contributed to the establishment of better North-South relations. It will continue to be the policy of my Government to maintain and promote constructive dialogue with the developing countries and further to strengthen co-operation to promote their economic and social development. This policy is embodied in the new medium-term target established last year, under which my Government is endeavouring to expand its official development assistance. My Government is making these efforts despite an extremely stringent budgetary situation, and we would expect that the developing countries would for their part further intensify their development efforts so that official development assistance might be more effectively utilized.\t'\n196.\tThe global negotiations on international co-operation for development can be expected to play a very great role in advancing North-South dialogue in the 1980s. Japan realizes the political significance of the global negotiations and sincerely hopes that every arrangement for launching them will be completed as soon as possible. In this regard, my country strongly hopes that, the General Assembly in a spirit of co-operation, will at its current session achieve concrete results and, to this end, Japan intends to participate actively in consultations with other countries.\n197.\tIn addition to efforts to launch the global negotiations, Japan believes that all of us are responsible for assuring the success of the sixth session of UNCTAD to be held next June. The Conference has ambitiously tackled the problem of promoting international economic co-operation at the global level in the fields of trade and development, and since its first session in 1964 it has achieved concrete results. Japan strongly hopes that with such a history and such experience behind it, UNCTAD will at its sixth session seek realistic and workable solutions to the problems of trade and development, which constitute one of the most important issues facing mankind today, I wish to reaffirm Japan's resolve to participate actively in these efforts.\n198.\tI wish also to take this opportunity to appear strongly to all States to ratify as soon as possible the Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities,\\\" the greatest achievement of North- South dialogue in the 1970s, so that this agreement will enter into force by the target date, which is the end of next September.\n199.\tThe United Nations, in protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms and in working to achieve solutions to social problems such as those relating to refugees, women, children, the disabled, the aging, population and the environment, is playing an important role in the world today. Japan is highly gratified that, particularly in recent years, international co-operation in these fields has been consistently productive and has contributed to the improvement and development of the welfare of mankind. We shall contribute actively to such co-operative efforts as we have done in the past.\n200.\tIn this connection, I should especially like to pay a tribute to the activities of the various United Nations organs for the relief of refugees. At present, the international community is faced with several refugee problems for which there is no solution yet in sight, in places such as Indo-China, Afghanistan, the Middle East, Poland, Africa and Central America. I recently had the opportunity to visit an Afghan refugee camp in Pakistan. I must say that when I saw how the people there were being obliged to live in a state of deprivation, away from their homeland, I felt real sympathy for them.\n201.\tI strongly urge the United Nations to make further efforts for the relief of refugees. At the same time, I fully realize that in order to achieve a real solution to the refugee problem, it is essential to deal with its root causes. Japan, for its part, has provided considerable financial assistance to United Nations activities for the relief of refugees and will continue to extend the utmost co-operation for this purpose. I should also like to reiterate Japan's continued determination to provide its economic co-operation to countries such as Thailand, which are burdened with a huge influx of refugees, and our intention to continue to accept Indo-Chinese refugees in Japan.\n202.\tIn order for the United Nations to carry out thoroughly the functions I have mentioned, it is clearly essential that its financial base be strengthened.\nI should therefore like to make a strong appeal to every Member State to meet without fail the payment of its assessments and to increase its voluntary contributions.\n203.\tAt the same time, I believe it is absolutely necessary for the United Nations to strive to make its activities more effective and efficient. In order for the United Nations to carry out its functions effectively within the limited resources at its disposal and to retain the confidence of Member States, the Secretariat will have to make every effort to achieve greater efficiency, for example by reviewing its administrative structure and its activities, as well as by redistributing resources from activities of lower priority to those of higher priority. Needless to say, we, the States Members of the United Nations, simply must co-operate to achieve these ends.\n204.\tIn today's international community, differences in race, culture or creed often tend to foment mutual distrust, which becomes an obstacle in the process of peace and stability among nations. And yet, today, because the peoples of the world are growing ever more interdependent, no country can enjoy its own peace and prosperity unless the peace and stability of the entire community of nations is secure. The interests of each State are closely linked to those of the whole world. In this sense, today's international community can indeed be characterized as a community sharing the same destiny. We must all realize that each of us belongs to this community and must co-operate for the development of the community as a whole and refrain from pursuing solely the interests of our own country.\n205.\tThe United Nations is the only truly global organization we have. Overcoming numerous constraints and difficulties and exercising its greatest wisdom and efforts, mankind has developed the United Nations in order to pursue such co-operation among nations. We, as its Member States, are therefore duty bound to support the Organization and to make maximum use of it as the centre of international co-operation. I appeal to all Member States to build relations of trust with one another with the United Nations at the centre and do their utmost to achieve enduring peace and prosperity for humanity.\n206.\tI wish to conclude my remarks by declaring that Japan, a country whose commitment to supporting and co-operating with the United Nations is a major pillar of its foreign policy, is resolved to make every effort toward attaining that goal.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\nMy first and pleasant duty is to extend warm \nfelicitations and congratulations to the \nPresident, a distinguished son of Hungary, upon \nhis unanimous election. I and the other members \nof my delegation pledge our full cooperation with \nhim in his efforts to make this session of the \nAssembly a successful one. May I at the same time \npay a tribute to Mr. Kittani of Iraq who, with \npatience, tact and wisdom, guided the Assembly \nthrough the various and bewildering demands of \nthe last year? We owe him a debt of gratitude. \nMay I also reiterate my congratulations to the \nSecretary General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar of \nPeru, on his election to this most important \noffice at this most critical period? I have \npersonally had the pleasure and good fortune of \nworking with him in earlier years when he gave \ndedicated and unstinting service to his country \nand to the Organization. The seriousness and \nforthrightness which characterize the approach of \nthe Secretary General to the challenges facing \nthe Organization and its Member States have won \npraise and well deserved recognition within the \nOrganization as well as outside it. We wish him \nevery success.\nThe Secretary General aptly observed in his frank \nand perceptive report on the work of the \nOrganization we are perilously near to a new \ninternational anarchy. Guyana shares that \nassessment. The world economic crisis deepens \neven as political relations are beset by tension \nand turbulence. Within recent years there has \nbeen an intensification of global crises, \npolitical and economic, and a manifest trend \ntowards the exacerbation of existing situations \nand the creation of new ones, of so called local \nand regional conflicts, some of them with \ndevastating effect. Turbulence is pervasive. No \nregion, indeed no country, has escaped unscathed. \nMore than ever before States need in their \nbilateral relations to be conscious of the impact \nof their national policies on others and to take \nthe appropriate and necessary steps to avoid \nconflict preserve pluralism and promote security \nmid the economic and social development of \npeoples throughout the world.\nUnderlying current global tensions is the \nheightening of the contestation between social \nsystems. Nowhere is that more clearly reflected \nthan in the increase in expenditure on, and the \nsophistication of, armaments and weapons systems, \nfuelling the movement towards conflict and global \nconflagration. The language of cooperation has \nbeen superseded by that of confrontation and the \nrelations among the great Powers are now \ndangerously adversarial. Thus military and \npolitical rivalries have reached a new level, \ncreating in their wake deep fissures in \ninternational relations and the frustration of \nthe process of democratization of those relations.\nOur global political preoccupations are matched \nby economic preoccupations; equitable \ninternational economic relations are necessary \nprerequisites to political stability. The present \ninternational economic system is undoubtedly in \ndisarray and its debilitating effect on all \nStates, especially on the small and the weak, is \nmanifest.\nThe solution to that state of affairs demands \ncollective, reasoned efforts But the global \ncommunity has not responded in that manner often \nenough. Instead of a greater surge towards \nmultilateralism in international economic \nrelations, there is today a retreat from it, \nresulting in frustration and impasse. Meanwhile, \nefforts to fashion solutions upon partisan, \nbilateral criteria are being renewed. Indeed, the \nretreat from multilateralism that threatens \neconomic relations among States has been finding \nexpression in a reassertion of the dominance of \nsingle minded ideological approaches to economic \ndevelopment, in essence a return to economic \ndeterminism. In the retreat from multilateralism, \nin this return to economic determinism, we are \nfaced today with a dual tragedy. There is a \nsteadfast refusal to remodel existing \ninternational institutions in a way that would \nrender them more responsive to the serious \nproblems which imperil us all and, more \nparticularly, the developing countries. \nSimultaneously, we witness a tendency to deny \nthose multilateral institutions the resources \nrequired for their normal operations. In that \nregard the position of UNDP demands our special \nattention and we must urge a genuine commitment \nto meaningful resource allocation to allow that \nagency to continue its useful work in an \neffective manner.\nThe disturbing trend towards a bilateral \nresolution of global economic woes is \ndemonstrated in other ways. We cannot ignore the \nevidence of three years of continued stalemate in \nthe effort to launch the global round of \nnegotiations. There have been periodic signs \nduring the process which indicated movement but, \njust as rapidly, there has been another impasse. \nThe failure to agree on that launching has \nseriously weakened the much needed to undertake \ncollective solutions. The consequence is a \ngrowing indication that the global manifestation \nof the economic woes can be set aside until the \nnational endeavors at a solution have been \npursued. Thus the absence of global negotiations \nto help to resolve global problems of a \nstructural nature has resulted in almost a total \ndearth of measures to address the immediate \nissues which beset the global community. The \nindividual, partisan adjustment measures are \nbeing forged with an increasing incidence of the \nattendant burdens, costs and pains of that \nadjustment being borne by the developing \ncountries.\n183. The problems of depressed prices for \ncommodities, the prevalence of inflation and high \ninterest rates, the barriers to trade expansion \nand the chaos that characterizes the \ninternational financial system have been \nrepeatedly assessed, examined and analyzed from \nthis rostrum over the last few days. Those \nanalyses notwithstanding, we in the developing \ncountries are acutely aware of the limits to \ngrowth we now face as a result of those problems. \nNowhere are those limits more manifest than in \nour efforts at debt management. The problems \nposed by cur spiraling debt burdens present us \nwith tremendous difficulty. Efforts at adjustment \nto inflation in the developed world have had a \nvery grave effect on its economies. All of these \nproblems high rates of interest, mounting debt \nburdens and the very nature of the international \nfinancial system demand that we seek collective \nredress. It is our most compelling concern and \none that necessitates urgent and immediate \nconsideration. For our part, we in the developing \nworld have been willing to seek ways and means to \ncontribute collectively to the solution of the \nglobal problems, as evidenced in the Caracas \nProgramme of Action on economic cooperation among \ndeveloping countries. Our attempts to pool our \nindividual strengths and resource bases and thus \npromote our collective self reliance are \nnoteworthy and offer promise for the future. But, \nas has been noted on repeated occasions, economic \ncooperation among developing countries, South \nSouth cooperation, is but one part of the whole. \nIt is not a substitute for genuine progress in \nNorth South relations. The quest for solutions \nbased, on multilateral and collective methods \nshould be pursued unceasingly.\nGuyana notes with satisfaction the successful \nconclusion of the negotiating sessions of the \nThird United Nations Conference on the Law of the \nSea and the emergence of a final text which truly \nreflects the concerns of many who have labored \nlong and hard establish an international legal \nregime for the ocean space. It is Guyana's hope \nthat when we meet in Jamaica to sign the Final \nAct and Convention, the number signatories to the \nConvention will be a source of great satisfaction \nto those whose primary motivation over the past \nseveral years has been the promulgation of just \nand equitable arrangements for the most effective \nuse of the sea and the utilization of its \nresources for the benefit of all mankind, without \ndiscrimination.\nIt is, not unnaturally, a source of profound \nconcern that some States should have seen fit to \nstand aside from this historic effort. It is also \na matter for regret that a few developed States \nhave moreover chosen instead to conclude between \nthem a mini multilateral treaty in defiance of \nthe wishes of the overwhelming majority of the \nworld's States.\nIf I now tum to international political \nrelations, it is to say that these have \ndeteriorated markedly over the past few years. \nThe diagnoses of the malaise afflicting \ninternational relations are many and varied. They \nrange from the crisis in the multilateral \napproach in international affairs to the \nproliferation of armaments with the concomitant \nincentive and urge to utilize them; the collapse \nof cooperative endeavors evolved in the aftermath \nof the Second World War so called; an increasing \ndisregard for the fundamental norms and \nprinciples of international law; and a widespread \ntendency  too widespread to resort to lawless \nconduct based on confrontation, threats and \nviolence and, unhappily, intervention.\nThese negative manifestations have both \nencouraged and facilitated behavior antagonistic \nto full respect for the sovereignty and \nindependence of States small States in particular.\nInterventionist behavior is undoubtedly on the \nincrease. It is at once cause and effect of the \ncrisis in international relations, a \ndistinguishing feature of many conflicts. The \nextant cases are numerous in the Middle East, in \nEurope, in Africa and in Latin America.\nNonintervention in the affairs of other States \nhas served as one of the main pillars and guiding \nprinciples of a system of stable international \nrelations. The proscribing of intervention is at \nthe core of several international instruments \nadopted by this world body over the years. The \nmost recent of these is the Declaration on the \nInadmissibility of Intervention and Interference \nin the Internal Affairs of States, adopted at the \nthirty sixth session. This Declaration represents \na comprehensive instrument codifying the rights \nand duties of States that inhere in the principle \nof nonintervention.\nYet, despite its existence as a well established \nand fundamental principle of international \nrelations, nonintervention has increasingly been \nrespected more in the breach. The whole gamut of \ninterventionist techniques, ranging from overt \nmilitary action to the more insidious and subtle \nforms of indirect pressures and destabilization \ntactics, has been brought into play in recent \nyears.\nThe motivation for intervention varies from case \nto case. Yet certain broad patterns are clearly \ndiscernible. Some manipulate local situations of \ncontroversy and exploit international conflicts \nto, serve perceived broader geo strategic \ninterests. Further, intervention is of times \ndesigned to frustrate national liberation and the \nstruggle against colonialism. No less problematic \nis interventionist behavior undertaken in pursuit \nof expansionist ambitions territorial, \nideological and economic.\nSome of our countries possess enough human and \nmaterial resources to ensure for their people an \nadequate and satisfying standard of living. Yet \nsome of these very countries, in what can only be \nseen as a fit of greed, seek to covet the \nterritory and resources of their neighbors. In \npursuit of their expansionist claims, such \ncountries disregard hallowed principles of an \ninternational legal edifice painstakingly \nconstructed over the years.\nBut even as we resolve to banish intervention as \nan instrument of policy in relations among \nStates, it becomes imperative to strengthen and \nadvance the process of collective security and \ndisarmament. The second special session devoted \nto disarmament, held here last June, did not \nrealize the high hopes of our peoples for a world \nfree from the specter of the catastrophic uses of \nthe destructive weapons at man's disposal. This \nhappens at a time in which we witness the \nproliferation and perfection of a plethora of \nweapons systems possessing mass destructive \ncapability.\nIt is indeed a sad commentary on the position of \nsome major Powers that in the face of a clear \ndemonstration of the public throughout the world \nin favor of disarmament, these Powers have not \nexercised the necessary political judgment to \nfacilitate agreement on the various disarmament \nissues and the preparation of a comprehensive \nprogramme on disarmament.\nThe recent horrors which accompanied the ruthless \nIsraeli invasion of Lebanon and senseless \nslaughter of innocent men, women and children in \nwest Beirut heighten the necessity for a \ncomprehensive, just and lasting solution to the \nMiddle East situation and the Palestinian \nquestion. There has undeniably been a quickening \nof the conscience of peoples to the urgent need \nto terminate the Palestinian diaspora and to \nbring about the creation of a homeland for the \nPalestinians in Palestine, as envisaged by early \nresolutions of the Assembly.\nLet me repeat the position of Guyana: the \nacquisition of territory by force cannot be \ncondoned; the Palestinian people, led by their \nauthentic representative, the PLC, must have \ntheir national rights restored; and all States in \nthe region should be enabled to live in peace and \nsecurity.\nWe must be equally firm in dealing with the \nracist entity in Pretoria. The independence of \nNamibia must be achieved in conformity with \nSecurity Council resolution 435 and there must be \nno question of further conditionality\u2019s. South \nAfrica must be made to vacate Namibia and to do \nso quickly. At the same time, South Africa must \nshow full respect for the sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of neighboring independent \nAfrican States. Within South Africa itself, the \nsystem of apartheid must be condemned. The \nmembers of the international community \nindividually and collectively must desist from \ngiving the racists in South Africa support to \nmaintain their oppressive policies.\nUnhappily, the tragedy of a divided Cyprus \nremains, despite the fact that the Assembly in \nits resolution 3212 set an adequate framework for \nthe withdrawal of foreign troops and the \nreconciliation of the communities in the \nterritory. Guyana gives every encouragement to \nthe Secretary General to continue unceasingly in \nhis search for an urgent solution. We also \nsupport the proposals made by the President of \nCyprus before the Assembly.\nLikewise the people of Korea deserve our support \nfor the peaceful reunification of their territory \nwithout outside interference. Guyana continues to \nurge the implementation of the provisions of the \n4 July 1972 joint communique? And the more recent \nconstructive proposals advanced by the Democratic \nPeople's Republic of Korea.\nWe are particularly concerned about the \ncontinuing war between Iraq and the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran. We call for strict \nimplementation of the relevant resolutions of the \nSecurity Council relating to this matter, in \nparticular resolutions 514 and 522.\nCentral America and the Caribbean indeed, Latin \nAmerica is a state of ferment. Threats of \ndestabilization and armed intervention are mad in \nrelation to Central America and the Caribbean. \nIndigenous impulses for change are being \nviolently confronted by a tandem force of local \ninterests and their external supporters. \nDeliberate policies of pressure and intimidation \nare implemented, policies aiming at ideological \nconformity. Guyana firmly believes that a system \nof peaceful and stable relations in the Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean region must of necessity \nbe premised or? an end to all types of economic \npressures and political interference and on \nrespect for ideological pluralism. The Caribbean \nmust be made a zone of peace.\nIn his statement to the Assembly at the 5th \nmeeting, the Foreign Minister of Venezuela \nadverted at length to the relations between our \ntwo countries. Unfortunately that presentation \ncontained egregious distortions; it was \ncontumacious, and it bordered on calumny. It was \ntendentious and selective in its account of \nhistory.\nLast year, in addressing the Assembly my Prime \nMinister, Mr. Ptolemy A. Reid, laid bare the \nhistory of our relations with Venezuela. The \nnature of those relations has been profoundly \naffected by a Venezuelan desire to redraw the \nboundary between our two countries, a boundary \nwhich was settled by Treaty in 1899 and \ndemarcated on the ground between 1901 and 1905.\nThe Foreign Minister of Venezuela stated that \nVenezuela's claim is based neither on territorial \nambition nor on covetousness of the wealth of \nothers but on the need to correct an historical \nwrong perpetrated against it. And this Venezuela \nasserts as the successor to Spanish colonial \nimperialism. He also asserted that Guyana refuses \nto understand the need for this correction \nbecause it wishes to enjoy the fruits of British \ncolonial imperialism.\nGuyana hardly needs to reject these pejorative \nVenezuelan asseverations. Moreover, our \nreputation as an anti imperialist nation is well \nknown. The anti imperialist policies my country \npursues are in accordance with the tenets of the \nnonaligned movement, of which it is a full member \nThe Foreign Minister of Venezuela, in disavowing \nany motive of covetousness and expansionism, and \nin persisting in his country's territorial claim, \nasserts that no exploitable mineral resources \nhave been discovered in the Essequibo region, \nwhich Venezuela claims. On the contrary, to give \nbut a few examples, oil has recently been \ndiscovered there; our long established gold and \ndiamond mines are developing as centers of \neconomic activity; and there has been an \nintensification in the evaluation of our uranium \npotential. And Venezuela knows this.\nWith these activities and the potential which \nexists, can we accept Venezuela's portrayal of \nthe Essequibo as a land without exploitable \nmineral resources. And are we to understand that \nits claim to this land, whose people are moreover \nof a different culture, is motivated simply by a \ndesire to redress an historical wrong. We are \nconvinced that the Venezuelan territorial claim \nis an unjustified attempt to satiate a thirst for \nthe land and resources of ethers.\nThe Venezuelan Foreign Minister also asserted \nthat there has been no aggression by Venezuela \nagainst Guyana. I cannot permit that statement to \ngo unchallenged. Indeed it must be categorically \nrejected. Let the record speak.\nCan Venezuela deny that its troops are still in \noccupation of Guyanese territory that it \nviolently seized in 1966? Can Venezuela honestly \nand I stress the word honestly deny that there \nhave been numerous violations of our air and land \nspace by Venezuelan aircraft and armed forces? \nAnd what of Venezuela's actions against us in the \neconomic field. Can Venezuela deny that it has \nbeen endeavoring to dissuade Governments and \norganizations both in the developed and in the \ndeveloping world from participating in Guyana's \neconomic development, especially in that part of \nour territory that it claims'? Does Venezuela \ndeny that in June last year, as we were preparing \nfor a global conference on new and renewable \nsources of energy, its Foreign Minister wrote to \nthe President of the World Bank opposing the \nconstruction of a hydroelectric facility in the \nUpper Mazuruni region of Guyana on the political \nground that the proposed dam was to be located in \nthe area claimed by Venezuela and that it was not \neconomically important to Guyana? And can it deny \nthat such action was after the World Bank had \nitself assessed the project as being economically \nand technically feasible? Is that not economic \naggression?\nThere are several international treaties and \nlegal instruments that relate to the border \nbetween Guyana and Venezuela. The most important \none is the Arbitral Award of 1899, which all \nparties, in ' eluding Venezuela, had by an \nearlier treaty agreed to accept as a full, final \nand perfect settlement. Pursuant to that Award, \nas I stated earlier, the boundary was demarcated \non the ground and registered in a separate \nAgreement in 1903. There is also the Geneva \nAgreement of 1966, which has as its purpose the \nsolution of the controversy which has arisen as a \nresult of the Venezuelan contention that the \nArbitral Award of 1899 is null and void.\nUnder the Agreement Guyana and Venezuela were \nrequired to choose one of the means provided in \nArticle 33 of the Charter of the United Nations \nfor the settlement of the controversy. Venezuela \nproposed negotiation; we proposed judicial \nsettlement, and recommended the International \nCourt of Justice. Unfortunately, Venezuela not \nonly challenged our competence to suggest the \nInternational Court of Justice but persistently \nrefused to consider our proposal for a judicial \nsettlement. As a consequence our two countries \nare now, in strict accordance with the provisions \nof the Geneva Agreement, required to consider the \nselection of an appropriate international organ \nto choose the means of settlement.\nFrom the inception of the Geneva Agreement in \n1966 there have been repeated violations of it by \nVenezuela. I have already alluded to some of \nthem. Notwithstanding those provocations, Guyana \nremains willing, in keeping with its policy of \nrespect for legally binding treaties and peace \nand good neighborliness, to continue to honor the \nGeneva Agreement and to fulfil its obligations \nunder it. On Friday last Guyana proposed to \nVenezuela that our two countries, in fulfilment \nof that Agreement, seek to agree on an \nappropriate international organ to choose a means \nof pacific settlement.\nThere are a number of organs of a regional \nnature, some of which may not be acceptable to \nVenezuela and others which may not be acceptable \nto us. However, there are three organs of such a \nwide international character that in our opinion \nany of them should be acceptable to both parties. \nThese organs are: the International Court of \nJustice the Security Council and the General \nAssembly of the United Nations.\nWe are therefore now suggesting for the \nconsideration of the Government of Venezuela \nrecourse to one of those organs. It is Guyana's \nbelief that their international character \nrecommends them as suitable. We put our \nconfidence in them. We trust that Venezuela would \nbe prepared to do likewise.\nLet me repeat what my Prime Minister said at the \nthirty sixth session of the Assembly: We have no \nother wish than that of establishing a regime of \npeace, harmony and friendship with the people of \nVenezuela, with whom we share aspirations for a \njust and satisfying life and with whom we can \ntogether make a contribution to our development \nand that of our region and our continent.\nTo that goal Guyana remains committed.\nIn the complexities which beset the international \ncommunity the nonaligned movement continues to \nplay an influential and beneficial role. As we \nspeak out against intervention and interference, \nthe nonaligned are aware that external efforts to \ndivide and subvert us will continue. But we must \nstick resolutely and uncompromisingly to our \nprinciples and our policies.\nDespite its imperfections, the United Nations \nsystem still offers mankind the best hope for \ninternational relations based on the rule of law. \nIn his courageous report on the work of the \nOrganization the Secretary General not only has \nanalyzed the weaknesses of that system but has \nalso made constructive proposals for the \nimprovement of its vitality and the enhancement \nof its effectiveness. The decline in its \nauthority and the credibility dilemma facing the \nUnited Nations are as much functions and \nconsequences of certain deficiencies of the \nsystem as of the growing propensity of an \nincreasing number of nations to marginalize the \nOrganization or to ignore its decisions.\nWe owe it to ourselves and to the Secretary \nGeneral to ponder seriously his assessment of the \ninternational situation, his views on the crisis \nof confidence facing the United Nations and the \nvarious ideas he has submitted for reinvigorating \nthe process of multilateral diplomacy. We believe \nthat the opportunity to do so which this session \nprovides should be fully utilized. Guyana \nsupports his proposals. We are particularly \ninterested in his argument for a role for the \nSecurity Council which emphasizes a preventive, \nrather than a reactive, orientation.\nAs my President said in a statement on 5 October 1982 in Brasilia:\nI believe the time is ripe for us to examine once \nagain the possibility of establishing a United \nNations security force with sufficient authority \nand strength to forestall aggression and prevent \ndisputes from degenerating into armed conflicts.\nMan's impulse is to survive and to live in peace \nwith his fellow man. Our task as representatives \nof Governments is to give effect to this impulse. \nThe pursuit of this task requires us to undertake \nserious dialogue, to act in concert, to adhere to \nthe norms of international law and to make a \nreality of peaceful coexistence. History, I \nsuggest, would indeed be unkind to us if we did \nnot seek to build a world that is safer and in \nwhich justice prevails.\n"

It is also my pleasure to commend the \nefforts being made by the Secretary-General to \nstrengthen the role of the Organization and to \nincrease its efficiency.\n1.\tSir, you have assumed the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at a most difficult time, a \ntime of increasing dangers and proliferating \nhotbeds of tension, and of problems causing \ninstability in international peace and security. \nIt is a time when the world's peoples, especially \nthe smaller ones, are concerned for their \ndestiny and their freedom. We note that the \nclatter of weapons is louder than the voice of \nreason, that right has become has become the \nprerogative of the strong and that the capability \nof the United Nations has sunk to an \nunprecedented tow. Disappointment at that was \nctearly expressed by the Secretary-General in his \nreport on the work of the Organization, in which \nhe said that\n  The United Nations itself has been unable to \nplay as effective and decisive a role as the \nCharter certainty envisaged for it.\n  ... The Security Council, the primary organ of \nthe United Nations for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, all too often \nfinds itself unable to take decisive action to \nresolve international conflicts and its \nrecommendations are increasingly defied or \nignored by those that feel themselves strong \nenough to do so\n2.\tThe Socialist People's Libyan Arab \nJamahiriya shares the Secretary-General's views \nin this regard. I should like in this context to \nrecall the letter sent by the Leader of the \nRevolution, brother Colonel Muammar Qaddafi, to \nthe Secretary-General on 20 September 1982 in the \nwake of the massacre of Palestinians in Beirut at \nthe hands of Israel and its agents:\n  I regret to have to express to you and to the \nworld the bitter truth which I perceive in my \ncountry, namely, that the second historic attempt \nmade by the peoples in 1943 (in San Francisco) to \nestablish an international organization to \nprevent war and keep the peace has failed \nutterly, as did the first attempt (i.e., the \nLeague of Nations).\n4. We have, however, the right to ask: where does \nthe responsibility for the inability of the \nUnited Nations lie? Is it the responsibility of \nthe States Members of the United Nations? Or is \nit the responsibility of the developing countries \nwhich are systematical subjected to military \nthreat, economic blockade and political blackmail?\n3. The responsibility, as we see it, lies in the \nstructure of the main organ of the Organization. \nIt is the Security Council which has become an \ninstrument to protect dictatorship for the \nbenefit of the permanent members of the Security \nCouncil. Responsibility also lies in the abuse of \nthe right of veto by States members of the \nSecurity Council in a manner that has made the \nCouncil a vehicle for their own security, \nencouraging the aggressive policies pursued by \ntheir agents. The unlimited number of times that \nthe United States Administration has used the \nright of veto to prevent the Council from \ncondemning the Zionist entity's aggressive acts \nin the Arab region is clear evidence of the \npolicy of injustice being practiced under the \numbrella of the United Nations and the Security \nCouncil. The reason for the inability of the \nOrganization lies also in the fact that the \nright of veto that the members of the cub of \nvictors in the Second World War granted to \nthemselves was abused for the benefit of those \nvictors to maintain their balance of interests. \nIn their irresponsible exercise of the right of \nveto, they turn the standard of democracy upside \ndown and subject the will of more than 130 States \nMembers of the Organization to the mercy of the \npermanent members of the Security Council.\n6. The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, \nafter consulting a target number of Member \nStates, put forward a number of proposals to \nabolish or amend the veto or to give greater \npower to the General Assembly and make binding \nits resolutions adopted by a two-thirds majority. \nThese proposals, however, met with rejection by \nthe great Powers which exercised pressure on \nother, smaller countries to prevent the abolition \nor amendment of the right of veto and to oppose \nthe principles of democracy and collective \nresponsibility for the maintenance of peace and \nagainst the principle of equal sovereignty among \nail Member States, as provided for by the Charter.\n7.\tThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya still holds \nthat view and will continue to bring up the \nsubject as long as the veto continues to exist \nand continues to be used against the struggles of \npeoples. It represents dictatorship and \nmonopoly, and is contrary to the opinion of the \nmajority in favor of collective responsibility \nand equality. We shall continue to hold these \nviews, regardless of the stand taken by the great \nPowers, particularly the United States, which \nmost abuses its use of the veto, and without \nregard to procedural manoeuvres to which they \nhave recourse.\n8.\tThe time has come to look seriously into \nthe role of the Special Committee on the Charter \nof the United Nations and on the Strengthening of \nthe Role of the Organization, because the \noppressed peoples of the world have almost lost \nfaith in the United Nations. We in the Libyan \nArab Jamahiriya realize the dangers that would \nresult from a loss of faith in our Organization. \nThat is why the leader of the great September \nrevolution made an appeal to enable the \nOrganization to fulfill its role in maintaining \npeace and justice, because the dictatorial \npractices carried out under its umbrella may \ncompel us to leave it and to urge other oppressed \npeoples to seek their own special platform from \nwhich to express their will and ambitions.\n9.\tThe abolition of the right of veto or its \nreview, if viewed as a guarantee of democratic \npractices, could enable the developing peoples to \nregain their faith in the United Nations. My \ncountry believes that, in reviewing the veto, the \nfollowing aspects should be taken into \nconsideration: first, the abolition of the veto \nor its amendment which would allow its use by all \nmembers, because if political dictatorship is to \nbe practiced, then it is only fair that it be \npracticed by all; secondly, the Security Council \nmust be placed under the General Assembly, and \nnot the other way round, because in the General \nAssembly resides the true will of the peoples and \nnations of the world; and thirdly, the \nmaintenance of international peace and security \nis the collective responsibility of all.\n10.\tThe agenda of the current session of the \nGeneral Assembly is full of political and \neconomic issues, in addition to those of \nliberation and colonialism. 1 shall allude to \nthose problems.\n11.\tThe recent massacres committed by the \nZionist entity in Palestinian refugee camps in \nLebanon is evidence of the tragedy that has \nbefallen the cause of the just struggle of the \nPalestinian people, and demonstrates the \naggressive, Fascist and racist nature of the \nso-called State of Israel. It confirms beyond \ndoubt that the State of the Zionist entity is not \npeace-loving and is a source of threat to \ninternational peace and security.\n12.\tThe continued occupation of the \nPalestinian territories since 1948, the \nannexation of the Golan Heights and the massacres \ncommitted daily against the Palestinians and \nLebanese, must induce the international \ncommunity represented in the United Nations to \ntake practical measures to eliminate aggression \nand occupation and to enable the Palestinian \npeople to return to its homeland.\n13.\tThe practical measures envisaged by my \ncountry are as follows: first, the expulsion of \nthe Zionist entity from the General Assembly, on \nthe grounds that the Israelis and their State are \nnot peace-loving, and in accordance with the \nresolutions adopted by the General Assembly at \nits ninth emergency special session, at which it \ndebated Israel's repeated aggression against the \nArab territories; secondly, the halting of \nmilitary, material and political support provided \nby the United States Administration, which \nexceeds $10 million daily, because we see that \nsupport as encouragement for Israel to continue \nits constant aggression against the Arabs and its \nchallenge to the resolutions of the international \ncommunity; thirdly, the economic boycott of the \nZionist entity in implementation of the \nresolutions of the General Assembly, on the \ngrounds that Israel is occupying Arab territories \nby force, and because of its disregard of the \nresolutions of the international community. If \nsome were able to impose an economic boycott on \nArgentina for demanding territories that belong \nto it, one wonders how it is that an economic \nboycott is not imposed on a Member of the United \nNations that all have admitted is not \npeace-loving and is a threat to international \npeace and security\u00f3and by that I mean Israel; \nfourthly, the halt of immigration, particularly \nthat coming to occupied Palestine from Eastern \nbloc countries, because the immigrants are \nprimarily citizens of those countries, and \nbecause their continued influx into occupied \nPalestine represents an increase in Israel's \nhuman and military capacity to continue to \nexercise a policy of aggression and occupation.\n14.\tThe political solutions proposed for the \nPalestine question come at a time when the United \nNations is apparently unable to check Israeli \nintransigence. That is in addition to the \ninability of the Organization to stand against \nsupport of the American Government for Israel's \naggressive policies. We therefore not see in the \ninitiatives undertaken by the United States \nAdministration a valid basis for any just peace.\n13. The United States peace initiative ignores \nthe resolutions of the United Nations, the \nOrganization of African Unity  and the group of \nnon-aligned countries, which affirm the right of \nthe Palestinian people to determine their own \ndestiny and establish their own independent State \nunder the leadership of the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization [PLO], their legitimate and sole \nrepresentative. Furthermore, the peace initiative \nput forward by the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference, held at Fez, is too optimistic; it \nhas much good will but does not recognize the \ntrue nature of the Zionist entity. It runs \ncounter to the following logical facts.\n16.\tHistory has taught us that the occupier, \nthe aggressor, is the one that puts forward \npolitical initiatives to those under its \noccupation. The only initiative that can be put \nforward by a colonized people is armed struggle. \nOn what logic should the Arabs come up with peace \ninitiatives when the American people, with French \nassistance, confronted British colonialism and \nEurope confronted Nazi occupation in defense of \npeace and freedom?\n17.\tThe Security Council must guarantee the \nsecurity of all States in the region and that \nassumes two things, namely: that Israel is \nthreatened by its Arab neighbors\u00f3which is \ncontrary to the truth, for Israel is the constant \naggressor that threatens Arab security, and, \nfurthermore, Israel's security and its policy of \naggression are guaranteed by the United States \nmilitarily and financially; and that the Arab \npeace plan would have the Security Council \nguarantee the security of all States in the \nregion. That represents recognition of Israel. We \nwonder how we can ask for protection and \nrecognition of a State the established political \nschemes of which include the occupation of Arab \nterritories and the policy of genocide and \ndisplacement pursued by it against the Arab \npeoples in Palestine and Lebanon.\n18. Any real peace initiative must come through \nthe United Nations, in spite of its weakness. \nPeace initiatives now coming from the Arabs are \ntaken under the pressure of an Israeli force \nsupported by the United States and under the \nUnited States threat to and blackmail of the \nArabs.\n19.\tThe present Government of the United \nStates of America is increasing its acts of \nintervention and pressure for the purpose of \nachieving political, economic and military \nhegemony. It has gone back to the policy of \ninstalling military bases in many parts of the \nworld. It has used its war fleets to practice \nterrorism along the shores of non-aligned \ncountries, as it did in August 1981 to my \ncountry, thereby violating our sovereignty over \nour territorial waters. The last act of \naggression was on 3 September 1982, when a United \nStates aircraft violated our airspace at 7.59 \np.m. It was an unmanned reconnaissance aircraft. \nOur air defenses downed it in the Benghazi area, \nand the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya will submit the \ndocuments and facts on this aggression to the \nPresident of the Security Council and to the \nSecretary- General.\n20.\tAlso, in August 1981 the American \nGovernment launched a propaganda campaign of \nfalsehoods and imposed an economic embargo \nagainst Libya. It started to incite other \ncountries to follow its example on false \npretexts, such as the alleged sending of a death \nsquad to assassinate President Reagan\u00f3which \nproved to be only the product of the imagination \nof certain officials in the United States \nAdministration in collaboration with the Zionist \nintelligence service.\n21.\tThe United States Administration's \npractice of threatening the Caribbean countries \nand its attempts to prevent them from exercising \ntheir free will prove the imperialist nature of \nthe United States Administration. The aggressive \npolicies pursued by that Administration against \nCuba, Nicaragua, Grenada and the people of El \nSalvador are examples of the United States \npolicy, the aim of which is to create hotbeds of \ntension and instability in the world, \nparticularly in the Middle East and southern \nAfrica.\n22.\tThe issues of disarmament and the \nstrengthening of international security are among \nthe most serious and complicated matters facing \nour world today. They have been at the centre of \nattention for the international community for \nmany years. This attention has been reflected in \nthe convening of numerous conferences since \n1932, in particular the two special sessions of \nthe General Assembly devoted to disarmament, the \nfirst in 1978 and the second this year, and also \nin the resolutions adopted in this regard. \nHowever, we see no signs on the horizon that \nprogress in this respect is being achieved. On \nthe contrary, the arms race has continued, \nespecially between the superpowers in the nuclear \nfield, with the development of new weapons \nsystems, such as the neutron bomb, and the \ncontinued promotion of certain dangerous \ntheories, such as those of nuclear deterrence, \nstrategic balance and a limited nuclear war that \ncan be won, as well as the horizontal \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, not to mention \nthe reported and manifest acquisition of nuclear \nweapons by the racist regimes of the Zionist \nentity and Pretoria.\n23.\tThe issue of disarmament is not just a \nmilitary one; it is also an economic, social and \npolitical issue. In the study carried out by the \nUnited Nations entitled the relationship between \ndisarmament and development it is stated that \n1,500 million people do not have access to \neffective medical services, nearly 570 million \nsuffer from severe malnutrition, 800 million are \nilliterate and 250 million children do not attend \nschool. This was at a time, 1981, when the world \nexpenditure for military purposes exceeded $600 \nbillion.\n24.\tIn addition to these negative \ndevelopments in the field of disarmament, in \nrecent years we have witnessed a deterioration in \ninternational relations as a result of the \nviolation of the Charter and international \nprinciples, in particular those relating to the \nright to sovereignty, independence, \nnon-intervention and the non-use of force in \ninternational relations and the continued spread \nof the areas of war and hotbeds of tension.\n25.\tIn the African continent the policy of \napartheid pursued by the racist regime in South \nAfrica continues unabated in spite of the \nfrequent condemnation by the Organization, which \nconsiders it a crime against humanity. However, \nbecause of the assistance given to that regime by \nthe colonialists, especially the United States, \nthis abhorrent policy continues to be practiced \nagainst African nationalists.\n26.\tIn Namibia the Pretoria regime continues, \nthrough its illegal administration, to oppress \nthe black citizens and plunder the resources of \nthat Territory, in collaboration with \nmultinational corporations of Western countries \nwhich have impeded the implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978), which \ncontains a plan for the independence of the \nTerritory. In this connection, the role of the \nEuropeans is complementary to that of the \nAmericans in trying to achieve independence for \nNamibia in accordance with Western schemes which \nhav6 nothing to do with Security Council \nresolutions. One of the latest obstacles created \nby the United States Administration was the \nlinking of the subject of Namibia's independence \nto the evacuation of Cuban forces from Angola, \nwhich amounts to interference in the affairs of \nan independent sovereign State, which has the \nright to protect itself and seek help from any \nState as it sees fit.\n27.\tThe aggressive and racist practices of \nthe Pretoria regime are not directed against the \nblack citizens of Namibia and South Africa only; \nthey have been extended to include the \nneighbouring countries, namely, the front-line \nStates. Attacks have been frequent, especially \nagainst the territory of Angola. In this respect, \nmy country declares its support and backing for \nthe struggle of the African citizens of Namibia \nand South Africa and for the steadfastness of the \nfront-line States; we commend those States and \nare proud of their steadfastness.\n28.\tColonialism and its surrogates, as well \nas the exploitative companies, continue to pursue \ntheir ambitions with tenacity and are prepared \nto intervene in any country that is ruled by a \nprogressive and non-aligned regime desiring to \nfree itself politically and economically. This \nwas clear in the aggression against the \nJamahiriya and also in that against the Republic \nof Seychelles, which was subjected to subversive \nactions perpetrated by external elements that \nwanted to create a state of anarchy and \ninstability in order to bring down its \nprogressive regime and replace it by one \nsubservient to colonialism and under its \npolitical and economic influence. However, the \npeople of Seychelles were able to overcome and \nthwart those acts of aggression. We in the \nJamahiriya, together with the forces of progress \nand freedom^ support the people and the \nGovernment of Seychelles against any foreign \nmaneuvers.\n29.\tOne of the regions that experience \ntension as a result of intervention and the \ninstallation of foreign bases is Central America, \nwhere the people of Nicaragua are struggling \nagainst the intervention of the United States of \nAmerica, which has been training hostile elements \nand sending them to Nicaragua to carry out acts \nof terrorism and subversion.\n30.\tWe are witnessing a liberation movement \nsweeping through Central America. We see the \nUnited States attempting to stifle that movement, \nas is happening now in El Salvador and Guatemala, \nin addition to its constant threats and \naggression against Cuba and the usurpation of the \nPuerto Rican people's right to independence.\n31.\tMy country supports the struggle of the \npeoples of Latin America against United States \nimperialism and affirms its unlimited support for \nCuba and Nicaragua in their confrontation with \nthe American policy of aggression.\n32.\tMy country followed with increasing \nconcern the war which was forced on Argentina to \nrecover the Malvinas Islands from British \ncontrol. Anyone reflecting on that war and the \nway it developed would be shocked by the \nfollowing facts. First, the United States claim \nthat it belongs to the group of American States \nis only a covey for the protection of American \ninterests and the Fascist regimes which are \nsatellites of the United States Administration. \nThe United States has revealed its imperialist \nnature and supported the British aggression \ncarried out against the Malvinas Islands. \nSecondly, the British presence in the Malvinas \nIslands is but a vestige of the old colonialism \nwhich divided the world into spheres of influence \namong the strong and used its control to implant \ncommunities that did not belong originally to the \nindigenous populations of the occupied \nterritories. Thirdly, the Malvinas war \nemphasizes the inevitable confrontation between \nthe imperialist Powers and the third world \ncountries, which have to realize that all that \nthe super-Powers aim at is to have greater \ndomination and wider spheres of influence.\n33.\tTherefore my country supports Argentina's \nright to sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands \nand calls upon the international community to use \nall possible peaceful means to ensure finally the \nending of the British colonization of the \nMalvinas Islands.\n34.\tThe United States exploitation of \ninternal strife in certain countries of Asia \naggravates tension in the region. The Afghan war \nand the situation in Kampuchea represent areas \nof tension in South-East Asia aggravated by \nforeign interference in the affairs of those \ncountries. Therefore my country affirms the right \nof those peoples to exercise their freedom of \nchoice. My country supports the principle that \nAfghanistan should be an independent, non-aligned \ncountry following the path of progressive Islamic \nStates.\n35.\tThe question of Western Sahara continues \nto be one of the primary issues facing the \nOrganization and there is the threat of American \nimperialist interference. We therefore emphasize \nthat the Organization should assume its \nresponsibility by affirming the right of the \nSahraoui people to free self-determination, \nalongside the African peoples which have \nexercised their right to freedom and sovereignty \nover their territories.\n36.\tThe question of Cyprus is one that has \nbeen before the United Nations for a long time \nwithout any comprehensive solution being found. \nMy country supports direct negotiations between \nthe Turkish and Greek communities of Cyprus with \na view to finding a just solution to this problem \nwhich would guarantee the independence and \nneutrality of Cyprus.\n37.\tThe situation in the Mediterranean has \nbecome dangerous as a result of the increasing \npressures of foreign war fleets and military \nbases, especially American fleets and bases, \nwhich have become a source of concern and a \nsubversive element, threatening the security of \nMediterranean countries. Everybody has heard \nabout the United States Sixth Fleet, which is \ndeployed constantly off the Libyan shore and \ncarries out provocative maneuvers, some of which \nwere in Libyan territorial waters.\n38.\tIt is our desire that that sea become a \nlake of peace, free from foreign fleets and bases \nand hotbeds of tension. Believing in the \nnecessity of realizing this objective, the \nJamahiriya has moved to settle the dispute \nbetween itself and its neighbor, the sister State \nof Tunisia, over the continental shelf. The \nInternational Court of Justice delivered its \njudgment in the case on 24 February 1982. The \ndispute with Malta over the delimitation of the \ncontinental shelf has likewise been referred to \nthe International Court of Justice.\n39.\tThe effects of the acts of confrontation \nand war have sometimes extended to societies \nwhich have not participated in such acts and are \nnot parties to them. This is evidenced by the \ntragedies and consequences of the Second World \nWar which continue to surface in my country, \ncausing economic, social and environmental \nproblems. The minefields planted by the warring \nforces over vast tracts of territory in my \ncountry have delayed the carrying out of \ndevelopment projects and raised the cost of such \nprojects, in particular that of prospecting for \nminerals.\n40.\tThis problem has been discussed at \nmeetings of the non-aligned movement and here in \nthe Assembly, and several resolutions have been \nadopted in this regard, affirming the \nresponsibility of the countries that planted \nthose mines to compensate the affected countries \nfor the material and moral losses caused by this \nproblem and calling for co-operation in the \nprovision of information about and maps of those \nminefields.\n41.\tThe relevant decisions of international \nand regional organizations, conventions and \ninternational laws require the States which \nparticipated in the Second World War and their \nallies who planted mines in Libyan territory to \nshoulder the responsibility, pay the required \ncompensation and co-operate in the final solution \nof this problem. Accordingly, my country hopes \nthat such States and the United Nations will take \npractical measures to place the responsibility \nwhere it belongs and guarantee the right of the \naffected States to compensation for the damage \nsustained by them as a result of the effects and \nvestiges of war.\n"

        "file_text": "1.\tSir, on behalf of the Government and people of Brazil, I wish to congratulate you on your election as President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\n2.\tI warmly greet the representatives of the Member States gathered together in this Hall. I extend warm greetings o the Secretary -General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar,  brilliant diplomat who is a credit to Latin America. I also wish to extend my sincere compliments to Mr. Ismat Kittani, representative of Iraq, who with assurance and ability presided over the work of the thirty-sixth session.\n3.\tAt this time, as the general debate begins, I wish to express my hope that this session of the General Assembly will effectively contribute to a just solution of the controversies which are jeopardizing international peace and security and to the removal of the threat to the stability of the world's economy.\n4.\tA few decades ago, an unprecedented economic depression and uncontrolled political tension brought about a catastrophic war. The society of sovereign States decided then, in 1945, to create a vast network of institutions to further co-operation between Governments in order to avoid a repetition of such severe economic crises, promote economic and social development, ease political tension and spare future generations from the scourge of war.\n5.\tSymptoms dramatically reminiscent of the events of the 1930s are reappearing today. A new economic crisis of global dimensions indiscriminately affects countries under different systems and resists orthodox therapies.\n\n6.\tParadoxically, the United Nations, which was established in order to examine and resolve controversy between States, has all too often been transformed into a forum for sterile confrontation. We are aware, however, that alternative forms of organizing international life inevitably depend on the arbitrary will of the most powerful States which, at times, runs counter to the cause of freedom and justice among nations and men.\n7.\tHaving these considerations in mind, the Government of Brazil renews its pledge to work together with the other Member States in order to make the United Nations a true centre for harmonizing the actions of States. I do not hesitate to call on all Governments represented here to adhere strictly in their international behaviour to the purposes and principles of the Organization. I launch a pressing appeal that we rededicate ourselves to the task of building peace.\n8.\tThere is no future\u2014nor can there possibly be one\u2014in that sad, unacceptable substitute for peace which is the balance of terror. We cannot persist in the illusion that world harmony can be founded on an excess capacity for destruction. Decades of talks and attempts at negotiation have not prevented the increase, improvement and diversification of nuclear arsenals capable of destroying mankind in various ways and under various circumstances, several times over.\n9.\tin view with great apprehension the persistence of the Middle East crisis, the major features of which are the conflict between Iraq and Ira a and the consequences of the military action that has engulfed Lebanon, a country with which we have close fraternal relations. The recent massacre of Palestinian civilians in Beirut has deeply shocked the world public. We are all aware that the question of the Middle East will be solved only when the Arab territories now under military occupation are evacuated and when the right of the Palestinian people to a sovereign State is recognized, as well as the right of all countries in the region, including Israel, to live in peace within recognized borders.\n10.\tIn southern Africa, also, there persist situations of tension caused by the occupation of Namibia and by repeated acts of aggression against independent countries, notably Angola. Brazil cannot fail to condemn racial discrimination, particularly its institutionalized forms, which threaten international peace itself. The success of the on-going negotiations for the speedy independence of Namibia on he basis of United Nations resolutions is the right way to remove the tension which has so terribly frustrated the just aspirations of the peoples in the area to economic development and true independence.\n\n11.\tMy country is deeply troubled by the increasing transfer to the less developed areas of the tension generated by the confrontation between the super-Powers. The policy of prestige and power applied to the third world engenders divisions and seriously affects the prospects for co-operation among developing nations. It is the firm stand of Brazil that such a process should be immediately stopped and \nreversed, and we are ready to continue our efforts to that end.\n12.\tWe cannot accept that, as a result of power- bloc policies, sovereign countries should be occupied, their domestic affairs subjected to interference and their freedom restricted, as is the case in Afghanistan. The principle of the non-use of force should be strictly observed in today's main areas of tension.\n13.\tIn Central America, there are recurring symptoms of a deep crisis of historic proportions, with social, political and economic implications. In accordance with the principles of self-determination and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, Brazil believes that a political solution to Central America's problems must be found by the peoples involved, free from any overt or covert outside interference. In the economic sphere, one cannot isolate the difficulties of Central America from the world crisis or minimize the responsibility of the industrialized countries to work for the creation of conditions favourable to the resumption of economic and social development. Peace and stability in that region are basic prerequisites for sound hemispheric cooperation.\n14.\tIn the South Atlantic, the mechanisms of violence were recently set in motion for a while. My Government has made considerable efforts during the last few months to help find a permanent political solution to the question of the Malvinas, and we are determined to pursue these efforts in the interests of peace, security and harmony among nations. Since the beginning of the controversy in 1833 Brazil has recognized the sovereign rights of the Republic of Argentina over the Malvinas, and it continues to insist on the necessity for negotiations as a suitable means of solving that problem.\n15.\tI wish to stress the importance of consideration by the General Assembly of the question of the Malvinas. An initial step must be the implementation of all the provisions of Security Council resolution 502 (1982). It is time for those who so vigorously condemn the use of force in the solution of controversies to demonstrate the consistency and sincerity of their designs. Negotiations must start in order to avoid the risk of increasing tension in an area naturally inclined to co-operation and prosperity.\n16.\tBrazil lives in peace with its neighbours in Latin America and with all nations which observe the principles of sound international behaviour. Relations between Brazil and friendly countries of Latin America are clear testimony to the success achieved when the path of mutual respect and non-interference is taken with determination and when the search for harmonious and profitable co-operation prevails over controversies or topical divergences.\n17.\tAs part of Latin America, Brazil trusts that its neighbours will know how to resolve their differences, including those of a territorial nature, by peaceful and conciliatory means, and hopes that our sister countries in Latin America will strengthen their capacity for dialogue and understanding at the regional level. We must all work to see that our region attains higher levels of development and co-operation and engage in positive actions on the world scene.\n18.\tWith sister countries of Africa\u2014our neighbours across the sea, with which we are linked by a common history\u2014Brazil's objective is to develop close, direct and cordial relations. Equally friendly purposes guide our policy of strengthening ties with the other nations of the third world.\n19.\tAs part of the Western world, Brazil strives to fulfil its national aspirations with total respect for freedom, democracy and human rights. These lofty values and the Western tradition of pluralism and equality among nations provide Brazil with a framework for action outside the constraints of the hegemony of the super-Powers and of the pressures of opposing ideologies.\n20.\tWith the Eastern European countries Brazil seeks to maintain correct relations, particularly in the economic and commercial fields, on the basis of mutual interests and reciprocal respect for the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.\n21.\tFor my country, peace and development are not ideals detached from the goals of and action on foreign policy. Brazil is firmly committed to the principles of universalism, friendly co-operation and national dignity.\n22.\tIt is the seriousness of the international situation that, for the first time, has brought the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil to the United Nations. Never in the history of the Organization have the risks and threats to the peace, security and progress of nations been so serious. Never have the challenges been so great. I call on the Governments of all Member States to make a determined effort together to tackle the mounting international problems and turn back the tide which leads to despair. It is our common duty to fulfil the expectations of our predecessors, who, having themselves experienced the direct consequences of political disorder, economic depression and war, pledged their resolve, as well as ours, to promote peace and development.\n23.\tThere are too many shortcomings in the present international order. It is a picture poor in accomplishments, yet rich in problems, poor in creativity, yet rich in disorder; poor in efficacy and justice, yet rich in waste and imbalances. It is not possible for me to remain indifferent to this picture. I believe it to be imperative to correct the serious flaws that so clearly stand out.\n24.\tThe society of nations is essentially a political community. Just as domestic decisions cannot be taken without consulting the interests and yearnings of the people, so it is impossible to ignore in this forum the just and legitimate claims of the great majority of nations, thus preserving vertical structures of international power.\n' 26. The United Nations has a crucial political role to play in the struggle against conformism, intransigence and ambitions for absolute victories. Only through the Organization can a truly democratic framework of relations among States be created.\n27. The extraordinary release of productive forces on a world-wide scale in the post-war period wrought within a few decades the intricate patterns of a different world, a complex and unstable world, but\nalso a diversified and promising one. The interdependence of nations has thus become a historic necessity.\n28.\tYet the improvements we have been able to introduce in the structures of international life have been few and unsatisfactory. Regrettably, even the efforts towards international co-operation for development, however meagre, are being scaled down. The practice of the interdependence of nations appears at times to degenerate into attempts to reconstruct hegemonistic situations or systems of subordination, which in no way contribute to prosperity, either in the industrialized or in the developing world. As actually practised in many cases, interdependence seems to have become a new name for inequality.\n29.\tThe interests of the North and the South are not in contradiction. In truth, there is no crisis between North and South; there is, rather, a profound crisis in the international economic system itself. The same situation affects both groupings. It is a uniquely adverse situation, which can be overcome only through mutual understanding and solidarity, not through a retreat into acrimony and confrontation. The challenges faced by all countries alike is that of adjusting to the new realities of the 1980s.\n30.\tThe North must understand to its full extent\u2014and its potential for enriching international trade\u2014the inescapable fact of the definitive emergence of the third world as a dynamic partner, and of its search for a position of greater prominence in the world economy.\n31.\tAs for the South, the moment has come for us to give effective expression to the cohesion we have been able to preserve above external difficulties and internal differences. We must move towards the consolidation of a truly solidary interdependence between Latin America, Africa and Asia. We must make it clear, by deeds as well as words, that the diversity within the third world contains unsuspected opportunities for economic complementarity, and is a uniting element, not a fact to be used as a pretext for initiatives\u2014such as the arbitrary discrimination among developing countries embodied in the concept of \\\"graduation\\\"\u2014which aim at undermining the cohesion of the third world international cooperation for development and North-South dialogue.\n32.\tWe must also demonstrate our capacity for seeking, in a serene and constructive spirit, the fulfilment of our claims. However legitimate, our claims should not lead us into rigid and maximalist negotiating postures\u2014lest we weaken our own principles and ideals and exacerbate even further the intransigence which characterizes certain sectors of the developed world.\n33.\tThe efforts of the third world to change normative frameworks, decision-making structures and discriminatory rules in institutions such as International Monetary Fund [/MP], the World Bank and GATT, among others, have been fruitless. Claims repeated for years or even decades clash against the impenetrable wall of the veto power of a few countries, which are in a position to oppose the most obvious considerations of rationality or the soundest requisites of equity. But initiatives multiply whenever the interests of the great powers are at stake.\n34.\tGATT's role should not be diverted towards new normative tasks in areas such as the export of services and investment policies, with a view to creating rules which might hamper access of developing countries to international markets and even hinder their capacity to regulate their own internal markets. By the same token, fundamental questions related to the improvement of GATT and to the satisfaction of the claims of the developing countries should not be neglected.\n35.\tIn financial institutions, measures are devised \u2014sometimes adopted against the will of the majority, as a result of inadequate decision-making processes\u2014 which restrict the flexibility of operations, add to the requirements of conditionally, and unjustly discriminate against the developing countries. Paradoxically, certain countries endeavour to maintain control over organizations which they appear to condemn, if not to disappearance, at least to insignificance, so great is the disproportion between the growing needs of the developing countries and the financial resources placed at the disposal of those organizations.\n36.\tThe principles of free trade must not be applied selectively and arbitrarily to the flow of capital, while the transfer of technology is inhibited and the capacity for action by capital-importing developing countries is restricted. The ideals of free trade cannot be in contradiction with the preservation and even strengthening of the autonomy of the countries of the third world. Interdependence should not be a concept inimical to national sovereignty.\n37.\tThe developing countries, which for so long have striven for the principle of permanent sovereignty over their natural resources, today face the new challenge of maintaining sovereignty over their own economic space. That does not mean, however, that the developing countries should oppose or show lack of interest in greater interaction at the international level, with respect to the flows of capital and technology and even operations of multinational corporations. Quite the contrary. It is undeniable that the vast majority of developing countries, beginning with those which have a clear Western identity, such as Brazil, but including others with a different political- economic organization\u2014aim at improving and diversifying their links with the developed West, which is a valuable source of the factors of production necessary for their development.\n38.\tThe preservation and strengthening of the national economic space of those countries will not hamper the expansion of the international economic system, but will rather be a factor in the broadening of the global economic space, for the benefit of us all.\n39.\tAlthough I was unable, for reasons of health, to attend the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development, which was held at Cancun in October 1981, I followed that event with interest and hope, and even with emotion. I cannot therefore fail to voice here, on behalf of the Government and people of Brazil, the feeling of deep disappointment at the lack, so far, of any practical follow-up action to the Cancun meeting.\n40.\tWe are watching with anxiety the continuous and even accelerated erosion of the instruments and institutions which should bring about a solution to\ninternational problems. We are troubled to see that there is even more resistance by important sectors of the developed world to what had been the great conceptual achievement of Cancun, namely, the recognition of the fact that the paths to the solution of the present crisis pass also through the South, and should lead towards co-operation among nations, instead of being subject only to the uncertainties of the market.\n41.\tThe crisis we face is global in more than one sense: it affects practically all countries and encompasses both the financial and commercial spheres. It is not only broad, but also deep: productive investment is being stifled on a world-wide scale under the impact of high interest rates, and of the uncertainties over the prospects of international trade and finance. It is as if a sudden paralysis of a large economic Power in the developed world had taken place: such is the situation created by the fact that 30 million highly qualified workers are now unemployed in North America and Western Europe.\n42.\tHowever, the effects of this crisis situation on the countries of the South are even more devastating. The non-oil-exporting developing countries have experienced over the past three years a deterioration in their terms of trade unequalled in history. Their often successful efforts to increase exports have been neutralized by declining foreign exchange revenues, leading to spiralling pauperization Years of patient investment in the creation of an export infrastructure, which made it possible for consumers in developed countries to acquire products from the South on advantageous terms, have been frustrated by insurmountable protectionist barriers. The persistence of high interest rates makes existing long-term investments unprofitable and threatens to undermine the viability of projects which are indispensable for overcoming present difficulties. The high cost of foreign debt servicing has created impossible situations for certain countries, as shown by recent events which have dramatically affected a few of the most promising countries of the South.\n43.\tAll this sacrifice could be tolerated if, in return, a restructuring of the international economic order could be seen on the horizon within a reasonable period of time. Regrettably, this is not the case. The present economic policy of the great Powers is destroying riches without building anything in their place. The decreasing fluidity in financial flows and the mounting difficulties in international trade are destroying the prospects for overcoming present difficulties.\n44.\tThe circumstances require that we all assume an attitude of reciprocal understanding and flexibility. The North-South dialogue must be urgently reinvigorated. Long-term efforts\u2014for which the launching of the global negotiations is so necessary\u2014must be ' supplemented now by a discussion of the short-term aspects of the crisis.\n45.\tThe shaping of the future world economy necessarily requires the overcoming of our present problems. The task of reformulating the international economic system cannot be deferred but, in the present circumstances, we must begin it by an effort to prevent the disruption of the system itself.\n46.\tTherefore it is essential that the major international organizations begin immediately to undertake an integrated and objective examination of emergency measures which can unblock the international flow of trade and finances. It is essential that the developed countries agree to take initiatives in order to liberalize trade, expand international financial flows, adopt a new policy on interest rates, and urgently start revising the international monetary system. The developing countries, because of their structural tendency to deficits in current accounts, cannot be the first to eliminate trade barriers, a measure which would only add to their deficits without creating sufficient momentum towards a recovery in the world economy. The developed countries have to accept the idea that a restructuring of their economies is inevitable. Only when the developed countries give up the protection of sectors which are no longer competitive can the manufactured and semi-manufactured goods from developing countries take their place in international markets, thus benefiting both the consumers of the North and the producers of the South.\n47.\tIt is urgent that there be an increase both in the availability of resources controlled by the international financial organizations and in the participation of monetary authorities in the preservation of the liquidity and stability of the international financial system, Only thus will the international community, particularly the developing countries, be freed from the strait-jacket resulting from the simultaneous contraction of trade and of official financial flows.\n48.\tAs for the question of interest rates, there need be no discrepancy between the major objectives of the economic policies of the countries of the North and a management of the interest rates compatible with the economic and financial viability of the developing economies. Indeed, it is in everybody's interest to avoid a dislocation of the developing economies which would result in an undesirable destabilizing effect on the countries of the North.\n49.\tFurthermore, it must be recognized that one of the essential conditions for reactivating world trade is the recovery of a minimum of stability in the international monetary system, which must not become a factor of turbulence, left to the whims of unilateral changes in the economic policies of a few great Powers.\n50.\tThe solution of the present crisis lies not in aid for developing countries but in ensuring conditions that would enable them to meet their obligations through a fair return for their work.\n51.\tI have come here to express the most legitimate aspirations of my country. I am motivated, above all, by the desire to ensure my people's well-being. We have made considerable efforts towards economic development, with promising results which fill with hope not only the people of Brazil but also all peoples yearning to attain standards of living compatible with human dignity and present-day levels of social, economic, scientific and technological development.\n52.\tIt is my duty to seek international conditions propitious for the pursuit of this noble effort by my people, for Brazil will never give up its rightful place in the concert of nations. \n53.\tI hope that the competition from the South will be understood as a valid expression of the political and economic dynamism of peoples that aspire to development. I hope that this competition will not serve as a pretext for the compliant preservation of unjust and inefficient patterns of exchange but will instead be a motivation for a courageous search for renewal. I am convinced that the most powerful countries will respond creatively to the reality of the emergence of the developing world as an active partner in the many sectors of international life. I have unshakable confidence in the international society's capacity for renewal.\n54.\tToday, however, the climate of conflict among nations in the political and economic fields is reaching threatening levels. It is in times like these that the moral and political imperative of international co-operation has to be fully acknowledged if the destinies of the society of nations are to be rationally assured.\n55.\tThe awareness that the international community today faces the broadest challenge to its capacity for action makes necessary bold and urgent efforts in the following areas: negotiated solutions to the tension and disputes which are poisoning international relations, both on the East-West level and in third world areas; greater use of dialogue and compromise and the strengthening of international institutions, starting with the United Nations itself; effective resumption of the North-South dialogue, including the launching of global negotiations, as a token of the will to respond to the expectations of the great majority of nations; concrete and immediate action, without prejudice to the resumption of that dialogue, on the most pressing economic questions which present a short-term threat to the international community.\nI express my hope that this session of the General Assembly will be most successful. I urge representatives of the Governments assembled here to shoulder to the full their inalienable historic responsibility to live up to the hopes and expectations of those who founded the Organization in 1945 and to build for future generations a broader road to peace and development. We are on the threshold of a new world. May God grant that, thanks to our efforts, it will be a better world. Brazil, I can assure the Assembly, is ready to undertake its share of this task.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like first to express to Mr. Hollai on this occasion my \nsincere congratulations on his unanimous election to the \ndistinguished office of the President of the thirty- seventh session \nof the General Assembly and also to extend our congratulations to the \nother members of the General Committee. The presidency of the General \nAssembly constitutes a singular honour to the Member State that \noccupies it, as well as to its regional group. My delegation also \ncongratulates Mr. Kittani, who presided over the thirty-sixth session \nof the General Assembly with great success. My delegation also wishes \nto express its gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez \nde Cuellar, whose experience and hard work in the service of the \nUnited Nations have already been clearly demonstrated, and represent \nfor the countries of the American continent a source of legitimate \npride and satisfaction. The report which he has submitted to the \nGeneral Assembly is brilliant, and is proof of this; of the many \ndocuments that the Organization produces, only a very few are as \nimportant as this call to reflection. His words not only enumerate \nthe great problems that oppress the world, but also propose solutions \nto these grave and multiple problems. With the sincerity and emotion \nessential to the task of considering the fate of peoples, the \nSecretary-General has made recommendations that do not shrink from \ncriticism of and alternatives for the action of bodies within the \nUnited Nations itself, such as the Security Council. His considered \nand valuable presentation has won the support and general approval of \nworld opinion, and my delegation supports it fully.\nThe Dominican Republic is conscious of the complex and serious \nproblems affecting the international community that are being debated \nat this session, and of the fact that those problems require measures \ncommensurate with their seriousness and urgency, We are confident \nthat within the framework of the law and the principles of the \nCharter will be possible to adopt the measures that can lead to a \nbetter and more just international order.\nIt is for me a source of great satisfaction to participate in the \nAssembly as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the new \nconstitutional Government of my country, inaugurated on 16 August of \nthis year. The Government headed by President Salvador Jorge Blanco \nassumed office in the Dominican Republic through the free and \nsovereign will of our people, expressed in free elections.\nThis Government is the result of the institutional strength of a \ncountry that has been fulfilling its democratic vocation through \nconstant struggle and great sacrifice. During the last 20 years we \nhave not only removed the obstacles that checked our democratic \ndevelopment, but we have also overcome situations that affected our \nstanding as a sovereign nation.\nThe Dominican Republic is now enjoying a period characterized by the \nconsolidation of its political democracy and is facing the urgent \ntask of promoting economic development and social justice. At this \ntime, within our institutional framework and with full respect for \nhuman rights, ideological pluralism and absolute freedom, the \nGovernment intends to make those changes and reforms that are \nnecessary to strengthen our economic democracy, one of the most \nlegitimate aspirations of developing countries.\nWe consider it appropriate to point out those accomplishments because \nwe firmly believe that the continuous and strengthening exercise of \ndemocracy in a small country such as ours, belonging to the group of \nthird world nations, is an example to be proud of and strengthens our \nnational purpose to achieve our own destiny without interference.\nThe political stability of Dominican Republic has created conditions \nwhich enable us to increase our effective participation in \ninternational relations, and to that end we offer our full \nco-operation in the search for peaceful solutions, strictly adhering \nto the principles of international law and of the Charter, at a time \nwhen great conflicts and tension are shaking the international \ncommunity. This activity will be exercised within our sovereign \nrights, without prejudices, inflexible positions or hegemonic \nconstraints.\nThe strengthening of the traditional bonds of friendship that join us \nto certain countries will not be an obstacle to the substantial \nbroadening of our frontiers in the vast and complex field of \ninternational relations, in as far as this is required by our \nnational interests. Above any other consideration, the unchangeable \nnorm of our conduct in the international community will be absolute \nrespect for and adherence to the legal and moral principles sustained \nand supported by the nations which together with ours form the \nOrganization.\nIn his inaugural speech as constitutional President of the Dominican \nRepublic, Mr. Salvador Jorge Blanco outlined the attitude of his \nGovernment in international affairs in the following words: \\\"We \ndeclare ourselves men of America, an essential part of an \ninternational community full of heroic deeds, an integral part of the \nnew world searching daily for a collective existence, of the union of \nwills and efforts dedicated to the defense of social justice, to the \nstruggle against underdevelopment. \\\"In these difficult moments for \nthe countries of the third world the solidarity of the people of \nAmerica is necessary and urgent and requires mutual support to help \nthem overcome their pressing problems of subsistence and their \nterrible economic and political problems. In these difficult times, \nAmerica, our Magna Patria, as it was called by Pedro Hennquez Urena, \nshould be a spearhead to thwart the constant menaces of a world \nholocaust and should be a bulwark of equilibrium in the concert of \nnations of the world.\\\" Within this new spirit, the Dominican \nGovernment has decided to exercise further its traditional vocation \nfor peaceful action and to participate as an active element in the \nsearch for solutions to the conflicts presently afflicting our \nbrother countries of Central America, and we are also prepared to \ncollaborate in alleviating the international tension that affects \nother nations in the Caribbean basin.\nThis attitude on the part of the Dominican Government is reflected in \nthe decision to offer our immediate support for the purposes \nexpressed jointly by the Presidents of Mexico and Venezuela in a \nletter they addressed to the President of the United States of \nAmerica, to the Council of Government of Nicaragua and to the \nPresident of Honduras, expressing their concern over the tense \nsituation existing between the latter two countries.\nIn this instance the Dominican Government did not confine itself to \nsimple support but expressed its willingness to participate, in \nwhatever useful way it could, without detriment to the principle of \nnon-intervention, in any effort to normalize relations between those \ntwo brother countries.\nThis position on the part of my Government had already been expressed \nin the joint declaration issued in Santo Domingo on 16 August last by \nthe heads of State of Venezuela, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Belize and \nthe Dominican Republic, on the express initiative of my Government, \nin which those distinguished statesmen ratified their support for the \nfundamental principles of international law, which include the \nsovereign equality of all countries, respect for their independence \nand the territorial integrity, respect for the principle of \nnon-intervention, non recourse to threats or use of force to resolve \ninternational conflicts, ideological pluralism, the \nself-determination of nations and respect for and faithful compliance \nwith international treaties.\nThe declaration emphasizes: \\\"within the framework of the different \nproposals for peace in the Central American region and the mechanisms \nto implement them, rejection of violent solutions, negotiations and \ndialogue are necessary for the solution of this crisis, a solution \nwhich must be the exclusive product of a common will and effort, with \na view to promoting democracy, economic development and social \njustice.\\\"\nMoreover, we also made a cordial appeal to those democratic countries \ninterested in the establishment of peace to apply their best efforts \nto achieve that end. For my country that declaration forms part of a \nprofound commitment. We must help to stop the present bloodshed and \nthus avert the possible danger of cruel and extended confrontations. \nFor our brother nations of Central America we desire the full \nexercise of human rights. We consider it just and urgent that these \ncountries be able to choose freely their own destiny and to devote \ntheir energies to full economic and social development.\nWe must emphasize that there is perhaps no other region as cohesive \nin its geography, its history, its ethnology, its economy and its \nculture as the Caribbean. This region is characterized by the \ncoexistence of traditional and emerging States. However, due to \ncauses alien to the interests of its peoples, interchanges among the \ncountries of the region have not been achieved to the extent that we \nwould desire and welcome. The Dominican Republic has special \ncharacteristics which make it an ideal bridge for the realization of \nsuch exchanges among Caribbean countries, especially at a time when \nwe are strengthening our relations with the region's new States.\nFor the Dominican Republic it is not Utopian to believe and to say \nthat the Central American and Caribbean region must become a zone of \npeace, of balance, stability, pluralism and the total rejection of \nmilitary solutions.\nThis year there occurred in the South Atlantic a deplorable event \nthat disturbed the region but brought about solidarity in support of \nthe just territorial claims of a brother nation.\nAn invariable aspect of the foreign policy of the Dominican Republic \nis our opposition to all forms and vestiges of colonialism in any \npart of the world. This has been a firm and consistent position \nexpressed on innumerable occasions and in different international \nforums. Within the Organization, from the very outset, the Dominican \ndelegation has constantly supported all anti-colonial recommendations \nand measures and has with clear determination contributed to the \nworthy process of decolonization that has been realized by the United \nNations.\nThroughout its history the Dominican Republic has been a peace-loving \ncountry. This position is unchangeable and is universally recognized. \nWe believe that peace is the common goal of all mankind, the highest \nof social values, the indispensable norm for a harmonious and \ncivilized life within each country and internationally.\nWe therefore address a cordial appeal to the Republic of Argentina \nand the United Kingdom to resume within the framework of the United \nNations the necessary negotiations that will through dialogue and \nunderstanding permit a dignified, honourable and permanent solution \nto the conflict through the peaceful mechanism available to sovereign \nStates under the Charter of the United Nations and international law.\nWe consider it appropriate to point out that this deplorable \nexperience has deeply affected public faith in the effectiveness of \nthe Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, signed at Rio de \nJaneiro in 1947, as a proper instrument for the preservation of peace \nin our hemisphere and has once again demonstrated the urgent need to \nenrich and strengthen the system of collective security in that part \nof the world with the same firm will and resolve manifest in Bogota \nwhen the Organization of American States was founded there.\nThe Dominican Republic expresses its deep concern at the grave \neconomic crisis affecting the international community, which is \ncharacterized by a reduced rate of economic growth, a deterioration \nin the terms of trade, the stagnation of trade, a decrease in the \nprices of raw materials, high interest rates and increasing \nprotectionism by the industrialized nations, together with the \nreduction of international economic aid and co-operation. To give \njust one revealing example, the increase in the gross national \nproduct barely reached 1 per cent in the industrialized countries for \n1980 and 1981, and it will probably be at zero in 1982. This has \nproduced a considerable increase in unemployment and thereby a drasticreduction \nin the demand for the products and raw materials on the export of \nwhich the existence of the third world depends.\nAlthough this problem affects all countries, it is undeniable that \nthe countries within the underdeveloped group that do not produce oil \nare those that suffer most as a result of the present international \neconomic crisis. In fact, in real terms, the prices of our \ncommodities have reached the lowest level recorded in the last three \ndecades and are substantially lower than those that prevailed during \nthe recession of the mid-1970s. The most important consequence of \nthis situation for the underdeveloped countries that do not produce \noil is that in most of tl.cm real per capita income has been \ndrastically reduced for the first time since the Second World War.\nThis situation has created a grave imbalance in the external sector \nof our economies characterized by high deficits, for which we have \nbeen compelled to compensate with unprecedented increases in our \nforeign debt. This high level of debt today constitutes one of the \nmost serious threats to the financial stability of many nations. We \nwant to use this international forum to request the flexibility that \nthe international banking community must show as regards the \nrepayment of those debts, because it must be remembered that they \nhave been caused by a very unusual economic situation.\nWe support the conclusions set forth at the recent meeting of the \nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Toronto stressing \nthe enormous responsibility now facing the main industrialized \ncountries as regards the recovery of their economies, the reduction \nof present interest rates and reversal of the present isolationist \ntrend so as to bring about closer and more generalized international \nco-operation.\nWe also propose the study and identification of proper \nrecommendations to curtail the increasing protectionist trend in \nindustrialized nations, which manifests itself in the establishment \nof unjustified trade barriers that obstruct international trade and \nlimit the expansion of markets for the products of the third- world \nnations.\nIn other words our delegation considers that the North-South dialogue \nmust be awakened from its present stagnation and be activated as an \ninstrument for frank discussions concerning the contradictions \nbetween the developed and the developing worlds. The present \ncondition of the international economy reveals symptoms similar-too \nsimilar to be ignored- to those that existed before the world \ndepression of the 1930s, whose disastrous consequences we all know.\nLet us pledge that during the current decade, through global \nnegotiations within the framework of the Organization, those \nindispensable measures required for the achievement of the much \nawaited new international economic order will be taken and make it \npossible for us to live in a more secure and just world.\nAs we examine the problems that affect the international community, \nwe cannot forget the danger posed by the policies of increasing \narmaments pursued by the super-Powers. Our concern increases when we \nobserve with anxiety and frustration the paralysis of negotiations on \ndisarmament and the fact that we cannot foresee the establishment of \na new order that will give peace to the world. It is a paradox that \nwhile the great nations argue over formulas to reduce the tremendous \npower of their forces of mutual destruction new installations with \nnuclear missiles of incalculable efficiency are being set up on their \nterritories. If this latent menace became reality, it would imply the \ntotal destruction of the world that we live in. The danger becomes \ngreater with the outbreak of limited conflicts in sensitive areas of \nthe world, conflicts that could easily become uncontrollable and \nresult in a nuclear holocaust.\nIn this situation of extreme danger to all mankind, there is an \nurgent need for all Member States to act together to create the \nproper climate for constructive dialogue between the big world Powers.\nOne of the dangers is the explosive situation of increasing violence \nin the Middle East which during recent decades has been a negative \nfactor for the prospects for balance and peace in the world. The \nseriousness of the situation has been made tragically evident by the \nrecent horrible massacre of Palestinian refugees in the camps of \nLebanon, a dreadful act of genocide that has shaken the conscience of \nthe entire international community. Our Government has publicly \nemphatically condemned that horrible massacre, and has demanded that \ninternational bodies prevent its repetition and determine \nresponsibility for it.\nOur voice has joined those of other nations clamouring for an \neffective guarantee of the integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon, an \nunfortunate country with which we have very cordial relations. We are \naware that the problems in that area of conflict have demonstrated \nthat the Palestinian question is one of the decisive factors in the \ncrisis. We believe that no permanent, serious solution can be reached \nif we do not provide a mechanism that assures the Palestinian people \nthe exercise of its inalienable right to self- determination, which \nhas been recognized by the United Nations.\nSimilarly, we reiterate our policy that any serious attempt to \nachieve peace and coexistence in that tormented region must take into \naccount Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which, among other \nthings, affirms the State of Israel's right to exist.\nWe regard as timely and essential to the peace effort the proposal \nmade by the Secretary-General to convert the Security Council into a \nworld forum where \\\"all the parties concerned\\\" in the problem of the \nMiddle East may sit at the same negotiating table.\nThe Dominican Republic feels closely linked to the Arab world by the \nstrong connections created by the historical emigrations to our \nterritory of Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian citizens, who have \nenriched the cultural, social and economic heritage of our country \nover the years. Consequently, my Government has affirmed its \ndetermination to establish or strengthen political, economic and \nother ties with many of the countries of the Arab world, within the \nframework of international law and the principles of the Charter.\nThe war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran, an unfortunate \nconfrontation between two Moslem countries, is a cause of deep \nconcern to us. We hope that a solution will be found in the near \nfuture, one restoring peace and making possible a policy of \ngood-neighbourliness, with the full guarantee of reciprocal \nrights-within the framework of the United Nations, of course.\nFundamentally, the composition of the Dominican people is the product \nof an interracial union of Indians, whites and blacks. The result of \nthis ethnic mixture is a mixed race of which we are truly proud. The \nDominican Republic reiterates in this world forum that for us any \nkind of discrimination or segregation, any attempt to separate the \npopulation on racial, religious or other lines, is a crime against \nhumanity. Therefore, we reject the policies and practices of \napartheid. We take this opportunity to affirm that the Dominican \nRepublic condemns without reservation violations of human rights in \nwhatever circumstances and wherever they occur.\nOur profound conviction on the matter and our resulting firm \nrejection of such attempts have a special meaning at this particular \ntime, when we have just inaugurated in the city of Santo Domingo a \nmonument to Brother Antonio Montesinos. A magnificent work \narchitecturally and sculpturally, the monument is a gift from the \nGovernment of Mexico to the people of the Dominican Republic. Brother \nAntonio Montesinos proclaimed in a sermon in our island in 151l \\\"By \nwhat right and with what justice do you keep these Indians under such \nhorrible servitude? Are they not men? Have they not rational \nspirits?\\\" That was his cry of concern from Santo Domingo, the first \nact in defence of human rights in the new world.\nOn 12 October, Hispanic Day, our President, at the inauguration of \nthe monument, recalled that pronouncement and its far-reaching \nconsequences when, in the presence of President Jose Lopez Portillo \nof Mexico,he said: \\\"The rights of man, which, under another name, \nBrother Antonio Montesinos fought for, have been a permanent guiding \nlight for the Dominican people. Even in those dark days when liberty \nwas denied to us, the pursuit of freedom became the principal motive \nwhich unified our wills, criteria and actions. Only time has \nseparated those historic moments of the struggle for liberty and \ndemocracy in our country. Our political democracy, today fully \nachieved, may be the great answer to those struggles and to a full \nawareness of them, and the role this plays within our continent.\nGeographical differences do not prevent us from recalling the \nstruggles of other peoples, however distant they may be from the \nAntilles. We support the efforts of the people of Namibia to regain \nits independence. We also express our concern about foreign \ninterventions in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. We hope that through \npeaceful dialogue and the use of the machinery provided by the \nCharter the Korean people may be able to secure their desired \nunification into one sovereign State.\nAt this time, when territories are the source of still-unresolved \nconflicts and problems, the seas may contribute to the well-being of \nthe world. We are now witnessing the humanization of the seas through \nthe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea that \ndeclared the sea-bed to be the common heritage of all mankind. The \nConference was one of the great successes of the General Assembly and \nproof of this body's effectiveness within the United Nations. Since \n1973, when the Conference on the Law of the Sea began, it has been \nworking with a new vision of international law and co-operation and \nis laying down rules that would satisfy our aspirations to abolish \nprivileges, to protect the environment and to achieve peaceful \ncoexistence. The new Convention on the Law of the Sea, in \nestablishing a new and fruitful reality, is an example of the \ninfinite possibilities inherent in negotiation, good will and mutual \nunderstanding.\nAmong the social items on the agenda of the Assembly, the Dominican \nRepublic considers as being particularly relevant those related to \nthe rights, evolution and development of women as well as to their \nparticipation in the political, social and economic life of their \ncountries. In this connection, the new Dominican Government has set \nup an office for the advancement of women within a Ministry of Social \nWelfare as a first step towards integration of the different aspects \nof human advancement. We express our deep satisfaction at the fact \nthat our country has been selected as host to the International \nResearch and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women, whose \nformal installation will take place early next year in Santo Domingo \nand for which the Dominican Government has already made a substantial \nappropriation.\nWe are confident that the report the Secretary- General will submit \nwith regard to this matter, which has already been endorsed by the \nEconomic and Social Council, will prompt other Member States to \ncontribute to the support of this Institute and thereby assure the \nfulfilment of its important functions.\nUnder the present difficult international circumstances, cultural \nco-operation-widely debated and defined at the World Conference on \nCultural Policies, known as MONDIACULT, organized by UNESCO in \nAugust-is evoked to strengthen the ties that exist between peoples. \nThere can be no argument that all cultures have the same dignity and \nequality; that freedom is necessary to all intellectual and artistic \ncreation; that all patrimonies, be they architectonic, written or \noral, need to be protected and that those values are the bedrock of \nan interdependence freely assumed but carefully preserving identities \nand receptive to new sources of enrichment.\nThe Dominican Republic, which suffered for a long time from cultural \nisolationism, now wishes to develop communication in education, \nscience, literature and art, provided such dialogues between cultures \nare established on a basis of respect and reciprocity, of recognition \nand a receptiveness that assures interchange in the true meaning of \nthat word. We wish to strengthen regional ties, the mutual \nrecognition of cultures, the resources and unique expressions of the \npeoples of Central America and the Caribbean. To this end, the \nDominican Republic has proposed the celebration of the First Biennial \nof Visual Arts in the Caribbean, to be held in Santo Domingo, a \nrecommendation that was approved by the General Assembly of \nMONDIACULT.\nHowever, this wish for a greater closeness to the countries of our \nregion and Latin America does not diminish the lively interest of the \nDominican Republic in extra-continental cultural co-operation and the \nrecognition of great historical events of the past that still loom \nlarge today. We refer to the fifth centenary of the discovery of \nAmerica, and we are grateful to the Spanish Foreign Minister for \nmentioning in his statement the Dominican Republic's initiative in \nproposing that the United Nations General Assembly declare, in a \nuniversal context, that 1992 be proclaimed the Year of the Fifth \nCentenary of the Discovery of America.\nThe United Nations was founded on the ruins of that great catastrophe \nthat history has called the Second World War. The Organization was \nconceived to guarantee international peace, to develop friendship \namong peoples, to assure self-determination and to promote, through \ninternational co-operation, their social, economic and cultural \ndevelopment. The Organization was conceived in support of human \ndignity, on the basis of respect for the rights and fundamental \nfreedoms of all mankind without distinction as to race, sex, language \nor religion. The Organization was conceived to prevent the third-and \nprobably the last-world war.\nWe often forget that the founders, our predecessors who signed the \nCharter of San Francisco, did so in the name of peoples, not in the \nname of States or Governments. This is not a semantic artifice, nor \nis it a legal subtlety. It is simply the living expression of a deep \nlonging for peace and solidarity that was born in the universal \nconscience in those dark days. I believe that many of the problems \narise or worsen because Governments sometimes ignore the real \naspirations of their peoples. People have among themselves \nspontaneous affinities, natural and pure, that are deeply rooted in \ntheir cultural origins and common ideals. Those affinities transcend \nthe boundaries of circumstantial antagonisms that are characteristic \nof the strict exercise of government. AH Governments, regardless of \nideology or of geopolitical location, would render a great service to \nthe Organization's vocation for peace should they decide to stimulate \nthe development of those affinities, whose roots are found in the \nvery depth of human awareness. A simple examination of the agenda of \nthe Assembly, a mere study of the multiple conflicts that divide the \ninternational community, the anguish expressed by the brave \ndeclaration of the Secretary- General in his memorable report, will \nsurely prove that we have not yet reached these ideals. However, \nthose harsh realities must not frustrate us to the point of losing \nfaith in the Organization, for if we have not been able in many cases \nto prevent or to solve conflicts, we have at other times had \nsuccesses that constitute true triumphs for mankind.\nIn this connection, it should be pointed out that if the fear of a \nnuclear holocaust is still the gravest threat to mankind today, there \nis no better hope of preventing it than that offered by this exalted \nforum, open without discrimination or prejudice to all the peoples \nand nations of the world.\nThe imperfections of the Organization must not shatter our faith in \nit. On the contrary, they Should inspire us to overcome them, thus \nstrengthening our confidence in its capacity to fulfil its \nobjectives. This is the best contribution we can offer to the future \nof mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "  At the outset, Mr. President, my delegation \nwould like to congratulate you on your unanimous \nelection to guide the work of the thirty seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. Your election is \na recognition of your rich experience, personal \nqualities and statesmanship. It is also a fitting \ntribute to your country, the People\u2019s Republic of \nHungary, a country with which Ethiopia enjoys \nstrong ties of friendship and cooperation, and a \nrecognition of the outstanding contributions it \nhas made towards peace and international \nunderstanding. I also pay a tribute to your \npredecessor, Mr. Kittani, for the skill with \nwhich he guided the work of the thirty sixth \nsession. I should also like to take this \nopportunity to express the appreciation of my \ndelegation to the Secretary General for the able \nmanner in which he is serving the cause of peace \nand progress. Thirty seven years after its \nestablishment, the United Nations is still far \nfrom meeting the challenge of ensuring \ninternational peace and security. As a result of \nthe exacerbation of existing conflicts, the \ncreation of new hotbeds of tension, the acute \nglobal economic crisis and the ever increasing \ndanger of a nuclear holocaust, mankind today \nlives under the shadow of total annihilation. The \nray of hope that flickered with the birth of the \nUnited Nations, which was conceived to avert \nconflicts and promote international peace and \ncooperation is, regrettably, being dimmed. \nContrary to the obligations entered into by \nMember States under the Charter, and despite the \nlip service so readily paid to its lofty ideals, \nthe violation of its cardinal principles is \nincreasingly becoming a habit rather than an \noccasional lapse. Today, wars of aggression are \nopenly condoned, dying tension revived, and new \nconflicts fomented. International law continues \nto be flouted with impunity by those in the well \nknown imperialist circles, whose interest in \nexploitation and dreams of expansion have been \nundermined by the mighty tide of national \nliberation and social emancipation. The \nfrustrating outcome of the second special session \non disarmament is a reflection of the \nprecariousness of the prevailing international \nsituation. The unwillingness of some Members to \nbe parties to the United Nations Convention on \nthe Law of the Sea, which has been finalized \nafter more than eight years of painstaking \nnegotiations, could adversely affect one of the \nmajor undertakings of the United Nations. The \nlack of political will on the part of the \ndeveloped world to make possible the launching of \nglobal negotiations on the new international \neconomic order and the overall heightening of \ntension on a global scale are disturbing trends. \nTwenty two years ago the General Assembly adopted \nits historic Declaration on the Granting of \nIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. \nBy invoking this Declaration, a number of \ncountries gained their independence and joined \nthe family of free nations. Yet colonialism and \nracism in their most vile forms continue to be \npracticed in southern Africa. The racist regime \nin Pretoria, with the political, economic and \nmilitary support of its imperialist allies, \ncontinues not only to subjugate the black \nmajority in South Africa but also to consolidate \nits colonial occupation of the international \nTerritory of Namibia. Harassment, imprisonment, \ntorture and racial indignity are the daily lot of \nthe masses of South Africa and Namibia, who have \nbeen cruelly deprived of even the most basic \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. \nFurthermore, the\tregime, acting as the \nagent of imperialism, is busy sowing the seeds of \nterrorism and destabilization in the entire sub \nregion of southern Africa. The frontline States \nhave become prime targets for unprovoked acts of \naggression by racist Pretoria. To us Africans, \nand indeed to all peoples the world over that \ncherish peace and freedom, the delay in Namibia\u2019s \naccession to independence and the attempt to \nperpetuate the policy of apartheid in South \nAfrica are outrageous in the extreme. The \ninternational community is fully aware that the \nterrorist regime in Pretoria, in collusion with \nits imperialist allies, is leaving no stone \nunturned in its bid to keep Namibia in its \nFascist clutches. The independence process of \nNamibia has stalled because of Pretoria\u2019s \nintransigence and the acquiescence of the Western \ncontact group in its dilatory tactics. Without \nthe accession of Namibia to genuine independence \nand the complete dismantling of the racist \nedifice of apartheid objectives to which all of \nus appear to be committed durable peace in \nAfrica, and indeed in the world at large, will \nremain elusive. We therefore cannot and must not \nallow the obstructionist and dilatory tactics of \nPretoria to delay or compromise the inevitable \nindependence of Namibia. In this connection \nEthiopia once again calls for the speedy \nimplementation of Security Council resolution \n433. We reject each and every stratagem designed \nto introduce questions that are of no relevance \nto the issue and fall strictly within the purview \nof the sovereign jurisdiction of independent \nStates. Indeed, we strongly condemn the contrived \nissue of the so called Cuban presence in Angola \nas a blatant and impudent infringement of the \nsovereign rights of the People\u2019s Republic of \nAngola. While supporting all viable initiatives \nwithin the framework of the United Nations plan \nfor Namibia, Ethiopia believes that, in the \nabsence of the political will to impose \ncomprehensive and mandatory sanctions, resolution \n433 will remain a dead letter. In the present \ncircumstances, Ethiopia feels duty bound to \ncontinue to render political support and material \nassistance, within its modest means, for the \nintensification of the legitimate armed struggle \nbeing so resolutely waged by SWAPO, the sole and \nauthentic representative of the people of \nNamibia. Furthermore, Ethiopia pledges its \nunswerving support for the oppressed people of \nSouth Africa in their struggle to build a \ndemocratic society based on racial equality and \nmajority rule. Similarly, Ethiopia reaffirms its \nsupport for and solidarity with the peoples and \nGovernments of the frontline States of southern \nAfrica, which must remain vigilant in defense of \nindependence and human dignity against an \nundeclared war by the Fascist Pretoria regime. \nPretoria, having failed in its strategy of \nmaintaining racist and colonial regimes around \nits borders, has now embarked on establishing in \nsouthern Africa a belt of instability as yet \nanother weapon for the defense of the abhorrent \nsystem. Today it is not only Angola that is the \ntarget of racist and imperialist forces. Lesotho, \nMozambique and Zimbabwe, as well as Seychelles, a \nState that has no common boundary with South \nAfrica, are under the constant threat of acts of \nbanditry and sabotage emanating from South \nAfrica. Indeed, armed bandits and mercenaries \norganized and trained by the Fascist regime of \nSouth Africa with the connivance of international \nimperialism are at this very moment carrying out \nacts of terrorism, murder and pillage in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Mozambique. In the face of \nthese developments, the international community \nmust therefore render both diplomatic and \nmaterial assistance to Mozambique in accordance \nwith the relevant resolutions of the United \nNations, to enable that country to strengthen its \ndefense capabilities to ensure respect for its \nsovereignty and territorial integrity. In this \nregard, it is with great pleasure that I hail the \nvictory once again scored by the people and \nGovernment of Seychelles over the forces of \nracism and imperialism. Encircled by a chain of \nmilitary bases and interventionist forces, my own \ncountry is under constant danger. The forces of \nreaction, subversion, armed banditry and \nterrorism, bankrolled and equipped by \ninternational imperialism and its surrogates, are \norchestrated to undermine the unity, sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of my country. Rocked \nby internal crises and strife, the despotic \nregime of Mogadishu has, since early July 1982, \nbeen making allegations of an Ethiopian invasion \nof its territory. With regard to those unfounded \nand self serving allegations, there are a number \nof facts that the international community needs \nto bear in mind. First, Ethiopia neither covets \nnor has it ever claimed any portion of the \nterritory of Somalia. On the contrary, it is \nSomalia which, in a systematic violation of the \nterms of United Nations instruments that brought \nabout its emergence in 1960 as an independent \ncountry on the map of Africa, continues to be \nobsessed by an expansionist dream at the expense \nof its neighbors. Contrary to the cardinal \nprinciples of the Charter and to the decisions of \nthe United Nations and the Organization of \nAfrican Unity, Somalia has over the past two \ndecades repeatedly committed a series of brazen \naggressions against its neighbors, especially my \ncountry, with the purpose of realizing its \nterritorial ambitions. Secondly, the \ninternational community, including those members \nthat are today cynically shedding crocodile tears \nover the conveniently fabricated invasion of \nSomalia by Ethiopia, can surely testify to the \nfact that it was Somalia which committed an \nunprovoked and massive aggression against my \ncountry in July 1977. Since Ethiopia was in the \nmidst of a far reaching revolution, the Mogadishu \nregime, in collusion with its imperialist and \nreactionary allies, had calculated that the time \nwas opportune to strike at my country with a view \nto realizing Somalia\u2019s expansionist ambitions and \ndestabilizing the Ethiopian revolution. In this \nconnection, it may be recalled that even when the \ninvading army had penetrated 700 kilometers into \nEthiopian territory, the Ethiopian defense forces \nthat routed the invading army early in the \nfollowing year did not sweep the enemy to the \nshores of the Indian Ocean in hot pursuit, even \nthough they had the capacity and the moral right \nto do so. As everyone will recall, our defense \nforces stopped at the international boundary \nbetween the two countries. That is an undeniable \nfact. Similarly, the record of Ethiopia\u2019s policy \nof good neighbourliness and mutually beneficial \ncooperation with its other neighbors, namely, the \nRepublics of Djibouti, Kenya and the Sudan, \neloquently speaks fbr itself. The national \nobjective of our revolution has been repeatedly \nstated on several occasions. If Ethiopia has \ndeclared any war, it is a war on the enemies of \nmankind: hunger, disease and ignorance. Our \nrevolution is irrevocably committed to advancing \nthe material and spiritual wellbeing of the \nEthiopian people. The linchpin of our foreign \npolicy is likewise peace, progress and the \npromotion of good neighbourliness. Since the \nachievement of those objectives compels us to \ndevote all our energies and resources to national \nreconstruction, Ethiopia has neither the need nor \nthe intention to launch an invasion against \nSomalia. It is obvious that the myth of the \nEthiopian invasion has been fabricated by \nMogadishu and its imperialist and reactionary \npatrons as a convenient pretext both to arm \nSomalia to pursue its territorial ambitions \nagainst its neighbors and to strengthen the \nimperialist military bases and the \ninterventionist forces in Somalia. The truth is \nthat under the leadership of the Somalia \nSalvation Democratic Front and the Somalia \nLiberation Movement, the Mejertin, Issaq, \nDulbahanti, Haberawel and other oppressed \nnationalities of Somalia have taken up arms to \nrid themselves of the tyranny of the oligarchy \nbased in the Merehan clan. The popular movements \nto which I have just referred have repeatedly and \nunequivocally declared to the world that they \ntake full responsibility for the civil war now \nraging in Somalia. Hence, no amount of gross \nfabrication and distraction on the part of the \nMogadishu regime and its collaborators can \nconceal the realities of the situation. \nFurthermore, it is evident that international \nimperialism and its surrogates in the area, \nparticularly the archaic feudal potentates who \ncould not even unite to combat genocide and help \nthe Palestinian children falling at their \ndoorsteps, are shamelessly echoing Somalia\u2019s \nallegations. In their policy statements in the \ngeneral debate of the current session and in \nother forums, those Governments have, \nregrettably, expressed concern over an alleged \ninterState conflict in the Horn of Africa. To be \nconcerned about the actual state of relations \nbetween two neighboring countries is one thing, \nbut to lament an internal turmoil within a given \ncountry, a turmoil arising from an oppressive \nrule, is a totally different matter. My \nGovernment therefore reiterates its categorical \nand unequivocal rejection of the baseless \nallegations levelled against Ethiopia and once \nagain calls upon the Governments that show such \nmisplaced concern to see the situation for what \nit is, namely, an internal struggle between the \nregime in Mogadishu and liberation forces opposed \nto its oppressive rule. In this context, I must \nunderscore the fact that some of those \nGovernments that are currently raising a false \nalarm were either arming and financing the \naggressor or maintained a dead silence in 1977, \nwhen Ethiopia was the victim of Somalia\u2019s \naggression. The position they have taken now is \nthus as transparent as it is self serving. Let me \nreaffirm once again that peace in the Home of \nAfrica will reign only when Somalia eschews its \nterritorial claims over its neighbors. The \nbenefactors of the Mogadishu regime could \ntherefore make a positive contribution to the \nrestoration of peace and stability in the area if \nthey could persuade it to abide by the cardinal \nprinciples and decisions of the United Nations, \nthe nonaligned movement, and the OAU, including \nthe decisions of the eighteenth session of the \nAssembly of Heads of State and Government of the \nOAU, held at Nairobi in August 1981. Providing it \nwith weapons and funds indulge in an unrealizable \ndream and destructive ventures can only \nexacerbate tension and conflict in the Horn of \nAfrica. Africa\u2019s endeavors to forge continental \nunity have often been the target of bedevilment \nand attacks by its enemies. In spite of the \nnumerous obstacles that the enemies of unity have \nset before it over the last 19 years, African \nunity still remains a force to be reckoned with. \nThe OAU, which was conceived to ensure the \nfreedom and peace as well as the economic \ndevelopment of our continent, has in the last 19 \nyears scored remarkable achievements. Only its \ndetractors would dare deny its outstanding \ncontributions to the decolonization process. \nNevertheless, imperialist forces to whose \ninterests the success of the Organization has \nproved detrimental have left no stone unturned in \ntheir devious machinations to drive a wedge \nbetween the ranks of its membership. Africa\u2019s \nstrength stems from its unity. Even with the \npressure being exerted against it by its \nimperialist racist adversaries, Africa is \nresolved not only to determine the course of its \nown development but also to contribute to the \npeace and security of the rest of the world. We \nare therefore convinced that the OAU will remain \nstrong and viable to enable Africa to speak with \none voice and to guide effectively the common \ndestiny of the sons and daughters of our great \ncontinent. Despite the best efforts of the United \nNations, peace in the Middle East still remains \nelusive. The return of all Arab lands occupied \nsince 1967 to their rightful owners, the exercise \nof the right to self determination by the \nPalestinian people, including its right to an \nindependent homeland in Palestine, and respect \nfor the sovereignty and security of all the \ncountries in the area will go a long way towards \nensuring durable peace in that region. Israel\u2019s \nrecent invasion of Lebanon and the resulting loss \nof life and destruction of property have once \nagain thrown the entire region into turmoil. The \nsubsequent massacre in west Beirut of innocent \npeople, after the withdrawal of Palestinian \ncombatants under a guarantee of the safety of \ntheir families and other civilians, has shocked \nand angered the international community. Ethiopia \ncondemns in the strongest terms possible the \ngenocide perpetrated against the Palestinian \npeople and supports the call for an international \ninvestigation of the massacre in west Beirut. In \nany event, Israel and its imperialist allies \ncannot escape responsibility for that shameless \nand inhuman episode. Theimperatives of peace in \nthe Middle East demand that Israel immediately \nwithdraw from the entire territory of Lebanon and \nunequivocally recognize the right of the \nPalestinian people to a national homeland of its \nown. Ethiopia reiterates its full support for the \nexercise by the people of Western Sahara of its \ninalienable right to self determination and \nindependence in accordance with the relevant \nresolutions of the United Nations and the OAU. My \nGovernment strongly deplores the arrogant \nimperialist interference in the internal affairs \nof sovereign States in Central and Latin America. \nWe reaffirm Ethiopia\u2019s solidarity with the \nNicaraguan revolution and the gallant fighters in \nCentral America struggling against imperialism to \nreassert their inalienable right to guide their \nown destinies. In Asia, Viet Nam, Kampuchea and \nAfghanistan are endlessly becoming targets of \nimperialist provocation and slanderous campaigns. \nMy Government is convinced that the thomy \nproblems of South East Asia and SouthWest Asia \ncould be resolved by the peoples concerned \nwithout outside interference. My Government also \nsupports all endeavors aimed at promoting \nunderstanding between and the peaceful \nreunification of the two Koreas. With regard to \nCyprus, Ethiopia strongly supports all positive \nefforts designed to bring to an end speedily all \nfactors of disharmony and instability. My \ndelegation insists that the independence, unity, \nterritorial integrity and nonaligned status of \nCyprus be fully respected. The reversal of \ndetente and the accelerating pace of the arms \nrace, coupled with the acquisition of new \nmilitary bases and the provocative behavior of \nsome States, have often again revived the \ndangerous era of the cold war. In the Race of the \ndeteriorating international situation and the \nproduction, stockpiling and deployment of ever \nmore deadly weapons of mass destruction, peace \nhas today become the overriding concern not only \nof Governments but also of people everywhere, as \nhas been demonstrated by the mounting public \nprotests around the world. In the light of the \ngrowing threat of a nuclear holocaust, we are \nconvinced that urgent and concrete measures must \nbe taken to halt and reverse the arms race, \nparticularly in its nuclear aspect, until the \nattainment of our ultimate objective of general \nand complete disarmament under effective \ninternational control. The ongoing negotiations \non strategic arms reduction prompt us not to lose \nhope despite the many failures we have \nencountered in our collective endeavors in this \nfield. The expectations and hopes of the \ninternational community for a successful \nconclusion to the second special session of the \nGeneral Assembly devoted to disarmament were \nshattered. Obviously the main responsibility for \nthat failure is borne by the very forces which \nhave embarked on a policy of massive rearmament \nand advocacy of dangerous military doctrines such \nas that of a limited nuclear war. We therefore \ncall upon the Powers in the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization to demonstrate good will and \ncooperation in expediting negotiations on the \ncomprehensive programme of disarmament so that it \ncan be adopted at an early date. The unilateral \nundertaking by the Soviet Union not to be the \nfirst to use nuclear weapons is a significant \nstep coupled with a reciprocal commitment by the \nother nuclear weapon States, would prevent the \noutbreak of nuclear war. At its current session \nthe General Assembly has before it two important \nadditional items also proposed by the Soviet \nUnion. While the first deals with the urgent task \nof the complete and general prohibition of \nnuclear weapon tests, the second proposal \nunderscores the growing need to redouble the \nefforts aimed at the elimination of the threat of \nnuclear war and the protection of peaceful \nnuclear facilities. As a party to the Treaty on \nthe Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Ethiopia \nnot only welcomes these important proposals but \nalso urges all Member States to seize the \nopportunity they provide to halt the arms race, \nto prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and the \noutbreak of nuclear war andto enhance the \ndevelopment of peaceful nuclear technology. \nDespite the adoption by the General Assembly of \nthe Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of \nPeace, the expansion or modernization of existing \nmilitary bases and the acquisition of new ones in \nthe area, as well as the deployment of rapid \nintervention forces and weapons of mass \ndestruction, are being highly intensified. Those \nactions, contrary to the decisions of the United \nNations, continue to endanger international peace \nand security. In the light of those alarming \ndevelopments, the holding of a conference on the \nIndian Ocean is surely long overdue. We are \ntherefore compelled to reiterate our demand for \nthe convening of the Conference on the Indian \nOcean, in Colombo, in the first half of 1983, as \ncalled for by the relevant resolutions of the \nGeneral Assembly. Similarly, Ethiopia attaches \nconsiderable importance to the signing, speedy \nratification and implementation of the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. An \nexamination of the international economic \nsituation, regrettably, shows an increasing \nresistance on the part of certain industrialized \ncountries to instituting structural changes in \nthe existing system of international economic \nrelations. The continuing deterioration in the \nsituation of developing countries is assuming \nalarming proportions, while the economies of the \nleast developed countries are on the verge of \ncollapse. The burden of indebtedness, the low \nlevel of foreign exchange earnings, balance of \npayments difficulties, instability of commodity \nprices, rising import bills, low level of \nagricultural productivity and food shortages \nremain the general characteristics of the \neconomies of the developing countries. In the \nmidst of the grim world economic situation, the \ncondition of most African countries should be a \nmatter of the utmost concern to the international \ncommunity. It is rather sad to witness today that \nin Africa food shortages caused by the shortfalls \nin agricultural output, low productivity, \nchanging ecological and unfavorable weather \nconditions pre in the process of creating the \nsimplest form of dependence of the continent for \nits food on the developed North. Food aid has \ntended in recent years to become a permanent \nfeature of international assistance to the \nAfrican countries. Today there are no fewer than \n21 countries seeking special assistance from the \nUnited Nations because of their incapacity to \nwithstand even mild shocks to their economies. \nThis deteriorating situation has been a \nconsequence of the basic structural constraints \nand other serious limitations. As a result most \nAfrican countries, especially the least developed \nones, have been forced out of the mainstream of \ninternational economic life. Unless the \ninternational community urgently implements on a \npriority basis the Substantial New Programme of \nAction for the 1980s for the Least Developed \nCountries, adopted at the Paris Conference the \ngrave economic situation of these countries could \nsoon reach an irreversible state. Indeed, we \ncannot envisage a solution to the problem of the \nworld economic crisis in general and the least \ndeveloped countries in particular unless the \ndeveloped countries make a major political \ndecision to accept and institute fundamental \nchanges in the present international economic \nsystem. The growing anarchy in international \nrelations and the ever present threat of a \nnuclear holocaust indicate that mankind has \nreached a very critical point in history. In the \npresent circumstances, even decisions by \nindividual States, let alone those taken \ncollectively, are bound to affect the very \nsurvival of mankind and its civilization. While \npeace and progress are the overriding concern of \nhumanity, war and destruction appear to be the \nhallmark of our era. In this regard, the head of \nState of my country, Chairman Mengistu Haile \nMariam, in his statement to the Ethiopian people \non the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the \nEthiopian Revolution, said the following: Today, \npeace is the most vital issue for which the \npeople of the entire world raise their voice in \nunison. The demand for the preservation and \nstrengthening of peace, which at present figures \ntop on the agenda of the entire peoples of the \nworld, is also the demand of Ethiopia. The \nworldwide struggle for peace cannot also be seen \nseparately from the struggle for national \nliberation, for a just international economic \norder, for democracy and social process. Unless \nmankind, collectively and with the utmost \nurgency, addresses itself to the serious \nchallenges facing it today the consequences will \nbe very grave indeed. Not only is the noble goal \nof the United Nations to save succeeding \ngenerations from the scourge of war likely to \nremain a mere ideal, but there may be neither a \ngeneration to succeed nor a war from which to \nsave it. We must therefore take the present \ninternational crisis as an opportunity for \nintrospection and a time for decision to map out \na strategy to save humanity from the impending \nglobal catastrophe. In such a strategy \ninternational confrontation must yield to \ninternational cooperation. Scrupulous adherence \nto the principles and purposes of the Charter of \nthe United Nations must be consistently pursued \nand upheld. Each and every Government must \nexercise political wisdom, eschew political \nexpediency and act, at all times, in the long \nterm and broader interest of mankind. The time to \nrise to the supreme challenge of our times is \nnow, for tomorrow may well be too late.\n"

His \nfortitude and his balanced, realistic approach to \nthe problems besetting the world are a great \nasset to the United Nations as a whole.\n2.\tThe deterioration of the international \nsituation has continued throughout the past year. \nEast-West relations remain strained because of \nthe infringement of the principles of the \nHelsinki Final Act,' and this hampers progress in \narms control and in disarmament discussions so \nvital for peace and security in the world. The \narmaments race continues unabated. The world \neconomy is going through its worst crisis since \nthe Second World War. Against this background we \nare witnessing a greater tendency to resort to \nforce and violence and a multiplication of \nconflicts and con\u00acfrontations.\n3.\tThe thirty-seventh session is being held \nat a moment when we are all under the spell of \nthe momentous events which have taken place in \nthe Middle East during recent months. The whole \nworld is stunned by the massacre of innocent men, \nwomen and children in the refugee camps of west \nBeirut. That outrage against humanity has \ncompounded the tragedy unfolding in Lebanon since \nthe Israelis invaded that country in early June.\n4.\tThe responsibility of Israel in the mass \nkillings at the Sabra and Shatila camps is \nirrefutable. Israel has shown that it is not \nencumbered by any moral scruples in the pursuit \nof its political ambitions in the Middle East. It \nshould be clear to everybody that there can be no \npeace and security in the Middle East unless \nIsrael is deterred effectively from its \nintransigence, its propens ity instantly to \nresort to force and violence, its utter disregard \nfor the interests of other countries in the area, \nits frightening contempt for human values and its \ndefiance of the principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations and the resolutions of the General \nAssembly and the Security Council.\n5.\tThe aggression against Lebanon, the \nruthless Israeli actions, the staggering human \nlosses and the suffering and material damage \ninflicted upon the Lebanese and Palestinian \npeoples have been followed with abhorrence and \nrevulsion by Turkish public opinion. We reiterate \nour condemnation of Israeli policies and actions. \nAt the same time, we wish to make clear here that \nwe view with mounting concern the dangerous \nimplications of Israeli policies for the security \nof the Middle East as a whole, in which we have a \nvital stake.\n6.\tThe future course of events in Lebanon \nwill be crucial for the entire area. Lebanon \nshould be able to live as an independent and \nsovereign country and preserve its territorial \nintegrity and unity. It should be under the \ninfluence of no other country of the region. We \nhope that, despite the convulsions it has \nsuffered, the people of Lebanon will be able to \nachieve national reconciliation. Obviously, the \nwithdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon is of \nparamount necessity and every effort should be \nexerted to prevent dilatory tactics by Israel.\n7.\tThe horror in Lebanon has heightened \nawareness of the fact that the Palestinian \nquestion is at the core of the Middle East \nconflict. There is greater sense of urgency in \nthe efforts undertaken with a view to achieving a \ncomprehensive, durable and just solu\u00action of the \nMiddle East problem. We have in particular \nwelcomed the recent initiative of the United \nStates and the very constructive approach evolved \nby the Arab countries at the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference, which was held in September in Fez. \nThe United States proposals contain elements \nwhich could con\u00actribute significantly to the \nelaboration of a framework for future \nnegotiations among the parties concerned. The \nproposals of the Arab Conference represent a \ncommon position and reflect the genuine desire of \nthe Arab countries to achieve a balanced and \nrealistic settlement in the interest of all the \ncountries in the area. It is now up to Israel to \nrespond in a positive manner to that approach and \nfinally to alter its per\u00acception of security for \nitself as consisting of continuous confrontation \nwith its neighbors.\n8.\tConcerning the substance of a \ncomprehensive settlement of the Middle East \nconflict, I wish to repeat that we consider the \nfollowing as indispensable ingredients of a \nlasting and just solution: withdrawal of Israel \nfrom all the Arab territories occupied since \n1967, including A1 Quds Al Sharif; recognition of \nthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, \nincluding their right to establish an independent \nState in their own territory; the participation \nof the Palestine l iberation Organization [PLO] \nas the legitimate representative of the \nPalestinian people in all peace negotiations, on \nan equal footing with the other interested \nparties in the conflict; the right of every State \nin the region to live within secure and \nrecognized boundaries; and the maintenance of the \nArab and Islamic character of the Holy City of Al \nQuds Al Sharif.\n9.\tThe war which has been going on between \nIraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran for the \npast two years is a source of profound distress. \nFrom the very outset, we have felt deep anxiety \nover the disastrous conflict between two \nneighbouring Muslim countries. That war not only \nis detrimental to the interests of those two \ncountries but also has grave implications for the \nsecurity and stability of the entire Middle East.\n10.\tWe are saddened by the fact that various \npeace efforts have so far been of no avail. \nTurkey will continue to take an active part in \nthe endeavors of the Islamic Peace Committee and \npersevere in its efforts to support them as an \nimmediate neighbor of the two countries. We wish \non this occasion to renew our appeal to both Iraq \nand Iran to put an end to the bloodshed and to \nembark with determination on the road of peace \nand reconciliation.\n11.\tThe dramatic developments in the Middle \nEast cannot cloud our concern over the plight of \nAfghanistan. The valiant Afghan people continue \nto be deprived of their right to \nself-determination and remain under foreign \nmilitary occupation. We greatly appreciate the \nefforts of the Secretary-General towards a \nnegotiated settlement. Such a settlement should \nrestore to the Afghan people their right to self- \ndetermination and lead to the withdrawal of \nforeign troops from the country.\n12.\tWe realize that refugees are a tremendous \nburden for countries of asylum. As a humanitarian \nmeasure, we have recently settled nearly 5,000 \nrefugees in Turkey. We have provided them a \ntemporary home until they can return freely to \ntheir own country, if they so wish.\n13.\tIn Africa we follow developments \nregarding Namibia with a mixture of anxiety and \nguarded optimism. As a founding member of the \nUnited Nations Council for Namibia, Turkey \nextends its unreserved support to the people of \nNamibia. We hope that on\u00acgoing negotiations for \nthe independence of Namibia within the framework \nof United Nations resolutions will finally \nachieve their objective and thereby remove an \nimportant source of tension in the world. This \nwould be a cause for rejoicing in an otherwise \ngloomy international scene.\n14.\tAnother ray of hope comes from Cyprus. \nOnce the source of dangerous tension, that island \nhas been enjoying peace and stability for more \nthan eight years. Although a settlement has not \nyet been reached, the two national communities \nare committed to a con\u00actinuous negotiating \nprocess. As a result of the sustained efforts of \nthe Secretary-General, the intercommunal talks \nare now proceeding within a comprehensive \nframework encompassing allaspects of the Cyprus \nproblem. The encouraging course of the \nnegotiations has further strengthened our \nconviction that inter\u00accommunal talks represent \nthe only method for resolv\u00acing the issue.\n15.\tThe two communities should now intensify \ntheir efforts to reshape their relations within a \nfederal structure. They should concentrate their \nattention on dialogue. They should not be swayed \nby the counsel of those who would prefer a \ncontinuation of the con\u00acflict for their own \nselfish ends.\n16.\tTurkey remains firmly committed to the \nobjective of a just and lasting settlement of the \nCyprus question. We will continue to encourage \nthe intercommunal talks under the auspices of the \nSecretary-General.\n17.\tThe Kampuchean problem is another \ninter\u00acnational issue which calls for an urgent \nsolution. What is required is a political \nsolution that would enable the people of that \ncountry to choose their government without \ncoercion or intervention from outside. We should \nlike to express the hope that the formation of \nthe Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea \nis a step which will contribute to such an \nevolution. We greatly appreciate the efforts of \nthe members of the Association of South-East \nAsian Nations [/1SE/4JV] to bring peace to \nKampuchea and promote stability and prosperity in \nSouth-East Asia.\n18.\tI should like also to say a few words \nabout the situation on the Korean peninsula. The \ndivision of Korea is certainly painful for all \nKoreans. We firmly believe that the reduction of \ntension on the peninsula and the creation of \nfavorable conditions for a dialogue between the \ntwo parties concerned will contribute not only to \nthe fulfillment of the national aspiration of the \nKorean people to unity but also to the \nmaintenance of peace and stability in the region.\n19.\tThe mounting terrorism and violence \nthroughout the world is a cause for concern for \nthe entire inter\u00acnational community. some \ncountries which have allowed their territory to \nbe used for terrorist actions directed against \nother countries or have tolerated political and \npropaganda activities in support of such action \nare now becoming themselves the hunting grounds \nfor all kinds of terrorism. That should increase \nthe awareness that the need for international \nco-oper\u00acation to curb this scourge is greater and \nmore urgent than ever.\n20.\tOne manifestation of international \nterrorism is the attacks directed against \ndiplomatic representatives. The General Assembly \nresolutions on the protection of diplomatic and \nconsular agents and premises represent an \nimportant step in initiating international \nco-operation in this field. We hope that it will \nbe possible this year to devise more effective \nmeasures for the prevention and elimination of \nsuch acts of terror.\n21.\tTurkey has a special reason for feeling \ngrave concern on this issue. Armenian terrorists \nhave in recent years brutally assassinated more \nthan 20 Turkish diplomats and officials. In the \nfirst week of August, Armenian terrorists \nlaunched an attack at Ankara airport in which \nnine people lost their lives and some 70 were \nwounded.\n22.\t \tAn intensive propaganda campaign, \nbased on blatant falsification and distortion of \nhistory, lies behind these vile acts of terror. \nThe Armenian propaganda alleges that a great \nnumber of Armenians were massacred in Turkey \nduring the First World War. It demands \nvindication for this contrived and imaginary \nmartyrdom.\n23.\tNo amount of propaganda and \ndisinformation can alter historical truths or \nchange political realities. After the First World \nWar the Ottoman Empire collapsed and was replaced \nby a completely new State, the Turkish Republic. \nMany new States came into being on the territory \nof the Empire. But historical facts indicate that \nthe assertions in Armenian propaganda are \ncompletely unfounded.\n24.\tPrior to the First World War, the \nArmenians were concentrated in Istanbul, the \ncapital of the Ottoman Empire, and in the eastern \nprovinces. In none of the areas where they lived \ndid they constitute anything more than a small \nminority. The Armenians found themselves in a \nmajority only in a region of the Caucasuswhere \neventually they created a State which signed a \npeace treaty with Turkey recognizing the present \nborders and later joined the Union of Soviet \nSocialist Republics.\n25.\tArmenian extremists began to resort to \nviolence in the early 1890s in a manner very \nreminiscent of the activities of their successors \ntoday. They caused the deaths of a large number \nof innocent people. The outbreak of the First \nWorld War marks the most important crisis in \nrelations between Turks and Arme\u00acnians. The \nTsarist Russian Government then instigated the \nrising of the Armenians against Ottoman rule in \neastern Anatolia, by promising the establishment \nof an Armenian State. That was the signal which \nprompted the Armenian extremists to commit large- \nscale atrocities against the Turkish population \nin eastern Anatolia, as the Russian armies \nadvanced. It was only after these massacres that \nthe Ottoman Government decided to move the \nArmenian population out of range of the Russian \ninvading forces in eastern Turkey to central \nSyria, which was at that time within the \nboundaries of the Ottoman State. Specific \ninstruc\u00actions were issued for the protection of \nthe life and property of the deportees.\n26.\tFollowing those events, enormously \nexaggerated claims were put forward by Armenian \npropagandists. It was alleged that 1.5 million \nArmenians died. That is nonsense, since the total \nArmenian population in the Ottoman Empire did not \nexceed 1.2 million. Of that number, about half a \nmillion Armenians living in north\u00aceast Turkey had \nmoved to Russia at the outbreak of hostilities in \nthe area. The deportees numbered approximately \n400,000. A sizeable number found their way to \nEurope and the United States, and about 100,000 \nremained in Turkey after the war. There were of \ncourse Armenians as well as Turks who lost their \nlives during the war years. The number of Turks \nwho died during that period was 2 million. Many \nof both communities died of cold, famine and \ndisease and as a result of communal clashes upon \nthe break\u00acdown of law and order. Because \nArmenians collabor\u00acated with invading Russian \narmies, many also died during military operations.\n27.\tNeither moral nor historical \njustification can be found for the callous and \nsenseless Armenian terrorism. It reflects a \nshameful rejection of the human values which the \ncivilized world is trying to uphold. Armenian \npropaganda and violence can achieve nothing more \nthan a long list of innocent victims.\n28.\tMost of the support and aid that the \nprotagonists of violence get from Armenian \ncommunities are obtained through extortion and \nintimidation. There is no doubt that the great \nmajority of Armenians through\u00acout the world abhor \nthe crimes committed by the fanatics among their \nranks. The Armenians who continue to live in \nTurkey in full enjoyment of their rights and in \ncomplete harmony with Turks have condemned the \nacts of terror in the strongest terms. It is sad \nthat some countries provide shelter and support \nto terrorists and encourage Armenian propaganda. \nThese countries cannot disassociate themselves \nfrom the odious crimes being committed. At the \nsame time, they are creating on their own \nterritory an atmosphere propitious to the \nescalation of violence, which in the end can \ncause great harm to themselves.\n29.\tIn the economic Held, it is becoming \nincreas\u00acingly evident that the world economy is \nunder the most adverse economic, financial and \npolitical pres\u00acsures of the post-war period. High \nrates of inflation, low rates of growth and \nsevere current-account imbalances are indeed the \norder of the day. The dif\u00acficulties confronted \nseem to be not transitory but lasting, as a \nresult of maladjustments that have accumulated \nover a number of years.\n30.\tAgainst the background of unstable and \nunpredictable economic conditions, many \ncoun\u00actries, particularly the industrialized \ncountries, seem to be moving dangerously towards \nprotectionism. Such a trend not only would be \ndamaging to economic efficiency but also would \ndiminish the prospects for economic growth.\n31.\tIt would be deceptive to think that \ndomestic economic problems can be resolved effectively \nwhile the international economic system is in \nturmoil. Indeed, the economies of rich and poor \ncountries are so interlocked that only \ninternational co-operation can restore growth and \ndevelopment. However, as the troubles of the \nindustrialized countries increase international \nco-operation tends to diminish and con\u00accern for \ndeveloping countries wanes. Unlike the last major \nrecession, in the mid-1970s, when increased aid \nand private capital flows to developing nations \nhelped to shield them from its worse effects, \nthis time the developing countries are left to \nface the full brunt largely unassisted. \nDeveloping countries, particularly the deficit \ndeveloping countries, need more time and \nresources to carry out structural adjustments in \na way that will minimize the loss of output, \nemployment and income.\n32.\tAt no time has the economic \ninterdependence among nations been more evident \nand at no time has there been greater need for \nthe formulation of collec\u00active policies and \nreforms of established rules of conduct. \nEspecially in the light of the current world \nrecession, the formulation of a scheme for \nintegrated development is indispensable.\n33.\tIt is with this conviction that my \nGovernment supports the launching of the global \nnegotiations in an effort to deal with \ninternational economic issues in a comprehensive \nway. Sectoral approaches have not been sufficient \nor effective. It must be remembered that, as the \nmajor issues in international economic relations \nare interlinked, they can be resolved only \nthrough interdependence.\n34.\tIt is understandable that the developing \ncoun\u00actries are engaged in a process of extensive \nco-oper\u00acation among themselves as well as in an \neffort to cope with many of the adverse effects \nof the deterior\u00acating world economic conditions. \nWe welcome the growing importance of South-South \nco-operation in this respect and believe that \nthrough such a process a: more meaningful \ndialogue could be established between the North \nand the South in dealing with the current \ninefficiencies and inadequacies of the world \neconomic system.\n35.\tTurkey, which is geographically situated \nbetween two continents, has always found itself \nplaying a role as a link between Europe, the \nMiddle East and the Islamic world. Indeed, it has \nfor centuries been the meeting place between East \nand West and North and South. These factors \nexplain Turkey's multidimen\u00acsional relations, \nnamely, its efforts to improve relations with the \ncountries of the region, its membership in the \nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment, its association with the European \nCommunity and, in particular, its expanding \nrelations with the countries of the third world.\n36.\tAlthough Turkey has great economic \npotential, it is still a developing country \nfacing all the typical problems challenging other \ndeveloping countries. Like them, it has been \nadversely affected by the rapidly changing and \ndeteriorating world economic conditions. Its \neconomy has for some time been in a state of \ncrisis. However, at the beginning of 1980 it \nembarked on a vigorous stabilization program with \nthe support of international financial \ninstitutions. Daring steps have been taken, and I \ncan say with confidence that the results have \nbeen promising.\n37.\tAs can be seen, Turkey has done its part, \nas may have others, in good \\\"housekeeping\\\", and \nit will continue to do so with determination. The \ninter\u00acnational community and its institutions as \na whole must prepare themselves to respond to \nsuch positive adjustments- if we are to achieve \nany progress in finding effective ways of \nmaintaining stable inter\u00acnational economic \nrelations in the interest of world peace and \nprosperity.\n38.\tOne encouraging aspect of this session \nhas been the impact upon all of us of the first \nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of \nthe Organization. He has put before us with \nclarity and perceptiveness the central issues the \nUnited Nations faces today. He has analyzed \nfrankly and accurately the reasons preventing the \nOrganization from fulfilling its basic mission of \nsafeguarding peace and security and promoting international \nco-operation. We have been reminded appropriately \nof our duties and respon-sibilities. It is now \nincumbent upon us to reflect on the ideas of the \nSecretary-General and to come forward with \nrenewed determination to transform the United \nNations into an effective instrument of \ninternational peace and security and orient our \nbilateral and multilateral policies towards this \nobjective.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam, I should like to extend to \nMr. Hollai, of Hungary, warmest con\u00acgratulations \non his election to the high office of Presi\u00acdent \nof the thirty-seventh session of the General \nAssembly, and express my conviction that with his \neminent talents and wealth of experience he will, \ntogether with other members of the General \nCom\u00acmittee, guide the work of the present session \nto fruitful results.\n80.\tWe are living in a period of complex \nupheavals and difficult challenges. The creative \nlabour and the economic and other achievements of \nthe world's peoples in the past 37 years are in \ndanger of being destroyed by the tension clouding \nthe international situation. In the hope of \nextricating itself from the prolonged economic \nrecession and coping with the growth of the \nforces of peace, democracy, national independence \nand social progress, and in an attempt to \ncontinue to impose its will on other peoples, \nduring the past three years the United States\u2014in \ncollusion with other reactionary forces\u2014has \nlaunched a global counterattack against the \nindependence and sover\u00aceignty of peoples and \nagainst world peace. It has stepped up the arms \nrace to an unprecedented level in its quest for \nmilitary supremacy. Billions of dollars have been \nspent on the production of weapons of mass \ndestruction, including the neutron bomb. It has \ndecided to deploy medium-range missiles in \nWestern Europe, shamelessly proclaimed the \ndoctrine of a for limited nuclear warfare , \nintroduced the rapid deployment force into the \nregion of the Persian Gulf, reinforced its fleet \nin the Caribbean Sea and built new military bases \nin the Indian Ocean, with a view to preparing for \naggression and intervention in every continent, \nthus creating new hotbeds of tension in various \nregions of the globe.\n81.\tThis adventurist and bellicose policy \nconstitutes an extremely grave threat to \ninternational peace and security, and runs \ncounter to the aspirations of billions of people \nthroughout the world. The collusion between the \nring-leader of imperialism and international \nreactionary forces is a cause of tension and \ncould lead to an explosive situation. More than \never before the struggle for international peace \nand security is an urgent and primary task for \nall peoples. With the exception of the \nmilitary-industrial complexes of the imperialist \nPowers seeking excessive profits from war and the \narms race, nobody today profits from war. The \nprofound aspirations to peace of billions of \npeo\u00acple are what give the peace movement \nunprecedented power, capable of staying the \narmored hands of the imperialist and reactionary \nforces. The united efforts of and the \nco-ordinated struggle carried on by the socialist \ncountries, the non-aligned countries and the \nforces of peace and democracy in the Western \ncoun\u00actries have a great opportunity of averting \nthe danger of a nuclear war and countering the \nwarlike and aggres\u00acsive policy of the \nimperialists and international reactionaries.\n82.\tHaving undergone 35 consecutive years of \nwar while the rest of the world was enjoying the \nlongest period of peace in the century, the \nVietnamese people are profoundly conscious of the \nsignificance of peace. Together with all \npeace-loving forces on this planet, our people \nhave waged and are still waging an untiring \nstruggle for national independence, foiling one \nafter another all the schemes of imperialism and \ninter\u00acnational reaction, aimed at turning \nSouth-East Asia into the hotbed for a new world \nwar.\n83.\tIn the past several months alone, 15 \nmillion Viet\u00acnamese have participated in \ndemonstrations, briefings and seminars and have \nsigned petitions in response to a nationwide \ncampaign for peace and disarmament. We \nunreservedly support the peace and disarmament \ninitiatives put forward by the socialist and \nnon-aligned countries. In particular, we highly \nappreciate the unilateral commitment of the \nSoviet Union not to be the first to use nuclear \nweapons, and see in this a gesture of historic \nimportance. If, like the Soviet Union, all \nnuclear Powers\u2014and first of all the United States \nof America\u2014were to make similar commit\u00acments, the \npossibility of rebelling the danger of a \ndevastating nuclear war would immediately become \na reality, even at a time when the major Powers \nhave not yet reached an agreement on disarmament. \nThe new proposals of the Soviet Union, announced \nby Foreign Minister Gromyko to the General \nAssembly at the 13th meeting, once again prove \nthat the Soviet Union spares no effort to prevent \nwar and to defend world peace. Likewise, we give \nour full support to the proposal of the Soviet \nUnion and the Secretary- General for a conference \nof States Members of the Security Council at the \nhighest possible level to seek a solution to \nproblems relating to international peace and \nsecurity.\n84.\tAs an Asian country bordering the Pacific \nOcean and the Indian Ocean, Viet Nam warmly \nwelcomes the initiatives of India and other \nnon-aligned countries, aimed at making the Indian \nOcean a zone of peace. Likewise, we firmly \nsupport the proposal of the Mongolian People's \nRepublic on the signing of a convention on \nnon-aggression and non-use of force in relations \namong countries in Asia and the Pacific. The \nimplementation of these proposals would \nconsti\u00actute an effective contribution to \ninternational peace and security.\n85.\tThose who have a conscience cannot remain \nindifferent to the abominable crimes perpetrated \nby the Israeli aggressors against the innocent \ncivilian population of Lebanon and Palestine. The \natrocious massacres in Lebanon are reminiscent of \nthe crimes committed by the Hitlerites during the \nSecond World War, by the American aggressors at \nMy Lai during the Viet Nam War and by the Pol Pot \nclique in Kam\u00acpuchea. As long as murderers in the \nMiddle East of the Hitler and Pol Pot type remain \nunpunished, slaughters such as those committed in \nLebanon will not be the last crimes against \nhumanity. The Govern\u00acment of the United States \ncannot clear itself of the crimes of aggression \nand genocide of the Israeli Zionists.\n86.\tTogether with all of progressive mankind, \nthe Vietnamese people indignantly condemn the \nIsraeli aggressors and those who have provided \nthem with billions of dollars, and weapons, and \nwe demand due punishment for those aggressors. \nOnce again, we reaffirm the resolute support of \nthe people and the Government of the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for the just struggle of the \nPLO, the Syrian Arab Republic, Lebanon and other \nArab countries against the Israeli aggressors and \ntheir protectors. Israel must withdraw all its \ntroops from all the Arab terri\u00actories it has \nillegally occupied. A just solution for the \nsituation in the Middle East cannot be achieved \nunless and until the legitimate rights of the \nPalestinian people, whose sole authentic \nrepresentative is the PLO, are guaranteed, \nincluding the right to found their own \nindependent and sovereign State. Any separate \nsolution is aimed only at dividing the Arab \ncoun\u00actries and encouraging the aggressors, and is \ncertainly doomed to failure.\n87.\tThe present situation in southern Africa \nis causing us no less concern. Unless checked in \ntime, the crimes being committed in the Middle \nEast may be repeated in southern Africa, where \nthe Pretoria racists are pursuing a ferocious \npolicy of apartheid, violently opposing the \nstruggle of the peoples of Namibia and South \nAfrica for national liberation, and launching \npiratical attacks against Angola, Mozambique and \nthe other front-line States. The Vietnamese \npeople wishes to express its profound sympathy \nand firm support for the just cause of the \npeoples of Namibia and South Africa, under the \nleadership of SWAPO and the African National \nCongress JVC], respectively, as well as that of \nthe front-line States. We fully support all \nmeasures taken by Angola to deliver a well- \ndeserved riposte to the aggressors.\n88.\tWe totally support the struggle of the \npeople of Seychelles and of Madagascar against \nimperialist subversion and intervention. We \ndemand that the United States return Diego Garcia \nto Mauritius.\n89.\tThe Vietnamese people resolutely stand by \nthe peoples of Cuba, Nicaragua and Grenada in \ntheir current struggle against the threat of \naggression and in defense of the fruits of \nrevolution. We fully sup\u00acport the peoples of El \nSalvador, Chile and other Latin American peoples \nin their fight against their dictatorial regimes. \nOur special sympathy goes to the Puerto Rican \npeople in their struggle for independence from \ncolonial domination. In their struggle to regain \nsover-eignty over the Malvinas Islands, the \npeople of Argen\u00actina can rely on the solidarity \nof the Vietnamese people.\n90.\tThe Government and people of Viet Nam \nvehemently condemn the policies of the \nimperialist countries which use political \npressure and carry out hostile acts to interfere \nin the internal affairs of the Polish People's \nRepublic, with a view to wiping out the socialist \nachievements of the Polish people.\n91.\tWe resolutely support the Government of \nthe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the \nfraternal Afghan people in their struggle against \nthe imperialists' and international \nreactionaries' undeclared war, in defense of \ntheir independence and sovereignty, and to \nsafeguard the fruits of the April revolution. We \nunreservedly support the just struggle of the \nKorean people for the reunification of their \nfatherland. The persistent struggle waged by the \npeople of Western Sahara for their national \nindependence as well as that waged by the people \nof Cyprus for their territorial integrity enjoys \nthe constant and firm support of the Vietnamese \npeople.\n92.\tHaving suffered from the yoke of \ncolonialism and having had to wage a protracted \nstruggle against the aggressors, the Vietnamese \npeople fully and consistently support the \nstruggle of the peoples in Asia, Africa and Latin \nAmerica for the elimination of the last vestiges \nof colonialism, for the defense of their national \nindependence and for the building of a new, just \nand equitable international economic order.\n93.\tWe are of the view that at this juncture, \nwhen the burdens of the economic crisis and of \nthe arms race are weighing so heavily on the \ndeveloping coun\u00actries and when the United States \nis resorting to its policy of embargo and \neconomic sanctions to impose its will on other \npeoples, the struggle of the peoples of Asia, \nAfrica and Latin America to build a new \ninternational economic order is of necessity \nlinked with the common struggle of the peoples of \nthe world for peace and disarmament and against \nthe imperialist policy of aggression and \nintervention. The experiences of the past years \nhave taught us that only by waging a struggle on \nthe economic, political and other fronts can the \npeoples of the developing countries become \nmasters of their own political destiny and \nnatural resources and force concessions from \nimperialism.\n94.\tThe causes of world tension in the past \nthree years are precisely those that threaten \npeace and stability in the South-East Asian \nregion.\n95.\tAfter failing in their attempts at \ncollusion with United States imperialism in \nholding back the com\u00acplete victory of the \nVietnamese, Lao and Kampuchean peoples in their \nwars of resistance for national salva\u00action, the \nreactionary elements in the Beijing ruling \ncircles have considered the emergence of a \nunified Viet Nam as the biggest obstacle to their \nstrategy of expansionism in South-East Asia. \nSince 1975, China has used the Pol Pot clique as \nits essential instrument to weaken Viet Nam and \nto carry out its policy of expansionism. Since \nthe overthrow of the Pol Pot clique and China's \ndefeat in February 1979 in its war of aggression \nagainst Viet Nam, the new leaders of the modern \nfor Middle Empirefor  have waged a war of \ndestruction in all fields against Viet Nam and \nthe other Indo-Chinese countries. At the same \ntime, they have kept oh using the remnants of the \nPol Pot troops and have fabricated the so-called \nKampuchean prob\u00aclem in a bid to reinforce their \ncollusion with the United States and other \nreactionary forces against the three Indo-Chinese \npeoples and to incite confron\u00actation between the \nIndo-Chinese countries and those which are \nmembers of ASEAN, with a view to under\u00acmining \npeace and stability in South-East Asia so that \nChina may fish in the troubled waters.\n96.\tIn order to conceal its expansionist and \nhegemonist schemes, China has fabricated the \nso-called Vietnamese threat to the ASEAN \ncountries, with a view to inciting the latter to \noppose Viet Nam and sowing disorder in South-East \nAsia.\n97.\tIt is necessary to point out that this is \nnot the first time that the aggressors have used \nsuch a pretext to justify their acts of \naggression against Viet Nam. As is widely known, \nin 1964 the United States con\u00accocted the for \nTonkin Gulf incident for  as a pretext for \nunleashing its air and naval war of destruction \nagainst the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam. What \nthe Bering expansionists are now doing is just a \nrepetition of the shameful acts committed in the \npast by the colonialists and imperialists against \nViet Nam.\n98.\tAt present, China requires the settlement \nof the so-called Kampuchean problem as a \npre-condition for the normalization of relations \nbetween Viet Nam and China and claims that it is \nthe root cause of the Sino- Viet Nam conflict. \nYet it is only too evident that since early 1978 \nChina has used the question of the Hoa \npeople\u2014Vietnamese of Chinese descent\u2014to launch a \ncampaign of subversion against Viet Nam, as it \ndid against Indonesia in 1965 and to invade India \nin 1962. They will certainly resort to similar \npretexts when they find it necessary to provoke \nconflicts with other coun\u00actries in South-East \nAsia.\n99.\tHistory has proved that policies based on \nfabrica\u00actions are always doomed to failure. At \npresent more and more people have become aware of \nthe fact that the so-called Kampuchean problem is \nin essence China's opposition to Viet Nam and the \nother Indo- Chinese countries, and not in the \nleast a conflict between the ASEAN and the \nIndo-Chinese countries. The latest developments \nin South-East Asia have further enlightened world \npublic opinion about the fact that the Beijing \nleaders are the only ones who do not want peace \nor stability in that region. China has time and \nagain rejected all our proposals aimed at easing \ntension on the Viet Nam-China border and at \nresuming talks between the two countries to find \na peaceful solution to the disputes. Moreover, \nChina has sought all ways and means to sabotage \nthe dialogue between the Indo-Chinese and the \nASEAN countries to settle matters relating to \npeace and stability in the region.\n100.\tDespite the hostile policy being pursued \nat pres\u00acent by the Chinese leaders against Viet \nNam and the other countries of Indo-China, the \nVietnamese people never look upon the Chinese \npeople as their enemies. Bearing in mind the \nage-old friendship between the two peoples, we \nbelieve that the present abnormality in the \nrelations between Viet Nam and China is only a \ntemporary phenomenon. It has been our consistent \npolicy, and still is, to persevere in peaceful \nnegotia\u00actions to settle all differences between \nthe two coun\u00actries. We stand ready to resume the \nViet Nam-China talks at any level, at any place \nand at the earliest pos\u00acsible time, with the aim \nof normalizing relations between the two \ncountries.\n101.\tWith the desire to promote reconciliation \namong the countries in the South-East Asian \nregion, the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People's \nDemocratic Republic, on behalf of the \nIndo-Chinese countries, sent a letter dated 15 \nSeptember 1982 to the ASEAN countries further \nclarifying the proposals made by the Conference \nof Foreign Ministers of the Lao People's \nRepublic, Kampuchea and Viet Nam, held in July \n1982 in Ho Chi Minh City, on settling questions \nrelating to peace and stability in South-East \nAsia. We regard these proposals as matters to be \nnegotiated between the two groups of countries. \nWe are ready to listen to other views and to \nrespond positively to the legitimate concerns of \nthe ASEAN countries. We hold that the two sides \nshould respect each other's legitimate interests, \nthat they should respect the principles of \nequality, mutual respect, non-imposition of one \nside's views upon the other and non-interference \nfrom out\u00acside. Only in those conditions can all \nissues con\u00accerning South-East Asia be settled \nproperly and peace and stability in the region be \nguaranteed.\n102.\tThe situation in Kampuchea is developing \nfavorably. Under the leadership of the Government \nof the People's Republic of Kampuchea, the \nKam\u00acpuchean people have over the past three years \novercome their most serious difficulties and \nhardships and thus have continued the miraculous \nrebirth of their nation after the nightmare \ncaused by the Pol Pot genocidal clique. World \npublic opinion particularly welcomes the policy \nof national unity and concord of the Government \nof the People's Republic of Kam\u00acpuchea as \nexpounded in a recent statement by Mr. Hun Sen, \nVice-President of the Council of Ministers and \nMinister for Foreign Affairs, concerning those \nKampucheans who are still in the ranks of the Pol \nPot clique or are collaborating directly or \nindirectly with them. If they cease this \ncollaboration and respect the Constitution of the \nPeople's Republic of Kam\u00acpuchea, they will be \nentitled to enjoy all rights of citizenship, \nincluding the right to stand for and vote in \nKampuchea's free elections, in the presence of \nforeign observers. With its foreign policy of \npeace and non- alignment, the People's Republic \nof Kampuchea, together with other countries in \nthe Indo-Chinese peninsula, is playing an \nincreasingly active role as a factor for peace \nand stability in South-East Asia.\n103.\tWe make this appeal to the international \ncom\u00acmunity: if for the time being it is unable \nactively to assist the Kampuchean people in \naccelerating their rebirth and to promote \ndialogue and reconciliation between the \nIndo-Chinese and ASEAN countries, at least \nrefrain from doing anything that may poison the \natmosphere, which is improving in this region.\n104.\tAs a Member of the United Nations, the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam hopes that the \nOrganization will do its best to perform the \nnoble tasks entrusted to it by the peoples of the \nworld. It is regrettable; however, that \nthroughout the 37 years of its existence, in \nspite of the goodwill and com\u00acmendable efforts of \nmany Member States, the United Nations has not \nyet fulfilled the aspirations of mankind. The \ngreat changes brought about by the peoples of the \nworld in that period of time in their struggle \nfor peace, democracy, national independence and \nsocial progress have all taken place outside the \nUnited Nations.\n105.\tIn the course of the struggle of the \nIndo- Chinese peoples and countries in the \nMoodiest war in history, the United Nations did \nnot recognize the right of the Indo-Chinese \npeople to be represented, while the imperialist \nand reactionary forces hostile to those three \npeoples had an important voice in this \nOrganization. Today, when the peoples of the \nworld greatly rejoice at the rebirth of the \nKampuchean people who survived the genocide, the \ncriminals of the Pol Pot genocidal clique and \ntheir accomplices in the for coalition government \nof Democratic Kampucheafor  have not yet been \nousted from this body. However, the rebirth of \nthe Kampuchean people is absolutely irreversible. \nAll attempts to reimpose the genocidal regime on \nKampuchea will certainly fail.\n106.\tMankind now faces extremely severe \ntrials. World peace and international security \nare being threat\u00acened by the frantic arms race \nand the policy of insti\u00acgating chaos in the \nworld. In such a situation, the peoples of the \nworld are urging the United Nations to discharge \nits responsibility to history. We believe that in \norder to strengthen the role and effectiveness of \nthis Organization and to turn it into a real \ninstrument of peace and international \nco-operation it is essential that Member States \nstrictly respect the purposes and principles of \nthe Charter and refrain from turning this \nOrganization into an instrument for interfering \nin the internal affairs of other States and \ninfringing the sovereignty of other peoples. The \nUnited Nations can accomplish its historic \nmission only if it supports the struggle of the \npeoples for justice and responds to the ardent \naspirations of billions of people on our planet \nfor the maintenance of world peace, the defense \nof the national independence of peoples, the develop\u00acment \nof international co-operation and the building of \na prosperous and happy life for all. The \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam will spare no \neffort to make its contribution to that noble \ncause.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to add the congratulations of the delegation of \nBurundi to those already addressed to Mr. Hollai on his unanimous \nelection to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly. The Assembly's decision to make him its President \nis a reflection of the respect and esteem which his country, Hungary, \nand he himself enjoy within the international community. His \nexperience, competence and efficiency, as evidenced by his diplomatic \ncareer, have enabled him from the outset to give the work of this \nsession a momentum that promises results in line with the hopes of \nthe nations represented here. It is our firm conviction that he will \nmanage to give our work the energy demanded by the seriousness and \ncomplexity of the questions being studied. We are all the more \nconvinced of this as he will be assisted by a General Committee whose \ncompetence and devotion we fully appreciate. I must also congratulate \nMr. Hollai's predecessor, Mr. Kittani, for the outstanding work he \ndid during the last session of the General Assembly. May I also pay a \ntribute to the Secretary-General for the effective manner in which he \nhas carried out his lofty duties since his election. He has spared no \neffort to restore international peace and security wherever they have \nbeen threatened in the world.\nThe international community is going through a period of crisis of \ndisturbing proportions. The peoples of the world, particularly those \nwho are economically the weakest, are rightly turning once more their \nanguished gaze towards the Organization, which is the special \npreferred and most appropriate forum for a promising dialogue among \nMember States. It is here that a new order-more just, more equitable \nand more human-is taking shape.\nOur present discussions will once again make it possible to study the \ninternational political and economic situation, and to evaluate the \ndepth of the current crisis in international relations. But these \n-debates will not yield fruit as long as the decisions taken by the \nGeneral Assembly are ignored and trampled on by some States Members \nof the United Nations, and as long as others want to paralyse the \naction of the Organization by subordinating that action to their own \nselfish interests.\nThe political problems affecting South Africa, the Middle East and \nother regions of the world cannot be solved if there is lack of \nrespect for the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security \nCouncil and deliberate contempt for the obligations incumbent upon \nMember States under the Charter of the United Nations.\nIndeed, in South Africa the vile Pretoria regime has established \napartheid as an institution, a system of colonial and racist \noppression and exploitation that the Assembly has justly described as \na crime against humanity. Pretoria's power and prosperity is being \nbuilt on the denial of the most elementary rights of the black \npopulation, on contempt for them, and on their relegation to a social \nlimbo.\nFor many years the United Nations has continually demanded respect \nfor the right of the black people of South Africa to freedom and \ndignity. Today, it is less a question of exposing the ignominious \ncrime of apartheid than of stressing the urgency of finding a just \nand definitive solution to that problem.\nThe international community must hope that, in order to react against \nthe policy of apartheid practiced by the Pretoria regime in South \nAfrica, the Security Council will use the powers given to it by the \nCharter to put an end to that odious crime. With the exception of an \narms embargo decided upon in Security Council resolution 421 (1977), \nwhich continues to be violated in a concealed fashion, the Security \nCouncil has remained paralysed by the use of the right of veto by \nsome of its permanent members each time the situation in South Africa \ndemands recourse to Chapter VII of the Charter.\nThe Security Council's inaction in the matter strengthens Pretoria in \nits policy of oppression against the black population and in its \naggressiveness against neighbouring countries. It is clear that the \napartheid regime could not daily defy the injunctions of the \ninternational community calling for an end to its policy of apartheid \nwithout the political, military, economic and financial support of \nits allies.\nFaced with the gravity of the situation in South Africa, the struggle \nof the national liberation movements finds itself doubly legitimized \nby the nobility of their cause and the extent of their sacrifices. We \ntoday reaffirm our Government's constant support for them.\nA/37/PV.33\nA situation which is just as anachronistic prevails in Namibia: the \nracist and colonialist regime in Pretoria has become enriched in an \nillegal occupation by depriving the Namibian people of their right to \ndetermine their own destiny. Each passing year unfortunately adds to \nthe long list of missed appointments and postponed deadlines for the \nindependence of Namibia.\nWhen the International Court of Justice decided that South Africa's \noccupation of Namibia was illegal, and when in its turn the \ninternational community recognized the struggle of the people of that \nTerritory, the dimensions of the Namibian question became clear. It \nwas purely and simply a problem of decolonization. It was therefore \nincumbent upon the United Nations, as in similar cases, to do what it \ncould to enable the inhabitants of the Territory to exercise their \ninalienable right to self-determination and independence. The United \nNations has exercised that right consistently and constantly. It will \nnot agree to the Namibian question so being distorted as to become a \nconflict on grounds and for reasons completely alien to the interests \nof the Namibian people.\nAllow me, therefore, to repeat my Government's consistent position on \nthe Namibian question. We continue to believe that it is indeed a \nquestion of decolonization, falling completely and solely under the \nresponsibility of the United Nations. The decolonization planned for \nNamibia, as endorsed in Security Council resolution 435 (1978), must \nbe carried out fully. To that end, we urgently appeal to the five \nWestern States, members of the contact group, to do everything in \ntheir power to persuade Pretoria to stop its specious dilatory \ntactics aimed at delaying implementation of the United Nations plan \nfor the decolonization of Namibia.\nWe also reject all parallelism intended to link South Africa's \nwithdrawal from Namibia to that of the Cuban forces from Angola. Our \nview on this is based on our conviction that such linkage not only \nconfuses two fundamentally different questions but also entails \ninvolvement in Angola's internal affairs. Indeed, we think it is for \nAngola alone to adopt, in complete sovereignty, the measures it deems \nmost appropriate to ensure its own security as long as it considers \nthat security to be threatened.\nWe further believe that Decree No. 1 for the Protection of the \nNatural Resources of Namibia,' enacted by the United Nations Council \nfor Namibia, must be strictly observed. We therefore ask those who \nare either directly or covertly involved in the exploitation of \nNamibian resources, regardless of their nature or origin, to cease \ntheir scandalous pillaging. We repeat our firm and constant support \nfor the South West Africa People's Organization, the sole legitimate \nrepresentative of the Namibian people.\nMoreover, we hereby reiterate Burundi's solidarity and support for \nthe front-line States, in particular our brothers, the peoples of \nAngola and Mozambique, who are the targets and the victims of acts of \naggression and sabotage by the\tregime.,\nThe question of the Western Sahara remains a burning issue, to the \nextent that no step seems to have been taken since the adoption by \nthe Assembly of its resolution 36/46. None the less we keep our faith \nin the capacity of the Organization of African Unity to resolve, in \ncollaboration with the United Nations, the problem of Western Sahara, \nwhile respecting the right of the Sahraoui people to \nself-determination and independence.\nThe unparalleled frequency with which the United Nations considered \nthe question of Palestine this year is a clear demonstration of the \nserious concern with which the United Nations views Israel's \nunacceptable policy of illegal occupation of Arab territories and its \ncontinued aggression against its neighbours. The Israeli invasion of \nLebanon, causing death and destruction, the recent massacres of \nPalestinian refugees in the Shatila and Sabra camps in west Beirut \nhave, alas, only confirmed the concerns expressed for almost three \ndecades now. Those sinister events were added to the sufferings of a \npeople already dispersed, a people whom Israel refuses not only the \nright to a homeland but even the right to an identity. The General \nAssembly has often asked Israel to withdraw completely and \nunconditionally from all Palestinian and other Arab territories \noccupied since 1967, including Jerusalem. Israel has responded by \nannexing the Golan Heights, by imposing its own civilian \nadministration on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and establishing \nsettlements, and, finally, by the invasion of Lebanon and the savage \nbombardment of Beirut.\nIt is not through violence, or the violation of United Nations \nresolutions that Israel will ensure its own security. On the contrary \nits security will be safeguarded and strengthened only when it \nrecognizes the Palestinian people's right to existence, \nself-determination and a homeland in its own territory, in keeping \nwith the relevant decisions of the United Nations.\nToday we renew the support of the Government of Burundi for the \nPalestinian people and the Palestine Liberation Organization its sole \nand unique legitimate representative.\nOur conception of international relations follows a constant \nprinciple which rejects colonialism, racism, domination, aggression \nand the acquisition of territories by force. We have always held that \nit is up to each people, to each country, regardless of its size and \neconomic potential, to define its own policies in complete \nsovereignty, free from any foreign interference and according to the \npriorities which those peoples and countries have chosen for \nthemselves.\nThe solution of the current disputes in Central America, South-East \nAsia, Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Cyprus and elsewhere, must be guided, \nin our view, by the principles I have indicated. They demand a \npolitical solution. Recourse to force in international relations \ndeprives the peoples involved of their right to choose the political \nsystem which best responds to their aspirations.\nAnother deplorable situation is also of concern to the delegation of \nBurundi. I refer to the conflict between Iraq and the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran. In spite of the mediation efforts made by \nrepresentatives of the non-aligned countries-to whom we pay a \ntribute-the war between those two countries continues. Burundi \nurgently appeals to the two belligerents to heed the voice of reason \nand bring the destruction to an end in order to promote true peace.\nThe Government of Burundi has already expressed its views on the \nKorean question. That question, too, demands apolitical solution. The \nwithdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea is a prerequisite which \nwould establish a climate of confidence conducive to negotiations \nbetween the two parties. We, for our part, will continue to support \nany effort aimed at achieving the peaceful reunification of the two \nKoreas.\nFour months ago we met in this very Hall to talk about disarmament. \nThat debate, which began four years earlier, was necessary to the \nextent that it was becoming more and more apparent that the arms race \nwas threatening to establish nuclear terror and to sow insecurity in \nthe minds of nations. Is it not paradoxical, to say the least, that, \nat a time when a large part of mankind is bogged down in the most \nabsolute poverty and people are dying by the thousands of sickness \nand hunger, the human and material resources that ought to have \nserved to feed those people, to care for them and to educate them \nshould be absorbed in the suicidal undertaking of the unbridled arms \nrace?\nOne of the tasks of the General Assembly at the twelfth special \nsession and the second special session devoted to disarmament was to \nstart considering seriously again the devotion of our collective \nefforts to limiting the arms race. At that session the Assembly was \nto have considered ways and means of beginning to implement the \nProgramme of Action contained in the Final Document of the Tenth \nSpecial Session of the General Assembly. So it is not at all \nnecessary to reformulate the principles and priorities that were \nagreed upon in 1978, much less to question them. It is time for the \nnuclear Powers to engage in a frank and constructive dialogue on the \nreduction of the nuclear weapons in their respective arsenals. This \nis a question of the security and, indeed, the survival of the \nplanet. We also think it would be sterile for the super-Powers to \nlimit themselves to a debate in which each one would absolve itself \nfrom guilt in the eyes of the world public by attributing all the \nblame to the other.\nThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea finished \nits work on 30 Apr' of this year by adopting the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea. The participants in that Conference \nsucceeded after nine years of hard work and sustained efforts in \nreconciling positions and interests which at the outset were claimed \nto be irreconcilable. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law \nof the Sea will go down in the annals of history not only because of \nthe complexity of the matters which it had to codify, the divergence \nof the interests involved or the time it lasted, but also and above \nall because it will prove to future generations that with a minimum \nof political will and good faith nations can, while respecting the \nessential interests of all concerned, solve the problems they face So \nthe benefit of the international community as a whole, regardless of \nthe scope and acuteness of those problems.\nThe results of that Conference will prove, furthermore, that the \nUnited Nations remains the best framework for the North-South \ndialogue. Similarly, we believe in the viability and possible outcome \nof the global negotiations. It is our hope that those that for one \nreason or another were unable last April to agree to the adoption of \nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea will realize the advantages \noffered to them by that Convention and rejoin the rest of the \ninternational community so that together we can make the concept of \nthe resources of the sea-bed and ocean floor as the common heritage \nof mankind a reality of the future. In parallel with the \ninternational political situation which I have just described, a \nworld economy is developing in a way that is of no less concern, in \nparticular with regard to the developing countries. Unemployment, \nrecession, inflation, the colossal debt of the developing countries, \nthe disruption of the economies of the least developed countries, the \nreduction of official development assistance, the return to \nprotectionism, the problems with United Nations funds which \nchannelled the fruits of international solidarity to the least \ndeveloped countries, the precipitous fall in raw material prices, \nwhich constitute the essential source of revenue for the developing \ncountries-this is the not very comforting picture of the world \neconomy. That picture is especially painful because it seems to \ncombine with the present economic malaise actions which are even more \ndisruptive and ineffective and which, if continued, would merely \nstrengthen the current state of affairs. Whereas the present economic \ndisorder affects international relations and requires a global \napproach, some persons seem to be proposing as remedies for the \nsituation the return to selfish national interests and the \nstrengthening of international financial and monetary mechanisms, the \ninability of which to meet the global needs of the international \ncommunity has become clear. The role of the United Nations in the \nformulation of this global approach to the solution of the economic \nproblems of our time is a primary one, although some seem to wish, \nfor various reasons, to block its efforts in this matter. None the \nless, the Member States, by unanimously adopting General Assembly \nresolution 34/138, committed themselves to global negotiations in \norder to establish a new international economic order. The global \nnegotiations have not been begun precisely because there is a \nsuspicion that they would in the long run challenge the lack of \nequality in international economic relations. But the opposition to \nthose negotiations cannot continue indefinitely because the present \nstate of the world economy makes the launching and conclusion of the \nglobal negotiations an overriding necessity. It is equally clear that \nthe settlement of the present economic crisis demands more determined \nsolidarity on the part of the international community. Recent events \nhave shown that the bankruptcy of the developing countries, whatever \nthe level of their development, could, if we do not act in time, lead \nto the bankruptcy of the international economic and financial system. \nThe time is past when some thought they could build their wealth on \nthe growing impoverishment of others. The economic interdependence of \nnations is now a reality.\nThe economic crisis affects the whole world. Nevertheless, there is a \ncategory of countries for which the present crisis is most bitter. I \nrefer to the least developed countries. Whereas in the developed \ncountries the crisis affects the customary well-being of the \npopulation, in the least developed countries it involves the loss of \nthe essential minimum. In the former countries the crisis makes life \nless comfortable; in the latter it makes life simply impossible. We \nare particularly disturbed by the trend towards the reduction of \nofficial development assistance and the problems concerning the funds \nof United Nations bodies, such as UNDP, in which the least developed \ncountries have placed such great hopes for a better future. Voluntary \ncontributions to UNDP funds have made it a vital and effective \ninstrument for development in the developing countries and the \nsuspension of such contributions would block the development of the \neconomies of the least developed countries. The wealthy countries \nmust not allow themselves to become indifferent to the desperate \nsituation of the least developed countries. It was envisaged that in \nthe Third United Nations Development Decade special efforts would be \nmade to enable the least developed countries finally to escape from \ntheir past and present stagnation and future prospects.\nThe United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held \nin Paris in 1981, laid the foundations for the co-ordination of \ninternational assistance to the least privileged countries. And so \ntoday we launch an appeal to the entire international community to \nensure that the spirit of solidarity and generosity that inspired the \nSubstantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least \nDeveloped Countries adopted at the end of the Paris Conference is \nfinally given practical effect.\nThe economic difficulties faced today by the developing countries \nhave prompted them to explore new methods of co-operation which can \nbest take account of their own limitations and also enable them the \nspeed up their own economic growth and improve position in the system \nof international economic relations. It is to this concern that the \nProgrammes of Action of Amsha, Mexico, Buenos Aires and Caracas \nrespond with a view to establishing a system of collective autonomy. \nThe Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia \nStrategy for the Economic Development of Africa which was adopted at \nthe second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State \nand Government of the CAU also responded to that necessity.\nIt is through strengthening the regional and sub- regional economic \ngroupings that we will achieve the collective autonomy envisaged in \nthe different programmes of action mentioned. It is to this end that, \nin collaboration with our partners, we intend to strengthen the \nvarious types of co-operation whit the sub- regional and regional \ngroupings, of which Burundi is a part.\nThe analysis of the international political and economic situation \nwhich I have just presented to the Assembly is based on the \nprinciples which guideour foreign policy, namely, international \nco-operation with reciprocal respect among partners, non-interference \nin the internal affairs of other States, good neighbourliness, \npositive non-alignment and support for national liberation movements.\nSometimes justified criticisms of the United Nations have been made. \nBut these present shortcomings should not make us lose our faith and \nbe discouraged. International peace and security, whose guarantor the \nOrganization is, demand that we concentrate our efforts on \nstrengthening the United Nations through a progressive adaptation to \nthe realities and requirements of our time. As the Secretary-General \naptly pointed out in his report on the work of the Organization: \\\"The \nwill to use the machinery of the Charter needs to be consciously \nstrengthened, and all Governments must try to look beyond short-term \nnational interests to the great possibilities of a more stable system \nof collective international security, as well as to the very great \nperils of failing to develop such a system.\\\" My delegation's view is \nthat this analysis is relevant. The dearest wish of the people and \nthe Government of Burundi is to see the progressive establishment in \ninternational relations of a new world order where there is peace and \njustice, collective economic security, and co-operation with due \nrespect for the right of nations to determine their own future and to \nchoose freely their path of development in keeping with the \naspirations of their peoples. May the United Nations be the cradle \nwhere this hope is nurtured.\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me, Sir, on behalf of the French \ndelega\u00action to congratulate you, Sir, on your \nelection to the presidency of the Assembly. Your \nexperience of international life acquired in the \nhigh offices you have held together with your \nthorough knowledge of the United Nations are \nassuredly a guarantee that the work of the \nAssembly will be conducted with all the necessary \nauthority and efficiency.\n80.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to \nthe Secre\u00actary-General. I had the pleasure of \nwelcoming him recently in France and I have \nexcellent memories of that first meeting. I found \nin it confirmation of the qualities which he has \nconstantly demonstrated in the exercise of his \nfunctions. The French delegation would like to \nexpress its gratitude to him for the dedication \nhe has shown in carrying out his duties in the \npast 10 months. Our gratitude naturally extends \nto all the members of the Secretariat, with whose \nwork we are familiar and whose competence we \nappreciate.\n81.\tThe presence of the Prime Minister of \nFrance in the Assembly is, I know, unusual. I am \nthe first French head of Government to come to \nthis rostrum since the founding of the Fifth \nFrench Republic in 1958. By this gesture we \nwanted first of all to demon\u00acstrate the \nimportance which the President of the French \nRepublic attaches to the Organization.\n82.\tFor more than a century the body of ideas \nof which we are the heirs has been concerned with \npromoting internationalism as one of the forms of \nsolidarity. For us, this solidarity must be both \nan ethic and a principle of action. Just as in \nFrance we are offering companies and workers \n\\\"contracts of solidarity\\\" to fight unemployment, \nso the international community could turn to \n\\\"contracts of solidarity\\\" among countries to \nfight underdevelopment.\n83.\tThe head of the Government of France is \npresent today at this rostrum precisely to \nemphasize the imperative need for solidarity, \nwhich we believe is the best way to achieve \npeace. France wishes in this way to demonstrate \nits confidence in the United Nations and in the \ncapacity of the Organization to revert to its \noriginal mission, namely, the maintenance of \npeace. The Assembly is in effect the only one in \nwhich all States meet on an equal footing. I \nshould like at once to stress this conviction, at \na time when France, in response to an emergency \nsituation, is contributing actively to a \nmultinational force requested by the Security \nCouncil but not constituted according to our \ncustomary procedures, which, unfortunately, are \ntoo slow.\n84.\tI should like to describe to the Assembly \nthe state of the world as I see it today and to \nanalyze the causes of our present difficulties. \nThen, in the second part of my address, I will \noutline the responses that France proposes.\n85.\tWhat, then, is the present state of the \nworld? Wherever we look we see nothing but \ndisorder and confusion. Since the creation of the \nOrganization blood has been spilled in some 120 \nconflicts on this planet, and in the past two \nyears we have seen the dangers grow and multiply. \nNo continent has been spared. Localized \nconflicts, declared or potential, are increasing \nand represent a permanent threat to regional \nbalances. Old conflicts are being perpetuated. \nStates are invaded; others are tom apart.\n86.\tThis year the absurd war in the South \nAtlantic was added to the list. This showed once \nagain in striking fashion that the use of force \nis never a per\u00acmanent solution to a quarrel.\n87.\tIn the Middle East also, the world has \nhad to recognize once again the futility of \nmilitary operations. Only death and suffering \nprofit by it while the basic issue remains \nunaffected. A people is still condemned to a life \nof wandering. And once the wheels of the military \nmachine were set in motion this led to the \nhideous massacres of civilians which the \ninternational community has been unanimous in \ncondemning.\n88.\tIn Eastern Europe, in a Poland occupied \nby its own army t we see a courageous people \nprevented from choosing the paths of liberty.\n89.\tIn Central America conflicts are becoming \nmore widespread and redoubling in intensity. How \ncould it be otherwise when peoples are denied the \nelementary right to shape their own futures?\n90.\tThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nrecognizes the right to rise up against \noppression.I was myself nurtured in this noble \ntradition and would be the last to forget it.\n91.\tSuch events are all factors making for imbalance and insecurity.\n92.\tAt the same time, the economic crisis is \nassuming planetary proportions. The length of \ntime it has lasted has become a new factor for \ndisarray which tends to increase its ravages. One \nafter another, countries, even stable and \ndeveloped countries, have found themselves in \nfinancial straits.\n93.\tFor 18 months now the recession has hit \nthe industrialized countries hard. Production is \nstagnant or is falling back; unemployment is \nrapidly increasing, at times achieving levels \ncomparable to those during the Great Depression \nof 1929.1 make that point with particular \nseriousness because in this context France, \ntogether with Japan, is the country which has \nbeen able to maintain a positive rate of growth.\n94.\tCertain precarious balances which had \nbeen main\u00actained hitherto are beginning to \ncrumble; one after another industries are going \nbankrupt; budgetary and trade deficits are \nincreasing. The development of the third world \nhas now been halted. Per capita income in many \ncountries is perceptibly diminishing. The least \nadvanced countries are suffering particularly \nfrom a reduction in public aid programmes for \ndevelopment. The problems of hunger today are \neven more dis\u00actressing than they were a decade \nago. How many coun\u00actries are at the mercy of a \nclimatic or financial accident which might \nthreaten their very existence?\n95.\tAll these disorders have the effect of \nincreasing even further the inequalities between \nthe industrialized States and the majority of the \nothers. I would add that in many countries the \ncrisis is widening the gap between different \nsocial categories, between those which have some \nreserves in order to face up to the hardships of \nthe times and those which do not possess those \nreserves.\n96.\tWe are thus witnessing a world decline \nwhich is promoting self-centeredness and mounting \nviolence, of which terrorism is one of the most \ndespicable manifestations. Every possible pretext \nhas been used to justify this violence: security, \nideologies and sometimes simply vengeance. The \nrights of States and of peoples have too often \nbeen flouted for this reason. France sees in that \nsome disturbing signs of mankind slipping \nbackwards towards a situation where might \nprevails over right.\n97.\tThat then is the state of the world. For \nFrance, current difficulties derive essentially \nfrom three factors: the interplay of the two \ngreat Powers; the rise of national \nself-centeredness; and over- armament.\n98.\tLet us talk now of the first factor, the \ninterplay! of the two great Powers. For years now \nthe world has lived with the illusion that \npeace-loving coexistence between two great Powers \nserved to reduce sources of tension. This \nillusion has now been dispelled.\n99.\tThe progress of education, particularly \nover the last 20 years, developments in science \nand technology which they promoted, have \nstimulated the aspirations of men to freedom and \njustice and the aspirations of peoples to \nnational identity and of nations to \ninde\u00acpendence. The Organization is the living \nexpression of that, because I would point out \nthat the number of its Members has tripled in 20 \nyears. It is that diversity, that vast planetary \nchange, that teeming burgeoning of life, to which \nthe two great Powers have not been able to \nrespond. They have striven to perpetuate a \nwide\u00acspread policy of blocs which is no longer in \nkeeping with the state of the world today.\n100.\tThis persistent temptation to defend or \nexpand their spheres of influence, to deal with \nworld problems through the distorting prism of \ntheir own interests, and to transform into \nEast-West confrontation internal tension in \nStates or disputes between neighbouring \ncountries, has been a constant factor for \ndestabilization. Innumerable pressures of all \nsorts, from military maneuvers to financialpenalties, \nhave been brought into play against peoples who \nwant to have their independence respected. Third \nworld countries are the very first to suffer from \nthis rivalry, but the industrialized nations are \nnevertheless not free from its consequences, even \nif it takes a different form in the East and West.\n101.\tIn the West, one of the great Powers has \nbeen using, for the benefit of its national \ninterests, the dislocation of the international \nmonetary system. It has been laying down its \nbudgetary and monetary policy without concerning \nitself about the conse\u00acquences which may result \nfor other countries.\n102.\tIn the East, the other great Power has \nbeen continuing to employ, directly or \nindirectly, military force to thwart the wish of \nthe peoples of the world to be masters of their \nown destiny.\n103.\tThis blindness on the part of the two \ngreat Powers is without any doubt one of the \nmajor causes of the disorders troubling the world \ntoday. I say that as I think of the great \nAmerican and Soviet peoples with which the French \nfor centuries have maintained ties of friendship. \nI say that because France is a member of an \nalliance to which it intends to remain loyal.\n104.\tFaithful to its commitments, France \nnever\u00actheless desires the gradual disappearance \nof military blocs. It wants entirely free \ncountries to express their initiatives freely.\n105.\tThere exist, it is true, other forms of \ndomination, sometimes crude censorship which \nstrives to crush the powers of creation. There \nare also modem tech\u00acnologies\u2014which, together with \neconomic power, make it possible to control the \nhuman mind. Let us beware of that. Reactions can \nit fact be extremely violent when one offends the \nculture of peoples at their deepest roots, and \nwhen one does violence to their conscience.\n106.\tThe second factor explaining the \ndifficulties through which the world is going is \nthe rise of national self-centeredness. Since \ninternational economic rela\u00actions can and will be \nadapted to the law of \\\"might is right\\\", it is \ninevitable that we should be witnessing a return \nof policies which are more or less \nprotec\u00actionist. I urge those who deplore this in \ndefense of the rules of the market-place to be \ngood enough to consider that they have in fact \ncontributed to the destruction of these \nregulating mechanisms by imposing the law of the \njungle.\n!09. This rise in national self-centeredness has \nbecome an additional curb on international trade \nand has thus contributed to prolonging and \nfueling the crisis. Furthermore, and this is even \nmore serious, it under\u00acmines regional groupings \nwhich have been functioning for two or three \ndecades now. The process of integra\u00action of the \nEuropean Community has thus been halted, and the \nsame is true of the Americas and Asia.\n! 10. Behind the facade of international \nmeetings, and a co-operation which has never in \nhistory been so widely developed as today, the \nCommunity which we make up seems in fact to be \nbreaking up, to be fragmented, and gradually to \nbe falling back on each of its national entities.\n111.\tIt would be particularly serious if, on \nthe pre\u00actext of an economic crisis, the \nindustrialized countries were to oppose the \nemergence of new industrial centers in the third \nworld countries. They must adapt to this new \nreality, even at the cost of sometimes painful \nconversions.\n112.\tHowever, this industrialization of the \nthird world cannot be limited to forms of dumping \nbased on uncontrolled exploitation of cheap \nlabour. It cannot be considered simply in terms \nof the profit accruing to multinational \ncorporations which take advantage of the disorder \nin the world to impose their own laws. The \ninevitable mutation must be controlled.\n113.\tThe future of the world will be based \nlargely on the independence of our economies. Yet \nthe increasing number of divergences grows in \nproportion to the increasing articulation of \npolicies arising solely from national interest. \nThus multilateral institutions, the privileged \ninstruments of international co\u00acoperation, no \nlonger seem sufficient to enable us to overcome \ntoday's crises.\n114.\tThe third factor which explains the disarray \nin the world today is over-armament. All States \nhave a right to security and an independent \nsystem of defense. This is in fact the policy \nthat France applies for itself. Still, we are \nconvinced that the build-up of arms is a serious \nsource of danger to peace and security in the \nworld. The General Assembly itself, meeting in \nspecial session a few weeks ago to consider \npossibilities of disarmament, made the \ndistressing observation that more than ever \nbefore in history the arms race is proceeding at \na frantic pace.\n115.\tThis situation stems from the two factors \nthat I have just analyzed: the action of the \nsuper-Powers and self-centeredness on the part of \nnations. The ten\u00acsion to which these factors give \nrise is only worsening in a world where the rule \nis determined by power relationships. Our States \nhave a duty to respond to the questions and \nsometimes the anxieties which result from this \namong peoples and which are reflected, for \nexample in Europe, by the development of a \ncurrent of pacificism. Our States have a duty to \nshow that a path to genuine arms reduction can be \nopened. This is the urgent obligation incumbent \non our Govern\u00acments today, particularly on those \nwhich alone possess the bulk of the world's \nmilitary arsenal.\n116.\tNow, in face of the great Powers' nuclear \nover- armament, the build-up of conventional \nforces in Europe and the arms race raging in the \nthird world, negotiations are not advancing. \nBefore we can turn to serious talk of the general \nand verifiable disarmament that is our goal, we \nmust first challenge the over- armament.\n117.\tFrance is disturbed to find a growing \nimbalance between the requirements of peace and \ndevelopment, on the one hand, and the policies \nactually being pursued in the world, on the other.\n118.\tIf I have felt it necessary to make this \nassessment and to give our analyses of the \nsituation on behalf of France, it is not in order \nto give in to any sort of pessimism or to throw \nup my arms at the enormousness of the task before \nus. We can overcome the crisis, but we must have \nthe will to do so and not allow ourselves to be \ntaken in by delusions. The world must get back on \nthe road to growth and peace.\n119.\tFirst of all, the search for peace. \nFrance speaks and acts on a basis that is clear \nand unchanging: one method, negotiation; one \ngoal, political solutions in respect for the \nrights of peoples.\n120.\tThis was already the sense of the Franco- \nMexican Declaration\\\" with regard to El Salvador. \nIt called for mutual recognition on the part of \nthe adversaries.\n121.\tThis political approach on France's part \napplies to all crises in which one or the other \nof the two great Powers is directly involved.\n122.\tIn the case of Afghanistan, France \nreaffirms its support for any political solution \nleading to the with-drawal of the foreign forces; \nit calls for respect for the right to \nself-determination on the part of the Afghan \npeople and the guarantee of the non-alignment or \neven the neutrality of that country.\n123.\tIn Poland we fervently desire an end to \nthe state of siege and the liberation of the \ninternees\u2014neces\u00acsary conditions for the \nresumption of a genuine dialogue between the \nsegments of Polish society.\n124.\tIn Central America the principles France \nexpresses are as follows: political settlement of \ninter\u00acnal or external conflicts; regional \nguarantees of security and non-interference; \nabsolute respect for the sovereignty of States, \nwhich means the right of peoples freely to \ndetermine the forms of their eco\u00acnomic and social \ndevelopments\n125.\tThis approach is also the basis for our \npro\u00acposals in two regional conflicts that are of \ncourse of long standing, but the fact that they \nstill persist is particularly alarming.\n126.\tI refer first of all to the question of \nNamibia. The contact group has proposed a plan of \naction that has enabled considerable progress to \nbe made con\u00accerning constitutional principles and \nthe transition period. Currently, negotiations \nare stalled precisely because certain conditions \nare inconsistent with the general principles we. \nUphold and because they fall solely withinthe \nambit of Angolan sovereignty. France for its part \nwill continue to support the three-, stage plan \nwhile at the same time condemning any strategy \nthat would destabilize the region and refusing to \nestablish any link with external considerations.\n127.\tMy second example concerns the Middle \nEast. I believe that the tragic events of recent \ndays have clearly demonstrated that the positions \nFrance has supported since the beginning of \nhostilities are sound.\nHow much time would have been gained and now many \nlives spared if our voice had been heeded.\n128.\tI would, to refresh the memory of the \nmembers of the Assembly, just recall the \nprinciples so often set forth in this very Hall \nby France's representatives, and in particular by \nour Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Cheysson, \nnamely, security for Israel and for all the Arab \nStates in the region, on the one hand, and the \nright to self-determination for the Palestinian \npeople, on the other. Moreover, any settlement \nquite obviously presupposes the mutual \nrecognition of the States and political forces in \nthe region.\n129.\tFrance has done every g possible to halt \nthe hostilities and to prevent the tragedy. As \nfar back as 28 July, in agreement with Egypt, we \nsubmitted to the Security Council a draft \nresolution. We hoped for and proposed the \nintervention of United Nations forces. In the \npast few days, we have once again assumed our \nresponsibilities.\n130.\tWe note that many States, among them some \nof the most important, have agreed with our \nanalysis of the situation. We also note that the \nTwelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez expressed a \nview we believe to be positive.\n131.\tIn the case of Lebanon, the invasion of \nwhich was condemned by France, we will continue \nto work to see Lebanon's sovereignty, unity and \nterritorial integrity restored and respected.\n132.\tI should also like to say a word about \ndisarma\u00acment. Our position is based on two simple \nideas which, I believe, have the merit of \nrealism: a balance of forces and verifiable \nmonitoring of the reduction of arms stockpiles. \nThis is the basis upon which we approve the \ncurrent negotiations and on which we favour \ncompletion of regional security agreements and \narms limitation agreements.\n133.\tBut the return to a peaceful climate is \npossible only if, at the same time, we give \nourselves the means to overcome the economic \ncrisis. What is this crisis, in fact? It is not \nan unforeseeable natural catastrophe that has \nsuddenly descended on us. It is only that our \nsystem of economic relations and production has \ngone wrong. It is a period of change between two \nstages of the world, between two technological \nphases. That change, if not controlled, may take \nplace in the worst possible conditions, even \ngenerating armed conflicts. If it is controlled, \nhowever, that is to say if it is intellectually \ncontrolled, it may very well provide the \nopportunity for decisive progress for the \ncommunity of nations.\n134.\tWe should first of all reject false \nsolutions which, on the pretext of rigour or \nrealism, call for adjustments at the lowest level \nof production, that is, adjustments that prolong \nthe crisis. This would truly mean giving up.\n135.\tThe new conditions in the world economy \ncall for a considerable effort of adjustment \nwithin each economy. France in no way challenges \nthe need for this and has committed itself with \ndetermination to this course. These actions must \nbe pursued within a context that is particularly \ndifficult for all. I would note that the \ncountries of the third world have obtained \nsignificant results in this respect. But we must \navoid a generalization of restrictive policies \nthat would com\u00acpromise the benefits to be \nobtained from each country internally. And we \nmust see that such policies do not draw them all \ninto a deflationary spiral.\n136.\tEconomically there exists among us today \na profound solidarity. Whether we like it or not, \nno one is spared the effects of the daily \neconomic decisions of the international \ncommunity, and our own deci\u00acsions, in turn, cross \nfrontiers. New economic policies largely based on \na monetarist credo and on a lessening of \ngovernment influence, promise both long-lasting \ncontrol of inflation and the rapid resumption of \nsound growth. Everyone today is aware of the \nlimitations of these policies which have led to \nmassive budgetary deficits, the maintenance of \nexcessive real interest rates and persisting \nstagnation. The absence of inter\u00acvention in \nfinancial markets explains the persistence of \nerratic variations in rates of exchange.\n137.\tFrance, with several of its partners, has \nemphat\u00acically criticized these policies for their \nserious conse-quences for the world economy, \nparticularly the economies of the developing \ncountries.\n138.\tThe fragile foundations upon which we \nhave built our economies are beginning to give \nway. In order to halt the process, it is \nindispensable that action on the domestic front \nbe coupled with active explora\u00action on the \ninternational front of ways of promoting a \ngeneral return to growth and prosperity. Each of \nus should contribute to the attainment of these \ngoals according to his means. This is the tenor \nof the reso\u00aclution adopted at the Versailles \nEconomic Summit by the seven most highly \nindustrialized countries, which were meeting on \nthe invitation of President Mitterrand.\n139.\tIf we are to succeed in this, we must \nreaffirm our solidarity and use all the resources \navailable to us. The progress of technology and \nthe satisfaction of the needs of the most \ndisadvantaged among the world population, \nconstitute an enormous potential, the \nmobilization of which could give new momentum to \nthe world economy. Recession is not inevitable; \nit can be overcome by collective, clear-sighted, \nintegrated action.\n140.\tThis is the proper perspective in which \nto see North-South relations. The growth of \nNorth-South interdependence has so far been \nuncontrolled. It has helped to extend and \naggravate the crisis. The time has come to \nestablish true collective management of this \ninterdependence of equal partners. The time has \ncome to make it the instrument of the return to \ngrowth and development for all. The time has come \nto work for true international economic \nsolidarity. This is basically what is at stake \ntoday in the North-South dialogue. This is the \nmeaning of the appeal made by the Presi\u00acdent of \nthe French Republic at Cancun in October 1981.\n141.\tHow can we fail in the circumstances not \nto be disappointed and concerned that these \ndiscussions are now deadlocked? The proposed \nglobal negotia\u00actions, so keenly sought by France \nare at a standstill. Yet the viewpoints differ \nlittle. I see an illustration of this in the \nimmediate results it was possible to achieve in \nToronto with regard to the specialized agencies. \nFrance attaches great importance <to this and \nwelcomes the resulting agreement on financing the \nInternational Development Association [IDA] in \n1984 and on the creation of a special fund.\n142.\tI am sure that with a little good will \nthe global negotiations could get under way very \nquickly. This would represent a decisive \nachievement for the thirty- seventh session of \nthe General Assembly. It is clear to us all that \nthe present circumstances make it neces\u00acsary that \nsteps be taken forthwith. You, Mr. Secretary- \nGeneral, spoke of these in your statement at the \n1st meeting of the Economic and Social Council in\n1982.\tWe must ensure sustained expansion of the \nworld economy in a climate of stable exchange \nrates and stable prices for raw materials and \nmanufactured products.\n143.\tWe must also try to reduce hunger in the \nworld and make it possible for countries which \nhave not yet done so to reach a threshold of food \nself-sufficiency.\n144.\tI lay particular stress on official \ndevelopment aid. This is undoubtedly the only \nhope for the poorest countries. Despite our \nserious budgetary constraints France is \ncontinuing its own efforts. From 1980 to 1982 the \namount devoted to official development aid has \nrisen from 0.36 to 0.48 per cent of the gross \nnational product and it will reach 0.52 per cent \nin\n1983.\tWe are speaking only of aid to \nindependent countries. Our goal is still to reach \n0.7 per cent in 1988. The least developed \ncountries will receive 0.15 per cent of our gross \nnational product with effect from 1985, in \naccordance with the commitment we entered into in \nSeptember last year at the United Nations \nConference on the Least Developed Coun\u00actries, \nheld in Paris.\n145.\tFrance hopes that most countries will \nundertake similar action and join France in its \nefforts to guaran\u00actee IDA resources in the period \nfrom 1985 to 1987.\n146.\tIn addition to financial and technical \nmeasures, in addition to the reinvigoration of \nthe activities of the organized international \ncommunity, France intends to work towards the \nconstruction of a world based on right, not \nmight. From this standpoint we advocate the right \nto difference, for we know that culture is not \nmonolithic. There are no hierarchical links \nbetween the Confucian, Christian and Hindu \nphilosophies. The universe is rich, above all, \nbecause of its diversity. Let us therefore \nrespect the struggles of those who want to \nachieve dignity and freedom, because peoples \nexist when they have a history, a culture, and a \nwillingness to live together. The international \ncom-munity must recognize their rights.\n147.\tWe are convinced that in affirming the \nright to difference we affirm the right to life \nand to develop\u00acment. Economic crises are all too \noften accompanied by a crisis of identity, a \ncultural crisis. This leads to resignation and a \nfatalistic surrender to destiny. It seems, \nunfortunately, that there exists a link between \nthe dulling of our intellectual capacities and \nthe worsening of the crisis. We must heed the \nforces of the spirit and of creativity. We must \npay a tribute to and help those who have within \nthem a strong determination to assert that we \nwill emerge from this situation. This is our sole \npurpose, in France, in giving absolute priority \nto research and culture. A society that does not \ncreate, that does not call upon the resources of \nthe will and the intellect, is a moribund society.\n148.\tThis conviction has also guided France's \ndeter\u00acmination to contribute to the promotion of \nindividual and collective human rights. In this \nFrance remains faithful to its vocation and its \nhistory. This means that our foremost concern is \nto respect the principles of national sovereignty \nand non-interference in internal affairs in \nrelations between States and that we must not \nlose sight of the fact that the Charter of the \nUnited Nations confers a universal character on \nhuman rights.\n149.\tThe Charter must remain the hope of the \noppressed. It recognizes the right if not the \nduty of the organized international community to \nconcern itself with the way in which each State \nacquits itself of its obligations towards its own \nnationals. In this spirit France has recently \nrecognized on the regional level the right of \nindividual recourse provided for in the European \nConvention on Human Rights. Similarly we have \njust recognized the right: laid down in arti\u00accle \n14 of the International Convention on the \nElimina\u00action of all Forms of Racial \nDiscrimination.\n150.\tBut we believe that in this field \nco-operation with the States concerned should be \nencouraged. In our view this alone justifies the \nlimitations which the universality of human \nrights imposes upon the principle of \nnon-interference.\n151.\tSimilarly this indispensable co-operation \nis the only guarantee for the States concerned \nthat interna-tional supervision, a peaceful and \nhumanitarian act, can never be conceived of as an \nunfriendly act. Full enjoyment of all human \nrights presupposes an eco\u00acnomic balance, which \nitself depends on a certain con\u00acception of \ndevelopment. It is in this spirit that within the \nUnited Nations France is taking an active part in \nthe preparation of a draft declaration on the \nright to development.\n152.\tWe welcome the increase in regional \nsuper\u00acvision. Europe, with the Commission and the \nCourt at Strasbourg, is no longer acting alone in \nthe regional protection of human rights, as is \nshown by the growing role played by the \nInter-American Commission on Human Rights on the \nAmerican continent. Similarly we should stress \nthe progress achieved in Africa with the \nproclamation of the African Charter of Human and \nPeople's Rights.\n153.\tThis development has, furthermore, made \nit possible to develop global protection of the \nright to self-determination by taking internal \nsituations into account, due consideration being \ngiven to the juridical identity of each \nparticular region.\n154.\tWe want to make this point categorically: \nthe freedom of a people\u2014even once it has become \ninde-pendent\u2014to decide on its own future with the \npar\u00acticipation of all is essential for the \nsafeguarding of human rights in the world.\n155.\tthe United Nations is not only the most \nim\u00acportant meeting place in the world of which \nthe As\u00acsembly is the living symbol; it is also a \nformidable instrument that has been considerably \nenriched since its foundation. The creation of an \nimpressive number of specialized agencies has \nmade it possible to work in all areas to achieve \nthe objectives set forth in the Preamble to the \nCharter. We must therefore make these instruments \neffective. It is a question of imagination and \nwill. I should like in this connection to thank \nthe Secretary- General for the remarkable report \nhe has presented to us. In breaking with a well \nestablished tradition, he has gone out of his way \nto focus attention on the capacity of the \nOrganization to maintain peace and to strengthen \nthe system of collective security which, \nunfortunately, we can only note has not been \nsuccess\u00acful. Mr. Secretary-General, you have made \nconcrete suggestions in this regard, and by and \nlarge we sub\u00acscribe to them. Your proposals are \nin fact very much in keeping with the constant \nconcerns of France.\n156.\tWe endorse your desire to make the \nOrganiza\u00action, and the Security Council in \nparticular, a forum for negotiations once again. \nWe favor a revision of United Nations practices \nand procedures, which you have recommended. Like \nyou we should like to see the Organization act \nmore rapidly and more effectively. To that end we \nare ready to contribute to the necessary \nstrengthening of peace-keeping opera\u00actions. In \nfact France has demonstrated this very point \ntoday in Lebanon.\n157.\tThe imperative need for solidarity calls \nalso for a massive consolidation of the \ninternational financial system. This can be \nachieved through the following means: a very \nsubstantial increase in the size and resources of \nthe International Monetary Fund [/MF] to enable \nit to assume its role of supporting countries \ncaught in the grip of financial difficulties and \nrecover its fundamental role of monitoring \nmonetary policies and rates of exchange; \nsystematic intervention by the Bank for \nInternational Settlements in the solution of \nfinancial crises; early implementation, within \nthe framework of UNCTAD, of the Common Fund for \nCommodities, accompanied by renewed efforts aimed \nat reaching commodity agreements together with \neffective mean for the stabilization of prices; \nestab-lishment of an energy affiliate of the \nWorld Bank or some other comparable system so as \nto have avail\u00acable an instrument appropriate to \nthe size of the energy investments the developing \ncountries will have to make in the course of the \ncoming decade.\n158.\tThere must be progress on all these \nsubjects in the various bodies where they are \nbeing discussed. It is essential to seize every \nopportunity for dialogue and meetings in order to \nrestore the proper signifi\u00accance to the \nmultilateral institutions existing in the \neconomic and political field and make them fully \nfunctional and useful.\n159.\tIt is imperative to promote the spirit of \ninterna\u00actional co-operation, which alone can \nenable us together to return to the path to \ndevelopment and prosperity and, ultimately, \npeace. This strengthening of international \ninstitutions thus calls for the drafting of a new \nand better balanced code of law. The work of \ncodification, which has been going on for more \nthan 30 years, has certainly shown progress. But \nwe must take into account the profound changes \nthat the international community has experienced \nas an organized entity. We must therefore forge \nnew instruments.\n160.\tThere is one specific area that \nillustrates this determination: the law of the \nsea. La^ April practically all the Members of the \nOrganization adopted a con\u00acvention. In spite of \nthe reservations it may have on certain of its \nprovisions, France voted in favor of that text. \nWe considered that it was in itself an \nillustration of the North-South dialogue, which \nwe advocate, and that it also constituted an \nimportant step towards an improvement of the \nworld system. That is why I very much hope that \nthe inadequacies and imperfections of the text \nwill be remedied, which will make possible larger \nadherence to the Convention. I should like to \nannounce today\u2014and I do so symbolically from this \nrostrum\u2014that France will sign the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea, because it does \nnot confine itself to coming here to make \nproposals. We also want to preach by example and \nto make our deeds fit our words.\n161.\tI am also in a position to inform the \ngeneral  Assembly that France has decided to \nendorse the principles contained in the 1975 \nDeclaration on the Protection of All Persons from \nBeing Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, \nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. \nToday I shall give official notification of this \nto the Secretary-General on behalf of the French \nGov\u00acernment.\n162.\tFinally I should like to add that France \nwill recognize the right of a State or an \nindividual to exercise, before the Human Rights \nCommittee, the right of recourse provided for in \narticle 41 and the Protocol of the International \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n163.\tBefore coming here to address the \nAssembly, I re-read the remarks made by Leon Blum \nin June 1936 in the League of Nations. Many of \nhis arguments are still relevant today; France \nstill means \\\"to declare publicly, and to attest \nto by its deeds, its loyalty to international \nlaw. For history is not made up only of conflicts \namong men. It is also shaped by their dreams and \ntheir Utopias. And what finer idea! is there than \nthe one we symbolize here: that of an \ninterna\u00actional society capable of abiding by a \ndiscipline to which it has freely consented? We \nare the image of what the world could be, and \nthat image can give hope to millions of people on \nthis planet. For our role has not changed. The \ntask is sti!! to put an end to what Victor Hugo \ncalled \\\"the world's great insomnia\\\". And, as Leon \nBlum added, \\\"Men want to be able to sleep again. \nThey want to rest their heads peacefully on their \npillows after a hard day's work. They place their \nhope in you. \\\"\n164.\tYes, the Organization must once again \nbecome synonymous with hope. We can do it if we \nwant to.\n"

I wish you \nevery success in guiding the deliberations of the general  Assembly \non the complex issues facing it in the year ahead. 1 should like to \ntake this opportunity of expressing our esteem and admiration for \nyour predecessor, Mr. Kittani, who presided over the thirty-sixth \nsession of the General Assembly with great distinction and success. I \nshould also like to convey our deep appreciation to Mr. Perez de \nCuellar for his dedicated and unremitting efforts in search of peace \nduring a year which has seen a succession of crises and continuing \nturmoil. We commend his resolve in the bleak international \ncircumstances of today, to strengthen the role and influence of the \nUnited Nations in the conduct of international relations.\n\n73.\tThe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the \nOrganization is an eloquent and candid comment on the grim reality of \nthe international situation, which he has succinctly described as \ninternational anarchy . in the recent past we have witnessed an \nalarming intensification of conflicts and tensions, use of force with \nimpunity, growing mistrust among nations, increasing confrontation in \nEast-West relations and a new escalation in the arms race, which in \nthis nuclear age portends the gravest consequences for the very \nsurvival of mankind. This spiral of violence is accompanied by a \ndeepening apathy regarding the principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations and an indifference regarding the role of this \ninstitution as the primary multilateral instrument for the \nmaintenance of international peace and security.\n\n74.\tThe gravity of the international scene demands a rededication \nto the ideals of the United Nations in the same spirit of commitment \nas ted to the foundation of this world forum after the agony and \nhorror of the Second World War. The strength of the United Nations, \nwhich is indispensable to world peace, is also a measure of our \ndetermination to achieve adjust and civilized world order and to \nprevent a universal holocaust.\n\n75.\tThe Middle East conflict remains the most serious crisis on \nthe international horizon and a glaring record of persistent \nviolations of international law and brazen defiance of the United \nNations by an intransigent and implacable aggressor.\n\n76.\tThe recent massacre of Palestinians in west Beirut epitomizes \nthe tragedy of the Palestinian nation. The shock and indignation felt \nthroughout the world over this massacre should serve as a reminder of \nthe continuing Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people, whose \nhomeland has been usurped and who have been subjected to relentless \npersecution. Since its occupation of the Arab and Palestinian \nterritories in 1967, Israel has been pursuing a systematic policy of \nannexing those territories by changing their demographic and historic \ncharacter, establishing settlements there and driving the Arab and \nPalestinian population into exile. In the process Israel is \ndetermined to liquidate the identity and nationhood of Palestinians \nin their ancient homeland.\n\n77.\tBeyond the occupied territories, Israel desires to establish \nits military diktat and hegemony in the region. It has attacked its \nneighbours at will and with impunity. The brutal invasion of Lebanon, \nthe cruel siege of Beirut and the events which led to the Israeli \nadvance into the city and the massacre of Palestinians fully expose \nIsraeli ambitions in the region. The crisis in Lebanon should make it \nclear to Israel's friends and allies that their support and \nprotection only encourage Israel to sustain its irredentist ambitions \non the pretext of strengthening its security.\n\n78.\tThe valour with which the Palestinian freedom fighters \nwithstood the ferocious Israeli attacks, and the sacrifices of the \nPalestinian people, bear testimony to the strength and justice of \ntheir cause, which cannot be trampled by terror and expansionism. The \nPalestine Liberation Organization [PLO] has emerged with renewed \nvigour as the voice for Palestinian freedom and has won international \nacclaim for its restraint.\n\n79.\tThe proposals endorsed by the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference \nat Fez  constitute a major initiative for a durable peace in the \nMiddle East and demonstrate the sincere desire of the Arab countries \nand the PLO to bring to a dignified and honourable end the chapter of \nconflict in the Middle East. Predictably, Israel has rejected the Fez \nplan, as well as the proposals by President Reagan, which illustrates \nIsrael's obsession with holding on to the occupied Arab and \nPalestinian territories and its negative response to opportunities \nfor peace.\n\n80.\tIn the immediate context, it is imperative that Israel's \nwithdrawal from Lebanon be secured, that civilian life be fully \nprotected and conditions of peace and normality be restored in that \nravaged country. The agony of the Palestinian people and the justice \nof its cause demand that the international community take determined \naction for the achievement of durable peace in the Middle East. Such \npeace depends on the imputable condition of Israel's withdrawal from \nthe Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967 and the \nrestitution of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian \npeople, including its right to a sovereign State in its homeland.\n\n81.\tIn our neighbourhood, the crisis in Afghanistan resulting \nfrom Soviet military intervention in that country nearly three years \nago persists, with no sign of reprieve in its severity. The Afghan \nnational resistance has proved to be enduring and steadfast, despite \nthe awesome military superiority and sophisticated modem equipment \ndeployed against it.\n\n82.\tThe presence of 100,000 foreign military troops in \nAfghanistan, with its dangerous portents forthe stability of the \nentire region, continues to evoke deep concern in the international \ncommunity, which has consistently pronounced itself on the illegality \nof that presence and has demanded its termination. The latest \nexpression of this international concern was embodied in general \nAssembly resolution 36/34, adopted last year with the overwhelming \nsupport of 116 Member States, which outlined, once again, the \nessential elements of a just political solution of the Afghanistan \nproblem, namely, the immediate withdrawal of the foreign troops from \nAfghanistan, the preservation of the sovereignty, territorial \nintegrity, political independence and non-aligned character of \nAfghanistan, the right of the Afghan people to determine its own form \nof government and to choose its economic, political and social system \nfree from outside intervention, subversion, coercion or constraint of \nany kind whatsoever, and the creation of necessary conditions which \nwould enable the Afghan refugees to return voluntarily to their homes \nin safety and honour.\n\n83.\tDespite the repeated calls of the United Nations and similar \ndemands by the movement of non-aligned countries and the member \nStates of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the end of the \ncrisis in Afghanistan is not in sight. It is a matter of regret that \nthe Soviet Union, which had traditionally enjoyed good relations with \ncountries of the area, including Afghanistan, and which takes pride \nin its solidarity with third-world causes, should engage and persist \nin an action which has caused immense tragedy to the people of \nAfghanistan and which has been firmly opposed by the international \ncommunity.\n\n84.\tThe grave political implications of the Afghanistan crisis \nare compounded by a vast and growing humanitarian problem in the \nexodus of the Afghan population on a massive scale from their \ncountry. Nearly 3 million Afghan refugees, who represent one fifth of \nthe total population of Afghanistan, have been forced to seek shelter \non our soil and have placed on us an enormous responsibility for \ntheir upkeep which we have willingly accepted as our humanitarian and \nIslamic duty.\n\n85.\tAs a country grievously affected by the crisis in its \nneighbourhood, Pakistan has a direct and vital stake in a peaceful \nsolution of the Afghanistan problem. Consistent with the decisions of \nthe United Nations, Pakistan has sincerely co-operated with every \ninternational endeavour, including the constructive efforts of the \nSecretary-General and his Personal Representative on Afghanistan. The \nGeneva discussions held in June under the good offices of the \nSecretary-General marked an important step in his efforts for a \npolitical settlement. We participated in those talks in a positive \nand constructive spirit and we look forward to further progress in \nthe process of consultations initiated by the Secretary-General and \nassure him of our continued co-operation.\n\n86.\tIt remains our ardent hope that the Afghanistan crisis will \nsoon be resolved in compliance with the decisions of the United \nNations with the aim of strengthening peace and security in the \nregion, white preserving respect for the independence, sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of each State.\n\n87.\tThe ramifications of the crisis in Afghanistan and the \ndisturbing security climate in our region have deepened our concern \nfor the defence of our frontiers. We are seriously endeavouring to \nturn those borders into frontiers of permanent peace. But we have no \ncontrol over developments in our neighbourhood and cannot turn our \neyes away from the imperative of maintaining an adequate defence \nestablishment commensurate with the size of the country and the \nextent of its international frontiers, which stretch across more than \n5,000 kilometres. The strengthening of Pakistan's defence capability \nshould not be a matter of concern to any other country-first, because \nany suggestion of such concern would have no relation to reality and, \nsecondly, because those who make us assume the privilege of passing \njudgement on vital matters falling exclusively within our sovereign \ndomain. We are tied to no bloc or strategic consensus, a/id our right \nto have a minimum defence capability of our own is an expression of \nour sovereign status as a non-aligned country.\n\n88.\tThe unfortunate conflict between the Islamic Republic of Iran \nand Iraq has been a source of deep anguish and concern for us. In \naddition to causing extensive human and material tosses, this was has \naggravated the climate of insecurity in a highly sensitive region, \nand its early termination remains in the best interests of the \npeoples of the area. With this conviction, the President of Pakistan \nhas made several efforts, singly and collectively, under the auspices \nof the Islamic Conference, and will continue to make every endeavour \nfor the solution of this tragic conflict.\n\n89.\tThe conclusion of our neighbourhood have made us keenly aware \nof the perils of great-Power rivalry and confrontation to which, in \nan historic sense, the Indian Ocean region has always remained \nexposed. Pakistan has consistency supported Sri Lanka's proposal for \nthe establishment of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, which \nsymbolizes the shared aspirations of the people of the region for \nprogress in conditions of peace and security. In the regional as well \nas international context, we will Co-operate with every initiative \naimed at securing the elimination of any foreign military presence in \nthe Indian Ocean region and the removal of threats, whether from \nwithin or from outside the area, to the independence, sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of the countries of the region.\n\n90.\tI am happy to note that seven countries of South Asia have \ninitiated concrete measures to promote regional co-operation aimed at \nthe well-being and progress of their peoples; Joint studies have been \nundertaken and action programmes have been worked out to promote \nco-operation in important economic sectors for mutual benefit. The \nrecently held meeting of the Foreign Secretaries of South Asian \ncountries in Islamabad was the third in a series of such meetings \nestablishing an auspicious tradition of co-operation and \nunderstanding among countries of South Asia which we are committed to \nstrengthen in the future.\n\n91.\tApart from being a geo-political imperative, good-neighbourly \nrelations between Pakistan and India are essential to the fulfilment \nof the aspirations and hopes of millions of people in the two \ncountries to live in peace and to ensure for themselves and for \nsucceeding generations a life of dignity, well-being and prosperity. \nIn this spirit, Pakistan sincerely desires full normalization of \nrelations with India which can be achieved with the resolution of the \nJammu and Kashmir dispute, the only outstanding problem between the \ntwo countries.\n\n92.\tThe Government of Pakistan has taken several Initiatives, \nincluding the offer of a non-aggression pact, to foster an atmosphere \nof trust and confidence. We are gratified that last January, the \nForeign Ministers of the two countries agreed that the conclusion of \nsuch a pact would make a positive contribution to peace and stability \nin the region. We also welcomed the suggestion of the Prime Minister \nof India for the establishment of a joint commission between the two \ncountries. Already an exchange of views on the substance of the \nproposals has been initiated which augurs well For the future of \nPakistan-India relations, on which the peace and tranquillity of the \nregion largely depend.\n\n93.\tPakistan has consistency maintained a firm position of \nprinciple on issues which concern the sovereignty and freedom of \nnations, whether these pertain to our region, or regions far beyond \nit. Accordingly, Pakistan supports the right of the people of \nKampuchea to shape their own future free from outside intervention \nand has joined the international call for the withdrawal of foreign \ntroops from that unfortunate and Pakistan welcomes the formation of a \ncoalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, headed by Prince \nSihanouk and hopes that this Government will facilitate the creation \nof conditions conducive to the full implementation of the decisions \nof the general  Assembly on the Kampuchean question.\n\n94.\tWe feel equally concerned over the dangerous situation in the \nSouth Atlantic and hope that a negotiated solution to the problem \nwill be found on the basis of the resolutions of the United Nations.\n\n93. The illegal occupation of Namibia and the abominable system \nperpetrated against the black population of South Africa continue to \nbe an affront to human morality and values. The hopes which had been \nraised for an early independence of Namibia by the adoption of \nSecurity Council resolution 433 (1978) proved short-lived. South \nAfrica, having first accepted the United Nations plan for free and \nfair elections in Namibia under the supervision and control of the \nOrganization, baulked at its implementation and even questioned the \nimpartiality of the United Nations. The authors of the United Nations \nplan, namely the members of the Western contact group, have a \nresponsibility to ensure the implementation of the plan as the \ncredibility of their commitment to this plan is at stake.\n\n96.\tPakistan joins the international community in its demand for \nthe realization of the independence of Namibia without further delay, \nand reaffirms its total solidarity with the struggle of the Namibian \npeople under the leadership of the South West Africa People's \nOrganization PO] to bring the dark chapter of colonialism in their \ncountry to a close.\n\n97.\tPakistan shares the dismay and disappointment of the \ninternational community at the failure of the second special session \non disarmament. It is clear that heightened international tensions \nprevented any progress on important disarmament issues, for which a \nmodicum of detente in East-West relations and improvement in the \nglobal political situation have become a prerequisite. However, the \nfailure of the special session should not lead to pessimism; nor \nshould it be seen as the defeat of an ideal. The cause of disarmament \nconcerns the very survival of mankind and must be pursued with a deep \ncommitment, a positive outlook and a sense of destiny.\n\n98.\tPakistan believes in a comprehensive approach to disarmament \nand emphasizes the need to pursue it at every level since these are \nall organically linked to each other. Progress in one direction could \nstimulate movement in the other. Consequently, we welcome \ninitiatives, at the bilateral, regional or global level, and \nmeasures, either interim in character or undertaken in a long-term \nperspective.\n\n99.\tThe prevention of a nuclear war is a primary challenge of our \nage and imposes a grave responsibility on all, especially the major \nnuclear Powers. We welcome the non-first-u ) declaration by the \nSoviet Union in the same manner as we had welcomed an earlier \ncommitment by China to the same effect. We are also encouraged by the \nresumption of negotiations between the United States and the Soviet \nUnion on the reduction of theatre and strategic nuclear forces and we \nhope that this dialogue produces meaningful results.\n\n100.\tWithout prejudice to the usefulness of unilateral or \nbilateral initiatives, we are convinced that the complex issues of \ndisarmament, especially nuclear disarmament, can best be addressed in \na multilateral context. The threat of nuclear weapons is pervasive \nand concerns equally every member of the international community. The \nUnited Nations, therefore, remains the most appropriate forum in \nwhich negotiations on disarmament could be effectively pursued.\n\n101.\tMotivated by its commitment to the objective of general  and \ncomplete disarmament and to nuclear non-proliferation, Pakistan had \ntaken initiatives at the United Nations for the establishment of a \nnuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia and for effective assurances \nto non-nuclear-weapon States against the use of nuclear weapons. \nMeasures such as these could also strengthen the links in an overall \ncomprehensive programme of disarmament.\n\n102.\tThe demands of security, disarmament and development are \nfundamentally interrelated. Progress in disarmament could release the \ncolossal resources, currently consumed by the insane arms race, for \neconomic development and for combating deprivation and disease, which \nafflict vast sections; of humanity. A common historical cause for a \nnew world order must, therefore, motivate our efforts for \nstrengthening international security and pursuing effective \ndisarmament, and for alleviating injustices and disparities besetting \nthe international economic situation.\n\n103.\tOver the past few years we have passively witnessed a rapidly \ndeteriorating crisis in the international economic system. A \ngalloping cancer of stagnation, recession, inflation and mounting \nexternal debt have plunged the global economy to levels redolent of \nthe Great Depression. This has led to the emergence of new attitudes \nand practices characterized by inward looking short-term solutions, \nelements contrary to the spirit of international economic cooperation \nand the principle of interdependence. Deflationary policies pursued \nby some developed countries have rapidly transferred the crisis to \nthe developing countries because of the interdependent nature of the \nworld economy.\n\n104.\tWhite the contraction of the economies has been a universal \nphenomenon, the brunt of the crisis has fallen upon the developing \ncountries. In 1981, for the first time since the 1950s, the per \ncapita real income of the developing countries as a whole actually \nfell in absolute terms. The consequent deceleration in the process of \ndevelopment has led to record unemployment in both the developed and \nthe developing countries, with resultant social unrest and growing \npolitical insecurity. The rapid deterioration in the terms of trade \nof developing countries, rising protectionism and reduced financial \nflows have led to an enormous increase in their external debts \nresulting in drastic reductions in development budgets and growth \nrates. At the same time, the debt burden of oil-importing developing \ncountries increased during 1981 by $50 billion over the 1978 level. \nThis feeds into the recession by towering their capacity to import.\n\n105. The increasing current account deficits and the absence of \nproperty designed international mechanisms to finance these deficits \nin the short run or to correct the fundamental structural imbalance \nin international payments in the long run is the central dilemma \nconfronting us today. It should be a matter of concern for the \ninternational community that the burden of this extraordinary \nadjustment is being passed on to the developing countries, the most \nvulnerable members of the international community. ,\n\n106. We believe that it is possible for the international community \nto find solutions to its problems. The glaring shortcomings in the \nexisting economic system which are responsible for the present crisis \nalso present a rare opportunity to rebuild the various components of \nthe international economic order on a just and equitable basis. There \nis a need for massive and urgent structural changes, the parameters \nfor which are so clearly outlined in the International Development \nStrategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and \nresolutions adopted by the United Nations on the establishment of the \nnew international economic order. The basic malady is not the \nshortage of liquidity in the international system but its gross \nmisdistribution.\n\n107.\tIt is indeed regrettable that global negotiations, proposed \nat the thirty-fourth session of the Assembly, have not yet been \nlaunched. The assurances sought by the industrialized countries are \nalready provided for in the proposal submitted by the Group of 77 on \nthe subject. Let us, therefore, abandon suspicions and apprehensions \nabout each other's intentions and move forward to the substantive \nissues. However, what is alarming is the fact that lack of progress \nin the launching of global negotiations has been accompanied by a \nsimilar situation in sector-wise negotiations.\n\n108.\tAnother disturbing development is the alarming erosion of the \nspirit of international co-operation at a time when increasing \nmultilateral economic co-operation could play a critical role in \ntriggering the process of international economic recovery. Eight \nyears ago, when the general Assembly at its sixth special session \nadopted resolution 3201 (S-Vl), the Declaration on the Establishment \nof a New International Economic Order, it unequivocally emphasized \nthe reality of interdependence, an interdependence between the \ndeveloped and the developing countries. The Assembly also recognized \nthe fact that the political, economic and social well-being of \npresent and future generations depended more than ever on \nco-operation between all the members of the international community \non the basis of sovereign equality and the removal of the \ndisequilibrium that exists between them.\n\n109.\tGlobal interdependence demands that the restoration and \ngrowth of the international economy must be undertaken on the basis \nof international co-operation. We can find answers to the present \nproblems involving financial transfers, protectionist sentiments and \nchanging attitudes towards policies of development assistance only \nthrough a compact of mutual help and assistance. What we are looking \nfor is not short-term financial and trade concessions, although they \nare important in themselves, but long-term structural changes which \nwould involve creating a framework for expansion of world trade, \nprovision of development finance on a long-term basis and the \nprogressive democratization of the present international financial \nsystem to enable it to function in an equitable and efficient manner.\n\n110.\tThere is no alternative to a dialogue and mutual co-operation \nto overcome the malaise which has afflicted the economies of the \nNorth and the South alike. Increased interdependence in the world \neconomy has ensured that no country or group of countries can achieve \ngenuine recovery merely through efficient domestic management of \ntheir economies. A consensus on the root of the current problems and \na co-ordination of responses to solve them are indispensable for this \npurpose.\n\n111. While calling for a global response to the present crisis, the \ndeveloping countries are conscious of the need to promote economic \nco-operation among themselves. This is one area in which positive \ndevelopments have taken place. We believe that expanding economic \nco-operation among developing countries is a dynamic and vital \nelement in any effective restructuring of international economic \nrelations. However, co-operation among developing countries can only \ncomplement, and cannot be a substitute for, a new international \neconomic order based on equity and justice.\n112.\tThe present economic crisis calls for vision and imagination \non the part of the leaders of the industrialized countries, and we \nlook to the emergence of a new internationalism, the awakening of a \nnew spirit of global Co-operation and recognition of the imperatives \nof interdependence, requiring a more equitable management of the \ninternational economic system. The world economy can be rebuilt only \non a sound and permanent foundation of economic efficiency and \neconomic justice with the full participation of developing countries \nin international decision-making, and not through their exclusion. \nThis is an imperative which the world leaders can no longer afford to \nignore in their search for reducing tension and promoting peace and \nharmony.\n\n"

        "file_text": "A year ago, during the thirty-sixth session, President Moussa Traore, \nhead of State of Mali, affirmed from this rostrum that \\\"The \naspiration of our peoples to live in dignity and in spiritual, moral \nand material tranquility is thus being increasingly jeopardized\\\".\nAlas, the past year confirms that statement which should be a source \nof fruitful meditation and deep reflection for us. In fact, 1982 will \nabove all confirm the prevalence of relationships of force in \ninternational relations. The international community has been shaken \nby political, economic and military crises which treaten the very \nfoundations of human civilization.\nThe past year, more than any other, seems to have been a year of \ndisillusion. Solutions to fundamental questions basic to the balance \nof the world which were at one time within our reach crumbled because \nof the resurgence of warlike activism and last- minute intransigence.\nThat is why the eyes of the world, a world which legitimately expects \nfrom us just and lasting solutions for its stability, its security, \nits economic, social and cultural progress, are fixed particularly \nupon the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\nBecause we know that Mr. Hollai is an experienced diplomat with a \nlong and full career; because he has dedicated part of that career to \ndefending, in this very Organization, the fundamental objectives of \nthe Charter, the Republic of Mali, a friend of his country, the \nPeople's Republic of Hungary, places great hopes in his well-deserved \nelection which will, we are convinced, contribute to enriching our \ncommon action in maintaining peace, respect for the sovereign \nequality of States and the peaceful coexistence of all nations.\nOf course, I cannot conceal the legitimate pride that my delegation \ntakes in the wide-ranging and positive action accomplished so \nskilfully by Mr. Hollai's outstanding predecessor, Mr. Kittani, that \nworthy son of the third world, of Iraq, a country which is a friend \nof my own, who acquitted himself so ably in they should like also to \nreiterate to the new Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, the \nbest wishes of the Government of the Republic of Mali, which \nreaffirms its full readiness to co-operate most sincerely with him. \nOne of the long line of individuals who devote their talents and \ntheir political courage to the cause of peace, he bears with him the \nfaith and hopes of the third-world countries which are resolutely \ncommitted to preventing the bipolarization of the world. He has \nalready reflected in stirring terms in his report on the work of the \nOrganization and in his speeches the meaning of his fight for justice \nand equity and also for the strengthening of the system of collective \nsecurity of the United Nations, an irreplaceable instrument for world \npeace.\nThe United Nations is neither called upon nor able to provide magical \nsolutions to international problems. But we had become accustomed \nyear after year, in spite of certain negative factors, to winning \nvictories over ourselves which reflected our deep dedication to the \nideals, goals and principles of the Charter and to have our awareness \nof our international responsibilities heightened day by day.\nIn the course of the past decades, the United Nations has given \nparticular meaning to its ascent towards universality. New forces \nhave strengthened its action and given new dynamism to its \nstructures. The virtues of wisdom and realism have often dispersed \nthe clouds which, streaked with lighting heralding lethal \nthunderbolts, darkened the international horizon. Where agreement was \nsometimes lacking, hope at least was allowed. That is why the United \nNations can quite rightly be pleased at having made its appreciable \ncontribution to the national liberation struggles. It can take pride \nin having prepared international development strategy decades tor \nlow-income countries. It can also be proud at having created hopes \nfor the establishment of a new international economic order. Well may \nit be proud also at having contributed to a sharper perception of the \ndanger represented by the arms race, especially the danger of atomic \nweapons, and at having placed the individual at the center of its \nconcerns by stressing the magnificence and protection of his basic \nrights.\nThus, in spite of pitfalls, in spite of certain sharp setbacks, in \nspite of uncertainties that have often characterized the \ninternational situation, at each of the previous sessions the \nAssembly has attempted to pay its share for the safeguard and \nmaintenance of peace. The feeling has prevailed that where we lacked \nimmediate solutions to international problems, dialogue did enable us \nto discharge our international responsibilities with respect for our \nfundamental interests.\nBut this is where our hopes stop short. Indeed, as the \nSecretary-General himself recalls in his brilliant report \\\"The past \nyear has seen an alarming succession of international crises as well \nas stalemates on a number of... international issues\\\". Hence the \nthirty-seventh session of the General Assembly has opened in the \natmosphere of a terrible, distressing vacuum.\nIt is therefore easy to understand why the recent twelfth special \nsession of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, in which \nmany distinguished personalities participated, concluded without even \nreflecting the hopes that had been placed in it. And, worse still, \nwhile it was meeting Beirut was crumbling under Israeli bombs and new \nso-called conventional weapons were appearing on the battlefield, \nwhich thus served as a testing ground.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has been adopted, \nbut with its chances of implementation blocked. The North-South \ndialogue on the coming into being of the new international economic \norder has foundered on national egoism.\nThe racist, illegal Pretoria regime has strengthened its alliances, \nheightened its repression against South African patriots and \nviolated, with increasing brutality and even more bloodshed, the \nsovereignty and integrity of neighboring States. Some Member States \npersist, in their delirium of power, in their attempts to break the \nwill of peoples for independence. The United Nations will not at this \nsession be enriched by the admission of one of the nations still \nunder domination-although we had every reason to hope that that would \nbe so.\nThus the challenges that we have committed ourselves to meeting are \nin fact taking on frightful dimensions.\nThe thirty-seventh session of the Assembly is being held at a time \nwhen Palestinian people is experiencing the most tragic situation in \nits existence. The Zionist war machine has been unleashed against the \nLebanese and Palestinian peoples with unequalled furor. The siege of \nBeirut, the invasion of that city, the systematic destruction of \nPalestinian refugee camps, hospitals and schools and, lastly and \nabove all, the Sabra and Shatila massacres lend the war in Lebanon \nthe character of genocide, a crime against mankind. That outright \naggression against Lebanon is a premeditated act of war against the \nsovereignty and integrity of a State Member of the Organization. The \nhorrors that have been perpetrated bring back terrible memories. But \nthe peoples that do not have short memories have spoken up everywhere \nin the world, including in Israel itself, against this repetition of \nthe massacre of an entire people.\nWhat took place in Lebanon disturbs and frightens us, because there \nis no greater incitement to crime than the apathy of those who, under \nthe dangerous illusion that only the neighbor's house is burning, \naccept the inadmissible role of hearing and seeing no evil. In \ninternational relations, indifference is the most serious complicity, \nbecause it makes it possible for evil to progress and worsen.\nThe Zionist aggression in Lebanon is the consequence of the \nunpunished acts of Israel which therefore continues to defy the \ninternational community every day-as though the odious aggression of \nJune 1981 against the Iraqi people were not enough and as though the \narrogant annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights were a minor event. \nToday it is the Lebanese and Palestinian civilians who are the \ninnocent victims of the blind violence characteristic of the policy \nof the Zionist State.\nThe Security Council should have, for the cause of peace, drawn from \nChapter VII of the Charter its inspiration and justification for \naction to induce the Government of Israel to respect the elementary \nrules of international law. It is high time to come to our senses, \nbecause Zionism just like apartheid and both are by their very \nessence generators of tension-will expose mankind to a new \nconflagration. Let us therefore act together to guarantee the \ncollective security of all the nations of the world.\nThere is no other solution for the Middle East crisis, and especially \nthe Palestinian question, than that set forth at this very rostrum a \nyear ago, at the 23rd meeting of the thirty-sixth session, by the \nhead of State of Mali, who, even at that time, welcomed what was \nstill called the Fahd plan and advocated, first, withdrawal from all \nthe occupied Arab territories and, secondly, recognition and \nguarantee of the exercise of the national rights of the Palestinian \npeople under the leadership of the PLO, its sole authentic \nrepresentative.\nThose proposals were reaffirmed once again by the non-aligned \nmovement during its recent Extraordinary Ministerial Meetings. They \nare being increasingly accepted, even by Israel's friends, including \nthe most fervent ones. They are the backbone of the recent plan, of \nthe Twelfth Arab Summit Conference, at Fez, which the Government of \nMali supports.\nIsrael's brutal rejection of those proposals is not at all \nsurprising. This systematically rigid attitude is part of the Zionist \nlogic based on defiance and arrogance. The leaders of the PLO, with \ntheir usual grandeur, have solemnly declared that they adhere to \nthose realistic proposals. Israel, on the other hand, rejects any \nsolution which might stop the massacre in the Middle East and enable \nall the peoples of that region to live in peace, honor and dignity. \nHowever, we must remember this: the Palestinian fighters have left \nBeirut but their destiny is not buried there. They left Beirut with \nthe strong determination to impose their national identity.\nThe repercussions of the situation in Palestine have on four \noccasions almost led mankind to perdition. In the face of the \npersistence of that danger and the imminent outbreak of even more \nserious conflicts, the relevant General Assembly resolutions on the \nconvening in 1983 of an international conference on Palestine demand \nattention as very valuable proposals in the accomplishment of our \ncompelling duty to restore peace to the Middle East and finally \nenable the Palestinian people to enjoy its inalienable right to \nfreedom.\nThat right to freedom is part of the whole series of rights that the \nCharter acknowledges for all peoples and that have been codified, \nparticularly in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But, like \nIsrael, South Africa does not understand these principles, which have \ninternational scope, for the system which it has made into a system \nof administration, denies man his very existence. This unacceptable \nsystem is disturbing the harmony of international relations.\nIn its resolution 36/172 B the General Assembly proclaimed the year \n1982 the International Year of Mobilization for Sanctions against \nSouth Africa. Since then, the recommendations made to that end by \nmany political, economic and social governmental and nongovernmental \norganizations have taken on new meaning, on this twentieth \nanniversary of the arbitrary imprisonment of Nelson Mandela, whose \nvision of freedom is the same as that of those great men who by their \ncourage and actions gave meaning to life.\nThe banning of the apartheid regime from United Nations activities is \nonly poor consolation for those who are truly committed to defending \nthe basic rights of man and peace. Chapter VII of the Charter has a \nwealth of resources for isolating and destroying that hateful system \nof\tIt is that system which is preventing a just and peaceful \nsolution to the problem of Namibia.\nThe United Nations by legitimately assuming trusteeship over that \nTerritory committed itself to helping the Namibian people to complete \nthe re- conquest of its homeland. The steps taken in accordance with \nthat commitment have been essentially of two types: the first was the \nrecognition of SWAPO as the sole authentic representative of the \nNamibian people, because it is the only organization which has palm \nin blood the price of the dignity of its homeland; the second led to \nthe adoption by the United Nations of recommendations and decisions \npertaining to the Namibian issue, including Security Council \nresolutions 385 and 435, adopted unanimously, which contain a plan to \nsettle the crisis. The methods for implementing that plan were the \nsubject of long and patient negotiations between Pretoria and, \nrespectively, the United Nations and five Western Powers. An \nexceptional opportunity was thus presented to us to abide by our \ncommitments in regard to the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity.\nBut Pretoria remained frozen in its total lack of understanding for \nthe requirements of peace. Each time that a glimmer of hope appeared \non the horizon for Namibia's accession to independence, the racist \nregime of South Africa snuffed it out through successive \nrecantations-some involving fantastic allegations in regard to the \npartiality of the Organization, others putting the emphasis on the \npresence of Cuban troops in Angola. The duty incumbent upon us is to \ncommit ourselves resolutely to correct implementation of the relevant \nresolutions on Namibia. The implementation of those resolutions which \npertain solely to the independence of that Territory cannot have any \nimpact on or link with commitments entered into by States bordering \non South Africa, in the exercise of their sovereignty, to ensure the \nsecurity of their peoples in the face of precisely the warlike \nincursions of South Africa.\nMali's people and leaders vigorously oppose that grotesque \nmachination, which is only a fallacious amalgam aimed at delaying the \nprocess of independence for Namibia. For Mali, the presence of Cuban \nforces comes within the exclusive sovereignty of Angola and cannot be \nan element for negotiation between South Africa and those who are \nfighting-that is, the heroic SWAPO combatants.\nThe position adopted by the United Nations, to lead Namibia to \nindependence, is based on the purposes and principles of the Charter. \nIf it has provoked the wrath of South Africa, as was to be expected, \nit is even more valid.\nIt is up to the Namibian people and to them alone to seek and apply \nthe appropriate political formulas to guide them in carrying out \ntheir national duty. Any attempt to subject its independence to other \npurposes will only lead to the preservation of foreign interests.\nThe Government of the Republic of Mali hopes that between now and the \nend of the current session of the General Assembly, an independent \nNamibia, with its territorial integrity intact, will take its \nrightful place in the United Nations. That independence will only be \ndeserved, in view of the great sacrifices made by the courageous \nNamibian people in the defense of the ideals of the United Nations.\nIt is on behalf of those ideals of justice, equity and peace that the \nGovernment of the Republic of Mali has committed itself to the quest \nfor a peaceful solution to the problem of the future of the Sahraoui \npeople. We have on several occasions set forth and analyzed here the \nvarious steps taken by Africa and the many initiatives taken by the \nhead of State of Mali to bring about a satisfactory solution to this \npainful-because it is fratricidal-conflict. The question of Western \nSahara, which bears the imprint of incomplete decolonization, cannot \nbe solved without free expression by the Sahraoui people-that is to \nsay, the exercise of true and inevitable self-determination. Africa, \nin its traditional wisdom, had already at the fifteenth session of \nthe Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, at \nKhartoum, recognized that to be the only solution. But it was only at \nthe eighteenth session, at Nairobi, that unanimous agreement was \nreached by the parties to the conflict to the organization of a general \nand free referendum on self-determination.\nOne could have thought, therefore, that the real dangers inherent in \nthat conflict had been eliminated because the path of wisdom and \nrealism had finally been taken by the protagonists, thanks to the \nvigilance and firmness of Africa. But to think that was not to \nunderstand sufficiently the demons of history. If the latest African \nmeeting, the nineteenth session of the OAU Assembly, held at Tripoli, \nbore the stamp of the Sahraoui equation, it is comforting to note \nthat once again Africa showed proof there of its traditional wisdom.\nMy country, Mali, which is honored to have constantly benefited from \nthe confidence of Africa in all its attempts patiently to search for \na solution to that delicate problem, will continue its efforts to \nensure that our continent, as in the heroic epochs of resistance and \nstruggles for independence, will in unity complete the elimination of \nthe after-effects and last vestiges of the colonial system. That \nnoble mission must be the concern of all African States, forced us \nnot to forget that the OAU remains above all the symbol of \nanti-colonial resistance. The current crisis in our continental \norganization will be mastered. Eternal Africa will be able to draw \nfrom its age-old values the resources necessary to allow our unified \norganization to pursue its constant march towards happiness, progress \nand solidarity among African peoples.\nTo live in peace means to establish and strengthen links of \nco-operation and tolerance of political and economic choices. That \nmeans non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and \nthe strengthening of relations of good-neighborliness. The policy of \ngood-neighborliness recognized by the United Nations is indubitably \none of the most dynamic factors for the exploitation of the enormous \npotential which continued progress in science and technology makes \navailable to nations.\nThe crossroad for several civilizations which enriched each other, \nthe cradle of a people which linked its destiny to that of others, \nMali has made good-neighborliness one of the pillars of its foreign \npolicy, The language that it desires to speak to its neighbors is \nthat of sincerity, tolerance and respect for the basic principles \nwhich govern the existence of States. Mali is always open to \ndialogue, to constructive discussions which unite people around \ncommon basic interests.\nThat policy of positive good-neighborliness also implies active \nsolidarity among fraternal peoples faced with temporary difficulties. \nThat is why our country constantly pursues its efforts within the \nAfrican family to safeguard the national unity and territorial \nintegrity of Chad. Those objectives can only be achieved without any \noutside interference in the internal affairs of an independent and \nsovereign State, whose current crisis is no reason for placing it \nunder any trusteeship.\nIt is also on the strength of the principles I have just mentioned \nthat we appeal to our brothers on the Horn of Africa and in \nKampuchea, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Cyprus \nhonorably to end conflicts which can only expose them further to the \nappetites of the forces of domination and make the fruits of the \nstruggle for emancipation increasingly bitter as well as dangerously \nweaken the front that the third world has decided to form for the \nrestoration of its human and natural resources.\n From Korea there does not come any glimmer of hope that would permit \nus to believe in the just redress of one of the errors of the last \nworld war, which established arbitrary borders-an artificial line \nwithin a single country, all of whose people aspires profoundly to \nthe unification of their common homeland. We hope that fraternal \ndialogue and fruitful co-operation will triumph so that the great \nKorean family will come together on the basis of the 10-point \nreunification plan, which is an infinite source of inspiration.\nAs can be seen, an analysis of the international situation reminds \none of the situation during the great fear of the year 1000. Today \nconflicts born of liberation struggles are taking on formidable \ndimensions. Brothers are tearing each other apart. The policy of \ndiktat is resurfacing. The desire to impose solutions to \ninternational disputes through threats and the use of force is again \ncommon currency.\nConceived and drawn up on the ruins of a monstrous war, the Charter \nof the United Nations was designed to open the world onto an era of \nreconciliation of hearts and minds. But, unfortunately, the spirit of \ncompetition continues. Nuclear experiments continue although, \naccording to all estimates, the existing stockpile of nuclear weapons \nis more than capable of destroying our planet several times over.\nThere is no agreement on the spiraling arms race, because the \narguments advanced in the negotiations to restrain it are attached to \nconcepts which tend to transform effect into cause. The initial \nconcept can be reduced to the old adage, \\\"If you want peace, prepare \nfor war\\\". However, people have never stopped preparing for war and \nhave never stopped being in a state of war. Armament is seen to be a \nstabilizing element in international relations, whereas, on the \ncontrary, the maintenance of such stability is conceivable only \nwithout the threat of the use of armed force. The second concept is \nthat no disarmament is possible without the prior establishment of a \nclimate of international confidence. Here again, the terms of the \ndiscussions on disarmament are inverted. Confidence is dissipated; it \nemerges through a prism whose pieces must be put together on the \nbasis of a common agreement. Here the stumbling-block which has \nimpeded negotiations on disarmament is again the balance of forces. \nOnce again rhetoric has prevailed over the real will to negotiate. In \nan atmosphere of negotiation in which confidence does not reign or in \nwhich the stockpiling and improvement of weapons appear to be the \nonly guarantees against widespread conflict, the basis on which the \nbalance of strength rests is only a figment of the imagination.\nThe arms race leads inevitably to war. Only the kind of political \nwill that has made possible the adoption of the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea and the International Development \nStrategy for the First and the Second United Nations Development \nDecade can lead to results in the negotiations on disarmament.\nThe manifestation of this political will was, unfortunately, lacking \nduring the launching of the global negotiations at the thirty-sixth \nsession. Nevertheless, here again, the goal pursued was very close. \nThe need for the establishment of a new international economic order \nwas seen by all to be a demand of our times. A number of obstacles \nalong the way were eliminated after long and patient negotiations. \nThe consensus which enabled progress to be achieved was not \nmaintained into the final phase of the negotiations, although these \npertained only to questions of procedure.\nHere again, in the final phase of the negotiations, the North-South \ndialogue lost its raison d'etre. A group of States, thinking only of \nthe status of their national economies, blocked the dialogue that had \nbeen begun with a view to finding concerted solutions to common \nproblems. These problems may be rerouted, they may be subordinated to \ntemporary concerns, but their scope and their universality can only \nbecome more compelling. They are common problems because they pertain \nto the interdependence of States, and they require common solutions, \nwithout which the world economic situation will only deteriorate \nfurther.\nAn analysis of the world economic situation shows on the one hand a \nmore marked deterioration of trade relations and on the other hand a \ntrend towards absorbing the crisis through selfish and isolated \nnational policies. That is the way in which I have summarized the \nbitter observations in the World Economic Survey, 1981-1982: \n\\\"Economic expansion decelerated markedly throughout the world... The \ndeceleration was particularly intense in the developing countries, \nmost of which experienced a significant fall in per capita incomes\\\".\nThe growth rates of the developing countries have been falling \ndangerously since 1978. The terms of trade have deteriorated further; \nexport earnings have not been sufficient to ensure debt servicing, \nwhile at the same time official development assistance has become \nmore scarce and been tied to more and more conditions. For the first \ntime since the welcome establishment of UNDP-and we wish to praise \nits efforts and its merits-UNDP has had its resources reduced. The \nOttawa, Cancun and Versailles economic summit meetings, as well as \nthe United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, gave \nrise to many hopes, which were very quickly dashed. Global \nnegotiations, the immediate launching of which is seen every day to \nbe an undeniable necessity, although promised, do not seem to be on \nthe horizon.\nHowever, the industrialized countries are beginning in their turn to \nbe affected to their very foundations by something from which they \nthought they were shielded, that is, an upheaval in the anachronistic \nworld economic system. In fact we are on the eve of an implosion of \nthe international monetary system. An increasingly large number of \ndeveloping countries can no longer pay the North the interest on \ntheir numerous debts, which have reached the outrageous sum of $500 \nbillion. Even though they transfer every year to the North the tidy \nsum of $50 billion to service the debts and even though the South \nreceives annually from the North only $25 billion in the form of \nofficial development assistance, the banks of the North are still \nthreatened with collapse. This is in no way surprising. This \ndisturbing observation only underscores once again the degree to \nwhich the world economy is interdependent.\nWe must above all be convinced that it is upon an improvement of the \nliving conditions of the three quarters of the population of our \nworld which continues to live in extreme distress that the world \nbalance and the maintenance of international security depend. For \nmillions of people whose average income is less than $1 a day, it \ntakes little thought to comprehend and realize the fact that every \nday about 4 million times that income goes into the production of \ndevices that could deprive them of the meagre benefits they hope to \nderive for their subsistence. How can we explain to them, when every \nday they wonder what their chances are of obtaining a small crust of \nbread, that the cost of a jet fighter is equivalent to that of 15,000 \ntons of wheat and that the cost of a bomber is equivalent to that of \n30 schools or 15 hospitals? How is it possible for them to \nunderstand-and here we are referring to the statistics of the World \nBank-that 800 million of them are condemned to illiteracy while sums \nthat defy the imagination are swallowed up in the unbridled arms race?\nFor us, the peoples of the Sahelian region, where a relentless \ndrought prevails, where millions of people see their very survival \nendangered, this dangerous evolution of the world's civilization is \nstupefying. The international community has, of course, decided to \nmobilize to restore life to the Sahel. We are therefore pleased once \nagain to thank the many States and groups of States and governmental \nand non-governmental international organizations that have helped us \nto carry out some of our projects. However, it remains true that the \ndesert continues to advance. The drought that prevails in the \nSahelian regions can no longer be attributed to temporary \nmeteorological phenomena. It prevails as a profound and more and more \nwidespread evil, for the combating of which, however, technical and \nhuman resources exist.\nA careful look at the phenomenon of drought, because of its \npersistence and its magnitude, shows a disturbing evolution in the \necology of our world. Yet the time is past when lightning caused man \nto dash for cover. The struggle to keep our environment healthy and \nsound so that man can flourish by applying all his creative skills, \nhas never been closer to being won. Unfortunately, thousands of \nexperts, and even the most competent among them, devote their \nintelligence to improving the war machine that is destined to destroy \nmankind.\nThe rehabilitation of the world economy so as to give it new life and \nvigor is thus among the primary challenges we shall have to meet in \nthe course of this decade if we are to preserve peace.\nThe Republic of Mali, because it is determined to participate \nactively in the collective effort to rehabilitate the world economy, \nhas chosen a course of development that is in keeping with the ethic \nof its people and with the demands of the modem international \ncommunity. The building of an independent and planned national \neconomy, in our view, is the appropriate response to the concerns of \nour people. Having made this choice, we are endeavoring to adapt our \neconomic policies to meet the deepest aspirations of our population.\nLike our neighbors, we believe that the patient construction of \nregional groups and subgroups such as the Organization for the \nDevelopment of the Senegal River, the West African Economic \nCommunity, the Conference of Saharan States and the Economic \nCommunity of the States of Western Africa is the only way \nsignificantly and decisively to contribute to the realization of the \nLagos Plan which resulted from the important second special session \nof the OAU Assembly in April 19S0 devoted to a thorough consideration \nof economic questions of concern to the African continent. The \nguidelines contained in that plan, which is now an historic one, arc \nfor Africans the only way to survive in the face of the serious \neconomic crisis. At the thirty-sixth session, in this very Hall, \nPresident Moussa Traore spoke these words: \\\"Together with you, we \nwish to restore the confidence of our people in their creative \nabilities. Together with you, we wish to preserve international peace \nand security.\\\" We have come here once again to reaffirm our readiness \nto build, together with all the States of the international \ncommunity, another world, a new world commensurate with our creative \ngenius so that universal civilization can flourish.\nThis readiness on the part of the Republic of Mali to work for peace, \njustice and equity is constant. That is so because our aspirations \nand hopes are shared by the rest of the international community. \nThose hopes will exist as long as peoples are compelled to resort to \nweapons to defend their raison d'etre and their dignity. They will \nexist as long as racism and its most odious manifestation, apartheid, \ncontinue as a system of government.\nA world that trembles in fear of nuclear peril is not a free world, \nand it is even less a world of peace. People who are ill for lack of \ncare, who are sick of being hungry will, without warning, upset the \npresent precarious order, precarious because it is obsolete.\nThe past year has been fraught with threats. That is why we are here \nin this Hall with the other members of the Assembly to clear the \nground for the establishment of a more stable system of collective \nsecurity.\nWe should not be shouldering our responsibilities and we should \nbetray the confidence of our peoples if in our actions we failed to \nprovide concrete, pragmatic, realistic and lasting solutions for the \nsole raison d'etre of man: that of living in peace with himself and \nwith his fellow man, free of fear of future misery and conflicts, in \never larger freedom.\n\n"

        "file_text": "I bring to the General Assembly and to the United \nNations the greetings of the people of Mauritius \nand of their newly elected Government. I wish to \nconvey to the President my warmest \ncongratulations on his election to preside over \nour deliberations. I am confident that under his \nwise and able leadership the Assembly will, in \nthe superior interests of mankind, give concrete \nshape to the aspirations of the peoples of the \nworld. I seize this opportunity to express to his \npredecessor, Mr. Kittani, our warmest \nappreciation for the highly impressive manner in \nwhich he presided over the deliberations of the \nprevious session of the Assembly.\n53.\tIt is indeed a moment of intense emotion \nfor me to address the Assembly for the first time \nin my capacity as the head of a new Government \noverwhelmingly mandated by the people of \nMauritius to take the destiny of the country \nfirmly in hand, to make it play the role it \nshould play in mankind's search for enduring \npeace in the world and to make it contribute its \nshare, however modest, to the eradication of all \nforms of injustice at home and abroad.\n54.\tI wish here to record our appreciation of \nthe work done by the Secretary-General. It takes \ngreat courage, Mr. Secretary-General, to \nundertake on behalf of humanity the difficult \ntasks that your office carries with it. The \ninternational community has seen you at work in \nthe past year in some of the most trying \nsituations, where your tact, your moderation and \nyour perseverance have inspired universal \nadmiration. The year ahead, unfortunately, does \nnot promise to be any easier for you than the \nyear that has elapsed. In your first report on \nthe work of the Organization you have focused on \nthe need for an urgent review of the United \nNations and, in particular, of mechanisms set up \nfor collective action for international peace and \nsecurity. You have argued for a more forthright \nrole for your office of Secretary-General and you \nenvisage for the Security Council a kind of \ndiplomatic system. Finally, you say you would \nlike to see more concrete follow-up action to \ndebate in the Assembly. Many of the proposals you \nhave made could be put into effect immediately if \nthe political will of Member States was \ngalvanized for the purpose. You can therefore \nrest assured that my delegation will co-operate \nfully with your office and with the other Member \nStates for an early implementation of any \nresolution arrived at in respect of the \nreorganization envisaged.\n55.\tIt is a matter of deep regret that the \nprinciple of the universality of United Nations \nmembership does not yet actually prevail. \nUnilateral action and exclusive alliances have in \nfact not been disowned. Spheres of influence and \nconsiderations of balance of power, regrettably, \ncontinue to actuate the policies of many nations, \ndespite the fact that they fail to produce the \ndesired results. Added to this is a considerable \nand formidable interference in the internal \naffairs of many countries, the powerful making \ntheir presence felt in many ways, relentless in \ntheir endeavour to enlarge their spheres of \ninfluence. Countries like Mauritius, which have \nonly recently acquired freedom, have a strong \nattachment to the United Nations and inevitably a \nspecial stake in its functioning. I have come \nhere to reiterate my country's deep commitment to \nthe principles and purposes of the Charter.\n56.\tI believe that we come here not to save \nface but to save and protect life. We come here \nnot to deliver speeches only and then make our \nexit but to make action follow our words. We come \nhere not as a matter of mere formality and to pay \nlip service to the ideals of peace and justice \nbut  to show how serious we are in our intentions \nto work for the superior interests of the whole \nof mankind. We come here not out of selfish \nmotives but to show how willing and prepared we \nare to forgo a little bit of our own ego for \ninternational good in a spirit of compromise, so \nthat the world may live and the human race \nsurvive. We come here not to add to problems but \nto find solutions satisfactory to all parties. We \ncome here because we believe in man and in all \nthe inherent good there is in him which, if it \nprevails, will be the safety valve of the human \nrace.\n57.\tWhat is urgently needed is a unified view \nof the world's resources and the world's \nexperience and of man's power of invention. The \nchange we desire, the change which must come, is \none not of pace, quantity or manner but of the \nbasic quality of what man is and can be. We all \nneed to make earnest and well-considered efforts \nto subdue and check national ambitions and \nrivalries in the superior and wider interest of \nthe preservation of civilization and the survival \nof humanity.\n58.\tIt is in the context of what I have just \nsaid that I invite representatives present here \nto bear in mind the human dimensions of the \nissues we shall be deliberating upon. The average \nman does not ask for much; he is not interested \nin leading a life of frivolous affluence and \nfrenetic consumption. We are gathered here to \ngive substance to the yearnings of the average \nman, to give voice to the wishes of the \nvoiceless, for that is the primary responsibility \nof those who govern. The great tragedy of the \npresent situation is that the world order as it \nnow exists has been unable to satisfy the basic \nuniversal aspirations of man \u2014dignity, peace and \nsecurity.\n59.\tIn June the people of Mauritius gave an \noverwhelming mandate to those whom they perceived \nto be the champions of the dignity of man. We \nhave given a solemn undertaking to our people to \ndefend the oppressed and the weak and we will be \ntrue to that undertaking. It is equally in this \nspirit that we want to add our voice to that of \nthis concert of nations in our denunciation of \nall forms of injustice and to work to better the \nlot of suffering mankind.\n60.\tThe major and continuing threat to the \ndignity of man comes from the prevailing economic \norder, characterized by built-in \nself-perpetuating inequality which results in an \nunjust distribution of the world's limited \nresources. Year by year the inequality grows, the \ninjustice of the system becomes ethically more \nrevolting and at the receiving end deprivation \nand misery become more unbearable. It is patent \nthat this system cannot be allowed to continue. \nChange may be too gradual in the developing \ncountries for our liking but we realize that it \ncan come only out of patient dialogue. We are \ntoday faced with the Herculean task of \nrestructuring an economic order which has been \nshaped by four centuries of colonialism. This \ncannot be done quickly, it cannot be done \npainlessly, but it has to be done and it will be \ndone. The real question before us is whether we \nwant to continue frittering away our energies in \nuseless disagreements and quarrels or whether we \nwant to look seriously into the future of mankind \nand act to make people really prosperous.\n61.\tBoth the rich and the poor nations have \npressing  and paralleled problems which cannot be \nsolved independently. The present crisis is a \ncrisis of international structures. The present \nsystem needs fundamental institutional reforms, \nbased upon the recognition of a common interest \nand upon mutual concern in an increasingly \ninterdependent world. New vitality and urgency \nhave to be imparted to the North-South dialogue. \nThe very survival of both developing and \ndeveloped countries depends on the success of \nthis dialogue. We have to moderate the shrillness \nof the demands made, as well as the obdurate \narrogance with which those demands have so far \nbeen rejected. I believe that we have in the Lome \nConvention given the world a small but \nsignificant example of what cooperative \nNorth-South could be like.\n62.\tMy Government also calls upon the members \nof the international community to direct its \nefforts to the equally important transformation \nof the international order relating to the \noceans. The traditional legal order in that Held \nhas been eroded by technological and political \ndevelopments and must be replaced by a new legal \norder which would permit the exploitation of the \nocean space\u2014the largest and most valuable region \nof our planet\u2014in the interests of all mankind. \nAfter many years of intense and very complex \nnegotiations, in which over 150 States have \nregularly participated, the Third United Nations \nConference on the Law of the Sea has produced a \nConvention which ought to be hailed as a triumph \nfor mankind in laying the foundation for \ninternational co-operation in the use of the \noceans.\n63.\tAll the major industrialized Powers \nplayed a very active role in the shaping of the \nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \nwhich largely reflects their interests, concerns \nand preoccupations. It is on account of this that \nwe fail to appreciate the attempt being made by \ncertain major Powers to scuttle the Convention by \ntheir decision to opt for a mini-treaty among \nlike-minded States, a mini-treaty which \ninevitably will create new areas of tension in \ninternational relations likely to lead to a \nsituation which endangers international peace and \nsecurity.\n64.\tWe call upon all States to sign the \nConvention in order to make the concept of the \ncommon heritage of mankind a reality. The \nConvention on the Law of the Sea should be \ntreated as a special convention and we urge the \nmajor industrialized States to forgo their fears \nabout the precedent setting nature of this \nConvention. All States should embark on this \nenterprise in a spirit of trust and good will.\n65.\tQuite apart from its determination to \nwork with other countries of the third world for \nthe elimination of the poverty curtain that \ndivides our planet into a world of the affluent \nand a world of the poor, Mauritius militates \nagainst the equally pernicious division of the \nworld into two hostile camps dominated by the \nso-called super-Powers, which, in their pursuit \nof world domination, threaten the security of \nStates the only concern of which is the social \nand economic development of their people, free \nfrom external interference. Mauritius is \ncommitted to a policy of active and determined \nnon-alignment. We intend jealously to protect and \nguard our hard-won independence; we intend to \ncondemn unequivocally all aggression, all forms \nof imperialism and all hegemonistic ambitions. We \naspire to a world of true interdependence of \ngenuinely free and equal States, whose relations \nare based on co-operation rather than on \nconfrontation.\n66.\tThe Government of Mauritius, in pursuit \nof its policy of strict non-alignment and in \nconformity with General Assembly resolution 2832 \n(XXVI), the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a \nZone of Peace, will work with other peace-loving \nmembers of the international community for the \ndemilitarization of the Indian Ocean. During the \nyears which have elapsed since the adoption of \nthe resolution, we have witnessed the expansion \nof the Ocean's geopolitical dimensions and the \nconversion of this intended zone of peace into a \nzone of war and mobilization for war, with all \nthe attendant dangers for the countries of the \nregime. The Ocean has gradually expanded beyond \nits own waters; it is now linked to the States of \nSouth-East Asia and to developments in West Asia \nand the Middle East. The so-called modest \ncommunications facility in Diego Garcia has been \nconverted into the formidable and horrendous \nnuclear base which threatens the security of all \nIndian Ocean States, and there has been a \nscramble to secure port facilities along the \nso-called arc of crisis, that is, the Horn of \nAfrica, the Arabian peninsula and the vital \nPersian Gulf area.\n67.\tWith the alarming increase in a foreign \nmilitary presence in the Indian Ocean, the \nfervent hope of the States of the region for the \nholding of the Conference on the Indian Ocean has \nreceded. Mauritius and the other States of the \nregion are not hoodwinked by the tactics and \nploys adopted by some States, which are designed \nprimarily to cause confusion, postpone \nindefinitely the holding of that Conference and \ncreate a smoke-screen to hide their warlike \ndesigns. We solemnly appeal to all the members of \nthe international community to give their full \nsupport to the United Nations so that the \nConference on the Indian Ocean can take place in \nthe very near future. We also call upon the \nforeign military Powers present in the Indian \nOcean to exercise mutual restraint and to \ninitiate a gradual and balanced withdrawal of \ntheir forces from the region, which would then be \nopen exclusively to commercial navigation. It is \nour conviction that the security of the sea lanes \nin the Ocean can best be protected by the States \nof the region.\n68.\tAt this juncture I should like to dwell \non an issue which affects the vital interests of \nMauritius; I mean the Mauritian claim of \nsovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, which \nwas excised by the then colonial Power from the \nterritory of Mauritius in contravention of \nGeneral Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 2066 \n(XX). This dismemberment of Mauritian territory, \nthe violation of our territorial integrity, has \nbeen made all the more unacceptable by the fact \nthat one of the islands of that very Archipelago, \nDiego Garcia, is now a full-fledged nuclear base, \nwhich poses a constant threat to the security of \nMauritius and to that of all the littoral and \nhinterland States of the Indian Ocean, the very \nOcean declared to be a zone of peace by this \nAssembly in 1971.\n69.\tI solemnly appeal to the peace-loving \nMembers of the Organization to extend all their \nsupport to the legitimate Mauritian claim of \nsovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. In \nhelping Mauritius to regain its national \nheritage, the United Nations will be living up to \nits own principles and proclaiming loud and clear \nthat it expects its resolutions to be implemented \nby its Members. As the Diego Garcia issue \ninvolves two fundamental principles of the United \nNations, namely respect by the administering \nPower for the territorial integrity of its \ncolony, and the right of peoples to live in peace \nand security, I venture to say that the return of \nthe archipelago to Mauritius will bring the \nOrganization the respect that is so indispensable \nto its continued existence.\n70.\tTimes are bad, very bad. The world \neconomy in fact teeters on the brink of a \ndepression that could be wider and deeper than \nthat of the 1930s. For the weakest national \neconomies, and therefore for hundreds of millions \nof people, little short of catastrophe looms. \nSuch a situation, wherein the world is perilously \npoised on the brink of an economic precipice, is \nnot conducive to peace. An extended recession, \nexcessive interest rates, highly unstable \nexchange rates, widespread protectionism\u2014all \nthese constitute threats to peace in a world of \ninescapable interdependence. Our political and \neconomic systems should provide conceptual space \nfor the reality of an interdependent world \neconomy. Regrettably, the search for the world \neconomy recovery that is so desperately needed \nremains derailed and we drill towards the abyss \nof economic disaster.\n71.\tAs far as Mauritius if concerned, we \nshall participate fully in the North-South \ndialogue and, indeed, have great expectations of \nprogress resulting from that dialogue, but we \nbelieve that much can be achieved through \nSouth-South co-operation. The Island States of \nthe south-west Indian Ocean are actively engaged \nin promoting co-operation at the regional level. \nWe hope in the near future to set up an Indian \nOcean commission which will provide the \ninstitutional framework for co-operation among \nthe States of the region. It Is no mean measure \nof our firm belief in the concept of an \ninterdependent world economy that we are already \nlooking beyond the immediate present to the day \nwhen the grouping of the south-west Indian Ocean \nStates can be associated with other regional \ngroupings.\n72.\tViolations of human rights constitute \nanother serious threat to the dignity of man. In \ntoo many countries do people live under constant \nthreat of arbitrary arrest, torture, appearance \nand execution after trials that are away from \ncivilized norms of justice. We unequivocally \ncondemn all violations of human rights wherever \nthey occur, under whatever social or political \nsystem that occur.\n73.\tWe have a special abhorrence for a system \nso inhuman, so immoral, would be unimaginable but \nfor the shameful fact that it exists. This odious \nsystem of institutionalized racism will eternally \ntarnish the claim of our epoch to a place of \nhonour in the history of civilization. We have a \nduty to our brothers in South Africa. We also owe \nit to ourselves to eliminate all vestiges of this \niniquitous system; otherwise the judgement which \nposterity will pass on our times will be indeed \nvery harsh, and deservedly so.\n74.\tWe believe that freedom is indivisible, \nthat peace is indivisible. One of the first \nforeign policy decisions of my Government was \nformally to recognize ANC. Mauritius will stand \nby ANC in its hard struggle to secure the \nemancipation of the people of South Africa; ANC \ncan depend on the unflinching support of the \npeople and Government of Mauritius.\n75.\tWe shall give the same unconditional \nsupport to SWAPO in its struggle for the \ndecolonization of Namibia. It is unacceptable \nthat the Republic of South Africa should continue \nin its illegal occupation of Namibia in defiance \nof the basic tenets of international law and of \ninternational opinion. This defiance has to be \nopposed by united and determined action. We \nshould not permit economic considerations to \nhinder our action when the basic norms of \nuniversal morality are being trampled upon, and \nwe should vigorously condemn the tactics adopted \nby the South African regime, tactics designed to \nmodify the terms of Security Council resolution \n435 (1978). Mauritius, moreover, sees no linkage \nbetween the presence of Cuban troops in Angola \nand the withdrawal of South African troops from \nNamibia and demands that the South African regime \nshould no longer be allowed to invoke such a \nlinkage to delay the accession of the Namibian \npeople to independence.\n76.\tWe in Africa will, we hope, soon be rid \nof the last vestiges of colonialism, and the \nemancipation of the South African people will \ninevitably be accomplished in the near future. \nRacist domination in southern Africa is the \nmajor, immediate problem we face, but it is by no \nmeans our only problem.\n77.\tI should like to impress upon the \nAssembly that the African peoples want to dispel \nthe image that the African continent is only a \nrich source of raw materials and nothing more; \nnor is it fertile ground for the manoeuvres of \noutside Powers and it is now determined not to \ntolerate such manoeuvres. Africa calls open all \noutside Powers to keep out and to let Africans \nget on with solving their problems and be of help \nfor countries in the solution of these problems \nis not to be ignored, provided there no sinister \nulterior motives, We in Africa are in urgent need \nof technology, of capital, of know-how. Our \nproblems, both economic and social, call for the \njoined, sustained effort of all of Africa. 0ur \ngreatest challenge is the maintenance of African \nunity and the consolidation of our independence.\n78.\tI come now to an area distant from \nMauritius. The issue at stake, however, is close \nto the heart of every Mauritian. Tre PLO as the \nsole representative of the Palestinian people has \nour unreserved support; our identification with \nthe Palestinian cause is total. We believe that \nthe people of the Middle East will remain \nsupportive towards Palestine until Palestinian \naspirations are fulfilled. Mauritius has studied \nthe various peace proposals with great attention \nand we are ready to give our backing to any peace \nplan put forward that is acceptable to the PLO.\n79.\tWe call upon all those who can do so to \nbring pressure to bear on Israel to stop \nforthwith its aggression against the Lebanese and \nPalestinian peoples. Prospects of peace in the \narea suffered a severe setback with the Israeli \ninvasion of Lebanon and the unspeakable, \ncold-blooded carnage of innocent civilians in \nBeirut.\n80.\tThe fratricidal war between Iraq and the \nIslamic Republic of Iran drags on, to the \nsatisfaction of those who would wish to see the \nthird world in a perpetual state of turmoil and \nunderdevelopment. We call upon both parties to \nthe conflict to cease hostilities and to stop the \ndeath and destruction this war is inflicting on \nthe peoples of Iran and Iraq.\n81.\tThis war has led to the postponement of \nthe Seventh Conference of Heads of State or \nGovernment of Non-Aligned Countries. This \npostponement comes at a time when our movement is \nfaced with problems requiring immediate \nsolutions. Afghanistan, a member of the movement \nfinds itself under foreign occupation for the \nthird year. It is imperative that foreign forces \nwithdraw from Afghanistan, that all foreign \ninterference in its internal affairs cease and \nthat its non-aligned status be restored.\n82.\tThe conflicts, the inequalities and the \ninjustices of the world scene could easily lead \nus to be disheartened at the precarious state of \nthe world. But we cannot allow ourselves to be \ndisheartened, for that would be an abdication of \nour responsibilities towards our children and \ntowards posterity. An important aspect of my \nGovernment's socialist creed is faith in the \ninnate goodness of man. Man fights the forces of \nevil and darkness, conscious that, however long \nand arduous the way may be, the victory of good \nover evil is assured.\n83.\tI believe that the Charter is the \nconcrete embodiment of one of the instances where \ngood has triumphed against tremendous divisive \nodds. The Charter is our yardstick by which are \njudged the acts of nations. I can assure the \nAssembly that my Government's actions find their \ninspiration in the Charter.\n84.\tThe world has always faced one crisis or \nanother, but today's crisis is deeper and more \nfar-reaching. No thinking, sensitive and \nright-minded nation can remain silent. But it is \nnot enough merely to speak out: we should peak \nout when the occasion for action comes, but, \nabove all, we should act, because the occasion \nfor action is here and now.\n85.\tOn behalf of the people of Mauritius and \non behalf of their newly elected Government, I \npledge our continuing and unflinching support for \nthe United Nations and our respect for its \nCharter.\n"

        "file_text": "The annual gathering of representatives of \nvirtually all the sovereign nations of the globe, \nand of affiliated or interested international \ninstitutions within the framework of the regular \nsession of the General Assembly of the United \nNations is always a source of great satisfaction \nand moral comfort to us. We see therein the signs \nof that ideal of tolerance which is inscribed in \nthe Charter and which inspires us all, despite \nthe different views we may hold about the various \nevents which are at present rending the world. We \nalso see therein the demonstration of our \nwillingness to discuss our differences, not to \nsay our divergences of opinion, and to seek \ntogether ways and means to solve or eliminate \nthem.\nThat ideal of tolerance and dialogue could hardly \nbe symbolized more fittingly than by the gesture \nof the unanimous election of Mr. Hollai as \nPresident of the Assembly. Crowning his long \ndiplomatic career, that choice constitutes a \nwell-deserved tribute to his country, Hungary, \nfor its positive contribution to mutual \nunderstanding among peoples and the strengthening \nof co-operation among States. Certainly, the \nreins which our President has taken over from Mr. \nKittani of Iraq are difficult to hold firm. But \nwe are convinced that his long and rich \nexperience of world affairs, particularly in the \nUnited Nations system, will allow him to \nundertake the difficult task with the same \nwisdom, determination and efficiency as his \ntalented predecessor, to whom I should again like \nto express the appreciation of the delegation of \nthe Niger.\nThe thirty-seventh session of the General \nAssembly is opening in an international context \nwhich is heavy with threats for all mankind, so \ntrue is it that the course of affairs of our \nworld and the spirit guiding it remain dreadfully \nmarked by violence, injustice, egoism, and \nignorance or disregard of the principles and \nnoble ideals which the United Nations adopted in \nits Charter in order to establish a world of \npeace and progress for all. Such a situation is \nlikely, if care is not taken, to do serious and \nlasting harm to the credibility of the \nOrganization\u2014a credibility which is, moreover, \nincreasingly being challenged by international \npublic opinion, which is disturbed and anguished \nbecause of the results achieved by United Nations \naction in areas as vital for mankind as those of \ndisarmament, development and the maintenance of \npeace and security.\nEach of our peoples aspires to live in a world \nfree of wars and conflict, where hunger, sickness \nand poverty are unknown. The events of today seem \nto indicate that this prospect is further away \nthan ever, consequently revealing the inability \nof the Organization, and of the system of \ninternational relations as a whole, to respond \neffectively to the political and economic \nchallenges which confront us.\nIn the political arena, that failure is even more \nserious because it relates to problems which are \nat least as old as the United Nations itself and \nwhich the international community has assumed a \ndirect moral and historical responsibility to \nresolve. I refer here to the problems of \nPalestine and the Middle East and the question of \nNamibia. To be sure, the United Nations has \nformally recognized the legitimacy of the \nstruggle for self- determination of the peoples \nof those countries by granting observer status to \ntheir legitimate representatives, the PLO and the \nSouth West Africa People's Organization. But the \nfact remains that any mention of Palestine and \nNamibia results in flagrant and unpunished \nviolations of international rules and customs, \nbrutal oppression, the denial of the rights of \npeoples to self-determination and the invasion \nand occupation of neighbouring States.\nWith regard to the question of Palestine, it \nshould be noted that the international community \nas a whole has now finally accepted that the \nPalestinian problem is at the head of the drama \nwhich is tearing the Middle East apart, and that \nany solution to that conflict must necessarily \ninvolve the restoration of the inalienable rights \nof the Palestinian people.\nThe great majority of the States of our community \nrecognize the PLO as the sole legitimate \nrepresentative of the Palestinian people, as well \nas recognizing the absolute right of those people \nto self- determination and to the creation of a \nsovereign State on their own territory.\nThere is also reason to recall that at the \nseventh emergency special session the General \nAssembly adopted by an overwhelming majority \nresolution ES-7/2, an important resolution \nreaffirming the inalienable rights of the \nPalestinian people to self- determination without \nforeign interference, as well as to independence \nand sovereignty, and stressing their right to \ncreate a sovereign State on their own national \nterritory.\nSimilarly, the international community has on \nmany occasions, within the United Nations as well \nas in other international forums, condemned the \ncontinued occupation of Arab territories by \nIsrael and, on the basis of the principle of the \ninadmissibility of the acquisition of territories \nby force, has called for its total and \nunconditional withdrawal.\nBut we must today note that the international \ncommunity has not been able to take any specific \naction to ensure that the Palestinian people can \nexercise their inalienable legitimate rights, to \nrestore to Arab sovereignty the territories \nillegally occupied by Israel, and to guarantee \nthe independence, sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of Lebanon. Thus far no action has been \npossible to halt the policy practised by Israel \nof systematic negation of the inalienable rights \nof the Palestinian people and the rights of the \nArab and Lebanese people to peace and calm within \ntheir borders.\nIt is a fact that Israel remains deaf to the \ndisapproval, the constant appeals to reason and \nthe condemnations of the international community. \nOn the contrary, guided by hatred, blinded by \nmilitary power, day after day displaying its \ngrowing for the decisions of the United Nations, \nIsrael has adopted and is carrying out in an \noutrageous manner an unbridled policy of \nJudaization of Palestinian Arab lands through the \nmodification of their geographic, historical, \nsociological and religious characteristics.\nPursuing its expansionist policy, Israel has \nsuccessively annexed the holy city of Jerusalem \nand the Golan Heights, before launching its army \nupon the conquest of Lebanon, a large portion of \nwhose territory is today occupied. At the same \ntime, populations living in the occupied Arab \nterritories are pitilessly subjected to ferocious \nrepression which nothing can justify.\nRecent events in Lebanon, which in fact represent \nonly a single episode in the strategy of conquest \npursued by the Israeli State, prove\u2014if any proof \nwere needed\u2014that neither vehement protests nor \nenergetic condemnations are enough to thwart a \ngenocidal undertaking which discredits the action \nof the United Nations as much as it makes guilty \nby omission almost the entire international \ncommunity.\nIn the light of this holocaust of our time, faced \nwith this great tragedy, it demeans the \ninternational community that its representatives \ncontinue to cling to their well-known positions \nand to conduct byzantine discussions on the texts \nof resolutions which, when adopted, remain dead \nletters. The memory of thousands of Palestinian \nmartyrs and of the innocent victims of Sabra and \nShatila cry cut to us, and call for decisive \naction from us to restore the usurped rights of \nthe Palestinian people.\nAgainst that background, the Organization of the \nIslamic Conference, whose thirteenth session of \nthe Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs the \nNiger was greatly honoured to host, urges all the \nStates which love peace, liberty, justice and \nprogress to work collectively within the United \nNations for the adoption and implementation by \nthe Security Council of a new resolution \nrequiring in precise terms the Israeli withdrawal \nfrom all occupied Palestinian and Arab \nterritories, including the holy city of A! Quds, \nand the guaranteeing of the inalienable national \nrights of the Palestinian people, namely, their \nright to return to their homeland, Palestine; \ntheir right to determine their own fate without \nforeign interference; and their right to \nestablish an independent State on their national \nterritory, under the leadership of the PLO.\nFurthermore, we believe that a sincere use of the \nway courageously opened by the Twelfth Arab \nSummit Conference, held at Fez in September of \nthis year, will allow the international community \nto restore its image in the eyes of the \nPalestinian people and of history. We say that in \nthe hope that the constructive peace proposals \nunanimously adopted at Fez will be accepted by \nIsrael and will not suffer the same fate which \nSouth Africa dealt to the United Nations plan for \nNamibia\u2014another situation which persists and \nseriously concerns my Government owing to the \nthreats it represents for the security of the \nAfrican continent and for world peace.\nThe situation prevailing in Namibia is known to \neveryone. It is a situation which is clearly \nillegal and exceptionally painful for the \nNamibian people which is enduring it and fighting \nfor its freedom; it is painful for the front-line \nStates which, because of their support for that \nliberation struggle, expose themselves to \nrepeated acts of aggression by South Africa; and \nit is painful for the United Nations, which has \nan historic direct responsibility for Namibia. \nInspired both by its own foreign policy and the \nprinciples of the Organization of African Unity \nof the Niger intends, just as all of independent \nAfrica, to draw attention once again to that \nsituation and to the proposal of a rapid solution \nfor the Namibian problem. It does so in the name \nof law and legality, in the name of morality and \njustice, and for the benefit of peace and \ninternational security.\nThe hope raised by the United Nations plan for \nNamibia has still not been realized. In spite of \ninformation showing notable progress in \nnegotiations for the implementation of the \nprovisions of Security Council resolution 435 \n(1978), we note that five years after the \nadoption of that plan by the United Nations the \nelectoral system has not yet been defined, the \ncomposition of the United Nations forces has not \nyet been agreed upon, and the cease-fire has not \nyet been decreed.\nDuring this time South Africa has, with impunity, \ncontinued its illegal occupation of Namibian \nterritory, its pillage of its natural resources, \nand its outrageous acts of aggression against \nneighbouring countries. Through manoeuvres which \nnow no longer deceive anyone it is attempting to \npromote the establishment of institutions and \nbodies which would alter the authenticity of \nNamibia's independence into something artificial.\nThe racist minority regime of Pretoria, \nstrengthened by solid complicity, continues to \nflout and defy the international community under \nfallacious pretexts and with unreasonable \ndemands. Therefore the United Nations is \nconfronted with a deadlock in Namibia, \nresponsibility for which lies entirely with South \nAfrica\u2014and no consideration, in particular one \nrelated to Angola's sovereignty, can hide that \nfact which was emphasized on 4 September at \nLusaka by the heads of State and Government of \nthe front-line States.\nThe Government of the Niger reiterates most \nenergetically its condemnation of the illegal and \ncontinued occupation of Namibia by South Africa \nand its repeated acts of aggression against the \nfront-line States. We hope that the international \ncommunity will display the necessary upsurge of \npolitical will to lead Namibia to independence \nand thus allow the surrounding countries to work \nfor their own economic and social development. In \nthis context, it is important for the United \nNations to think about establishing a massive aid \nprogramme for those countries which today are \nheroically bearing the burden of the unjust war \nimposed upon them by the racist regime in \nPretoria.\nThe African peoples also expect of the \ninternational community in general and from the \nUnited Nations in particular energetic action to \neradicate the apartheid and racial discrimination \nthat are rife in the southern part of the African \ncontinent. They fervently hope and wish for the \nestablishment in South Africa of political \nconditions that would allow everyone, without any \nconsideration as to race, sex, language or \nreligion, to participate in the building of a \nmultiracial community like the one which is today \nbeing built in Zimbabwe, a country which formerly \nsuffered from the evils of racial discrimination. \nThe achievement of such conditions will allow the \nAfrican countries to devote their efforts to the \nimprovement of the living conditions of their \npeoples at this particular juncture in the \ninternational economic situation when things are \nalready particularly difficult and continue to \nworsen.\nThe world economy is today in a critical state of \ndisruption which many meetings held in various \nparts of the world on the question have not been \nable to prevent. Those stages\u2014New York, Geneva, \nVienna, Paris, Cancun, Versailles and many \nothers\u2014have been glimmers of Hope quickly dashed. \nThe disintegration of the economy has reached \nsuch levels that any prognosis today would be \ndaring or haphazard. No one is attempting to do \nthat, neither Governments nor even international \nfinancial and economic institutions. Everywhere \nin the world one envisages the future with \npessimism. In this climate of gloom, concern and \nalmost panic, the fate of developing countries, \nand especially the poorest among them, is \nparticularly alarming.\nAs channels for a limited group of export \ncommodities, developing countries today are \nfacing a marked deterioration in their terms of \ntrade\u2014an evil which they have fought for many \nyears now without success. They are therefore \nfacing a catastrophic dwindling of their export \nrevenues. At the same time, high interest rates \non the main international financial markets and \nthe rise in the value of the dollar have \nincreased their loan and debt-servicing costs. \nThey can only watch as the standard of living of \ntheir peoples drops sharply owing to galloping \ninflation.\nTheir export revenues have plummeted, the cost of \nborrowing and servicing the debt has soared; they \nhave been compelled to slow down the pace of \nimplementation of their development programmes\u2014or \nto make agonizing revisions. In some cases that \nhas led to the cancellation of those programmes; \nin others, such as Chad, the effects of a long \nand disastrous war, added to those of the \neconomic crisis, have created an even more tragic \nsituation which only a vast international \nprogramme can remedy.\nThat is the very similar picture which we find, \nwith varying degrees of intensity, in the world \neconomy today, from North to South, East to West, \nin the countries of the periphery as well as \nthose at the centre. The destabilizing effects, \ninternally and internationally, of such a \nsituation can be easily foreseen. In this \nconnection and stressing that this difficult \nsituation largely stems from the fact that \ninternational financial and economic structures \nhave not adapted to the demands of the present \nworld, President Seyni Kountche said the \nfollowing at the thirty- sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly:\n\\\"We shall spare the world from a very damaging \neconomic confrontation only if together we \noverhaul North-South relations and work together \nfor a more unified approach to the development of \nthe world and for the well-being of mankind.\\\"\nThe wealthy countries should become aware of that \nrequirement and, although they, too, are affected \nby the crisis, they must understand that the \nrecovery of their economy for which their \ncitizens long require decisive action in favour \nof developing countries. The modalities of such \naction e been laid down by representatives in \nvarious international forums from Cancun to \nToronto; but, for various reasons, the proposals \nthat have been made have not been completely \ntaken into account. People continue to maintain \nthat a considerable increase in the capital of \nthe two main international financial institutions \nis not needed. Some even continue to advocate \nlimiting the relevant credit facilities for \ndeprived peoples. There is certainly a basically \nnegative and selfish attitude involved; it is \nembodied in the position of those who prevent ail \nprogress towards the establishment of a more just \nand equitable new international economic order.\nThe various economic conferences held in recent \nyears, both within the framework of the United \nNations and in other international bodies, have \nall shown the need for a reorganization of the \npresent international economic and financial \nstructures. In the light of the serious crisis \nwhich is shaking the world economy today, a \nrestructuring of the present order has become a \ncategorical imperative if we wish to spare \nmankind painful turmoil. We must accept the fact \nthat no nation represented in this Hall, however \npowerful it may be, can reasonably think that it \ncan do without the others. Attempts to seek \nisolated solutions to the serious economic \nproblems of our world today are unquestionably \ndoomed to failure. The concept of the \ninterdependence of nations is today more than \never before of special significance.\nIn this connection we find in the report of the \nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization \nrelevant comments on the development of United \nNations action along such lines, because no organ \nis better able than this one, despite its \ninsufficiencies and limitations, to offer the \npossibility of fostering a spirit of harmony, \ninterdependence, solidarity and co-operation \namong nations.\nI should like to pay a well-deserved tribute to \nthe Secretary-General for the clear and \ncourageous manner in which he analysed the \ndeep-rooted causes of the disorder in the present \nsystem of multilateral relations and set out \ncertain guidelines which could be used as a basis \nfor innovative action on the part of the \nOrganization to establish a world order capable \nof meeting the aspirations of the peoples to \npeace, justice, freedom and economic and social \nprogress.\nWe are ready to play our part in this major \nbattle, because we are aware that this is a \nquestion of saving the world from the cataclysm \nwhich lies in wait. As for the Niger, as has been \nstressed here by President Seyni Kountche \\\"we are \nardent supporters of peace, tireless workers for \ngood-neighbourliness and fervent apostles of \ndialogue and understanding among nations\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "First I should like to congratulate the President \nof the thirty-seventh session of the General \nAssembly on his election. I am quite sure that he \nwill carry out his functions as President with \ngreat success. I should also like to pay a \ntribute to his predecessor, Mr. Kittani of Iraq, \nwho presided over the last session with \ndistinction and leadership. I wish, too, to join \nin congratulating the Secretary- General. \nAlthough he has not yet been one year in office, \nhe has already established a justly deserved \nreputation for integrity and for his efforts to \nmake the United Nations a more effective \ninstrument for peace.\n2.\tI want also to associate myself with the \nviews already expressed by my colleague the \nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark, Mr. \nElle- mann-Jensen, on behalf of the 10 member \nStates of the European Community, to which \nIreland belongs.\n3.\tAs we begin this annual session of the \nGeneral Assembly the international outlook is \ngloomy, even more gloomy than it was one year \nago. Over the past year relations between the \nmajor Powers have deteriorated and this has had \nan adverse effect on many other aspects of \ninternational life. Furthermore there are at this \nmoment several wars and conflicts taking \nplace\u2014between Iran and Iraq, between Ethiopia and \nSomalia, in Afghanistan and in Central America. \nIn recent months the world has also seen a war \nthat should not have happened over the Falkland \nIslands and an invasion of Lebanon by Israeli \nforces which has led to tremendous loss of life \nand brought great tragedy in its wake.\n4.\tAt the world level the arms race \ncontinues, and the level of nuclear armaments is \ngreater than ever before. Conventional armaments, \ntoo, are a major item in world trade. They now \noccupy second place after oil. And these are \nweapons which are actually being used in conflict \nin many parts of the world.\n177\n5.\tIn economic matters, too, the world \noutlook is exceedingly gloomy, more gloomy \nperhaps than it has been for many years. The \nmajor industrialized coun\u00actries are suffering \nthrough a serious recession, with high \nunemployment, inflation and high interest rates. \nThe less developed countries are poorer than ever \nbefore, and many relatively prosperous countries \nwhich appeared to have good economic prospects \nhave now run into major difficulties. These \ntrends, if left unchecked, could threaten the \nstability of the whole international monetary \nsystem.\n6.\tIt is clear that the problems facing the \nworld community in this month of September 1982 \nare indeed formidable. In many areas of \ninternational life it would be no exaggeration to \nspeak of the present situation as one of serious \ncrisis.\n7.\tWhat of the means available to the world \ncom\u00acmunity to deal with these serious and \ncritical problems? How effective are the \nOrganization and the procedures which have \nevolved since the Second World War in promoting a \nsense of community and a common response to \ninternational problems?\n8.\tHere too, I believe, we can speak of a \ncrisis. The events of the past year, and of the \npast six months in particular, seem to many \npeople around the world to have called most \nseriously into question the effective\u00acness and \nrelevance of the whole United Nations system as \nan instrument for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security and for the \ndevelopment of inter\u00acnational co-operation.\n9.\tWe have available to us at the beginning \nof this session a most important document: the \nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of \nthe Organization. It is, I venture to say, one of \nthe most important documents of recent years. \nIreland is extremely grateful to the \nSecretary-General for his analysis, his insight \nand his courage.\n10.\tI know that many important problems are \nalready on the agenda or will be raised in the \ncourse of the session. But I strongly believe \nthat in a deeper sense the real question before \nus at this the 1982 session of the General \nAssembly is how we respond, individually and \ncollectively, to the very basic issues raised by \nthe Secretary-General in his report.\n11.\tThe report itself is short, and all of it is of interest, but the \ncore of the report is a serious warning that the \nworld is now embarked on an exceedingly dangerous \ncourse and that we are perilously near to a new \ninternational anarchy. The present crisis in the \nmultilateral approach in international affairs \nand the crisis of confidence in the United \nNations as an instrument for the maintenance of \npeace and security are evidence of this. I \nbelieve the Secretary-General was right in his \nwarning that the most urgent goal at present is \nto re-establish the fundamental concept of the \nCharter of the United Nations: that of collective \naction for peace and security.\n12.\tWe all need to remember that the United \nNations in its origins was not simply an \nidealistic concept. It was a serious organization \nof States with a very serious purpose. It grew \ncut of one major war\u2014the most disastrous in human \nhistory\u2014and it was designed to prevent another. \nIt began as an organization of limited \nmembership, but it has now become an almost \nuniversal world body, and it must be strengthened \nand made more effective if it is to deal \nadequately with world problems.\n13.\tI have little doubt that most, or perhaps \nall, of us who come here to this rostrum to speak \nduring the next few weeks of general debate win \nspeak highly of the Secretary-General's report. \nThis is what it merits. He has clearly identified \nfor us the problems, and he has gone farther by \npointing \u00abut and proposing a whole series of \nmeasures which, if implemented, would do much to \nimprove the capacity of the United Nations to \nkeep the peace and to serve as a forum for \nnegotiations. On behalf of my Government, I \nwarmly endorse his ideas and proposals. in \npar\u00acticular, I agree with him when he urges a \nmore sys\u00actematic use of the Security Council; a \nmore active approach to conflicts so that it is \nnot left to the judgment of the conflicting \nparties whether or not the matter should be \nraised in the Council; a greater use of \nfact-finding missions and missions of good \noffices; and a greater use by the \nSecretary-General himself of his power under \nArticle 99 of the Charter to bring issues to the \nattention of the Security Council. These, and the \nmany other useful ideas in the Secretary- \nGeneral's report, should in our view be \nconsidered at a meeting of the Security Council \nheld at high political level, as the \nSecretary-General has also proposed. From such a \nmeeting could emerge an improvement in procedures \nand, far more important, a new sense of \ncommitment.\n14.\tThose are only some among the many wise \nideas which the Secretary-General has put \nforward. It is most important that he has invited \nus to debate, and to think out seriously with him \nwhat needs to be done. I think that we owe it to \nhim not simply to speak warmly of his report or \nof some of his ideas and then leave it stand as \njust another document. Rather, we must each \ncontribute what we can to the debate, and we must \nthen together ensure that the end result of all \nthis debate over the coming weeks will not be \nwords only but actions which each of us will \ntake, in so far as it is open to us to do so.\n13. In contributing to this debate on what is \nneeded to strengthen the United Nations, I want \nto emphasize three points which Ireland considers \nparticularly important at the present time of \ncrisis.\n16.\tFirst, as I have already said, we need a \nnew and continuing commitment from every Member \nState to strengthen and improve the United \nNations system and make it increasingly relevant \nand effective. A particular commitment will be \nneeded from the great Powers which are permanent \nmembers of the Security Council and which have a \nvery special role in the ' system. Ireland, for \nits part, though it is a small country, willingly \nmakes such a commitment. We will do everything we \ncan to sustain and support the United Nations. We \nwill work with others in every way open to us to \nmake it more effective.\n17.\tSecondly, there is a need to carry \nthrough this commitment in practice. That means \nthat wherever there is a situation of conflict \nbetween Member States all those involved must be \nready not only to invoke\nthe Charter, as they now do, to justify their \nactions but to use the procedures of the United \nNations to the full before resorting in the first \ninstance to their own strength to vindicate their \nrights.\n18.\tThirdly, there is a special need for the \nSecurity Council and its permanent members in \nparticular, to be willing to follow through on \nthe decisions which the Council takes in order to \nensure that they are implemented. Nothing \ncontributes more to an impres\u00acsion of \nineffectiveness and irrelevance than an inability \nor failure of the Council to do so. This has been \nparticularly evident over recent months.\n19.\tBecause of its importance, I should like \nto spell out this third point in more detail. \nUnder the Charter, the Security Council has \npower, through a whole range of measures, to \nimpose its decisions and to exercise authority. \nMany of us would like to see a greater measure of \nagreement within the Council, and among the \npermanent members, on the use of that authority \nto resolve international conflicts. We have come \nto accept, however, that there are many issues \ncon\u00accerning which the Council cannot agree in the \nfirst instance on what should be done. But, when \nthe Coun\u00accil does agree and does adopt a \nresolution in relation to a conflict, it must \nalso be ready later, if necessary, to consider \nthe measures which may be needed to ensure that \nthe decision is implemented. If the Coun\u00accil \nrepeatedly fails in this, it will soon lose all \nauthority. The case is even more obvious when, as \nhas happened several times in recent months in \nregard to Lebanon, the initial Council decision \nwas unanimous.\n20.\tThese are three points which Ireland, as \na small country which has always tried to uphold \nand support the United Nations and contribute to \nits effectiveness as best it can, would think to \nbe fundamental.\n21.\tBut what specifically should now be done, \nand by whom? I repeat that it is not enough to \ncommend the Secretary-General's report: we must \nact on it. I would hope therefore that when this \ngeneral debate is finished, and when all \ndelegations that wish to do so have stated their \nviews, there can be serious con\u00acsideration of how \nbest to proceed.\n22- In particular, I believe that it would be \nimportant ^hat the Security Council\u2014to the \neffectiveness of which much of the document is \ndirected\u2014should consider necessary action. For \nits part, Ireland, as a member of the Security \nCouncil until the end of 1982, would be willing \nto support and work for such con\u00acsideration among \nmembers of the Council with a view to finding the \nbest way to translate ideas into action. There is \nno more important task before us at the present \ntime.\n23.\tThe need to restore respect for the \nCharter and for the authority and status of the \nUnited Nations is mcst forcefully demonstrated by \nrecent events in the Middle East. The situation \nthere, already complex and seemingly intractable, \nhas been greatly aggravated by Israel's invasion \nof Lebanon and its continuing presence there. \nMany resolutions of the Security Council, despite \nthe authority which they carry under the Charter, \nhave been defied or ignored, and have remained \nunimplemented for over four months.\n24.\tIsrael's invasion of Lebanon, carried out \nin the name of its security, has brought with it \ndeath and destruction. Israel has continued its \noccupation, an occupation which, I must say in \nall candor, shows no sign of ending despite the \nrepeated calls of the Security Council; despite \nthe stated wishes of the Government of Lebanon \nand, not least, despite Israel's own claim that \nit does not covet even one inch of Lebanese \nterritory. In the past few weeks, the situation \nhas deteriorated even further. The occupation of \nwest Beirut, with the declared objective of \nmain\u00actaining law and order, has brought in its \ntrain deeds that have shocked the world.\n25.\tThe Irish Government and people are \nhorrified at the wanton murder of Palestinian \ncivilians in the Shatila and Sabra camps, and we \njoin in condemna\u00action of those who perpetrated \nthose dreadful crimes. The murder of the \nPalestinian civilians, whoever carried them out, \ntook place when Israeli forceshad assumed control \nof the area, and Israel must accord\u00acingly carry \nconsiderable responsibility.\n26.\tThe people of Lebanon have suffered much \nin recent years. They must be enabled to \nre-establish the authority of their central \nGovernment. The full sovereignty, independence \nand territorial integrity of Lebanon must be \nrestored. To this end, the Israeli forces must \nwithdraw immediately from Beirut as a first step \nto their complete withdrawal from all Lebanese \nterritory. Withdrawal by Israel from Lebanon was \nunanimously demanded by the Security Council \nnearly four months ago. We believe that all \nforeign forces whose presence has not been \nauthorized by the Government of Lebanon should \nnow leave Lebanon.\n27.\tLebanon has been a casualty of the wider \nconflict of the Middle East, and that conflict \nremains un\u00acresolved. What is now needed is real \nprogress towards negotiation aimed at \nreconciliation of two basic rights: that of all \nStates, including Israel, to exist within secure \nand recognized boundaries; and that of the \nPalestinians to self-determination and statehood, \nif they so wish.\n28.\tSuch reconciliation cannot be achieved \nthrough efforts to suppress or abridge the rights \nof other parties. The bloody events of recent \nmonths testify to that reality. The parties \nshould now accept that those basic rights must be \nreconciled within the framework of a \ncomprehensive and negotiated settlement, with the \ndirect participation of all concerned, including \nthe Palestine Liberation Organization [FLO], \nwhose role in representing the Palestinian people \nwe recognize.\n29.\tDespite the events of recent weeks, there \nis also encouraging evidence of a new willingness \nto break the deadlock which has prevented \nprogress towards a comprehensive and just \nsolution of the Middle East problem. The \ninitiative announced by President Reagan on I \nSeptember provides a significant oppor\u00actunity to \nmake progress in the direction I have out\u00aclined. \nThe declaration adopted at the Twelfth Arab \nSummit Conference at Fez  must also be regarded \nas an important and substantive contri\u00acbution to \na search for an equitable settlement. And because \nboth these developments together offer hope for \nthe future, they deserve the most serious \nconsidera\u00action by all the parties concerned.\n30.\tThe United Nations has over the years \nplayed an important and at times crucial role in \nthe search for a peace settlement in the Middle \nEast. It has served to set forth proposals and \nprinciples for a settlement; it has been a forum \nfor negotiations; and it has actively helped to \nmaintain peace through its peace-keeping and \nobservation missions. I believe that the United \nNations can and should play a role of similar \nim\u00acportance in the future. Security Council \nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) have set \ndown fundamental \u2014even if now \nincomplete\u2014principles for a settlement. These \nprinciples must be augmented and completed. The \nrecent joint initiative by France and Egypt in \nthe Security Council provides an opportunity for \ndis\u00accussion at the appropriate time on how these \nprin\u00acciples might be completed. But this \nelaboration of, so to speak, a juridical \nfoundation alone will not be enough.\n31.\tAs the Secretary-General stated in his \nreport, \\\"It is absolutely essential that serious \nnegotiations on the various aspects of that \nproblem involve all the parties concerned at the \nearliest possible time.\\\" I urge that careful \nconsideration be given to two points made by the \nSecretary-General concerning a possible role for \nthe Security Council in this regard. First, the \nSecurity Council is the only place in the world \nwhere all the parties concerned, and particularly \nIsrael and the PLO, at present sit at the same \ntable. Second, given a will by the parties to \nnegotiate seriously, it should be possible within \nthe Security Council to work out procedures and \nrules, new if necessary, to govern substantive \nnegotiations.\n32.\tRecent events in the Middle East, in \nparticular in Lebanon, have focused attention on \nthe peace\u00ackeeping role of the United Nations. The \ndevelopment of peace-keeping is, I believe, one \nof the most im\u00acportant achievements of the \nOrganization, and it gives effect in a practical \nand tangible way to the commit\u00acment of Member \nStates to the Charter. Peace-keeping activities \nhave increased in scope and significance over the \nyears and have evolved in response to the needs \nof particular situations. Precisely because the \nconcept of peace-keeping is still evolving, I \nbelieve it is necessary to keep it under review. \nIn the light of events in Lebanon in particular, \nwe should determine where weaknesses exist and \ndecide how they can be remedied.\n33.\tIreland's experience in United Nations \npeace\u00ackeeping over the years leads us to draw \ncertain con\u00acclusions about the circumstances in \nwhich it can make a useful contribution and about \nthe political and prac\u00actical conditions necessary \nfor peace-keeping to function effectively. First, \npeace-keeping operations are intended to assist \nin the control of conflict and in the search for \na peaceful solution. It follows that they are \nessentially a temporary measure and only one part \nof a peace-making process. Efforts to resolve the \ncauses of the conflict must continue. Secondly, \npeace\u00ackeeping missions must have the consent of \nthe coun\u00actries in whose territories they are \nstationed and the co-operation of all the parties \nconcerned. This dis\u00actinguishes peace-keeping from \npeace-enforcement. Thirdly, the peace-keeping \nforce must have a clear and unambiguous mandate. \nFourthly, the force must have freedom of movement \nthroughout the area assigned to it and must have \nconditions of adequate security for its \npersonnel. Fifthly, United Nations peace-keeping \noperations must at all times have firm support \nand backing of the Organization\u2014in particular of \nthe Security Council and its members\u2014 and a, \nstrong and assured financial basis.\n34. The events in Lebanon demonstrate the \nim\u00acportance of these five conditions. It is clear \nthat, in the case of UNIFIL, these conditions \nwere not fulfilled. Despite this, UNIFIL played \nan indis\u00acpensable part in controlling conflict up \nto the Israeli invasion last June. Even now \nUNIFIL, in its reduced and limited role, \nmaintains stable conditions in its area of \noperations. But this is quite inadequate. If \nUNIFIL or other United Nations forces are to play \nan effective role in assisting the Government of \nLebanon to restore full Lebanese sovereignty, \nindependence and terri\u00actorial integrity, the \nSecurity Council and the interna\u00actional community \nmust ensure that the conditions I have listed \nalready are fully observed.\n33. I should like to pay a tribute to the courage \nand devotion to duty shown by all those involved \nin United Nations peace-keeping operations, \nparticularly in UNIFIL and UNTSO. Several Member \nStates, including my own, have suffered through \nthe death and injury of their soldiers serving \nunder the United Nations Hag in the cause of \npeace. I extend my sympathy to the relatives and \nthe comrades of Com\u00acmandant Nestor and the other \nobservers killed by mine explosions in Beirut in \nthe past few days. United Nations peace-keeping \nforces have shown resilience and constant courage \nin the face of very difficult circumstances. It \nis for us to show respect for that courage by \nacting to bring about effective conditions in \nwhich they can discharge their vital task.\n36.\tIn the 1960s and 1970s, after years of \nconfronta\u00action and cold war, East and West seemed \nto be edging towards recognition of their common \ninterest in avoiding war and in promoting \nmutually beneficial co-operation.\n37.\tThe situation today is very different. \nMutual suspicion and growing confrontation have \nreplaced the cautious confidence of the 1960s and \nearly 1970s and the limited co-operation that had \nbeen achieved. The decline in the political \nrelations between East and West, particularly \nbetween the super-Powers and the alliances, has \nalso affected arms control and disarma\u00acment \nnegotiations. There will now be a further \nescalation in the arms race unless urgent and \nsustained efforts are made to reach agreement in \ncurrent nego\u00actiations.\n38.\tWe believe it is necessary to build upon \ncommon interests and to enlarge the areas whereconflicting \ninterests can be reconciled or accommodated. \nDialogue between East and West must therefore \ncontinue through bilateral and multilateral \nchannels. And if such a dialogue is to lead to \nsubstantive results, all sides must be willing to \nact with restraint and realism.\n39.\tOn the political level, the crisis of \nauthority in Poland and the sustained repression \nof elementary social and civil rights contrary to \nthe Helsinki Final Act^ undermine the credibility \nof detente. As long as those conditions remain, \nthey will hinder progress on a wide range of \nEast-West negotiations including, in particular, \nthe discussions at the Conference on Security and \nCo-operation in Europe. Likewise, the Soviet \ninvasion and continuing military occupation of \nAfghanistan must inevitably have a similar \nadverse effect.\n40.\tNone the less, it must be emphasized that \nsus\u00actained efforts at arms control and \ndisarmament are valid for their own sake. It is \nindispensable to try to contain, reduce and \nultimately eliminate the threat posed by the arms \nrace, particularly in nuclear weapons. It is also \nnecessary in the meantime to ensure that new \nweapons and technologies do not undermine or \ndestabilize the already fragile strategic \nrelationship. It follows that while the adverse \npolitical climate is bound to complicate existing \nnegotiations, arms control and disarmament \nefforts\u2014bilateral, regional and \nmultilateral\u2014should nevertheless not be \nsubordinated to the solution of wider political \nproblems.\n41.\tMy Government was very disappointed at \nthe outcome of the recent twelfth special \nsession, the second special session on \ndisarmament. But we cannot abandon efforts to \nachieve realistic goals aimed at putting an end \nto the arms race and reducing arma\u00acments\u2014both \nnuclear and conventional. World opinion, \nincreasingly concerned about the threat posed by \nnuclear weapons, demands that we redouble our \nefforts. My Government will always support \ngenuine and realistic arms control and \ndisarmament proposals.\n42.\tThe highest priority must be given to \nnuclear disarmament in order to halt and reverse \nthe ceaseless build-up of nuclear arms. It is our \nearnest hope that the negotiations between the \nSoviet Union and the United States on \nintermediate and strategic weapons will reach an \nearly and successful conclusion.\n43.\tI should like to reiterate the proposal \nfor an agreement on a moratorium on the \nintroduction of any further strategic nuclear \nweapons or delivery vehicles, proposed by the \nPrime Minister of Ireland, Mr. Haughey, during \nthe twelfth special session. The moratorium would \nbe for an initial period of two years but would \nbe renewable by mutual consent. An agreement \nalong these lines would, I believe, be a \nsignificant step towards the restora\u00action of \nconfidence.\n44.\tA comprehensive test-ban treaty, or at \nthe very least a moratorium on all nuclear tests, \nremains an urgent necessity. An end to testing \nwould slow down the rate of qualitative \nimprovement of nuclear weapons and would be a \nvaluable contribution by nuclear States to \nstopping the spread of nuclear weapons.\n43. There are, of course, many other areas in \nwhich progress must be made. I would highlight in \nparticular the need for a chemical weapons \nconvention, the banning of all weapons from outer \nspace and progress on conventional disarmament.\n46. If the outlook elsewhere is more sombre and \ntroubling than it was a year ago, the prospect \nfor Namibia seems more hopeful. The Israel \nGovernment is concerned that the momentum of the \nnegotiations to implement the United Nations plan \nfor Namibian independence should not be lost. \nIreland has fully supported the efforts of the \nSecretary-General, the contact group of five \nWestern States, the front-line States and the \nSouth West Africa People's Organiza-tion [SWAPO] \nto secure implementation now. In our view, any \nfurther delay will endanger the prospects for a \npeaceful settlement. It is vital that the \nAssembly at this session focus its efforts on \nassisting the Secre\u00actary-General to bring about a \nsettlement.\n47.\tThroughout the long history of the effort to help the people of Namibia \nwin freedom and live in peace, it has been clear \nthat a settlement through negotiation is possible \nonly if there is a sincere desire on the part of \nall concerned to achieve this. The implementation \nof the United Nations plan based on Security \nCouncil resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) \nwould enable the international community to \ndischarge its unique responsibility for Namibia \nand to demonstrate that the machinery of the \nUnited Nations can be used effectively to resolve \na major international issue.\n48.\tThe United Nations plan does not and, \nindeed, cannot contain a blueprint for the future \nrelations of all the States of southern Africa \nand it will not resolve all the issues in the \nregion. But its implementation would be an \nimportant step in that direction. If South Africa \nnow obstructs its implementation, thereby \npreventing a peaceful conclusion to the \ndecolonization process in southern Africa, it \nwill bear a heavy responsibility for the conflict \nand suffering which may follow.\n49.\tAt the root of the dangerous and tragic \nsituation in southern Africa today is the policy \nof pursued by South Africa. This system of \ninstitu\u00actionalized racial discrimination is \nunique and is rightly the object of universal \ncondemnation.\n50.\tIreland condemns South Africa's apartheid \nsystem unreservedly and we are committed to \nopposing it strongly and actively, working in \nconcert with the international community, The \npass laws, banning and detention regulations all \ncontinue to result in intense human suffering. \nThis year, when Nelson Mandela will have spent 20 \nyears in goal, we are particularly concerned at \nthe plight of political prisoners, including \nthose members of the African National Congress \nwho are currently under sentence of death. We \nurge the South African Government to commute \nthose sentences.\n51.\tThere is some evidence of increased \ndebate among the white community in South \nAfrica\u2014for example, in the search for new \nconstitutional struc\u00actures. Unfortunately, this \ndoes not address the core of the problem or the \nbasic framework of the apartheid system. The \ncrisis that South Africa faces is now so deep \nthat only a radical new approach can avert a \nfurther descent into violence.\n52.\tIn seeking to divert attention from its \ninternal problems, it seems that South Africa may \nbe endeavoring to destabilize neighbouring \nStates. We view with the utmost concern any \nactions having that objective. We will continue \nto support the efforts of the front-line States \nto consolidate their hard-won independence.\n53.\tOver the past year, conflicts in Latin \nAmerica were also a matter of concern to the \ninternational community. In the view of my \nGovernment, the armed conflict over the Falkland \nIslands (Malvinas) earlier this year was an \nunnecessary conflict. We very much deplore the \nuse of force contrary to the principles of the \nCharter, the failure to comply with Security \nCouncil resolution 502 (1982) and the fact that a \npeace\u00acful solution offered through the United \nNations did not prove possible. It is our hope \nthat the parties will be able actively to pursue \na peaceful settlement of their continuing dispute.\n54.\tThe Irish Government and people are also \ncon\u00accerned at the instability, the violence and \nthe viola\u00actions of human rights in Central \nAmerica. We are convinced that it is necessary to \nremedy the under\u00aclying economic and social causes \nof tension in the area, to end all foreign \ninterference and to seek political solutions to \nconflicts in the area through dialogue and \nnegotiations.\n55.\tThere is a growing acceptance that the \ninterna\u00actional community has a responsibility for \nthe remedy of serious human rights abuses. I \nwelcome the personal commitment repeatedly \nexpressed by the new Secretary-General to the \nhuman rights program of the United Nations and \nhis efforts to strengthen the Secre\u00actariat in \nthat field.\n56.\tIt is necessary for continued progress \nthat inves\u00actigations of human rights abuses \nshould be seen to be fair. It is also important \nthat States concerned in investigations should \nco-operate with the Secretary- general  or other \nappointed personsin the implementa\u00action of our \ndecisions, bearing in mind the primary \nresponsibility of States to ensure that human \nrights are respected within their own areas of \njurisdiction.\n57.\tThe Declaration on the Elimination of All \nForms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based \non Religion or Belief, adopted last year by the \nGeneral assembly is an important addition to the \nseveral human rights instruments adopted since \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights in \n1948. Ireland believes that further steps should \nbe taken to draw the attention of the peoples of \nthe world to this Declaration.\n58.\tIn the historical perspective, we have \nindeed seen considerable progress in the area of \nhuman rights. But serious violations of human \nrights in many parts of the world continue to \naffront our sense of the value of the human \nperson. Massacres of large numbers of innocent \ncivilians have taken place recently in Lebanon, \nGuatemala and E! Salvador.\n59.\tThere are other countries where we have \nless certain knowledge of such appalling \nviolations of the right to life but where there \nis reason to believe that such violations do \nindeed take place. There are still other areas \nwhere civil and political rights are suppressed \nsporadically or even on a systematic basis. \nAbuses of human rights, such as disappearances, \nare a most troubling recent feature.\n60.\tA general report by the Secretary-Genera! \non the international human rights situation to \nthe As\u00acsembly at regular intervals could help the \ninternational community to recognize at an early \nstage the emer\u00acgence of a pattern of such abuses \nand thus to take effective action against them;\n61.\tThe world at present has major problems \nin the economic field. Of particular importance \nis the problem of development, which is at once a \npolitical and an economic issue. Because of this \nand because of its universal nature the United \nNations has a vital role to play in the \nNorth-South dialogue. There is an urgent need to \npromote the changes necessary to redress the \nstructural imbalances in the world economy and to \naccelerate the rate of growth in developing \ncountries.\n62.\tThe economic difficulties facing all \ncountries remain serious and are likely to \ncontinue for some time. Large fiscal deficits, \nconcern about inflation and tight monetary \npolicies have raised real interest rates in the \nindustrialized countries to unprecedented levels. \nThese measures have far-reaching conse\u00acquences, \ndepressing the export earnings of hard- pressed \ndeveloping nations and curtailing their already \nlow growth rates. Low-income countries have been \nparticularly hard hit by the recession in the \nindus\u00actrialized countries. Poverty, malnutrition, \ndisease and illiteracy remain daily realities for \nthe vast majority of the world's population.\n63.\tIreland fully supports the central role \nthat the United Nations system has to play in any \nrealistic program for global recovery. In \nparticular, we urge that the challenge of \nfurthering and deepening the relationship between \ndeveloped and developing nations be met by the \nearly launching of global negotiations. We \nbelieve that the industrialized nations must now \ndo everything possible to ensure that a new and \neffective dialogue with the developing countries \ngets under way.\n64.\tIn the longer term we look to the sixth \nsession of UNCTAD in June of next year to improve \nunder\u00acstanding of the real problems of developed \nand devel\u00acoping countries, to promote the revival \nof the interna\u00actional economy and to give a new \nimpetus to the progress of developing countries.\n65.\tI am pleased that the lengthy work of the \nThird United Nations Conference on the Law of the \nSea has been concluded with the adoption by the \noverwhelming majority of the States represented \nhere of the text of the Convention on the law of \nthe sea.^ It is indeed an achievement of which \nthe United Nations can be justly proud. Our task, \nhowever, is not finished. The adoption of the \nConvention is only the first step in the process \nof giving to the provisions of the Con\u00acvention so \npainstakingly negotiated the status of generally \naccepted guiding rules for theorderly use of the \nseas and their resources. In the course of the \nnegotiations it was constantly stressed by all \nthe parties involved that the Convention is a \ncarefully balanced package which should not be \nthe subject of piecemeal acceptance by States.\n66.\tWe must now ensure that the integrity of \nthis comprehensive Convention is maintained. We \nmust also ensure that the new international body \nwhich it established, the International Sea-Bed \nAuthority, can begin to function at an early \nstage. It is the hope of my Government that such \nwill be the support for the ' Convention that the \nPreparatory Commission for the International \nSea-Bed Authority and for the Interna\u00actional \nTribunal for the Law of the Sea can be convened \nquickly to facilitate the smooth functioning of \nthe Convention and the effective operation of the \nbodies which it establishes.\n67.\tI therefore urge all Member States to \nsupport the Convention and endorse its provisions \nby signing it at the earliest possible time. It \nis the intention of the Irish Government to do so.\n68.\tI would like now to turn to a particular \ndifficulty which we face in Ireland and in \nrelation to which I ask for your sympathy and \nyour understanding. I refer to the Northern \nIreland situation.\n69.\tI do not need to dwell on the tragic \neffects of the continuing unrest in Northern \nIreland. Since the out- break some 12 years ago \nof the present cycle of violence, up to 2,400 \npeople have been killed and over 25,000 people \nhave suffered serious injury. The destruction of \nproperty has amounted to hundreds of millions of \npounds.\n70.\tThe economy of Northern Ireland has \nsuffered heavily and remains in decline. Among \nthe worst effects, however, has been the damage \nto the social fabric of society. A new generate t \nis now growing up in Northern Ireland in \nconditions in which violence and confrontation, \nhatred and division, form part of the pattern of \neveryday life.\n71.\tNor has the burden of the unrest been \nconfined to the six countries of Northern Ireland \nalone. Death and destruction have taken place in \nBritain, and in financial terms the cost to \nBritain has been a heavy one. We in the rest of \nIreland have also suffered death and destruction, \nand the Northern Ireland situa\u00action has involved \nfor us an additional expenditure of over 100 \nmillion pounds each year on maintaining security.\n72.\tCommon sense should compel us all, if \nonly on the ground of our mutual interests, to \nseek a just and lasting settlements of this \nintolerable situation, a settlement which, if it \nis to be effective, must take into account the \nfundamental nature of the problem. The Irish \nGovernment, for its part, has declared this task \nto be its first political priority.\n73.\tThe roots of the problem lie in a complex \nof historical circumstances in which social, \nreligious, economic and political factors have \nall played their part. We believe, however, that \nin any objective analysis of the problem one \nfactor emerges clearly and inescapably: the \nconstitutional arrangements made in the 1920s \nhave failed to provide a just and workable basis \nfor peace and stability in Northern Ireland.\n74.\tThe experiment of partitioning Ireland \nhas obviously failed. The consequences of that \nfailure include the tension in Northern Ireland \nwhich has erupted into violence in almost every \ndecade since the island of Ireland was divided. \nThe development of the full economic, political \nand social potential of the island as a whole has \nbeen slowed down as a result of partition. \nBarriers have been erected where none should \nexist; the small island of Ireland has an \nartificial political division, and within \nNorthern Ireland itself a community of one and a \nhalf million people is split by dissension that \nis irrelevant to the demands of today.\n75.\tThe Irish Government, on whose behalf I \naddress you today, seeks to remove all barriers \nand divisions within Ireland. We seek to do so \nonly through peaceful means. We condemn utterly \nand reject totally violence and terrorist \nactivity no matter what its source. The \natrocities committed by men and women of violence \non all sides are inherently evil. They are also \nultimately futile and counterproductive as a \nmeans of promoting political change. They serve \nonly to increase bitterness, to deepen \nintransigent attitudes and above all to post\u00acpone \nthe day of settlement. The road to peace lies \nonly in the removal of barriers and in the coming \ntogether of all the Irish traditions.\n76.\tWe believe that the way forward is for \nthe two Governments\u2014the Government of Ireland and \nthe British Government\u2014to work together to this \nend. Two years ago we moved in that direction \nwhen both our Governments accepted, in the \ncontext of the Northern Ireland situation, the \nneed to bring forward policies to achieve peace, \nreconciliation and stability and to improve \nrelations between our two countries. This \ndevelopment and the subsequent progress in \nidentifying concrete areas of co-operation were \nwidely welcomed as holding out the hope of a new \nand positive relationship between our two \ncountries, breaking down barriers and creating a \ndialogue of understanding and good will in which \nthe Northern Ireland problem could be effectively \ntackled.\n77.\tWe shall persist in our efforts to win \nwidespread support for our policy which we are \nconvinced offers the only prospect of an \neffective long-term solution. Our objective is to \nbring about the emergence in Ireland of agreed \npolitical structures which will accommodate the \ndifferent but complementary Irish traditions.\n78.\tWe ask Britain to join with us in working \ntowards the achievement of that objective and, in \ndoing so, remove the last barrier to the \ndevelopment of normal relations between the \npeoples of the two islands. And we ask all \nGovernments represented here today to assist us \non the difficult road towards reconciliation, \npeace and stability.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to convey sincere congratulations \nto Mr. Hollai on his election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its thirty-seventh \nsession and to express our best wishes to him and \nto the officers of the Assembly for success in \ndirecting the work of the Assembly towards the \nachievement of our goals. I should like to take \nthis opportunity to express our deep appreciation \nof the great efforts made by the former \nPresident, Mr. Kittani, during the thirty-sixth \nsession and of the skilful manner in which he \nconducted its work and that of the General \nAssembly throughout its successive sessions and \nmeetings this year.\n\n151.\tThe election of the new Secretary-General \nhas been a source of pleasure to us, considering \nhis outstanding position and wide experience in \nthe work of the Organization as well as the \nrespect and appreciation he has enjoyed for the \ntasks he has performed. While expressing our \ncongratulations to Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his \nelection by acclamation to his post, we should \nlike to express our conviction that he is worthy \nof this universal trust and to wish him success \nin his important work and in realizing the hope \nthat he may achieve the important tasks entrusted \nto him.\n\n152.\tIn reviewing the international situation \nand events since the previous sessions, we must \nunfortunately conclude that the picture is \ngloomy. Most of the problems which we discussed \nare becoming increasingly complicated. The views \nand hopes which we expressed have to a great \nextent not been realized. Many resolutions have \nbeen neither respected nor implemented. Our hopes \nfor establishing good international relations \nbased on the principles of the Charter and \ninternational law are still far from being \nachieved, and the United Nations\u2014as the \nSecretary-General indicated in his report on the \nwork of the Organization\u2014has not been able to \nplay its effective and decisive role as envisaged \nin the Charter, thus frustrating the hope that \nthe Organization would be capable of maintaining \npeace and security and serving as a forum for \nnegotiations. We must endeavour to put an end to \nthis deviation from the Charter, to adhere ,to it \nand to its principles, and to revive the concepts \ncontained in it, which requires making a \ncollective effort towards establishing peace, \nthereby strengthening the ability of the United \nNations to perform its basic, function.\n\n153.\tThe list of problems before the Assembly \nat this session is, as usual, diverse, \ncomplicated and long,, but we believe that such a \nlist should not lead us to despair or make us \ngive up endeavours towards the achievement of \nwhat we believe is right and fair. We have ho \nalternative but to continue our efforts and \nco-operation towards achieving the objectives \nthat we set ourselves, including in particular \nthe establishment of peace based on justice.\n\n154.\tAs at previous sessions, the Middle East \nproblem, whose central issue is the Palestinian \nquestion, is the most urgent problem before us. \nWe all know that the main obstacle to the \nsolution of this problem is not the lack of \nefforts exerted within and outside the United \nNations to solve it, but, first and foremost, the \ncontinued Israeli defiance of the will of the \ninternational community, Israel's flouting of the \nvery principles governing the Organization.\n\n155.\tThis defiance of international public \nopinion and flouting of the Charter and \nresolutions is a serious matter, and the time has \ncome to deal with it. Otherwise, the law of the \njungle will prevail in international relations, \nand the remnant of confidence and hope of finding \na peaceful solution to this problem, based on the \nprinciples of international law and justice, will \ncollapse. This will also weaken the \nOrganization's ability to find peaceful and just \nsolutions to the disputes brought before it, as \nthe Secretary-General stressed in his report.\n\n156.\tThe Sultanate of Oman is an advocate of \npeace, and the people of our region, who have \nsuffered war and instability for a long time, \nlook forward to an era of security and stability. \nThe peace that we seek is a peace based on \njustice and on the principles adopted by the \nOrganization. We seek a just and lasting peace \nthat would put an end to the tragedy of the \nPalestinian people and would realize their \nlegitimate rights to return to their home and to \nself-determination. That is why we have \nsupported, and continue to support, all the \nefforts aimed at establishing peace in the \nregion. The Twelfth Arab Summit Conference, in \nwhich we participated, laid the basis and \nprovided the guidelines for a peaceful and just \nsolution to the Middle East problem. Furthermore, \nthe eight principles representing the Arab \nframework for solving this problem not depart, in \ngeneral or in details, from the principles that \nhave already been approved by the United Nations.\n\n157.\tThe recent initiative of Mr. Reagan, the \nPresident of the United States of America, \ndirected to solving the Middle East problem \ncontains positive points that might contribute to \nthe efforts being made to settle this problem.\n\n158.\tThe peace initiative of the Arab States \nand President Reagan's initiative create together \na climate conducive to finding a permanent and \njust settlement to the problem. We should take \nadvantage of it and develop it, and the negative \nattitude of Israel should not be allowed to \nundermine our efforts. However, the Israeli \npersistence in frustrating all international \nefforts and rejecting all proposals for forward \nfor solving the problem have led States to \nbelieve in the inevitability of the use of force \nin solving political problems involving Member \nStates. This is a very serious matter.\n\n139. The Israeli aggression against the Arab \nsister State of Lebanon, resulting in the \noccupation of Lebanese territories and violation \nof Lebanon's sovereignty, demonstrates to the \nwhole world that Israel believes only in the use \nof force, and not in peacel Therefore, the \ninternational community must once again censure \nthese brutall actions and demand that Israel \nwithdraw its forces from Lebanon immediately, \nand, further, that it assist the Lebanese people \nto realize their hopes of stability and security.\n\n160.\tOn 20 September 1982 the Ministry of \nForeign Affairs in Oman issued the following \nstatement about the events in Lebanon:\n\n  The Sultanate strongly denounces the barbaric \nmassacres which have been committed and are being \ncommitted by Israel against unarmed Palestinian \nrefugees, men, women and children, in the Sabra \nand Shatila camps in west Beirut.\n\n  These genocidal massacres are a flagrant \nviolation of international law and the Charter of \nthe United Nations. They are a dangerous \ndevelopment, since they have contravened the \nspirit of peace and escalated tension and \ninstability in the area. They recall the mass \nslaughter of Palestinians committed at Deir \nYassin and Kafr Qasem by the Israeli authorities \nin 1948.\n\n  Israel's invasion of west Beirut and its \nmassacre of defenceless Palestinian refugees, old \nmen, women and children, were part of a policy of \naggression and expansion which the Israeli \noccupation authorities were implementing, with \ncivilians as their victims. Their actions have \ndefied all human values and international mores.\n\n  Oman calls on the leaders of the world and the \nStates which were responsible for the evacuation \nof the Palestinian fighters from west Beirut, as \nwell as the international pubic and international \nand humanitarian organizations, to shoulder their \nresponsibilities fully at this crucial stage so \nas to stop the inhuman slaughter of Palestinian \nrefugees.\n\n161.\tThe withdrawal of Israel from the whole \nof Lebanon should be carried out immediately in \naccordance with the relevant Security Council \nresolutions. We express our hope that the return \nof the multinational peace-keeping force to \nLebanon after supervising the departure of the \nPalestinian fighters will help the Lebanese \nGovernment exercise sovereignty over the whole of \nLebanon.\n\n162.\tThe continuance of military conflict \nbetween the two neighbouring States of Iraq and \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran is a source of \nconcern and instability for the entire Gulf \nregion and represents a threat to all the peoples \nthere, and indeed to world peace and security, \nsince it involves innumerable dangers and is \nexhausting the greater part of the natural and \nhuman resources of those two States, resources \nwhich could be channelled into economic and \nsocial development.\n\n163.\tWe cannot but associate ourselves with \nthose who have called for an immediate end to \nsuch human and economic waste and urge that a \npeaceful settlement between the two sister States \nbe brought about as quickly as possible.\n164.\tWe welcomed the declaration by Iraq, \nwithin the framework of the League of Arab \nStates, that it would withdraw its forces from \nIranian territory to the international boundaries \nand was; ready to enter into negotiations to end \nthe war. On the same principle and in the \ninterest of peace and stability in the Gulf \nregion, we urge the sister State of Iran to stop \nthe war and move towards a peace which will take \naccount of the legitimate rights of all the \npeople.\n\n165.\tDespite the numerous United Nations \nresolutions demanding the withdrawal of Soviet \ntroops from Afghanistan, the reiteration of the \nsame demand by the Islamic Conference and the \nConference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of \nNon-Aligned Countries, which was held at New \nDelhi, and the insistence on respect for the \nindependence, sovereignty and non-aligned status \nof Afghanistan, Soviet troops continue to occupy \nMoslem non-aligned Afghanistan in complete \ndisregard of the resolutions of the United \nNations and other international and regional \norganizations concerned with this matter.\n\n166.\tWe call once again from this rostrum for \na cessation of the Soviet aggression and the \nimmediate withdrawal of the Soviet troops so as \nto enable the sister State of Afghanistan to \nregain control over its destiny and to choose its \nown political, economic and social system without \nany foreign interference or coercion.\n\n167.\tIn the context of the problem of western \nAsia we cannot ignore the deteriorating situation \nin the adjacent region of South-East Asia, \nnamely, the continued occupation of Kampuchea by \nVietnamese troops. In this connection, we hope \nthat at this session the Assembly will stress the \nneed to respect the Charter and the principles \nembodied in it and the need to find a speedy and \npeaceful political solution based on the \nprinciples of non-interference in the internal \naffairs of sovereign States and the non-use of \nforce, as well as the necessity for the immediate \nwithdrawal of foreign troops, so that the \nKampuchean people may determine their own destiny \nfree from foreign interference and this region \nmay enjoy peace.\n\n168.\tOman has a historical relationship with \nmany of the countries and peoples of the African \ncontinent. We therefore share the aspirations of \nthe peoples of the continent and their hope for a \nsolution to the grave problems in southern \nAfrica, particularly that of Namibia. We join the \nAfricans in denouncing racial discrimination and \nwe call for further efforts within and outside \nthe United Nations to ensure that the aspirations \nof the African people to freedom and stability \nare fulfilled.\n\n169.\tBecause of its geographical position the \nSultanate of Oman is directly concerned with \nevents in the Horn of Africa. It regrets the \ncontinued attempts to interfere in the internal \naffairs of the region. It condemns the acts of \naggression against the Somali sister State and \ndemands an end to foreign intervention in the \ninternal affairs of that region lest it should \nfall victim to foreign expansionism and attempts \nto propagate social systems imported from abroad; \nfoisting them upon the people of the area with a \nview to exploiting their resources.\n\n170.\tOur concern with events in the Horn of \nAfrica is closely associated with the security \nand safety of the coastal States of the Indian \nOcean. The Sultanate of Oman, as one of those \ncountries, is concerned for the security of this \narea and is therefore in favour of declaring it a \nzone of peace, It calls for an end to the \ncompetition between the super-Powers to establish \nspheres of influence in the region. As a member \nof the Ad Hoc Not Committee on the Indian Ocean, \nOman is anxious to promote the efforts to arrange \nfor the convening of the Conference on the Indian \nOcean, which is scheduled to be held in Colombo \nin 1983, so that the goal of making the Indian \nOcean region a demilitarized zone of peace may be \nachieved without further delay.\n\n171.\tMy delegation would like to express its \nsatisfaction at the adoption by the General \nAssembly at its thirty-sixth session of the \nDeclaration on the Inadmissibility of \nIntervention and Interference in the Internal \nAffairs of States. It hopes that this \nDeclaration, which emphasizes respect for this \nimportant principle, will be complied with, thus \nguaranteeing the right of all peoples to shape \ntheir own destinies and choose their systems of \ngovernment without any outside intervention, \npressure or threat.\n\n172.\tOman, like other peaceful States, \nattached great hopes and importance to the second \nspecial session devoted to disarmament. We had \nentertained the hope that the negotiations and \ndeliberations conducted during that session would \nbe successful; but, as we all know, failure to \nreconcile the different points of view made it \nimpossible to reach consensus on the major items \non the agenda of that session, in spite of the \npreparatory meetings. We entertained the hope \nthat the second special session would put into \neffect the Final Act of the Tenth Special Session \nof the general Assembly, which was adopted by \nconsensus in 1978. In paragraph 126 of the \ndocument the Members of the Organization \nreaffirmed:\n  their determination to work for general  and \ncomplete disarmament and to make farther \ncollective efforts aimed at strengthening peace \nand international security; eliminating the \nthreat of war, particularly nuclear war; \nimplementing practical measures aimed at halting \nand reversing the arms race; strengthening the \nprocedures for the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes; and reducing military expenses and \nutilizing the resources thus released in a manner \nwhich will help to promote the well-being of all \npeoples and to improve the economic conditions of \nthe developing countries/'\n\n173.\tThe failure of the negotiations at the \nsecond special session and the subsequent \ndisappointment to many parties are deplorable and \nregrettable. Nevertheless, we have to bear in \nmind that the responsibility of the United \nNations in the field of disarmament is a basic \none which emanates^ as we indicated earlier, from \nits purposes and principles: to establish , the \nbases of peace and to save succeeding generations \nfrom the scourge of war. The United Nations must \nurgently continue to assume this responsibility \nfully, without hesitation or despair. It is also \nimperative to mobilize the collective will to \nreplace doubt with confidence, so that we can \nachieve positive results in this domain.\n\n174.\tIn this connection I should like to \nreiterate what the President of the second \nspecial session of the\nAssembly said. We should be ignoring reality if \nwe failed to observe that this session is being \nconvened at a turning point of the greatest \nconcern in the field of international relations. \nDoubt, conflict, an increasing sense of \ninsecurity and a tendency to resort to force \nstill prevail.\n\n173. It is imperative that the international \ncommunity now look seriously into the fabric of \nrelations among States in order to restore the \nrole of the principles of international law and \nrespect for the Charter of the United Nations, \nfor it will be impossible to achieve progress in \nthe field of disarmament without the fundamental \nelements of confidence and respect.\n\n176.\tLike many other countries of the world, \nmy country is aware of the increasing importance \nof establishing a new international economic \norder based on a fair balance between the prices \nof raw materials and manufactured products, \ntaking into account the needs of developing \ncountries and the need to accelerate their \ndevelopment. That is why my country continues to \nsupport the decisions taken by the Group of 77 \nand the efforts made by the Group in this \nconnection ever since the beginning of global \nnegotiations on international economic \nco-operation for development, endorsed by the \ngeneral  Assembly at its thirty-fourth session we \nshould like to emphasize that it is not possible \nto find any solution to such problems except on \nthe basis of a common, universally accepted \napproach to the current global economic problems \ninvolving all States, and through agreed \nsolutions regarded as permanent and fair by all.\n\n177.\tSince then, to our regret, my delegation \nhas not seen any positive development in the \nglobal economic negotiations. On the contrary, it \nhas witnessed a clear general deterioration in \nthe economic situation in many countries of the \nworld, and particularly in the developing \ncountries. The obvious decline in the developing \ncountries' terms of trade, the large increase in \nthe cost of capital, inadequate demand for those \ncountries' exports, frequent resort to the policy \nof protectionism, continued application of \nstringent and unfavourable terms for the transfer \nof technology to those countries\u2014all this has \nweighed heavily on the economies of developing \ncountries, disrupted their economic growth and \nled to a sharp increase in their balance-of \npayments deficit and foreign indebtedness.\n\n178.\tLike any other developing country, the \nSultanate of Oman feels the need for such \ninternational economic co-operation and considers \nit imperative that the developed countries \nincrease their aid to the developing countries in \norder to raise the level of development in those \ncountries, relieve their foreign indebtedness, \nand demonstrate increased flexibility and \nseriousness in the negotiations on the subject. \nThe Sultanate of Oman feels that the \ninternational community is more than ever in duty \nbound to find a solution to the present economic \ncrisis by devoting every effort to achieving the \nobjectives and goals set forth in the \nInternational Development Strategy for the Third \nUnited Nations Development Decade. We hope that \nwe shall soon witness positive results in this \ndirection in response to the efforts of the \nSecretary-General.\n\n179.\tOman participated in the adoption of the \nfinal text of the United Nations Convention on \nthe Law of the Sea, in New York on 30 April, in \nspite of the fact that the final text did not \ninclude proposals and views put forward by Oman \nduring the deliberations of the United' Nations \nConference on the Law of the Sea during the past \nfew years. We did so out of our belief that the \nConvention, in general, is fair to all and would \nput an end to the chaotic situation with respect \nto the seas\u2014particularly as to exploration and \nexploitation of the resources of the sea-bed\u2014in a \nway that would serve the interests of humanity at \nlarge without prejudice to the basic rights of \nthe coastal States.\n\n180.\tWe hope that the States which could not, \nfor one reason or another, vote in favour of the \nConvention will reconsider their positions, \nbecause that Convention is the outcome of long \nand continuous efforts exerted over the last 10 \nyears, and it would be a waste of these efforts \nnot to adopt it. Otherwise, States will resort to \ntheir former practices without any binding legal \nrestraint defining their rights and obligations \nunder the law of the sea.\n\n181.\tFinally, I should like, with reference to \nthe report of the Secretary-General on the work \nof the Organization to express my appreciation of \nhis account of the situation in the world in \ngeneral, and at the United Nations in particular. \nIt merits attention far beyond that given to \nprevious reports. It clearly and realistically \nreflects our feelings, especially with respect to \nthe developing countries which, more than all the \nothers need to see that the United Nations \nreceives the necessary support to enable it to \nfulfil the effective and decisive role clearly \nenvisaged for it in the Charter. We hope this \nreport will receive the attention it deserves and \nthat at the current session the Assembly will \nexplore effective means of eliminating the points \nof weakness in the work of the Organization, \nparticularly during the last years, so that it \nmay regain the importance accorded it by the \npeoples of the world at its inception.\n\n182.\tWe renew the pledge we made in the Preamble \nto the Charter for a serious endeavour to save \nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war, \nreaffirm our belief in fundamental human rights, \nin the equality of the rights of men and women, \nas well as of nations, large and small, and we \nrenew our commitment to the principles and \nobjectives enshrined in the Charter of the United \nNations.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I take special pleasure in \ncongratulating you, the representative of \nfraternal Hungary, on your election to the \npresidency at this thirty seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly. Your unanimous election to this \nhigh post is an expression of the general \nrecognition of the international authority and \nprestige of socialist Hungary and its peace \nloving foreign policy. At the same time it is a \ntribute to your outstanding personal qualities. \nOn behalf of the Mongolian delegation, I wish you \nevery success in the discharge of your \nresponsible mission. Your great experience in \ninternational affairs, and especially in United \nNations circles, will no doubt serve as a \nvaluable factor in the successful completion of \nthis session. At this thirty seventh session the \nAssembly faces the urgent tasks of lessening \ninternational tension and reducing the threat of \nnuclear war. The world situation has acutely \ndeteriorated as a result of adventurist actions \nof the most aggressive circles of imperialism, \nwhich have set their narrow selfish aims against \nthe onward march of history. In particular, the \nmilitary industrial complex of the United States \nof America is seeking to impose the domination of \nAmerican imperialism over the whole world and to \nestablish everywhere an order solely to its \nliking. The arms race is being intensified on an \nunprecedented scale with a view to upsetting the \nexisting military and strategic balance to the \ndetriment of the interests of universal peace and \nsecurity. Designs are being nurtured for waging \nlimited or protracted nuclear wars. Detente and \nthe principles of peaceful coexistence are being \nrenounced outright. Force and sanctions have \nbecome the principal instruments of foreign \npolicy. Attempts are being made to undermine the \nvery fabric of international relations. Resort to \nblackmail, deceit and hypocrisy have become all \ntoo common. Rhetorical statements about peace and \nstability camouflage the actions taken to \ndestabilize the situation in various regions, to \nsow distrust and enmity among peoples and States. \nUnder the pretext of safeguarding vital interests \nand national security, blatant interference in \nthe internal affairs of States, as well as acts \nof aggression and even genocide by proxies, are \nbeing perpetrated. I should like to note here \nthat such tricks are also practised by certain \ncircles on our Asian continent. In order to \nconceal their expansionist ambitions, some offer \nassurances that their country would never become \na super Power. In order to divert the attention \nof the public from their own country\u2019s increasing \nmilitary potential and from its reviving \nmilitarism, others assert that their country \nwould never become a military Power. The \nrewriting of textbooks and historical documents \nin order to whitewash the past criminal acts of \nthe militarists is another case in point. But the \nmain thing is that the militaristic circles of \nimperialism are covering up their attempts to \nstrike at the socialist community by coarse \nslander directed against the peaceful nature of \nthe socialist system. The clamour about the \nnonexistent Soviet military threat is designed to \njustify the organization of a crusade against the \nreal socialism. History knows such tactics. \nImmediately after the victory of the October \nRevolution, an armed intervention of 14 \ncapitalist States under the slogan of fight \nagainst the communist threat was launched against \nthe young Soviet Republic. And nowadays attempts \nto undermine the very foundations of the \nsocialist system in the countries of socialism \nare not abandoned, which is evidenced by the \naggressive intrigues against the Polish People\u2019s \nRepublic and the Republic of Cuba. But socialism \nhas withstood imperialist assaults and invasions \nand has now become so strong as to exert a \ndecisive influence on world events and to serve \nas a stronghold of peace, national independence \nand the social progress of nations. This is an \nhistoric gain of lasting importance for the \nfuture of mankind. The Union of Soviet Socialist \nRepublics, which celebrates its sixtieth \nanniversary this year, is thebulwark of all the \npeace loving, democratic and revolutionary \nforces. The peace loving policy and constructive \ninitiative of the socialist community have a \nfavourable and stabilizing impact on the world \nsituation and actively promote United Nations \nactivities for the maintenance of peace and \ninternational cooperation. Here I should like to \nnote also the influential role played by the \nnonaligned movement in consolidating peace and \nsecurity and in restructuring international \nrelations on an anti imperialist and anti \ncolonialist basis. We give due credit also to the \nrealistic approach of sober minded statesmen in \nWestern countries who stand for the maintenance \nand development of mutually beneficial relations \nbetween East and West and for the preservation \nand strengthening of detente. The intensified \nmass antiwar movement in the world is an \nimportant factor that promotes the objectives of \nthe United Nations in maintaining international \npeace and security. Meanwhile the following \nstriking example reveals the attitude of major \nimperialist Powers these objectives of the United \nNations. At the very moment that the first \nspecial session of the General Assembly on \ndisarmament was under way in 1978 here in New \nYork, a long term programme of an arms buildup by \nNATO was adopted nearby in Washington. And this \nyear that programme was again reaffirmed in Bonn, \nat the highest level of the NATO alliance, during \nthe second special session devoted to \ndisarmament. The peace programme for the 1980s \nput forward by the Soviet Union and the \nconstructive initiatives of socialist countries \nenvisage practical measures to curb the arms race \nand to remove the threat of a nuclear holocaust. \nUnder the present circumstances, the extremely \nfar reaching and bold step of the Soviet Union is \nthe obligation, unilaterally assumed by the \nSoviet Union at the second special session of the \nGeneral Assembly on disarmament, not to be the \nfirst to use nuclear weapons. We believe that at \nthe present session the Assembly should call upon \nother nuclear Powers to do likewise. We consider \nthat the new proposal submitted by the Soviet \ndelegation at this session rightly supplements \nthe aforementioned initiative of historic \nsignificance. The proposal and the relevant \ndocument on the immediate cessation and \nprohibition of nuclear weapon tests seeks to \nspeed up the stagnant negotiations in this field. \nThe new draft of basic provisions of a treaty on \nthe complete and general prohibition of nuclear \nweapon tests constructively reflects the views \nand observations of other States on this matter, \nin the verification issues, and thus undoubtedly \nimproves the chances for a positive outcome of \nnegotiations. The proposal to set a moratorium on \nany nuclear explosions, starting from an agreed \ndate until the treaty is concluded, can create \nfavourable conditions for achieving this vital \ngoal. The same goal is then pursued by the Soviet \nUnion, which clearly expressed its readiness to \nratify at any time, on a reciprocal basis, the \nSoviet United States treaties on the limitation \nof underground nuclear weapon tests and on \nnuclear explosions for peaceful purposes, as well \nas to resume tripartite negotiations. This \nposition of the Soviet Union is in glaring \ncontrast to the recent decision of the United \nStates Administration not to resume tripartite \nnegotiations, which has given rise to concern in \nthe world community. The carrying out of a \ncomprehensive ban on nuclear weapon tests is of \nspecial significance in putting an end to the \ntechnological arms race, preventing the \nproduction of new types of nuclear weapons, \nincluding neutron weapons. The Government of the \nMongolian People\u2019s Republic regards as timely and \nimportant the new initiative of the Soviet Union \non intensification of efforts to remove the \nthreat of nuclear war and ensure the safe \ndevelopment of nuclear energy. It is essential to \nblock firmly a new channel which could result in \nincidents of nuclear catastrophe. The General \nAssembly, in the spirit of its Declaration on the \nPrevention of Nuclear Catastrophe, should, as \nproposed by theSoviet Union, declare the \ndestruction of peaceful nuclear facilities, even \nby means of conventional weapons, to be \nequivalent to an attack carried out with the use \nof nuclear weapons. Such an action, as we know, \nwould be termed a crime against humanity. The \ntalks between the Soviet Union and the United \nStates on the limitation and reduction of \nstrategic arms, as well as medium range nuclear \nmissiles in Europe, are of decisive significance \nas regards a wide range of disarmament problems. \nThose talks, which concern the very core of the \nglobal strategic situation, will be successful \nprovided that the two parties strictly observe \nthe principle of equality and equal security. \nAttempts to evade that principle in particular, \nmanoeuvres such as the zero option are the main \nobstacle to reaching mutually acceptable \nagreements. The problem of the elimination of \nchemical weapons has of late become especially \nacute. It stems from the decision adopted by \nWashington to accelerate the development and \nmanufacture of new types of this barbaric weapon \nincluding binary weapons. The Mongolian People\u2019s \nRepublic is in favour of intensifying the efforts \nof the Committee on Disarmament so as to complete \nthe elaboration of an international convention on \nthe prohibition of chemical weapons and on their \ndestruction. Actions aimed at spreading the arms \nrace to outer space are becoming more and more \nominous. The Mongolian People\u2019s Republic is \nendeavouring in every way possible to bring about \nan early start of the work of the Committee on \nDisarmament on the elaboration of the text of an \ninternational treaty on the prohibition of the \ndeployment of weapons of any kind in outer space. \nAmong the measures for strengthening universal \npeace and security, the Government of the \nMongolian People\u2019s Republic attaches great \nsignificance to the Vienna Talks on Mutual \nReduction of Forces; Armaments and Associated \nMeasures in Central Europe. The achievement of \npositive results in those talks would have a \nfavourable effect on the improvement of relations \nbetween East and West and on the international \nsituation as a whole. A realistic approach is \nrequired of the Western partners to the \nconstructive proposals of the socialist countries \nso as to pave the way for achieving progress in \nthis field. The same stand is taken by the \nMongolian People\u2019s Republic in its approach to \nthe Madrid meeting of the participants in the \nConference on Security and Co operation in Europe \nwhich was held at Helsinki in 1975. My Government \ncommends the efforts by the neutral and \nnonaligned States taking part in the meeting that \nare aimed at working out a generally acceptable \nfinal document. It hopes that the meeting will \nsucceed in adopting a decision to convene a \nconference on confidence building measures and \ndisarmament in Europe and taking other towards \nconsolidating the spirit of the Helsinki Final \nAct. My delegation believes that a settlement of \nthe Cyprus problem on the basis of the relevant \nUnited Nations decisions and the principles of \nrespect for the national independence and \nterritorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus \nis of great importance for the cause of peace and \nstability in Europe. In Asia the largest number \nof hotbeds of tension and armed conflicts \ncontinue to exist. Developments: the Middle East \nduring the past several months prove that a delay \nin the settlement of so called local conflicts is \nfraught with dangerous consequences for the cause \nof universal peace. The armed aggression against \nLebanon and the massacre in west Beirut are the \ndirect aftermath of the Camp David deal and of \nthe so called United States Israeli strategic \ncooperation. The Government of the Mongolian \nPeople\u2019s Republic in its statement of 22 \nSeptember this year resolutely condemned Israel\u2019s \nacts of aggression and genocide in Lebanon and \nstated anew that the responsibility for the \natrocities must be borne by Tel Aviv and its \nUnited States patrons. The Mongolian People\u2019s \nRepublic demands the withdrawal of Israeli forces \nfrom Lebanon and from all occupied Arab \nterritories. The Mongolian Copies Republic, like \nthe overwhelming majority of States, advocates a \ncomprehensive settlement of the Middle East \nproblem with the participation of all the parties \nconcerned, including the PLO the legitimate \nrepresentative of the Arab people of Palestine on \nthe basis of ensuring its right to create a \nnational State of its own. Therefore my \nGovernment supports the proposal made by the \nSoviet Union on 15 September this year, which \ntakes into account the latest developments in the \nMiddle East. The Government of the Mongolian \nPeople\u2019s Republic regards as positive the \ndeclaration of the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference, held at Fez, and regards it as a \nbasis which would contribute to uniting the Arab \nworld in the interest of settling the Middle East \nproblem. For many years the situation in South \nEast Asia has remained highly tense. The reason \nfor that, we strongly believe, lies in the policy \nand practices of the imperialisms and their \naccomplices, who, in pursuance of their so called \nparallel strategic interests, seek to alter which \nemerged in Indo China as a result of the \ntriumphant struggle of the peoples of Viet Nam, \nLaos and Kampuchea against imperialist \naggression. At the same time attempts are being \nmade to incite the countries of the Association \nof South East Asian Nations to engage in \nconfrontation against the three countries of Indo \nChina and to have ASEAN transformed into a \nmilitary political bloc. Quite recently a new \nmanoeuvre concerning Kampuchea was undertaken. A \nso calted coalition Government of nonexistent \nDemocratic Kampuchea was knocked together and \nserves as a camouflage for attempts to revive the \nPol Pot regime, on whose conscience lies bloody \ngenocide against its own people. This is a new \nmachination not only against the peoples of Indo \nChina but also against peace and security in \nSouth East Asia as a whole. The Mongolian \nPeople\u2019s Republic firmly believes that all the \nproblems of South East Asia should be resolved by \nthe States of that region themselves, through \nconstructive dialogue and without any outside \ninterference. The initiatives taken by Viet Nam, \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Kampuchea in July of this \nyear at the conference held in Ho Chi Minh City \nare constructive and directed to that end. Those \nproposals and steps demonstrating good will are \nconducive to the creation of a spirit of mutual \ntrust and of favourable conditions for \nstrengthening peace and security in the region \nand for developing good neighborly relations and \npeaceful cooperation between the countries of \nIndo China and those of ASEAN. The Mongolian \nPeople\u2019s Republic has consistently supported the \njust struggle of the Korean people for the \npeaceful and democratic reunification of its \ncountry, and for the withdrawal of United States \ntroops and nuclear facilities from South Korea. \nAt present the situation in Asia is being \naggravated still further by the fact that the \nexpansionist and militarist circles of certain \nmajor Powers of that continent are being drawn \nmore and more into the orbit of United States \nmilitary and political strategy. That calls for \nthe active involvement of Asian States in the \nstruggle for strengthening peace and security on \nthat continent. My delegation notes with \nsatisfaction that a number of Asian countries are \nadvancing constructive ideas and proposals. The \nproposal made on 24 August 1981 by the Government \nof the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan points \nthe way to the solution of the situation which \nhas arisen around Afghanistan on the basis of \nrespect for the sovereignty, independence and \ndemocratic achievements of the Afghan people. In \nthat context the Mongolian People\u2019s Republic \nwelcomed the meetings between the representatives \nof Afghanistan and Pakistan, held through the \ngood offices of the Secretary General. Against \nthe background of the present situation in the \nFar East, the proposal made by the Soviet Union \nconcerning the drafting and implementation of \nconfidence building measures in that region is of \ngreat importance. The proposal made by the Govern \nment of the Mongolian People\u2019s Republic on the \nconclusion of a convention on mutual \nnonaggression and nonuse of force in relations \nbetween the States of Asia and the Pacific is in \nkeeping with this and other initiatives. The very \npurpose of our initiative is to proscribe the use \nof force in interState relations, which would \nstrengthen mutual understanding and trust in \norder that all disputes can be settled by \npeaceful means alone. We consider that dialogue \nand negotiations constitute the only reasonable \nway to solve problems of peace and the security \nof States. I should like to stress here that the \nMongolian proposal is not a mere repetition of \nthe obligation not to use force undertaken by \nStates in accordance with the Charter. It has as \nits aim the realistic implementation of that \nprinciple, with due regard for the multifaceted \npractices and the specific features of interState \nrelations in Asia. In spite of some assertions, \nthe existence of many unresolved problems in Asia \nproves that our proposal is timely. It is clear \nthat efforts for the peaceful resolution of \nconflict situations between individual States or \nin different regions specifically require the \nadoption of measures to exclude the use of force. \nWe in the Mongolian; People\u2019s Republic hope that \nthe efforts of the representatives of nonaligned \nStates, which deserve encouragement and support \nwill bring about a peaceful securement of the \nconflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of \nIran and create conditions for the establishment \nof peaceful relations in that important part of \nwestern Asia. Naturally, we realize that the \nimplementation of cur initiative will require \ntime and painstaking efforts. My delegation, on \nbehalf of the Mongolian Government, wishes to \nexpress its gratitude to all Governments which \nsupport our initiative. The Mongolian People\u2019s \nRepublic has consistently supported the efforts \nof nonaligned countries to turn the Indian Ocean \ninto a zone of peace, and we favour the convening \nof an international conference on this issue in \n1983. We consider as timely the appeal to refrain \nfrom any steps likely to complicate the situation \nin that region. A danger to international peace \nis posed by remnants of colonialism and by the \nneocolonialist intrigues of imperialist forces. \nThe racist Pretoria regime, relying on the \nsupport of imperialist circles, is seeking to \nperpetuate in one way or another its domination \nin Namibia, and it systematically commits acts of \naggression against neighboring countries. In our \nview, the Assembly at this session should once \nagain speak out in favour of the imposition of \ncomprehensive sanctions against South Africa. \nLike other countries, the Mongolian People\u2019s \nRepublic is in favour of the immediate granting \nof independence to the people of Namibia through \nits legitimate representative, SWAPO, on the \nbasis of United Nations resolutions. There should \nbe no artificial conditions or linkages. In that \nconnection, the Government of the Mongolian \nPeople\u2019s Republic most emphatically condemns \nPretoria\u2019s aggressive intrigues against the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Angola, Mozambique and other \nfrontline States. The events in the South \nAtlantic have vividly demonstrated the danger \nposed to peace by the continued existence of any \ncolonial possessions, even the smallest and \nremotest. At the same time, those events \nemphasized the urgent need to complete the \nprocess of decolonization. My delegation \nconsiders that the problem of the Malvinas \nIslands should be solved only through \nnegotiations and on the basis of the relevant \nUnited Nations resolutions on the decolonization \nof that Territory. The Mongolian People\u2019s \nRepublic supports the granting of independence to \nPuerto Rico. Moreover, it is opposed to making \nMicronesia a colonial possession. The Mongolian \npeople condemns the growing intrigues against \nrevolutionary Nicaragua and the patriotic forces \nof El Salvador. Imperialism\u2019s neocolonialist \nstrategy assigns an important place to attempts \nat splitting the OAU, which plays an important \nrole in the struggle for peace, freedom and \nindependence on the African continent. The \nMongolian delegation expresses the hope that the \nTripoli declaration of 8 August 1982 will promote \nthe cause of consolidating the ranks of the OAU. \nThe pernicious effects of neo colonialism are \nclearly shown in the economic policies of \nimperialist Powers towards developing countries. \nEconomic relations between imperialist Powers on \nthe one hand and developing countries on the \nother are characterized by exploitation and \nplundering of the latter. That is the main reason \nfor the constant deterioration of the social and \neconomic situation in newly liberated States. The \nleading Western Powers disregard the just demands \nof developing countries for a restructuring of \ninternational economic relations, and they are \npreventing the implementation of progressive \nprovisions of such important United Nations \ndocuments as the Charter of Economic Rights and \nDuties of States and the Declaration and \nProgramme of Action on the Establishment of a New \nInternational Economic Order\tThe Mongolian \nPeople\u2019s Republic is in favour of the democratic \nreshaping of international economic relations and \nof economic decolonization. The Government of the \nMongolian People\u2019s Republic condemns the attempts \nof imperialist Powers to use trade and other \nforms of economic ties as instruments of their \naggressive policy. Such a course undermines the \nvery foundation of international economic \ncooperation and results in increasing tension in \nthe world. My delegation believes that the \ncomprehensive United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea meets the interests of all \ncountries and can contribute significantly to the \ncause of strengthening peaceful cooperation among \nStates in the vast space of the world\u2019s oceans. \nThe Mongolian People\u2019s Republic advocates the \nsigning of the Convention by all States and its \nspeedy entry into force. We resolutely reject any \nactions and deals directed towards arbitrary \nutilization of the world\u2019s oceans and their \nresources in evasion or in violation of the \nprovisions of that Convention. In conclusion, the \nMongolian delegation wishes to emphasize once \nagain the urgent need to adopt measures on the \nimplementation of the Declaration on the \nStrengthening of International Security enhancing \nthe effectiveness of the principle of \nrenunciation of the use of force or the threat of \nits use in international relations. In the same \nspirit the Government of the Mongolian People\u2019s \nRepublic reiterates its stand in favour of \nstimulating the activities of the United Nations \nand its principal organ the Security Council, \nwhich bears the main responsibility for the \nmaintenance of collective security on the basis \nof strict observance of the provisions of the \nCharter. My delegation will be guided by this \npolicy in its participation in the work of the \npresent session.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election \nto the presidency of the thirty-seventh session \nof the General Assembly. I am convinced that with \nyour vast knowledge and experience in \ninternational relations you will ably steer the \nAssembly towards a successful conclusion. I \nassure you of my delegation's full co-operation. \nI wish on this occasion to commend your \npredecessor, Mr. Kittani of Iraq, for having ably \npresided over the General Assembly at its \nthirty-sixth session. I wish also to commend the \nSecretary-General for the impressive manner in \nwhich he has discharged the responsibilities of \nhis office. We wish him every success.\n\n2.\tWe are meeting once again to continue our \ncollective efforts to find solutions to world \nproblems. Since the last regular session, there \nis very little that we can point to in the \ndirection of progress that we have achieved. \nIndeed, the year has been one of the most \nturbulent in recent times.\n\n3.\tThe international community has witnessed \nnot only the perpetuation of tensions and \nrivalries, which have now become the order of the \nday, but has also watched with horror and \napprehension as some of these tensions and \nrivalries have flared into open warfare, \nresulting in loss of human life and occasioning \nuntold misery for surviving victims. The \ncontinuing armed conflict between the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran and Iraq, the conflict in the \nSouth Atlantic, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon \nand subsequent massacre of Palestinian civilians \nin the Shatila and Sabra refugee camps in Beirut, \nthe grave situation in southern Africa and the \ndeterioration in the relations between the \nsuper-Powers, among others, have been of great \nconcern to the international community.\n\n4. Of equal concern to us in Zambia is the fact \nthat so many international and regional bodies \nwhose essential purpose is to find peaceful \nsolutions to world problems have been deadlocked. \nFor example, the Organization of African Unity \n[OAU] and the countries of the non-aligned \nmovement have not been able to meet at summit \nlevel this year as scheduled. Furthermore, the \nSecurity Council, an institution which the \nOrganization established for the purpose of \nmaintaining international peace and security, has \nbeen reduced to a mere debating forum and its \nresolutions are now honoured more in the breach \nthan in the observance. We are thus drifting into \na situation where the United Nations will no \nlonger be in a position to protect the weak or \nthe humble from wanton aggression by the strong \nand the bully in our midst.\n\n5. We live under the shadow of a nuclear \nholocaust and in an era where conventional \nweapons have proliferated 'and have been \nperfected. Efforts by the Organization to bring \nabout general and complete disarmament under \neffective international control have so far not \nyielded any meaningful results. It is \nregret-table that at the second special session \ndevoted to disarmament the Assembly could not \neven adopt a document on a comprehensive \nprogramme\u2022 of disarmament. The current \ndisquieting international situation demands that \nwe rededicate ourselves to the cause 'of general \nand complete disarmament under effective \ninternational control. As recent public \ndemonstrations supportive of disarmament have \nshown, the peoples of the world are growing \nrestive and impatient at the lack of progress in \nthe field of disarmament.\n\n6. Allow me now to turn to the problems relating \nto the state of affairs in the international \neconomy. When the developing nations called for \nthe establishment of a new international economic \norder way back in the mid-1970s, their aim was \nnot to redistribute the existing wealth \nthroughout the world, thereby scaling down the \nlevel of affluence in the developed communities. \nOn the contrary, their primary concern was to \ncreate conditions that would allow them to \ndevelop their material and human potential to the \nfull and consequently eradicate poverty, hunger9 \ndisease and ignorance which are rampant in their \nown countries. Accelerated development of the \ndeveloping countries poses no threat to the \neconomies of the developed countries. It can only \nlead to the attainment of better conditions of \nJiving for an mankind and an equitable sharing \nand utilization of the resources of our one \nworld. However, our concerted attempts to bring \nabout a fair and just economic system have \nfoundered at every turn. Past negotiating \nconferences such as the Paris talks, the fourth \nand fifth sessions of UNCTAD, the third \nconference of UNIDO, the Committee Established \nunder Resolution 32/l7( on the preparations for \nthe launching of the global negotiations, and \nmany others have not yielded tangible results. \nToday the international community is in a much \nworse condition. than it was a few years ago.\n\n7. The developed countries are experiencing least \ngrowth rates, persistent and rising unemployment \nand instability in their currencies. For them the \nproblem of how to rescue their economies from \nfurther recession and possible collapse. They \nhave accordingly resorted to protectionism and \nrestrictions in trade, investments and transfer \nof resources, measures which themselves are \nexacerbating, the already fragile and declining \neconomies.\n\n8. The developing countries, on the other hand, \nare experiencing decreased export earnings \ncoupled with increased costs of essential imports \nsuch as food and energy, an escalating external \ndebt burden and a tight reserve situation. Under \nthese circumstances they have no aliern2tive but \nto reduce their overall economic activities and \nas a result per capita gross national product \ndeclines from year to year. The consequence of \nthat situation in most developing countries, \nespecially in Africa, has been an increase in the \nincidence of absolute poverty.\n\n9. These trends do not augur well for the \neconomies of either the developed or the \ndeveloping countries, especially when they \nmanifest themselves at such an early stage of the \nThird United Nations Development Decade. Here too \nwe need to review the collective decisions we \ntook two years ago when we set out the policy \nguidelines of International development Strategy \nfor the Third United Nations Development Decade. \nConcerted efforts have to be undertaken to \nreverse the present trends. The international \ncommunity has already diagnosed the world economy \nand ascertained that the remedy lies in \nstructural adjustments.\n\n10. My delegation is of the view that the \nresponsibility for promoting development and \nmeeting the needs of our peoples naturally rests \nwith national Governments. None the less. the \ninternational community, including the United \nNations system itself, should assist in \nmobilizing the resources and expertise necessary \nto help those countries in need to resolve their \nnumerous developmental problems.\n\n11. The current situation is more alarming, not \nonly because of the magnitude and dimensions of \nthe economic recession but also because of the \nerosion of international co-operation and the \nlimitations in certain policies which are \ninstituted to deal with recession. In a world of \nrising expectations and increasing communications \nbetween nations and social groups, a lack of \nresponse to the pressing demand for improving the \nquality of human life can be a real source of \nconflict not only at the national but also at the \ninternational level. In this respect, the level \nof voluntary contributions to UNDP, to mention \nbut one, has experienced a decline. There is real \ndanger that, if the present trend in voluntary \ncontributions to the various .United Nations \ndevelopment-oriented agencies continues, the much \ncherished and noble aims and ideals of the United \nNations body in this regard are likely to be \ncompromised.\n\n12. My delegation firmly believes that \ninstitutional changes and structural reforms in \nthe world economy which could contribute to \nlasting solutions to our current problems can \nonly result from a global and integrated approach \nto these problems. The global negotiations, which \nwere decided upon by the General Assembly in its \nresolution 34/138, offer the best chance to the \ninternational community to achieve the desired \nobjectives. It is through meaningful \ninter-dependence and collective action that \neconomicprogress will be achieved. We hope that \nthe global negotiations will be launched in the \nnot too distant future and that they will result \nin concrete measures which all countries will \nfind It easy to adopt, and thereby bring about \nthe necessary structural changes leading to the \nestablishment of a new international economic \norder.\n\n13. The international political agenda is made up \nof many and complex problems which equally \nprovoke grave concern and require urgent \nsolutions. Let me now briefly reiterate Zambia's \nposition in respect of some of them.\n\n14. We are concerned about the increase in the \ngreat Power rivalries in and around the Indian \nOcean. We want to see the long-delayed Conference \non the Indian Ocean, to be held at Colombo, \nconvened urgently with a view to adopting \neffective measures to fulfil the aims and \nobjectives of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean \nas a Zone of IS.\tWe support the efforts \nby  the  Organization. including the good offices \nof the Secretary-General. to find political \nsolutions and to obtain the withdrawal of foreign \nforces from Afghanistan and Kampuchea.\n\n16. We support the efforts of the Democratic \nPeople's Republic of Korea to bring about the \nreunification of Korea and once again call for \nthe immediate and unconditional withdrawal of \nforeign troops from South Korea.\n\n17. We remain steadfast in support of the \nindependence, sovereignty, territorial integrity \nand non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus. \nWe call for meaningful progress in the \nintercommunal talks and for an early agreement on \nthe withdrawal of foreign forces from Cyprus.\n\n18.\tI wish now to focus particularly on the \nquestions of southern Africa and the Middle East~ \nas well as to outline briefly Zambia's perception \nof the institution of the United Nations.\n19. The situation in southern Africa still looms \nover us as one of the major factors contributing \nto the deterioration in international relations. \nThe issues in that perturbed region are well \nknown. I wish none the less to recount them. They \nare, first, the continued illegal occupation of \nNamibia by South Africa; secondly, the policies \nand practices of apartheid of the South African \nregime; and, thirdly, South Africa's military \naggression against and its destabilization of \nneighbouring Independent African States.\n\n20. Four years have passed since the Security \nCouncil adopted resolution 435 (1978) on Namibia. \nThat resolution was welcomed by the international \ncom-munity as a practical and realistic basis for \nthe termination by South Africa of its illegal \noccupation of Namibians for the Territory's \nprocess to its long-delayed independence. To \ndate, Namibia remains under illegal South African \noccupation as the numerous efforts undertaken to \nput resolution 435 (1978) into effect have ~en of \nno avail.\n\n21. This session of the General Assembly takes \nplace against the background of renewed efforts \nto break out of the impasse over the \nimplementation of resolution 435 (1978). \nConsultations involving the South West Africa \nPeople's Organization [SWAPO], the front-line \nStates and Nigeria on the one hand and the \ncontact group of five Western States and South \nAfrica on the other have been held in the last \nthree months here in New York with a view to \nresolving outstanding issues pertaining to the \nimplementation of the United Nations plan for the \nindependence of Namibia. These consultations \nresulted in agreement on virtua1ly all relevant \nissues. The one important out-standing issue \nconcerns the electoral system to be used to elect \na constituent assembly in Namibia. South Africa \nhas not made its position known on this issue.\n\n22. It is the firm view of my Government that the \nmomentum which has been generated in regard to \nthe independence of Namibia should not be lost. \nWe wish to see the implementation process begin \nwithout further delay. South Africa should not be \ngiven any pretext to frustrate further the \nimplementation of resolution 435 (1978). We \nwould, therefore, utter a caution against the \nintroduction of extraneous issues which would \nhave the effect of delaying the independence of \nNamibia. In this regard, we reject the linkage \nthat is being insisted upon between Namibia's \nindependence and the presence of Cuban forces in \nAngola. There would be absolutely no \njustification for Namibia's independence to be \ndelayed on account of issues which are clearly \noutside the, -letter and spirit of resolution 435 \n(1978).\n\n23.\tOn the question of apartheid and minority \nrule in South Africa, my country has been \nunequivocal in condemning that obnoxious system. \nWe have repeatedly warned South Africa that a \npeople cannot be suppressed forever. Already, the \nstruggle by the non-white people of South Africa \nhas become formidable. The march is on, and no \namount of arms, mass arrests, police brutality or \ntorture will stop it until the apartheid system \nis destroyed and majority rule is established in \nthat country.\n\n24.\tIt is true that the racist regime has \nbecome more ruthless in suppressing the uprising \nby the oppressed majority, but so too has the \npeople's determination to fight that regime \nintensified. The policy of bantustanization and \nthe concept of divide and rule, whereby the \nregime is trying to play the Coloured and Indian \ncommunities against the black people by allowing \nthe former a few more privileges than their black \ncolleagues, will deceive no one. They have been \nexposed for what they are: desperate manoeuvres \naimed at perpetuating apartheid.\n\n25.\tThe oppressed people of South Africa wish \nto see the establishment of a democratic system \nof government in their country. That is a quest \nfor Justice that requires support from the rest \nof civilized mankind, including in particular \nthose countries of the Western world which invest \nheavily in South Africa, and which, through those \nstrong economic links with Pretoria, could bring \nmaximum pressure to bear on the South African \nregime to abolish apartheid and bring about \nmajority rule.\n\n26.\tLet those who have interests of any sort \nin South Africa not be blinded by the massive \nshort-term profits that they are reaping under \napartheid. It will be in their long-term interest \nto exert effective pressure on South Africa lo \nabandon the apartheid system.\n\n27.\tMy Government is also seriously concerned \nabout South Africa's continued acts of aggression \nagainst front-line and other States in southern \nAfrica. As the international community is well \naware, South African military forces continue to \nthis day to occupy part of Angolan territory in \nflagrant violation of the sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of Angola. In addition, \nSouth Africa persists in carrying out military \nincursions and cross-border raids into Angola \nunder the pretext of hot pursuit against SWAPO \nfreedom fighters. South Africa is also \npersistently engaged in clandestine and open \noperations which embrace military aggression and \neconomic subversion as well as harassment of the \nneighbouring independent African States with a \nview to destabilizing them.\n\n28.\tIt is in the light of that situation that \nI urge those who are allies of the Pretoria \nregime not only to point out the folly of its \nadventurism, but also to cease giving support to \nit. I also urge the Assembly to demand urgently \nthe complete and unconditional withdrawal of \nSouth Africa's military forces from Angola, and \nthe cessation of all its acts of aggression \nagainst and destabilization of the front-line \nStates and other neighbouring States.\n\n29.\tWith regard to the Middle East problem, I \nwish to express my Governments indignation at and \ncondemnation of the unprovoked and premeditated \ninvasion of Lebanon by Israeli forces and the \ncold-blooded massacre of innocent Palestinian \ncivilians in refugee camps. The loss of civilian \nlive~ and massive destruction of property caused \nby the Israeli invasion of Lebanon are \nreminiscent of the holocaust of the Jewish people \nthemselves in Nazi Germany, and should be \nunreservedly condemned by all peace-loving \npeoples the world over. It is ironic that a \npeople which suffered so much under Nazi Germany \ntyranny should now have become the \nstandard-bearer and apparent admirer of Nazi-type \natrocities.\n\n30.\tI wish to state that the solution of the \nproblem does not lie in the liquidation of the \nPalestinian people or in their expulsion from \nLebanon. It is foolhardy for Israel to believe \nthat it can put an end to the legitimate and \ncherished aspirations of the Palestinian people \nthrough massive use of force of arms.\n\n31.\tThe invasion of Lebanon and the massive \nloss of innocent lives in that country have \nhighlighted the urgent need to find a lasting \nsolution to the Middle East problem, at the core \nof which\u2022 lies the question of the inalienable \nright of the Palestinian people to \nself-determination and to the establishment of an \nindependent state in Palestine.\n\n32.\tWe call upon those who have the leverage \nto exert pressure on Israel to abandon its acts \nof aggression against its neighbours and to \nrecognize the rights of the Palestinian people. \nWe remain convinced that a just and comprehensive \nsolution to the problem of the Middle East should \nbe found within the frame-work of the United \nNations.\n\n33.\tThe report' of the Secretary-General on \nthe work of the Organization, which is before the \nAssembly, is incisive, frank and objective. He \nhas eloquently expressed the concerns of many \npeople all over the world who believe in the \nUnited Nations and want the Organization to be \nstrengthened so that it can meet the cha1lenges \nof the present-day world and fulfil its historic \nrole in the maintenance of international peace \nand security.\n\n34. My delegation welcomes the report of the \nSecretary-General. The events of this year above \nall require that .we take a critical look at the \npeace-making and peace-keeping role of the United \nNations, particularly that of the Security \nCouncil, which regrettably seems to have been \nreduced to the role of a mere spectator while \nsome of its permanent members have actively \npursued initiatives of their own outside the \nframework of the United Nations.\n\n35. If we truly believe in the institution-the \nUnited Nations-we cannot and should not, as its \nMember States, merely give lip service to the \nOrganization. nor should we seek to find \nsolutions based on narrow national interests to \nimportant problems of universal interest and \nconcern outside the United Nations framework.\n\n36.\tPolitical will on the part of all Member \nStates is of the essence if we are to strengthen \nthe United Nations and revitalize its role in the \nmaintenance of international peace and security. \nWe need political will to implement and strictly \nadhere to the resolutions and decisions of the \nUnited Nations. We need political will to engage \nearnestly in a constructive dialogue to examine \nand perfect the mechanisms for promoting the aims \nand objectives of the United Nations.\n\n37.\tLet me say specifically that it remains \nthe considered view of the Zambian Government \nthat all Member States should do everything \npossible to support the work of. the Special \nCommittee on the Charter of the United Nations \nand on the Strengthening of the Role of the \nOrganization. No single issue should be \nconsidered sacrosanct. The Special Commit-tee \nshould have the latitude to consider all issues \nrelevant to the strengthening of the United \nNations and enhancing its effectiveness in \nresolving the problems which trouble \ninternational relations.\n\n38. The United Nations remains the only hope for \nmankind in the long search for lasting solutions \nto the multifaceted problems confronting our one \nworld. Let us therefore rededicate ourselves to \nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations \nand do all we can to ensure that the Organization \nlives up to the expectations envisaged by the \nfounding fathers.\n"

        "file_text": "Before discussing the international situation, \nwhich this year again can only be described as \ncritical dangerous and explosive, I must \nassociate myself with my colleagues in expressing \nour sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your \nelection to the presidency of this session. Your \nreputation as a seasoned diplomat, your long \nexperience acquired in the course of a brilliant \ncareer and your deep knowledge of the workings of \nthe Organization will enable you, I am certain, \nto conduct the proceedings of the General \nAssembly with all the skill required in these \ndifficult times.\n2.\tI should like to take this opportunity \nalso to express very sincere thanks to some other \noutstanding persons, and first to Mr. Kittani, \nPresident of the thirty-sixth session, for the \nmasterful and tenacious manner in which he \nassumed his heavy responsibilities.\n3.\tOur thanks go also to Mr. Waldheim, who \nfor 10 years as Secretary-General saw to the \nproper functioning of the Organization. His \ntireless dedication and the matchless skill with \nwhich he carried out his duties deserve our \nappreciation.\n4.\tFinally, let me turn to the new \nSecretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who \nsince he assumed his functions has brilliantly \nsucceeded in convincing us all of his exceptional \nqualities and his tireless dedication to the \nservice of the Organization. I wish to reiterate \nto him our assurance of full and constructive \ncooperation on the part of the Government and \npeople of Luxembourg.\n5.\tThe sessions of the General Assembly \noffer us an opportunity each year to take stock \nof the world situation. The Danish \nrepresentative, speaking yesterday at the 8th \nmeeting on behalf of the 10 member States of the \nEuropean Community, presented the views of the \nCommunity on the world situation. It goes without \nsaying that we fully subscribe to his statements, \nso that I may confine myself to emphasizing \ncertain problems which are of particular concern \nto us.\n6.\tIn our view, the world situation has \nsteadily worsened since last year. The \nfundamental equilibriums which have dominated our \nglobe since the Second World War are breaking \ndown; the worst economic crisis since the war \ncontinues to beset us without respite; there are \nmore and more centres of conflict. Thus East-West \nrelations, which are essential in determining the \npolitical situation of the moment, continue to \ndeteriorate. Events in Poland, especially since \nlast December, have added dangerously to this \ntension, so that the process of detente between \nEast and West, which was so promising, not so \nlong ago, has suffered serious setbacks.\n7. In our view, detente can only be one and \nindivisible. Our position in this regard is clear \nand in conformity with the principles of the \nCharter of the United Nations and the Final Act \nof Helsinki. These two documents guarantee inter \nalia the right of each people to choose and \nfreely develop its own political, social, \neconomic and cultural system, as well as to \ndetermine its own laws and regulations. Logically \nthe Helsinki document refers to the necessity for \neach State to abstain from any intervention, \ndirect or indirect, in the internal or external \naffairs falling within the national competence of \nanother State, whatever their mutual relations \nmay be.\nI need not stress here that all the countries of \nEastern Europe have solemnly subscribed to the 10 \nprinciples of the Final Act. The events in Poland \nare in flagrant contradiction of those \nprinciples. The same is true of the Soviet \nUnion's invasion of Afghanistan. Such flagrant \nviolations have in no way served the process of \nstrengthening mutual confidence. Thus it is not \nsurprising that East-West relations have been \nseriously affected.\n9.\tA return to dialogue among all the \ncomponent parts of Polish society and respect for \nthe rights of self- determination of the peoples \nconcerned are essential for the restoration of a \nclimate of true and lasting detente.\n10.\tFor our part, we remain firmly attached \nto the concept of such a true detente and an \nimproving climate of confidence between East and \nWest. We hope that, in the framework of the \nConference on Security and Co operation in \nEurope, it will prove possible to achieve an \nagreement on a balanced text guaranteeing real \nprogress in all spheres, when the Madrid review \nsession resumes its work in November.\n11.\tIn view of the slowness of the process of \ndisarmament, the convening of a conference on \ndisarmament in Europe, in conditions enabling \ntangible results to be achieved, seems to us to \nbe more indispensable than ever. The \nconcentration of weapon systems on the old \ncontinent, which is by far the highest in the \nworld, has reached unacceptable proportions.\n12 In view of the disappointing results of the \nsecond special session devoted to disarmament, we \nthink that a regional approach, with a smaller \nnumber of participants, to the problems of the \nreduction of armaments might be more realistic, \nand offer better chances of achieving tangible \nresults. This does not mean that we oppose the \ncarrying out of the world-wide efforts. On the \ncontrary, the United Nations ought indeed to be \nable to play a more important role in this \nprocess than it has been able to do so far. \nUnfortunately, the second special session devoted \nto disarmament, in which so much hope had been \nplaced by millions of citizens of good faith \nthroughout the world, did not give any grounds \nfor justified optimism in this regard.\n12.\tThat special session of the Assembly, \nhowever, did have the merit of producing a \nconsiderable impact on public opinion and \nbeginning a process of creating awareness, the \neffects of which may be felt only in the medium \nor long term. We hope that the new phenomenon of \nthe pacifist movement\u2014which should be allowed to \nexpress itself freely, even though efforts are \nmade to prevent it\u2014will succeed in bringing moral \npressure to bear throughout the world to advance \nthe cause of disarmament, so vital for the future \nof humanity.\n13.\tThe nuclear nations have a special role \nin the disarmament process. I take this \nopportunity to say how much importance we attach \nto ensuring that negotiations between the United \nStates and the Soviet Union on nuclear weapons of \nmedium range lead rapidly to tangible results. We \nEuropeans are indeed the first to be concerned \nabout this type of weaponry and for us the \nsuccess of those negotiations is of primordial \nimportance.\n14.\tWe hope also that the negotiations begun \nthis year between the United States and the \nSoviet Union on strategic arms reduction lead to \nresults within a reasonable length of time and we \nare confident that the proposals of the West \nsubmitted within the framework of the Vienna \nTalks on Mutual Reduction of Forces, Armaments \nand Associated Measures in Central Europe will \nmake it possible to bring about a progressive \nreduction of military forces.\n15.\tIf disarmament is a key problem in \nEast-West relations, it is equally true of \nNorth-South relations. In this context the \nproblem is mainly one of conventional armaments \nand the disproportionate financial burden of \narmaments on the heavily burdened budgets of most \ndeveloping countries.\n16.\tHowever, the predominant issue in \nNorth-South relations is clearly the economic \nproblem. The longest and most severe economic \ncrisis since the last war has had a particularly \ndamaging effect on the developing countries, \nprimarily the least advanced. That crisis, in my \nview, is the main reason why it has not been \npossible so far, despite long and laborious \nnegotiations, to start global negotiations aimed \nat establishing a new international economic \norder.\n17.\tLuxembourg has always been, and remains, \nfavourable to the launching of global \nnegotiations. Considering the time spent on \nnegotiating merely the procedure and the agenda, \nwithout its leading to an acceptable result for \nall, this session may well be our last chance. If \nwe do not succeed in getting the process under \nway now, this ambitious and grand undertaking may \nremain a dead letter. Have we been too ambitious \nin our objectives in wishing to attack all the \nproblems at a stroke? Is an undertaking of such \ndimensions viable in these times of crisis? Are \nthere other alternatives which are less ambitious \nbut morerealistic and have better chances of \nsuccess? These are questions that must be \nanswered at this session.\n18.\tIn this regard I should like to observe \nthat if our hopes should be dashed and if global \nnegotiations do not get under way\u2014which we hope \nwill not be the case\u2014we ought not be too rigidly \nwedded to primarily theoretical concept but try \nto attack the problems from a less ambitious but \nmore concrete point of view.\n19.\tWhat is important is that we should \nsucceed in continuing the dialogue and that we \npersist in seeking a solution, whether it be \nglobal or consists of several partial phases. We \nshould not lose sight of the fact that it is the \nprinciple of interdependence that is the \ngoverning factor, interdependence in an \nincreasingly complex world.\n20.\tUnfortunately, the economic difficulties \nof today lead to nationalistic reactions and \nself-protection. The spectre of protectionism is \nonce again looming on the horizon. Have we so \nsoon forgotten that the principal cause of the \nunparalleled economic boom following the Second \nWorld War was the determined support of the \nprinciples of free trade of goods and services?\n21.\tExperience has taught us that \nprotectionism inevitably leads to a limitation of \ngrowth, indeed a reduction in the volume of world \ntrade, and to particularly damaging repercussions \non the small and weak. That does not exclude the \nfact that countries whose economies are close to \nautarchy, which of course are less seriously \naffected, do not escape the consequences of a \nworld economy in recession.\n22.\tMy country, which in view of its size is \nparticularly aware of its dependence and of \ninterdependence in general, has always been \nespecially attached to the concept of free trade \nin goods and services. I therefore take this \nopportunity to emphasize that one must not give \nin to protectionist temptations which may in the \nshort run be alluring but lead, through an \nescalation of counter-productive results, \ninescapably to a negative balance-sheet for all \ntrading partners.\n23.\tI wish also to say a word on hunger in \nthe world. This question, which is the most \nurgent of all, should have absolute priority. It \nis indeed absolutely unacceptable that in certain \nparts of the world malnutrition should be the \nrule when food surpluses are being improperly \nused elsewhere and indeed destroyed in order to \nmaintain a level of prices acceptable to the \nproducers. The right to decent nutrition is one \nof the most fundamental human rights, if not the \nmost fundamental, and should be guaranteed for \nall.\n24.\tThe United Nations and its specialized \nservices have rendered particularly precious \nassistance in all areas where hunger threatens, \nbut we must observe that the problem is far from \nbeing resolved. Perhaps we are over emphasizing \nfood aid per se , that is, the mere supply of \nfood products, whereas it would certainly be \nbetter to enable the populations concerned \nthemselves to meet their own needs.\n25.\tAfter these considerations of East-West \nand North-South problems, I should like to turn \nto the principal areas of tension in the world \ntoday. We must unfortunately observe that since \nlast year there has been a tendency for conflicts \nto increase. The unfortunately \\\"traditional\\\" \nareas of conflict have been compounded by a new \none, that of the South Atlantic.\nOn that occasion, one of the members of the \nEuropean Community was the victim of grave \nviolations of the principles of the Charter, \nnamely those of non-resort to the use of force \nand the peaceful settlement of disputes.\n26.\tMy country, itself a repeated victim of \nannexation and occupation by foreign Powers, can \nnever condone resort to force or violation of the \nright of peoples to self-determination.\n27.\tAs for the Middle East, the situation has \ndeteriorated continually since the last session \nof the General Assembly. The gravity and the \ninherent dangers of that crisis, which has \ncontinued to shake that part of the world since \nthe end of the Second World War, have been \nemphasized at countless meetings of the Security \nCouncil and at the seventh emergency special \nsession, when the Assembly met to consider the \nproblem on three separate occasions.\n28.\tThe tragic events which have continued at \nan infernal pace in Lebanon since the invasion in \nJune by Israel led about 10 days ago to the \nhorrible massacre of some 1,000 Palestinian \ncivilians in two refugee camps in Beirut. That \ncriminal and irresponsible act, just like the act \ncommitted against President-elect Bashir Gemayel, \ncan only be condemned. Like its partners in the \nEuropean Community, Luxembourg is convinced that \nthe future of the Lebanese State can be assured \nonly if all troops at present occupying the \ncountry\u2014those of Israel or the Syrian Arab \nRepublic\u2014withdraw as soon as possible.\n29.\tAs for the negotiation of a comprehensive \npeace for the region, events in Lebanon have \nshown the need for all parties to be involved, \nwhich means the Palestine Liberation Organization \nas well. The principles that should guide those \nnegotiations are, more than ever, the security of \nall States in the region, including the right of \nIsrael to exist; justice for all peoples, \nincluding the right of Palestinians to self- \ndetermination with everything that that implies; \nand, finally, mutual recognition of all parties \nconcerned.\n30.\tI would not wish to fail to welcome the \nnew American proposals announced by President \nReagan on 1 September, as well as the resolution \nwhich the heads of State and Government of Arab \ncountries adopted unanimously on 9 September at \nFez at the end of the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference [,4/37/696]. These different ideas, \nAmerican and Arab, could encourage concrete \nprogress in the quest for a just and lasting \npeace, to which the people of the Middle East \nhave aspired for so long. A necessary \nprecondition, however, is the establishment of a \nclimate of confidence which is still lacking.\n31.\tAnother dangerous and explosive conflict, \nof which there is too little discussion in the \nAssembly, is also present in the Middle East. I \nam referring to the particularly bloody war \nbetween Iran and Iraq which has led to a huge \nnumber of victims and great material damage. This \nis another dangerous destabilizing factor in the \nregion of the Middle East, which has been so \nsorely tried. It is important that reason \novercome fanaticism and that a negotiated \nsolution put an end to that blood-bath.\n32.\tIn Asia, two serious drawn out conflicts \ncontinue to be of concern. The main \nresponsibility for these\ntwo conflicts tails to a super-Power, whether it \nis guilty of direct intervention, as in \nAfghanistan, or indirect intervention, as in \nKampuchea.\n33.\tThe occupation of Afghanistan by Soviet \ntroops in flagrant violation of the fundamental \nprinciples of the Charter is now in its third \nyear, despite the vigorous objections of all \njustice-loving peoples and the courageous \nresistance of the Afghan people. We reiterate our \ndeep devotion to the right of the Afghan people \nto self-determination and its right to return to \nits previous status of neutrality and \nnon-alignment under international guarantees.\n34.\tIn Kampuchea, on the pretext of \neliminating an inhuman genocide regime, Viet Nam \nhas imposed a puppet Government upon which it \nseeks to confer legality. Without wishing in any \nway to acquiesce in the barbarous policies of the \nPol Pot Government, we remain convinced that the \ninvasion by Viet Nam is contrary to the \nprinciples of international law. We shall never \nsubscribe to the idea that it is incumbent upon a \nmore powerful neighbour to decide on the \nwell-being of another nation. We believe that it \nis high time for the people of Kampuchea, after \nsuch trials and suffering, at last to have the \nopportunity itself to decide on its own future, \nand we welcome the formation of a coalition \nGovernment as an important step in that direction.\n35.\tIn Central America, there is no end to \ndangerous tension. Although there has been some \nprogress in certain countries, the situation \nremains unstable and the peoples of the region \nare far from having achieved the kind of \ncoexistence enabling them to live in peace and \nsecurity. Interesting proposals have been put \nforward by certain countries, and we would hope \nthat they will contribute to diminishing tension \nin the near future.\n36.\tIn Africa, there are still numerous \nconflicts\u2014in Somalia, Chad or the southern part \nof the continent. Let us say at the outset that \nthe painful problem of apartheid in South Africa \nis not near to an acceptable solution. We condemn \nthis ignoble attack on the dignity of the human \nperson and we remain convinced of the imperative \nneed to abandon this policy of racial \ndiscrimination if a dangerous escalation of \nviolence in southern Africa is to be avoided.\n37.\tNevertheless, I should like to end on a \nsomewhat more optimistic note with regard to this \npart of the world: indeed, the Namibian conflict \nseems close to a solution. We hope that it will \nsoon be possible to eliminate the last remaining \nobstacles in order to enable the Namibian people \nto determine its own future.\n38.\tIn this respect I wish to emphasize how \ndeserving are all those who played a constructive \nrole in the solution of this problem, whether \nfrom the group of five Western States or the \nfront-line States, and I should like to see \nothers take inspiration from this model, which \nproves once again that when people come to the \nnegotiating table with the firm intention of \nsucceeding, even the most thorny problems can be \nresolved in a manner acceptable to all.\nThe picture of the international situation I have \njust drawn is especially bleak. Rather than \nallowing ourselves to be discouraged and falling \nprey to pessimism, we should consider this bitter \nreality as a new challenge and redouble our \nefforts to reverse this trend.\n39.\tThe Organization\u2014at least if we persist \nin upholding the Charter\u2014is a precious instrument \nin this regard. However, we must make use of this \ninstrument with deftness and dexterity if it is \nto function according to the intentions of its \nfounders. Hence, we must guard against abusing it \nor making inadequate use of it, be it for \npropaganda purposes or for short-term political \ngain. In particular, we must ensure that every \norgan functions in keeping with its mandate and \nthe principles enshrined in the Charter.\n40.\tLet us guard against bringing before the \norgans of the Organization problems they are not \ncompetent to deal with. Otherwise, the only \nresult would be a profusion of texts whose impact \nwould be inversely proportional to their number. \nThat would only lead to false hopes followed by \npolitical discontent from a public which is \nalready weary of the few successes of the United \nNations in certain specific tragic and easily \nidentifiable problems.\n41.\tThose few thoughts concur with the \nsubstance of the Secretary-General's analysis of \nthe situation in his report on the work of the \nOrganization. That report, made without \ncomplacency, speaks to certain weaknesses of the \nOrganization but, above all, addresses itself to \nGovernments\u2014that is to say, to us\u2014inviting us to \ngo beyond short-term political expediency and \nrediscover the true objectives of the United \nNations.\n42.\tThe fact remains that the Organization \noffers a unique advantage, allowing constant \ndialogue amongst all of us. It is up to us to \npreserve this advantage and develop it to its \nfull potential, so that the Organization, in \naccordance with paragraph 4 of Article 1 of the \nCharter, can be \\\"a centre for harmonizing the \nactions of nations in the attainment of common \nends\\\" and remain so for future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with a deep sense of pleasure that I \nventure to associate myself with the many \nwell-merited complimentary statements, as my \nsources have indicated, made to Mr. Hollai on his \nelection to this most important office of \nPresident of the General Assembly. I am sure \nthat, as his predecessor and others before did, \nhe will conduct the affairs of that office so as \nto enhance its authority and add greater lustre, \nmeaning and dimension to the office itself and \nthe Organization which its serves. I should like \nalso to extend to the Secretary-General my \nwarmest congratulations on his appointment as \nadministrative head of this world body. He has \nassumed the reins of office during a year of \nvaried far-reaching problems in different parts \nof the world. I wish to assure him that Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines will give full support \nto his endeavours to bring this troubled world by \npatient diplomacy to confront, face and resolve \nits problems, and so wish him a pleasant and \nrewarding term in office during which he will \ndraw increasingly the respect of all inside and \noutside the Organization.\nThe election of Mr. Hollai at this thirty-seventh \nsession comes at a time of unprecedented \nconflicts and tension in the world. It was the \nambitious hope of the founders of this United \nNations that such problems as obtain today should \nnot be the lot of the world. That these conflicts \nand tension exist and have persisted over the \nyears is a serious continuing reflection on \nnational attitudes: ambition, aggressiveness, \nduplicity, pride and honour.\nThirty-seven years after the founding of the \nOrganization, the only real change has come from \nexpanded membership. Many former subject peoples \nare now free and independent, though not all are \nequal. National attitudes are following, in most \ncases, the same consistent pattern. We refuse to \nlearn from the experiences of the past. \nConsequently, people are dying, combatants as \nwell as non-combatants in Lebanon, Afghanistan, \nKampuchea, Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran, \nNamibia and elsewhere, all in the name of \nfurthering national ambition and objectives.\nFor yet another year I urge again that the time \nhas come for all Member States to condemn, and to \ncontinue to do so in the strongest possible \nterms, acts which clearly violate the Charter, \nresolutions and principles of this important \nworld body. It must be realized that the Charter \nis not an instrument to be accepted when it is a \nconvenient adjunct to national policy and \nabrogated when it is not. The Charter must be \naccepted as establishing an international code of \nconduct between nations. A code it is. By \nmembership of the Organization we have all agreed \nto conform to its spirit and intent. It \nrecognizes that disputes are often unavoidable \ngiven the present emotional level of the \ndevelopment of man. He may perhaps evolve into a \ndifferent creature in another half million years, \nbut for now he is Homo Homini Lupus. It was \nrecognized that for our generation a mechanism \nwas necessary, hence a machinery for the \nresolution of disputes was established. If the \nCharter is to be respected and if the authority \nof this body is not to be eroded, it must be \nrespected, the machinery for resolving disputes \nmust be rigidly adhered to, however painfully \nslow and frustrating may be the negotiations. \nParties once at a negotiating table must show a \nwillingness and desire to reach a consensus. This \nis the sane way, the humane way, the wisest and \nmost resource-conserving way. Is it so difficult \nfor leaders to accept this?\nI know there are those who would frown and say \nthat this is Utopian and an unrealistic diatribe, \nfor to accept this is to contemplate the \nremodelling of the innate conflicting attitudes \nof man. Yet, whatever may be said, it is always \nbetter for both sides to avoid confrontation and \nto settle a dispute at the conference table than \non the battlefield. Even for the apparent victor, \nthere are often more hydra heads springing from \nunexpected quarters than the one which the \nattempt was made to cut off by force of arms, by \nmilitary surgery.\nSince 1947 there have been continuous problems \nbetween Israel, the Palestinian people and the \nArab nations. For 35 years this problem has \npreoccupied the attention of the Assembly and of \nthe Security Council and has not been resolved \nbecause of the two genuine but conflicting claims \nby the protagonists of both camps. Israel demands \nthe right to exist within secure borders. The \nauthentic voice of the Palestinian people, the \nPalestine Liberation Organization, demands a free \nand autonomous State in an area that is not \nexclusive of Israel.\nRecent events in Lebanon have compelled my \ncountry to look at this issue in greater depth \nand to speak out about the wanton destruction and \ncarnage that have taken place, particularly in \nwest Beirut. The death and destruction wrought \nbefore the massacre were inexcusable and \nindefensible by any norm of international law; \nbut that a massacre that should have been \nforeseen or guarded against should have been \ncommitted while aid and assistance were given by \nIsrael to the Christian militia deserves strong \ncensure from the Assembly. A dark deed has drawn \nsharp and bitter protest and is viewed, \njustifiably so, with horror by civilized and \nrational people everywhere. That that act should \nhave been committed on the soil of one Member \nState by another and that the army of the country \nravaged is not at war or even in a state of \npreparedness for war makes it all the more \nreprehensible.\nWhatever allegations Israel may make to justify \nits conduct and action, the scale of the Israeli \nresponse was totally unwarranted and \nunjustifiable and cannot with good conscience be \nsupported even by their most ardent admirers. The \nOld Testament advocated an eye for an eye; but \nIsrael has taken 100 eyes for one eye. It is a \nmost callous, inhuman display of brute military \nmight which, while it may have achieved its \npolitical and military objectives, has released \nother possible adverse international forces which \nmay be contained only if Israel withdraws its \ntroops immediately and without pre-conditions \nfrom Lebanon and thereafter shows a willingness \nto accept that if it is to live within secure \nboundaries, as Security Council resolution 242 \n(1967) of 22 November 1967 stipulates, there must \nbe an accepted corollary that it is the \ninalienable right of the Palestinian people to \nhave a homeland. The recent massacre now brings \nthis need into sharper focus.\nCountries have to be careful that they do not, \neven by winning a war, lose the respect and \ngoodwill of the international community as Israel \nhas now done so successfully. No country, however \nlarge can allow itself to become an international \noutcast; still less one that is small, even \nthough it is in possession of a powerful military \nmachine. We all need the goodwill, friendship and \nsupport of each other. Total isolation must be \nthe worst tragedy with which any country can be \nbeset. Israel must in its own interest cease \nactions which suggest that it has a total \ndisregard for international opinion.\nIf we, inside and outside the Assembly, accept \nfacts, however unpalatable they may be, apparent \nproblems may become soluble and inexcusable and \nunpardonable Christian barbarities such as \noccurred in west Beirut may not recur. The fact \nis that Israel exists in the hearts of all \nIsraelis and as a State. The fact is that the PLO \nexists in the hearts of all Palestinian people, \nwherever they reside. It is therefore ridiculous \nfor either side to refuse to accept the existence \nof the other.\nFor either side to continue to take firm and \nunyielding positions on this issue could lead to \nother even more tragic events which, while they \nmust redound to the shame of the perpetrators and \nbe to the utter disgust and anger of civilized \npeople must not occasion guilt among us for any \nfailure on our part to put an end to this impasse.\nThere are now three options to be examined in the \nsearch for a peaceful solution to this Middle \nEast crisis: first, the much-criticized and by \nsome rejected Camp David accords; secondly, \nPresident Reagan's initiative; and, thirdly, the \nplan adopted at the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference, at Fez.The opposing leaders should \nnow come together and, with assistance, so \norchestrate their actions that an effective and \nlasting peace can come to the area. Those who can \nencourage this process must do so, so that peace \ncan come to a troubled and tortured land, \nLebanon; so that peace can come to a strife-prone \nand strife- torn region, the Middle East; so that \npeace can exist between the Israelis and the \nArabs, based on a just settlement of the \nPalestinian problem: a homeland.\nLebanon should now be given the opportunity to \nbecome a unified country and to live and trade in \npeace. Its new President and Government must be \ngiven the support of the international community \nto make this possible. It is for the President \nand his Government to decide when all \nnon-Lebanese troops should leave their country. \nWhen it is clear that the Lebanese army, with \ninternational financial support, is firmly in \ncontrol, they should, on request, all immediately \ndepart.\nThe international community must not appear to be \nindifferent to the fate of Afghanistan, a \nrelatively small country of 15.5 million people. \nForeign troops are in that country. The presence \nof those troops is being contested by the \ninhabitants of that country\u2014the Afghans. Whatever \nmay be the stated reason for the presence of \nthose foreign troops\u2014whether in support and at \nthe request of the present Government or \notherwise\u2014it is evident that a significant \nsegment of the population, indeed a majority, is \nopposed to the Government and to the presence of \nthose foreign troops. The fact is not \ncontestable, since poorly equipped Afghans at \ngreat expense, in terms of loss of life and \nproperty, and at great suffering\u2014both to \ncombatants and to non-combatants\u2014continue to wage \nresistance to an occupation of their country \nwhich they consider to be undesirable.\nNeighbouring States have over 3 million\u2014or about \none fifth\u2014of the Afghans as refugees, placing \ngreat strain on the resources of those countries. \nPakistan alone has over 2.7 million. Providing \nfor these refugees is utilizing a substantial \nportion of the resources of international relief \norganizations. AH this must make one wonder what \npurpose is served by a continuing stalemate with \nblood, death and suffering as the end-product. \nThe image of the occupying Power internationally \nis being affected, and the validity and wisdom of \nits political and military objectives must be \nquestioned. Without asking for a response, I am \nsure that Afghanistan is an embarrassment to that \noccupying Power. It has touched a lever which it \nnow wishes, quite likely, it had never touched, \nyet still somehow refuses to release.\nI appeal to the occupying Power to show that \ngreat courage which I know it possesses, and of \nwhich it is capable, and set a small country free \nto determine its own future as it wishes. Let it \nhold discussions with the Afghan nationalist \nfighters with a view to ending the conflict; let \nit agree to the holding of elections under United \nNations supervision and secure observer status \nfor such a team; let it negotiate, if possible, a \nneutral Afghanistan, but this should not be a \npre-condition for the holding of free and fair \nelections. I appeal further to the occupying \nPower to start the process now and show the \ngreatness and compassion of which it is capable. \nWe of the Assembly must all work unceasingly to \nbring to an end the cycle of suffering, death and \ndestruction occurring in that once quiet and \npeaceful country, now turned into a divided, \nsuffering and unhappy land.\nThe Kampuchean question is another very sad \ncontinuing episode. It is wrong for any outside \nPower to impose itself by force of arms on \nanother country or by direct intervention decide \nwho should administer a country. It is all the \nmore heinous when to achieve that result it \noccasions untold human suffering. Those foreign \ntroops now in occupation of Kampuchea should be \nremoved. Our national concern is that we cannot \nbe indifferent to human suffering, regardless of \nwhen or where it may occur but especially when it \noccurs under the domination of a foreign Power \ndetermined to demonstratethat might is right. Let \nthe people decide whether they wish the new \nCoalition or the present Phnom Penh Government.\nThe foreign troops occupying Kampuchea have \ncaused, in addition to the loss of lives and \nproperty, severe refugee problems in neighbouring \ncountries. Will this unremitting foreign \nintervention never cease? It should and must. The \nKampucheans should be left in peace to determine \ntheir future by dialogue and through a freely \nsupervised electoral process.\nThe Iraqi-Iran war, although not one in which \nforeign troops are the interventionists or the \nprotectors of their perceived but often misjudged \ninterests, is nevertheless a terrible war, being \nfought with the most sophisticated types of \nconventional weapons in an important and \nsensitive part of the world. It is not for Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines, at this stage, to \nattempt to apportion blame before being fully \napprised of all the facts; it is enough to \nrecognize that this senseless slaughter of the \nflower and youth of both countries is a reckless \nsquandering of an important national resource. \nThe armies of the contending forces should agree \nto withdraw, at all points, within their \nrespective borders and begin negotiations with a \nview to concluding a peace treaty. If there are \nany Member States which can in some measure \nexercise influence on one side or the other, or \nboth, they should do so before this dread \nmalignancy takes on incurable proportions\u2014before \nit spreads even further, with dire consequences \nfor peace in that region and for world peace. One \ncannot permit reason to be blind or deaf in a \ndispute. It is like searching for a tiger while \nblind and deaf, only to be destroyed by it.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines urges the \nrepresentatives of Iraq and the Islamic Republic \nof Iran to give support to the resolution of the \nSecurity Council and the sentiments of the \nGeneral Assembly and, within the limits \npermitted, persuade their Governments to take \nsuch differences as exist to the conference table \nand endeavour to resolve them within the terms of \nthe Charter of the United Nations and resolutions \nof the Security Council and the Assembly.\nYet another year approaches without the \ninhabitants of Namibia having the right to \ndetermine their future as a free and independent \npeople. For yet another year a regime in South \nAfrica which refuses to recognize racial equality \nand which has institutionalized the dehumanizing \nsystem of apartheid against the black majority \nwithin its borders persists by every ruse and \nvarious stratagems to frustrate the aspirations \nof a people that wishes to be no longer a ward \nbut a proud people in a free and equal country.\nThe question of independence for Namibia should \nnot be linked to any pre-condition, particularly \nwhen it is an issue not related to Namibia \nitself, but of a third State. Understandable, \nfrom a South African point of view, as that \nconcern may be, no one should allow a direct and \nseparate issue to be beclouded by what is, in our \nview, an extraneous consideration. The question \nfor the General Assembly is no longer \nindependence itself but where do we go from here \nto bring about independence for Namibia. The \nquestion of what progress is being made by the \ncontact group on the implementation of the United \nNations plan is speculative but this is still \nprobably an area where results could be achieved. \nLet us intensify our actions to ensure that this \nissue is resolved before the Assembly meets for \nits thirty-eighth session.\nAs a Member State, we shall continue to state \nthat the greatest challenge to the effectiveness \nof the Assembly lies in the deliberate erosion of \nits authority by its members. Perhaps Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines may have unwittingly \nbeen an offender already. Nevertheless, we should \nnot ignore the Charter or resolutions of the \nUnited Nations without at the same time \nappreciating the adverse effect this must have on \nits total responsiveness. For small States such \nas Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, it should be \nobvious that it is necessary to ensure at all \ntimes that the United Nations is strong and responsive \nto problems, with the ability, through the \ncollective will of the Assembly, to enforce its \nauthority with regard to regional and world peace \nfor the good of all mankind, since it is the best \nguarantor of the protection and independence of \nsuch States.\nToo often nations avoid the peaceful path and \nresort to arms, with unforeseen results. In a \nworld replete with border disputes, civil \nterrorism and guerrilla unrest, and territorial \nclaims, especially in this hemisphere, prudence \nand caution should make the negotiating table \nattractive. The path to a negotiated settlement \nor the resolution of disputes by discussion can \nat times be slow; yet this in itself should in no \nway frustrate the process. The results of quiet, \npainstaking diplomacy, even if the disputes are \nultimately resolved through the process of \narbitration, have always so far been more \nbeneficial than the results of war.\nI spoke at length at the 23rd meeting of the \ntwelfth special session on disarmament, and I do \nnot propose to add anything further to what I \nsaid then except to welcome the start of \ndiscussions between the super-Powers on nuclear \ndisarmament in the hope that it will be treated \nin as serious and urgent a manner as the gravity \nof the situation warrants. However, I would like \nto read out one portion of that statement: \\\"Given \nthe suspicion and distrust that exist between \ncountries, it can be appreciated that there are \ntremendous obstacles to be overcome in bringing \nabout real and lasting disarmament. \\\"Countries \nthat have been suspicious of each other for \nyears, and still are, will not suddenly believe \neach other's words. Therefore, in order to \neliminate this element of fear and doubt, which \nis the result of suspicion and mistrust, \ninspection and verification must be accepted as \nan inescapable provision of any such treaty. Any \ngenuine desire to achieve disarmament must \nrealistically accept that States have to move in \nthe direction of an open-door policy rather than \na closed-door policy. The prerequisite for \nreaching agreement on disarmament seems to be the \nability of the parties to convince each other \nthat no advantage is sought over the other and \nthat there is nothing to hide by thereby \nguaranteeing the right of access to each other's \nterritory for inspection. What should then be \ndecided will be who would do the inspection and \nhow such inspection should be carried out\u2014whether \nby a team selected and controlled by this world \nbody and answerable only to this world body or \notherwise. This would actually mean that there \nwould have to be a re-examination of the national \nconcept of sovereignty and territorial \njurisdiction. There can be no diminution or \ncompromise of authority in giving to another an \nentitlement that would be reciprocal. This is the \nwhole concept of ambassadorial and consular \nrepresentation which specifically limits national \njurisdiction on national soil and which \nencroaches upon national sovereignty in certain \ncases. This is now an internationally accepted \nprinciple set forth in a Convention. There are \nvery rare occasions when this Convention is \nviolated and, when it is, it is as a result of \ntraumatic shocks within a national society. \nSimilarly, what has been achieved in the area of \ndiplomatic reciprocity should prove to be no more \ndifficult in verifiable inspection to achieve \ndisarmament. Willingness to agree to inspection \nis an indication of acceptance of how crucial \ninspection must be in reaching agreement on \ndisarmament.\\\"\nIt must not be thought that it is only the United \nStates of America and the Union of Soviet \nSocialist Republics that are concerned, for all \nmankind is concerned. We, the others, the silent \nspectators, are all deeply concerned. There \nshould and must be an end to nuclear \nproliferation, through a balanced reduction of \nthe existing terror. Ultimately there should be \nan end to the international arms race in general, \nfor which a few countries are responsible. It is \nthey that possess the real capacity to fuel the \narms race; and once they show the will it can and \nwill cease.\nOne of the continuing, lingering problems with \nwhich the Assembly is confronted is the creation \nof conditions conducive to the reunification of \ncountries divided because of political and \nideological differences or differences of \nlanguage or religion. It must be a source of \ngreat hardship when the fabric of life in the \nparts of a divided country is torn. When there is \nlittle or no contact and when it is difficult for \nfriends or families to be reunited, there is the \ntemptation to want to resolve the problem by \nother than peaceful means. Consequently, in \ndivided countries, when restraint has been shown \nit deserves praise, and the Governments must be \nfurther encouraged to seek the negotiating table \nas the best and most practical way to a solution. \nThey should renounce the resolution of any \ndispute by means other than those the Charter \nenvisages, even though they may not be Members.\nNot all these divided countries seek or can seek \nadmission to the United Nations, but those that \ncan and do seek admission should be admitted, \neither together or individually, without the \npossibility for any of the five permanent members \nof the Security Council exercising a veto against \nsuch admission. Such admission, in the view of my \ncountry, would assist in the promotion of peace \nand might well contribute to the realization of \nthe national aspiration for the reunification of \nthe divided countries. Although past experience \nhas in no way suggested that there is reason for \noptimism, it has shown that admission has lowered \nthe threshold of tension between divided \ncountries, increased contacts in different areas \nand permitted a greater degree of dialogue.\nThere is a place for both the Republic of Korea \nand the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in \nthe Assembly. It is time the wounds of division \nwere healed. The process of healing can begin \nhere. Friends of both the South and the North \nshould make this process possible.\nWe in the Assembly must address once again the \nvery grave danger to world security posed by \ninternational terrorism, which now appears to \nmake a target of a diplomat for no reason other \nthan that in the discharge of the functions of \nhis office he speaks for his country and thereby \npersonifies his country. We must bring our minds \nto bear on this problem so that those who perform \nduties similar to our own work can do so in \ngreater safety. No self-respecting nation can \npermit itself to be blackmailed by the dark deeds \nof the terrorist. No self-respecting nation can \nsubmit to the will of terror. In such a situation \nselective terror could be applied against a \ncountry extraterritorially to achieve the \nobjective, and unless and until all the countries \nof the world community take firm and serious \ncollective responsibility for discouraging the \ncommission of such acts on their soil by \ninflicting for such offences the severest \npenalties permitted under their legislation, when \nthe perpetrators of the offences are apprehended, \nthe trend is not likely to be contained.\nWhile man continues to demonstrate his inhumanity \non the field of conflict and by oppression in \nother forms, there still remains a vast gap \nbetween the rich and the poor countries of the \nNorth and the South. Prodigious sums are budgeted \nand spent on the production, stockpiling and \ndeployment of weapons of mass destruction, both \nnuclear and conventional. While the budgeted cost \nof defence increases, in most cases \nsubstantially, only a few nations have yet been \nable to achieve the United Nations target figure \nof 0.7 per cent of the gross national product, in \naid to developing countries, to be attained by \n1985.\nThe International Development Strategy for the \nThird United Nations Development Decade, \ncertainly recognized the urgent need for aid \nflows to the developing world. Such payments \ninclude contributions made via multilateral \ninstitutions. Countries of the Development \nAssistance Committee are among those that have \nmade the highest contribution of resources on \nliberal terms to developing countries as a whole \nas a percentage of their gross national product. \nIn fact, four countries in the Committee exceeded \nthe targeted amountin 1979 and 1980. According to \n1980 figures, and based on information from the \nUNCTAD secretariat, the Kingdom of the \nNetherlands contribute gross national product \nwith 0.99 per cent, and the lowest contribution \nfrom the countries in the Committee was 0.17 per \ncent. On average, the Development Assistance \nCommittee countries gave just 0.57 per cent of \ngross national product in 1980\u2014that is, just over \nhalf of the targeted amount. Only members of the \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \nexceeded 1 per cent, with an average of 1.51 per \ncent in 1979 and 1.45 per cent in 1980.\nWhile this terrible world recession has with \nhigh, though now falling, interest rates caused \nrising unemployment everywhere from the \nindustrialized North to the impoverished South, \nwith only a few exceptions, and has contributed \nto budgetary strains, balance-of- payment \nproblems and liquidity squeezes within the \neconomies of the developed and the developing \ncountries, and may well tend to cause the \ndevelopment of an inward-looking attitude, \nnevertheless, even though it is natural for all \nGovernments to be preoccupied with national \nconcerns, introspection should not blind \nGovernments to the realities of the world around \nthem. Although the reality may be that some \ncountries are facing severe financial and other \nproblems, those small island States with highly \nvulnerable economies often based solely on \nprimary products are in a still more perilous \nstate and in need of greater official development \nassistance than ever before.\nIn his address to the Commonwealth Finance \nMinisters at a meeting held at Marlborough House, \nin London, on 30 August last, the Commonwealth \nSecretary-General had this to say: \\\"... the \ntightening of lending because of the danger of \ndefault can precipitate the very danger it seeks \nto avert and quicken economic collapse. Joint \naction by private banks alone cannot provide an \nadequate, reliable basis for handling problems of \ntoday's dimensions. The liquidity squeeze is \nsuperimposed on a contraction of resource flows \nto developing countries. Aid flows from the \nDevelopment Aid Committee and OPEC as a \nproportion of gross national product are \ndeclining, and the growth in World Bank lending, \nincluding from the International Development \nAssociation, is already projected at much lower \nlevels than in the past.\\\" This prognosis is \ngloomy for the developing countries. However, \nbecause the economies of the world are \ninterdependent, it is also gloomy for the rich \nindustrialized world. Of sheer necessity the weak \nmust and will, through trade, directly promote \nthe economic well-being of the rich. The rich \nshould therefore continue to be generous in their \naid to the poor, for a better world, such help is \na necessary priority. As we all now stand \nwatching a world writhing in financial and \neconomic agony, we should not allow our national \nconcerns to override all other interests and so \nshelve the need to renew the North-South dialogue \nin an effort to deepen our understanding of the \ninstitutional mechanism required to promote the \nintroduction of a new economic order.\nThere can be no doubt that there is a need for \nthe restructuring of the world's economies. \nNeither the old nor the new economic theories \nseem capable of energizing the developed or \ndeveloping economies upon which the economies of \nthe poor and the underdeveloped countries are so \ndependent, whether for the sale of their primary \nproducts or in the area of tourism. There are too \nmany external factors that seem to interplay and \nimpinge upon national planning over which \nnational planners have no control. It is the \nunpredictability of the multinational interplay \nof forces and factors with which small \nunderdeveloped countries must contend and over \nwhich they have far less control than the \ndeveloping or the developed countries.\nWhen the higher-priced production of beet sugar \nis subsidized within the European Economic \nCommunity, causing large surpluses in production \nand competition, the world demand for cane sugar \nfalls, creating huge surpluses in developing \ncountries, thereby sending prices down drastically, \nwith the result that economies dependent on that \ncrop are utterly destroyed, causing serious \nbalance-of-payments problems. These are some of \nthe difficulties which are beyond the control of \nnational planners. There is therefore a need for \nthe Economic and Social Council to look \ncritically at this problem to persuade States \nwhich have been subsidizing the overproduction of \nbeet to recognize the harm they are doing and to \ncorrect this injury.\nThere are some programmes which in my country's \nview are having an impact. One such is UNDP. \nSince just before our independence, it has been \nhaving quite a significant impact on our \ndevelopmental efforts in the area of statistics \nand economic advisory services. Since it appears \nthat programmes of the Organization are in all \nprobability going to be affected by the \ninadequate contributions of Members, it is our \nhope that this useful Programme will continue to \nreceive the support of the international \ncommunity. For our part, we are prepared to try \nto make our own modest contribution to this \nworthwhile Programme. As we demonstrate our faith \nin it, my country expects donors to keep faith \nwith us and support it\u2014not less generously, but \nrather more generously, than previously.\nIn my country's policy statement on admission, at \nthe thirty-fifth session, I said that our \nposition on issues would be made quite clear. Our \nintention would always be to assist this world \nbody in achieving and maintaining world peace as \nwell as economic and social justice. We meant it \nthen, and we still mean it. I wish to conclude as \nI did then: \\\"The Assembly can be a most effective \ninstrument; but it cannot be and will not be \ngreater than all of us collectively have the will \nto make it. Each of us representatives possesses \nthe perception by conscience to know right from \nwrong. Nevertheless, we are all subject to the \npolicies of our Governments and must represent \nthem or resign. But can we not in the light of \nour thinking strive to influence those decisions, \nif-by so doing we would enhance respect for the \nintegrity and credibility of this world \nOrganization? To fail in this endeavour is not \nthe problem; only to fail to try.\\\"\n\\\"General Assembly\\\" is a mere name. We are all \ngathered here in the General Assembly. \\\"United \nNations\\\" are only words. Our countries constitute \nthe United Nations. They can serve us as the \nCharter intended, if only we let them.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my privilege to deliver the statement of\nthe Republic of Zimbabwe to the Assembly on\nbehalf of my Minister for Foreign Affairs, who\nhas had to go home on urgent business. The\nfollowing is his statement.\nThe Government and people of the Republic of\nZimbabwe warmly greet the Secretary General and\nall delegations and wish the session success. I\nshould like to take this opportunity to\ncongratulate Mr. Hollai on his election to the\npresidency of the thirty seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly. He has my best wishes and those\nof my delegation in the very important\nresponsibility which the Assembly has placed on\nhis shoulders. He can certainly count on my\ndelegation's cooperation with him in his work.\nMay I also join other speakers who have paid a\nthoroughly deserved tribute to Mr. Kittani of\nIraq, for the way in which he presided over the\nthirty sixth session of the General Assembly, as\nwell as the special sessions.\nAs this is the first opportunity for me to offer\nmy personal congratulations to Mr. Perez de\nCuellar, on his election to the highest office in\nthe Organization, I wish to do so now. This is,\nof course, in addition to the messages of\nfelicitation and good wishes which the Government\nof Zimbabwe communicated to the Secretary General\nthrough the normal channels soon after his\nelection and also during the recent special\nsession of the General Assembly devoted to\ndisarmament. The Government of the Republic of\nZimbabwe is particularly satisfied at his\nelection for several reasons, the most important\nof which are his outstanding qualities both as a\nperson and as a diplomat, which are well known to\nall in this Assembly, and, equally important, the\ngreat honor which his election represents to his\ncountry, Peru, to the nonaligned movement and to\nthe third world.\nThere can be no denying the fact that the thirty\nseventh session of the General Assembly is taking\nplace against the background of a critically\ndeteriorating international situation. I wish to\nrefer to some of the things which contribute to\nthis atmosphere of fear, tension and insecurity\nin our world. In so doing it is my sincere hope\nthat when we conclude this session we shall all,\nas individuals and nations, rededicate and\nrecommit ourselves to the high principles of the\nCharter and to world peace.\nThe current vicious arms race, especially the\nnuclear arms race, if it is not quickly and\neffectively checked, could lead only to a nuclear\nconflict, resulting in the complete destruction\nof this planet; and, as the Secretary General has\nalready warned in his report on the work of the\nOrganization, nothing worthwhile will survive a\nnuclear holocaust if one comes. Let us remind\nourselves, therefore, that what is at stake here\nis the survival of the human race. If so far,\nhowever, we have been spared this no victor, no\nvanquished' war, it is perhaps because the world\nhas not yet been so unfortunate as to produce\npersons sufficiently crazy and foolish to wish to\ninscribe their own names on the pages of history\nwhich no one will ever survive to recount.\nIt has already been observed by speakers before\nme that Mother serious threat to world peace and\nsecurity is the production and stockpiling of\nmore sophisticated conventional weapons. Although\nthey know full well the destructive capacities of\nsuch inhuman weapons, some of the nation\u2019s\npossessing them seems most eager to employ them\nin the pursuit of so called national interests\nand objectives, the achievement of which does not\nseem beyond means that are more acceptable under\ncivilized international law. In fact, those who\npossess these dangerous weapons of death and\ndestruction often assume postures and positions\nwhich render ineffectual the mediatory and peace\nkeeping efforts of the United Nations and other\ninternational bodies concerned with seeking\npeaceful solutions to conflicts. Such has been\nthe common frustration of the Security Council,\nthe OAU, the nonaligned movement and other\ninternational and regional organizations. In most\nconflicts threatening regional or international\nstability, peace and security, such as, for\ninstance, those in the Middle East, the Persian\nGulf, the South Atlantic recently, Afghanistan,\nSouth East Asia or southern Africa to mention\nsome of the current areas of tension and conflict\nresolutions and decisions of those organizations\nare met more with defiance and violation than\nwith compliance. We in Zimbabwe had as, indeed,\nhas all peace loving peoples of the world high\nhopes and expectations of the second special\nsession of the General Assembly on disarmament.\nWe are just as deeply disappointed that the\nsession did not produce any tangible result.\nHowever, in spite of the failure of the special\nsession, we remain even more firmly convinced\nthat there can be no other course for the\ninternational community than to continue its\nefforts to achieve arms control leading\nultimately to total disarmament. This will not\nonly ensure peace for us as individuals and\nnations, but will certainly lead to a fresh and\nmore balanced review of our already critically\nderanged sense of priorities in the allocation\nand distribution of the scarce resources of our\nplanet. For example, we are convinced that the\n$US 500 billion now annually squandered on arms\nof death and destruction will be diverted towards\nnational, regional and interregional\ndevelopmental projects designed to benefit people\nrather than to destroy them.\nIt is not being suggested or implied here that\nsuccess in arms control or disarmament will\ncreate a world free of tension and even conflict.\nThese will always be there. What is being\nsuggested, however, is that the temptation to\nresort lightly to the use or threat of force in\nresolving political disputes between nations is\nlikely to be reduced markedly?\nA cursory review on a regional basis of our\nworld, and especially of the political scene,\nwill very quickly reveal how far we have wandered\nfrom the path, the ideals and the goals which\ninspired the authors of the Charter of this great\nOrganization, of which we are all proud to be\nmembers. I wish to start this review with the\nsouthern African region. There the Apartheid and\nracist Pretoria regime continues its oppressive\nand repressive policies against the black\nmajority in South Africa. The same racist regime\ncontinues its illegal occupation of Namibia in\ndefiance of the resolutions, decisions and\ndeclarations of this Organization, the OAU and\nthe nonaligned movement and the wishes and\ndemands of the people of Namibia.\nWhen in 1978 the five Western countries now known\nas the Western contact group successfully\npersuaded the Security Council to adopt the now\nwell known resolution 435, they argued that this\nproposal offered prospects of an immediate\npeaceful ending of racist South Africa's illegal\ncolonization of Namibia. Indeed, resolution 435\nhas since been universally accepted as the only\nfair, practical and realistic basis for the\npeaceful settlement of the Namibian independence\nquestion. Efforts have since been made to\nimplement the plan, which the illegal regime also\naccepted. Yet Namibia still remains occupied.\nI wish to refer briefly to the most recent\nefforts involving the front line States, Nigeria\nand SWAPO on the one hand and the Western contact\ngroup and South Africa on the other. The front\nline States, Nigeria and SWAPO cooperated in\nthese efforts, genuinely hoping that they would\nfacilitate the implementation of the United\nNations plan outlined in Security Council\nresolution 435. During and after the abortive\nGeneva Conference in 1981, the Western contact\ngroup informed all concerned that South Africa\nhad certain concerns which must be dispelled\nbefore the implementation of the United Nations\nplan for Namibian independence. We were further\npersuaded that once these so called concerns had\nbeen dispelled South Africa would cooperate in\nthe implementation of resolution 435.\nWe can say without hesitation that all the\nparticipants in the recent consultations,\nincluding South Africa itself, were agreed at the\nend of the exercise that South Africa's concerns\nregarding resolution 435 had all been completely\nallayed; that is, all matters and questions relating\nto resolution 435 (1978) and to the\nimplementation of the United Nations plan had\nbeen discussed and fully clarified to the\nsatisfaction of all concerned, including South\nAfrica. I should mention in passing, however,\nthat South Africa still has to specify which of\nthe two electoral methods will be employed in\nNamibia, that of single member constituencies or\nthat of proportional representation.\nIt must be emphasized here that SWAPO has time\nand again reiterated its readiness to sign a\ncease fire agreement and to take part in free and\nfair elections under United Nations supervision,\nas provided for in the United Nations plan. As\nrepresentatives here will recall, this has been\nSWAPO's position since the abortive Geneva\nConference of 1981.\nWhat, then, the General Assembly must be asking\nitself, is blocking progress towards the\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 435\n(1978)? The front line States, Nigeria and SWAPO\nare and have long been ready to proceed to the\nnext point at anytime, as soon as the electoral\nmethod is known. SWAPO needs to know this in\norder to make the necessary preparations for the\nelections.\nWhat I have said so far indicates tremendous\nprogress towards a peaceful settlement of the\nNamibian question. Let me also say that this\nprogress is greatly attributable to SWAPO's\ncooperation and to the air of optimism and\nmomentum generated in the capitals of the Western\ncontact group before and during the six weeks of\nconsultations. Yet all this momentum and good\nwill may soon be lost if South Africa and some\nmembers of the Western contact group continue to\nmanufacture pretexts for delaying the\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 435\n(1978).\nIn this regard, let me make Zimbabwe's position\nvery clear. I am referring here to the politics\nof linkage and parallelism which have been\nformulated to make the departure of Cuban troops\nfrom the People's Republic of Angola a pre\ncondition of the independence of Namibia. This\nstrategy, which is not related in any way to\nSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978), and which\nis the creation of certain members of the contact\ngroup and Apartheid South Africa in order to\npromote and serve their own bilateral interests,\nis totally unacceptable to Zimbabwe. Dragging the\nissue of the Cuban presence in Angola into the\nNamibian question is an unwarranted and\nunacceptable interference in bilateral affairs\nand relations between the sovereign States of\nAngola and Cuba, which are Members of the\nOrganization and of the nonaligned movement.\nMoreover, those who subscribe to this ridiculous\nand absurd view should be reminded that, while\nracist and colonialist South Africa continually\ncommits acts of aggression against the People's\nRepublic of Angola, Cuban troops have never set\nfoot on South African soil. With regard to the\nobnoxious system in South Africa itself,\nZimbabwe's position is well known. We have always\nsaid that we should like to see the total\ndismantling of Apartheid and racist minority rule\nin that part of our region. We demand instead a\ndemocratic system of government which sees all\nthe people of that country, regardless of race,\nreligion, language and sex, as equal citizens of\ntheir land. We call upon the leaders of the\nApartheid regime in Pretoria to negotiate with\nthe legitimate leadership of the oppressed and\nexploited black majority with a view to working\nout ways and means of establishing a system of\ngovernment guaranteeing every South African\nfreedom and social justice. The recently proposed\nso called Presidential Council giving limited\nrepresentation to South Africans of mixed race\nand Asians in that country is totally\nunacceptable to the people of South Africa, who\nare now solidly behind the armed struggle\nprosecuted by their liberation forces.\nThe Government and the people of Zimbabwe support\nthe struggle for liberation, equality and social\njustice being waged by the liberation movements\nin South Africa. We strongly condemn the\ncontinued incarceration of Comrade Nelson Mandela\nand other legitimate leaders of the people of\nSouth Africa by the racist Pretoria regime. This\nand the numerous political murders committed by\nthe racist rulers against the opponents of the\niniquitous system are also violations of human\nrights. We appeal to the international community\nto continue and even to intensify its material,\nmoral, diplomatic and political support to the\nstruggling people of South Africa in their\ncommendable efforts to free themselves from the\nApartheid yoke.\nIn its desperate efforts to frustrate the\nliberation process in Namibia and the dismantling\nof the Apartheid system within its borders, the\noppressive regime is busy waging destabilizing\ncampaigns against the neighboring independent and\nsovereign States of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,\nMozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Economic\nblackmail, bullying and sabotage, political\npropaganda and subversion, and open military\naggression and mercenarism are the common tactics\nemployed by Apartheid in its campaign of regional\ndestabilization. As the Assembly is well aware,\nthe regime's forces have been occupying part of\nAngola's territory for a year now and there is\nsufficient evidence that more incursions are\nbeing planned.\nThe abortive coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the legitimate\nGovernment of the Republic of Seychelles earlier\nthis year by Pretoria mercenaries and criminals\nis also part of this campaign of destabilization.\nSo also is the recruiting, training, equipping\nand supporting of dissident groups in some of the\nneighboring independent States for the purpose of\nresisting legitimate Governments there.\nZimbabwe's position on the question of the\ndestabilization of neighboring States by South\nAfrica is that this will not deter us from our\ndeclared policy of offering moral support and\nwhatever material support we can to the\nliberation struggle in that land. Zimbabwe\ndemands that the Pretoria regime should stop\nforthwith its destabilizing campaigns against our\ncountries. It should withdraw its forces from\nAngola forthwith and unconditionally. The white\nminority Government of apartheid South Africa\nmust be warned that no country has any right\nwhatsoever to violate international law with\nimpunity. I should now like, before leaving the\nAfrican region, to turn to the question of\nWestern Sahara. As the Assembly knows, this\nquestion has for a long time been on the agenda\nof the OAU and of the United Nations. The people\nof the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic deserve\nmore support in their just struggle for self\ndetermination in accordance with General Assembly\nresolution 1514 (XV). Because the Government of\nthe Republic of Zimbabwe is totally convinced of\nthe justness of the Sahraoui people's cause,\nZimbabwe has recognized the Sahraoui Arab\nDemocratic Republic as an independent and\nsovereign State. We believe that the resolution\nadopted by the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and\nGovernment at its eighteenth session, held at\nNairobi in 1981, providing for the signing of a\ncease fire between Morocco and the POLISARIO and\nfor the holding of a referendum to be\nadministered by a neutral force offers the best\nprospects for settling the question of Western\nSahara.\nZimbabwe views with deep concern efforts by\ncertain members of the OAU, apparently with\noutside encouragement, to polarize and therefore\nparalyse the OAU.\nThe past few months have witnessed a tragic\ndeterioration in the situation in the Middle East\nregion, as has been horribly exemplified by\nZionist Israel's invasion and occupation of\nLebanon and the massacring of thousands of\ninnocent Palestinian refugees in the Sabra and\nShatila camps on 16 and 17 September. The\ncivilized international community was deeply\noutraged, shocked and revolted by this genocidal\nact and crime against humanity, whose sadism can\nonly be compared to the crimes committed by the\nNazis, ironically enough against Jewish people,\nduring the Second World War. Surely the world\ncannot behave as if the thousands of defenseless\nmen, women and children in the two camps were\nkilled by a natural disaster. The barbaric\nslaughter was planned and carried out by the\nZionist Government. That Government and its\nsupporters who, if they had wanted to do so,\ncould have prevented the massacres, should be\nheld responsible for this crime against humanity\nand appropriately punished by the international\ncommunity.\nWe have time and again emphasized that no\nsolution of the Middle East question will be\nacceptable unless it recognizes the inalienable\nright of the Palestinian people to national self\ndetermination and to the establishment of a\nPalestinian State under the leadership of the PLO.\nIt is our view that the Palestinians and their\nLebanese brothers and sisters richly deserve to\nbe commended for their courage, resilience and\ndetermination in the face of naked aggression and\nintimidation by Zionist Israel. Zimbabwe salutes\nthem, especially the gallant PLO forces who for\nseveral weeks courageously defended their people\nagainst Zionist butchers.\nWhile still in the Middle East, we should like to\nexpress our deep concern about the continuing\nconflict between the Islamic Republic of Iran and\nIraq. It is our sincere hope that peace may come\nto this area where regional stability and\nsecurity are seriously threatened.\nAfghanistan is another area of concern to the\nOrganization and we feel obliged to reiterate our\nposition with regard to it. We feel that a\npolitical settlement is urgent and that this is\nonly possible on the basis of the withdrawal of\nforeign forces and the cessation of all outside\ninfluences and pressures. Accordingly we call\nupon all concerned to respect that country's\nindependence, sovereignty and nonaligned status.\nWith regard to Cyprus, Zimbabwe would again want\nto see the end to all forms of foreign\nintervention and interference, so that the people\nof that republic may be able to determine their\nown future freely. The Government of Zimbabwe\nstrongly supports the independence, sovereignty,\nterritorial integrity and nonaligned status of\nCyprus, as one united country. We share the\nconcern expressed by many speakers before us that\nthe intercommoned dialogue initiated under the\nauspices of the Secretary General\u2019s Special\nRepresentative has not yet produced any tangible\nresults.\nPoland is another area of international concern.\nOur own view is that it is only the people of\nthat country free of external pressure,\nintervention and interference who can resolve\ntheir internal problems. We believe very strongly\nthat any solution imposed from outside and\nagainst the will of the Polish people is totally\nunacceptable.\nZimbabwe's position with regard to the situation\nin South East Asia remains unchanged. We believe\nvery strongly in a peaceful political solution to\nthe Kampuchean problem in accordance with the\nprinciples of the United Nations and the\nnonaligned movement. Thus, we would like to see\nthe withdrawal of all foreign troops from\nKampuchean soil so that the various factions\ncontending for the mastery of that country might\nmeet to discuss and resolve their differences for\nthe benefit of the suffering masses of that\ncountry.\nZimbabwe believes in the principle of self\ndetermination and the termination of all forms\nand manifestations of colonialism. For that\nreason we find unacceptable Indonesia's military\nintervention in East Timor. It is our belief,\ntherefore, that the struggle waged by the East\nTimorese under the leadership of FRETILIN is a\njust one, deserving international support. We\ncall upon Indonesia to withdraw its forces from\nEast Timor.\nI should like to tum to the question of the\nKorean peninsula, another area of major\ninternational concern. We note with great regret\nthat the massive foreign military build up in the\nSouth continues unabated and poses a grave threat\nto international peace and security. The enemies\nof Korean unity and the supporters of the two\nKoreas myth have also been trying to confuse the\ninternational community by their deceitful talk\nof the possibility of free and fair elections in\nthe South. This cheap propaganda cannot deceive\nanybody, as we all know that there can be no free\nand fair elections in a territory under military\noccupation.\nWhile my Government will support negotiations\nbetween North and South Korea, we believe that nomeaningful\nnegotiations are possible under the prevailing\nconditions. We would therefore like to see the\nimmediate withdrawal of foreign forces from the\nSouth, so as to create an atmosphere conducive to\nmutual trust between the artificially divided\npeople of the peninsula. It is our strong view\nthat President Kim Sung's proposal for a\nconfederate system offers realistic prospects for\na settlement in the troubled area. If adopted, it\nhas every chance of putting the Korean people on\nthe road leading to the ultimate goal of complete\nKorean reunification.\nThe recent crisis over the Falkland or Malvinas\nIslands in the South Atlantic merits comment. In\nthat regard, we believe that the tragic events in\nthat region could have been avoided if the\nparties to the conflict had observed the\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.\nAs Zimbabwe is opposed to the use of force in the\nsettlement of disputes between States, we wish to\nurge the two parties to seek a peaceful, just and\nlasting settlement through negotiations.\nI wish to comment briefly on the international\neconomic situation. It will be recalled that it\nwas at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or\nGovernment of Non Aligned Countries, held at\nAlgiers in 1973, that the idea of a new\ninternational economic order was introduced. That\nconcept, which has since been debated at many\nmeetings and conferences, is attractive to the\ndeveloping countries, as it seeks to halt the\nperpetuation of a misdistribution of our world's\nwealth. Last year, in this very Hall my\ndelegation and many others referred to and warned\nagainst the dangerous deterioration in the world\neconomic situation. That same warning is still\nvery relevant today, especially since that\ndeterioration in the world economic situation may\nadversely affect world stability, peace and\nsecurity.\nZimbabwe and all developing countries have been\nhoping, almost in vain, that a conciliatory\nspirit would intervene to facilitate the\nconcluding of global negotiations for a new\ninternational economic order. Unfortunately,\nhowever, up to now no progress has been achieved,\nas several opportunities have been lost.\nWhile the industrialized countries continue to be\nuncooperative on this vital matter, their own\neconomies have not been able to escape the\nravages of one of the worst world economic\nsituations. It must be observed, however, that\ndeveloping economies are the hardest hit. The\nindustrialized countries are experiencing\ninflationary spirals, massive unemployment,\ncurrency weaknesses and high interest rates. Slow\ngrowth rates are becoming a common feature of\ntheir economies, too. Regrettably, these\nrecessionary conditions are now being used as\nexcuses for inward looking policies and for\nprotectionism against export commodities from\ndeveloping countries. We call for the immediate\nliberalization of trade relations in favor of\ndeveloping countries. The balance of payment\nproblems of the developing countries continue to\ngrow. The deficits of the latter countries,\nespecially the non oil producing countries, have\nreached astronomical figures, reflecting the\nmultiple crises afflicting the international\neconomy. Clearly, the international monetary\nsystem needs restructuring to reflect\ncontemporary economic realities. The core of such\na system should be the participation of the\ndeveloping countries in the decision making\nprocess and the enhancement of their ability to\nhave a significant impact on the democratization\nof the international monetary system.\nThe problem of energy is closely linked to that\nof our economic development. Our countries have\nserious difficulties in meeting their oil\nrequirements, and the oil bills of non oil\nexporting developing countries have reached\nunprecedented proportions. This is, however, an\narea where the developed countries and the oil\nexporting, newly industrializing countries can\nplay a crucial role in alleviating the general\nparalysis now crippling oil importing developing\ncountries. We do appreciate the efforts made by\nsome members of the Organization of Petroleum\nExporting Countries to try to resolve this acute\nproblem. What we would appreciate even more is\ngreater cooperation in the exploration of energy\nresources, especially in the area of new and\nrenewable sources of energy.\nAnother area of concern to us is that of global\nfood supplies. The eradication of hunger and\nmalnutrition is, and should be, a collective\ninternational effort. The establishment of a\nworld food security system and an internationally\ncoordinated system of nationally held food\nreserves would go a long way towards ameliorating\ncurrent world food shortages and would also\nguarantee surpluses for our expanding populations.\nIt is quite obvious that most countries cannot\nescape the malignant consequences of the world\neconomic crisis. Indeed, some countries are faced\nwith stagnation and outright zero growth rates.\nThere is therefore the need to intensify economic\ncooperation and collective self reliance among\nStates, particularly among the developing\ncountries. The new international economic order\nwill, however, remain illusory unless the\ndeveloping countries prove that they are willing\nto be assertive and determined to play an\neffective role in international economic\nrelations.\nFinally, may I congratulate and thank the\nSecretary General for his frank, objective and\nhonest report on the work of the United Nations,\nto which I have already had occasion to refer in\nmy statement. The delegation of Zimbabwe agrees\nentirely with every aspect of the report and\nstrongly endorses the references to the need to\nexamine more critically the peace keeping and\npeace making roles of the United Nations,\nespecially the Security Council. The Secretary\nGeneral's report is both a welcome inspiration to\nmy delegation and a challenge at a time when\nZimbabwe is looking forward with humility to\nserving on the Security Council. The report has\ncertainly refocused our attention on the noble\npurposes and principles of the Charter, to which\nZimbabwe is recommitting and rededicating itself.\n"

        "file_text": "  Before beginning my statement, I should like to \nexpress on behalf of my delegation our most \nsincere congratulations to Mr. Hollai on the \noccasion of his well-deserved election to the \npresidency of the thirty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly. His qualities as a skilled \ndiplomat, together with his long experience in \nthe Organization, as well as the high posts that \nhe has held in his country, all constitute a \nguarantee that our work will progress well and \nour debates serenely, at a time when the \nOrganization is called upon to deal with an \nendlessly growing number of complex problems of \ninternational scope. We there\u00acfore wish him every \nsuccess in the exercise of his difficult \nresponsibilities.\n176.\tPlease allow me also to pay a heartfelt \ntribute to his predecessor, Mr. Kittani, for the \ncompetence and dedication with which he exercised \nthe presidency of the last session. We also \nexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General \nfor his tireless efforts in the service of world \npeace since he was elected almost a year ago.\n177.\tAs we meet once again in the Assembly to \nassess, as is traditional, the work done by the \nUnited Nations since our last regular session and \nto review the international situation, we must \nobserve that, in spite of our legitimate \naspirations for a better world, the balance sheet \nis once again negative. How else could we \ndescribe it when a large number of coun\u00actries, \nespecially the weakest among them, live in the \ndaily anguish of inexorably mounting dangers?\n178.\tIn fact, the noble and sacred principles \ninscribed in the Charter of the United Nations \nare trampled underfoot and sometimes willfully \nviolated. Inter\u00acnational relations, both \npolitical and economic, are deteriorating at a \nrapid pace and are taking an increasingly \ndisquieting turn. Here and there, might prevails \nover right and the fait accompli replaces \ndialogue and agreement.\n179.\tThat being the situation, we believe that \nefforts must be made more than ever before in \norder to seek ways and means of overcoming the \nproblems and in order to safeguard the future of \nmankind. Hence the primary and decisive role that \nthe Organization must play in this troubled \nworld. It is therefore time that the purpose for \nwhich it was created, that is, the safeguarding \nand maintenance of peace be at last respected. \nThe time has come to restore its credibility, as \nmillions of people place their hopes in it. For \nmany of them it is sometimes their only resort.\n180.\tThe many dangers that I have just \nmentioned find tragic illustration in the grave \nevents that occurred in Lebanon a few days ago. \nAn appalled and angry world learned through the \ntelevision screen of the abominable crime, the \ngratuitous massacre of hundreds of children, \nwomen and elderly persons in the Palesti\u00acnian \nrefugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in Beirut. \nThat odious crime is horrible beyond all \nimagination and recalls a bloody page in the \nrecent history of the world which we believed to \nbe a thing of the past. It is all the more \nunpardonable and unjustifiable as it was \ncommitted against innocent, defenseless victims.\n181.\tIn my country, the Islamic Federal \nRepublic of the Comoros, the massacres of Sabra \nand Shatila were felt with great sorrow by the \nentire population. A day of national mourning and \nof prayer in memory of the martyrs unjustly \nassassinated was decreed by the President of the \nRepublic, Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane who, at \nthe same time, forcefully con\u00acdemned those who \nperpetrated and facilitated that dastardly deed.\n182.\tOn many occasions in the Assembly my \ncountry has expressed its views on the problem of \nthe Middle East. There can be no doubt, as we see \nit, that it is Israel's intransigence, together \nwith its annexationist and expansionist designs, \nwhich make it impossible to find a lasting \nsolution to this problem, nor can there be any \ndoubt that it is the vast financial and military \nmeans made available to Israel that make it \npossible for the Zionist entity to continue \narrogantly to defy the many decisions and \nresolutions adopted by the Organization.\n183.\tMankind cannot remain indifferent to the \ngenocide in west Beirut; otherwise it will lose \nits very dignity. The guilty and their \naccomplices must be found and punished. In our \nview one thing is clear, and that is the direct \nresponsibility of Israel in this mass \nassassination. It is time for the international \ncommunity at last to react firmly in the face of \nthe policy of extermination of the Israeli \nGovernment. That Government must withdraw its \ntroops, not only from Beirut, but from all of \nLebanon and comply with the relevant resolutions \nof the Organization, especially those of the \nSecurity Council.\n184.\tWe welcome the results of the Twelfth \nArab Summit Conference at Fez, devoted to the \nproblems of the Middle East. We feel that the \ndecisions that were adopted during that \nConference constitute clear progress in the \nsearch for a just and lasting solution to the \nproblem that is tearing that region apart. We \nstrongly condemn Israel's attitude, aimed at \nsystematically rejecting the peace plan.\n185.\tIt was more than a generation ago now \nthat the Palestinian people was driven out of its \ncountry, forced into exile, robbed of its lands \nand compelled to wander from one refugee camp to \nanother. Israel can no longer continue to ignore \nthe Palestinian fact, the right of that people to \nself-determination, and to establish a free and \nindependent State on its own land.\n186.\tI should like here to express our \nadmiration and respect for the head of the PLO, \nMr. Yasser Arafat, for his exemplary courage and, \nindeed, the heroism that he demonstrated during \nthe siege of west Beirut by Israeli forces. I \nalso take this oppor\u00actunity to reaffirm once \nagain the unassailable and constant support of \nthe Comorian people and its Government for the \njust struggle of the Palestinian people and its \nsole legitimate representative, the PLO.\n187.\tIt is on the basis of that same sacred \nprinciple of the right of peoples to \nself-determination and free\u00acdom that my country \nonce again issues a pressing appeal for the \nforeign troops to withdraw from Afgha\u00acnistan, \nmaking it possible for the people of that country \nfreely to choose the political system it \nconsiders best for its future. It has been three \nyears now since a foreign army occupied that \ncountry, which was formerly non-aligned, \ncompelling a large part of the population to \nchoose the course of exile.\n188.\tMy country has witnessed with profound \nsad\u00acness the continuation of the war between Iraq \nand -the Islamic Republic of Iran, two \nnon-aligned Moslem States. In spite of the \nmediation efforts undertaken by the Organization \nof the Islamic Conference and the non aligned \nmovement, that absurd and fratricidal war \ncontinues to exact thousands of victims on both \nsides, not to mention the sizeable material \ndamage it causes. We therefore once again \nsolemnly appeal to the two belligerents to cease \ntheir hostilities imme\u00acdiately so that hatred and \nintransigence can yield to wisdom and \nconciliation. In fact, that conflict not only \nconstitutes a threat to peace in that region, but \nbears the insidious seed of overall \nconflagration, given the highly strategic nature \nof the region.\n189.\tThe problem of Cyprus is still on the \nagenda of the Assembly. We are pleased, however, \nat the progress, limited but real, that has been \nachieved this year in the framework of the \nintercommunal talks in the quest for a just and \nlasting solution that would preserve the peace, \nunity and sovereignty of Cyprus. We encourage the \ntwo Governments, Greek and Turkish, to continue \ntheir negotiations so that a prompt and \nsatisfactory solution can be found, one likely to \nsafeguard the interests of all those affected by \nthe problem. In this respect, we wish to pay a \ntribute to the Secretary-General for the efforts \nthat he has constantly made to find a solution to \nthat problem.\n190.\tIn respect of Kampuchea, we cannot fail \nto express our deep disappointment at the fact \nthat the decisions of the General Assembly \ndemanding the immediate unconditional withdrawal \nof foreign troops from that country have been \nignored. The people of Kampuchea, just like all \nother peoples in the world, have aright to peace \nand freedom and it is time for their martyrdom to \nend. The direct action of a neighbouring Power \nwhich keeps many divisions of its army in \nKampuchea endangers not only the peace of the \nregion by creating an atmosphere of constant \ndestabilization but also constitutes a grave \nthreat to international peace and security.\n191.\tThe situation in the Korean peninsula \nremains deadlocked. Nevertheless, we do take note \nof the statement by the leaders of the two States \nindicating that they wish to arrive at a peaceful \nsolution making it possible for their divided \nhomeland to be reunified. We must encourage and \nsupport those good intentions, because a united \nKorea is a guarantee of peace and stability in \nthat part of the world.\n192.\tThe question of Namibia continues to be \nof the greatest concern to my Government. A11 \nAfrica places its hopes in the Organization, but \nthe United Nations will lose credibility if it is \nunable to guarantee to the peoples of Namibia and \nSouth Africa the freedom and justice to which \nthey naturally aspire. There can be no doubt that \nit is thanks to the assistance of certain \nindustrialized Powers that South Africa is able \nconstantly to defy United Nations decisions and \nto continue to exploit through the odious system \nof apartheid millions of Africans in their own \nland and illegally to occupy Namibia.\n193.\tIt is only through the prompt \nimplementation of Security Council resolution 433 \n(1978) that it will be possible to achieve the \npeaceful decolonization of Namibia by prohibiting \nany attempt to amend that resolution or blur its \ndetails, because this would just be playing the \ngame of the South African racists.\n194.\tThe efforts made thus far by the contact \ngroup to induce Pretoria to comply with \nresolution 435 (1978) have met with the delaying \ntactics of the Pretoria regime, which ceaselessly \nresorts to subterfuge, going so far as to \ninterfere in the internal affairs of \nneigh\u00acbouring countries in order to impose its \nillegal policy in Namibia. Today, the South \nAfrican army is in constant violation of the \nsouthern territory of Angola, killing hundreds of \ninnocent men, women and children by \nindiscriminate bombings.\n195.\tRegarding its evacuation of Namibia, \nPretoria seeks to impose unacceptable conditions \non a sover\u00aceign country, Angola. All these \nmeasures and these delays are aimed at gaining \ntime to make it possible for Pretoria to train \nand place its puppets at the head of the \nforthcoming independent Namibian Govern\u00acment. It \nis now up to the international community, to the \nOrganization, to take enforcement measures to \ncompel the Pretoria leaders to respect United \nNations decisions.\n196.\tI take this opportunity to reaffirm the \ntotal solidarity and unfailing support, both \nmoral and material, of my Government for SWAPO, \nthe genuine representative of the Namibian people \nin its just strug\u00acgle for the liberation of its \ncountry. I should also like to express here the \nunshakeable determination of my country to lend \nsupport to the national liberation movements of \nsouthern Africa.\n197.\tAs regards Western Sahara, my country \nendorses the resolution adopted at the eighteenth \nsession of the Assembly of Heads of State and \nGovern\u00acment of the Organization of African Unity, \nheld at Nairobi, in June 1981 and remains \nconvinced that a satisfactory solution to this \nserious problem, which could threaten our \npan-African organization with collapse, is to be \nfound through the full application of the \nresolution relating to the organization of a \nreferendum on self-determination for the people \nof that country. We hope once again that African \nwisdom will manage to avoid a prolongation of a \ndispute, which has incalculable consequences. As \nfar as we are con\u00accerned, we are ready to support \nany initiative aimed at safeguarding our \norganization, a symbol of the strength and unity \nof our African continent.\n198.\tAnother no less pressing problem \nthreatening us directly is of concern not just to \nmy country but also to many others in the same \nregion, since it relates to the further \nstrengthening of the foreign military presence in \nthe Indian Ocean. The root of this \nmili\u00actarization of an erstwhile peaceful zone is \nthe rivalry between the major Powers, who are \ninvolved in an arms race as frantic as it is \nabsurd. This state of affairs is giving rise to \nan explosive situation of con\u00accern to all the \ncoastal countries. It has also led to a sharp \ndeterioration in the climate of security which \nused to reign throughout this vast region. Thus \nit is with great disappointment that my country \nhas wit\u00acnessed the many obstacles which have \narisen to prevent the convening of the conference \nwhich the Organization was to have held at \nColombo in order to study the methods of \nimplementation of the Declara\u00action of the Indian \nOcean as a Zone of Peace, contained in General \nAssembly resolution 2832 (XXVI).\n199.\tMy country, like others wishing to \npreserve peace and security in that region, \nunreservedly sup\u00acports the idea of creating a \nzone of peace in the Indian Ocean and sincerely \nhopes that the conference which is to discuss \nthis matter will finally be able to meet. We \nsupport the position of the non-aligned countries \nin favor of holding it in Sri Lanka.\n200.\tThe gloomy picture of the international \npolitical situation which I have just sketched is \nunfortunately reflected in the serious economic \nimbalances to be found in the world today. We all \nmore or less agree on one point, namely, that \nthis crisis does exist. It has struck hard at all \ncountries with few exceptions, but it has \naffected the developing countries most, \nparticularly the weakest among them, those which \nare called the least developed.\n201.\tThe Islamic Federal Republic of the \nComoros, which is among the latter, is feeling \neven more pain\u00acfully the harmful effects of this \ncrisis, because of the problems arising from its \nspecial geographic characteristics. Because of \nits island character, the Comoros Islands must \ncope with structural problems: isolation due to \ndistance from major international communications \nroutes and lack of adequate infra\u00acstructures, \nalthough considerable efforts have been made in \nthis area by the Government and many projects are \nnow in progress. But we continue to come up \nagainst financial problems; in fact, the Comoros \nlike most of the non-oil-producing devel\u00acoping \ncountries, has suffered for several years from a \ngrowing deficit in its balance of trade caused by \nworsening exchange rates.\n202.\tAlthough our country has a virtual \nmonopoly of the production of certain cash crops, \nsuch as ylang- ylang and vanilla, nevertheless it \nis subject to the risks of a market controlled by \npeople who, com\u00acfortably installed in their \noffices somewhere in Europe, decide on the prices \naccording to criteria which they alone are privy \nto. Because of this we frequently have to sell \nour export products at a loss.\n203.\tAn obvious result of this is a \nconsiderable drop in our export revenues, \nresulting in a lack of resources which leads to \nbudgetary deadlocks and their corollary, \ninflation. In order to cope with this we \nunfortunately have to resort to loans, which add \nto the burden of our indebtedness.\n204.\tFaced with this problem, my Government \nmakes an urgent appeal, based on General Assembly \nresolu\u00action 36/212, to the international \ncommunity, inter\u00acnational financial institutions \nand developed countries which are able to do so \nto give us assistance in 3he development process \nof our country.\n205.\tIn this context, it is a pleasure for me \nto announce from this rostrum that, pursuant to \nthe recommendations of the United Nations \nConference on the Least Developed Countries for \na round table of the major lenders will be held \nin our capital, Moroni, in March 1983 and will \nbring together all those who are willing to \nrespond to this appeal and to participate in \nfinancing our development projects. I fervently \nhope that this appeal will be heeded.\n206.\tIf, each time we are given the \nopportunity, we demand new measures and \nconstantly call for global negotiations, a new \ninternational economic and monetary order and \nincreased assistance to the most disadvantaged \ncountries, that is not mere rhetoric but a call \nfor justice. The major rich industrialized \ncoun\u00actries frequently take pleasure in \nproclaiming with a certain pride the major \nprinciples and values of de\u00acmocracy, freedom and \njustice, which in their view are the unique \ncharacteristics of their civilization, but \nnational pride and the facts contradict them.\n207.\tHowever, a great hope was born last year \nduring the International Meeting Co-operation and \nDevelopment at Cancun in October 1981. The \npeoples and countries of the third world saw in \nthat meeting the beginning of an awareness among \nthe rich coun\u00actries of the problems and \ndifficulties facing the devel\u00acoping nations. \nUnfortunately, today our great disap\u00acpointment is \nequaled only by the hope which that meeting \nengendered. We are witnessing the progressive and \naccelerated erosion of the instruments and \ninstitutions which were justly established; infer \no/w, to find solutions to the problems of the \npoor coun\u00actries. The present economic situation \ncan be improved only if concerted action is taken \nat the international level to correct the harmful \nand perverse effects of the present economic and \nmonetary situation. Of course, that requires the \ngood will and loyalty of all countries.\n208.\tIt is in that context that the Government \nof my country supports the efforts undertaken to \nlaunch global negotiations, considering that both \nNorth and South must make some sacrifices. Only \nat that price will the world find a way out of \nthe existing morass of economic and financial \ncrises.\n209.\tI should like before concluding this \nrapid review of the political and economic \nsituation prevailing in the world to mention once \nagain a question of which the Assembly is well \naware and which for us Comorians is of prime \nimportance; it is a subject of constant concern \nsince it is the question of the Comorian Island \nof Mayotte. I do not think it would be useful to \nrepeat the background of this question here, \nsince several debates have been devoted to it at \nearlier sessions and since it remains on the \nagenda and thus will be the subject of a specific \ndebate, when we shall have the opportunity to \nspeak on it. Today I shall limit myself to \nrecalling the resolutions adopted by the United \nNations, OAU, the Islamic Conference and the \nnon-aligned movement, all of which affirm \nunequivo\u00accally the territorial integrity of the \nComoros as a country made up of four islands, \nincluding Mayotte, over which the sovereignty of \nthe Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros \nshould clearly extend.\n210.\tIt was on the basis of those resolutions \nand under the aegis of the OAU that anv4d \nCommittee of Seven of the OAU, specially \nentrusted with follow\u00acing the developments of \nthis problem, met in Moroni, from 9 to 11 \nNovember 1981. During that meeting the Committee \ntook note of the question and adopted certain \nrecommendations advocating, inter alia, direct \ncontact between the French and Comorian \nGovernments in order to find a just solution to \nthis problem through negotiations.\n211.\tSince then, several meetings at the \nhighest level have taken place between the two \ncountries, par\u00acticularly between the President of \nthe French Repub\u00aclic, Francois Mitterrand, and \nthe President of the Islamic Federal Republic of \nthe Comoros, Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane. \nDuring those meetings, which were frank and \nfriendly, as relations are between France and the \nComoros, the French President expressed his \nGovernment's desire to reach a satis\u00acfactory \nsolution to this problem.\n212.\tTaking note of that commitment, the \nComorian Government reaffirms its will to \ncontinue through negotiation and in accordance \nwith the relevant decisions and resolutions of \ninternational organiza\u00actions, to take all the \nnecessary steps to regain its territorial \nintegrity, that is, the return of the island of \nMayotte to the Comorian group of islands.\n213.\tThis peaceful struggle which we are \ncarrying on is not ours alone: it is that of all \npeoples and all countries which respect the \nCharter of the United Nations and international \nlaw. For its part, the Comorian people remains \ndetermined to pursue its legitimate claims, sure \nof its right, which is recognized and supported \nby the entire international community through its \nvaries organizations. Thus we expect France and \nthose who lead it today to respect their past and \npresent commitments and the law so that we may \nfind a just solution to this problem.\n214.\tThe United Nations was created to carry \nout a noble mission, that of safeguarding and \nmaintaining peace and security in the world. The \nmany hotbeds of tension which have flared up \nthroughout the world are likely at any time to \nplunge it into a new war, with unimaginable \nconsequences. In a world that has lost its way, \nit is time that the Organization regained its \nmain vocation. Of course that will be possible \nonly if each of its Members, whatever its power, \nscrupulously respects the principles of the \nCharter. For its part, the Islamic Federal \nRepublic of the Comoros, faithful to the great \nprinciples of peace, liberty and justice, will \ncontinue to make its contribution, however \nmodest, to strengthening the effectiveness of the \nOrganization and helping it to regain its noble \nreputation. This is very survival of mankind \ndepends upon this.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to add the voice of the delegation of \nSuriname to the voices of many others that have congratulated Mr. \nHollai on his unanimous election to preside over our deliberations at \nthe thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. His knowledge and \nexperience will surely prove to be important assets for the success \nof this session, especially at a time when international institutions \nlike the United Nations face a serious crisis. May I also take this \nopportunity to express the gratitude of my delegation to his \npredecessor, Mr. Kittani, for the skilled leadership with which he \nguided the proceedings of the Assembly at the sessions held during \nhis tenure of office. I should also like to pay a tribute to the \nSecretary General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, a great son of the \ncourageous Peruvian people, on his election to that high post. My \ncountry sees in him a true representative and protagonist of Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean unity. In view of the fact that Latin America \nand the Caribbean region have developed a tradition of peace for more \nthan a hundred years, we trust that his election at this difficult \njuncture in history will contribute towards international peace and \nprogress. We agree that, as has been eloquently stated by a great \nnumber of speakers who have preceded me in the general debate, the \nOrganization is going through a serious credibility crisis. At the \nsame time, we note with satisfaction that this session is enjoying \nthe maximum attendance of the family of States Members of the \nOrganization. We have to face facts. The Secretary General has been \nvery frank in describing the present international crisis, \npolitically, economically and institutionally. We join the Secretary \nGeneral in calling upon all Member States to use all possible \ninventiveness and creativity to equip the United Nations \ninstitutionally in order to enhance its capacity to cope with the \npresent international crisis. That appeal applies in particular to \nthe members of the Security Council which bear a special \nresponsibility to ensure the urgent restoration of peace in various \nregions of the world. The cause of predictability of conduct of \nnations, as well as adherence to principles and rules of \ninternational law, must guide us in our effort to prevent the \ninternational community from slipping into a state characterized by \nthe primitive use of force and coercive influence. My Government \nholds the view that the existing inequalities in the distribution of \neconomic and political advantages are at the core of the problems we \nare faced with on a national and international scale. More \nspecifically, the present international division of labour and the \nadoption of political systems conceived and propagated by States that \ncontinue to hold power over ether States have created a situation \nwhere the basic needs and justified interests and aspirations of the \nmasses are subordinated to the interests of traditionalist and \nelitist Powers. Suriname has committed itself to contribute within \nthe limits of its capacity towards ending flagrant inequalities \nexisting on the national and the international levels. On the \nnational level, Suriname has made substantial progress in conceiving \nand implementing an economic and political system based on the \ninterests and participation of the majority of its people. In doing \nso Suriname adheres to the genuine principles of democracy. We \nbelieve that consultation, participation and control by broad \nsections of our people offer the best guarantees to achieve the goal \nof nation building in a country where at least six ethnic groups from \nall parts of the world were brought together during the colonial era. \nMoreover, we are exerting serious efforts to make this unity an \neffective instrument for the proper and effective implementation of \ndevelopmental programmes. In our international policy we have \ndeveloped a strategy geared towards maximum diversification of \ndevelopment cooperation and solidarity in the struggle for the just \ncauses of developing countries. In doing so we adhere to the \nprinciples of non alignment. In this respect, we reiterate our full \ncommitment to the basic principles of this movement, such as national \nsovereignty, self determination, non interference, non intervention, \nthe settlement of disputes by peaceful means and the acceptance of \nideological pluralism in international affairs. Moreover, my \nGovernment holds the view that we should continue to intensify \nfinancial, technological and marketing relations with other \ndeveloping countries and join in the efforts of the developing world \nin restructuring the North South relationship in order to create the \nkind of international balance that can advance the cause of peace and \ndevelopment. Taking into consideration the fact that the ongoing \ndecolonization of Suriname is closely linked to a clear understanding \nthat it must share the fate of the Latin American and Caribbean \nStates, Suriname will continue to participate in all endeavours to \nstrengthen political and economic ties with the countries of its \nregion. In regard to the implications of Argentina's actions to \nrecover its sovereignty over the Malvinas, we understand the position \nof some sister Caribbean States, but those actions constitute only a \npart of the Malvinas experience. The Malvinas issue made it very \nclear to us that the Western States, in spite of existing treaties, \ntook a collective stand against 3 sister State in Latin America. That \ncollective action was not limited to economic measures of a coercive \nnature, but extended to military, political and diplomatic support. \nMy Government feels that an important lesson must be drawn from this \nexperience. The facts have proved that it is of vital importance for \nLatin America and the Caribbean States to bury their differences and \nto join hands in defining and implementing clear cut programmes \ngeared towards economic and political cooperation. My Government \nwelcomes the inclusion of this question in the agenda of this session \nof the General Assembly. It is our hope that a more constructive and \ncompromise oriented attitude will be displayed in the deliberations \nto end the colonial occupation of the Malvinas, thus correcting the \ninjustice done to the Argentine people over many years. The Caribbean \nBasin is an area of special concern; indeed, it has become explosive \nin nature. We cannot but return to the historical causes of this \nsituation, to identify a general state of utter poverty amongst the \nmajority of the people, in flagrant contradistinction to the wealth \nof a minority. We find in that a situation which is in itself \nconducive to violence and civil war. In that regard, the introduction \nof East West rivalry in the region, falsely identified as the main \nsource of conflict, has eclipsed the real causes of the problem. The \npresent situation in El Salvador, placed in the context of the \nCaribbean Basin, is illustrative of this growing tension and \nconstitutes a danger leading to the loss of human lives and a \nstagnation in development. My Government therefore favors all peace \nproposals derived from a fundamental analysis of this problem. That \nimplies that Suriname condemns all outside interference of whatever \nnature into the internal affairs of El Salvador. We call upon the \nrival parties in this domestic struggle to take the road of effective \ndialogue to stop the ongoing violence. The people of El Salvador are \nthose most capable of forging a fundamental solution to their \neconomic and political problems. A11 outside interference, whether \nbona fide or mala fide, can lead only to further complications in the \npresent situation and will ultimately serve the interests of foreign \nPowers, to the detriment of the interests of the majority of the \nSalvadorian people. My Government pledges support to all regional \nefforts to bring about an atmosphere in which such a dialogue can \ntake place. The principle of peaceful dialogue does not apply only to \nthe domestic situation of the individual States, but should be \napplied also to solve the problems that have arisen between sister \nStates in Latin America. My Government calls upon all members of the \nLatin American and Caribbean community to refrain from the use or \nthreat of use of force or economic measures of a coercive nature in \nthe pursuit of solutions to problems that are not inherent in the \nactual relationship between our respective peoples but find their \ncause in the colonialist and imperialist history of our continent. \nThe Latin American and Caribbean States should, in our opinion, \nfollow the wise course of seeking a peaceful settlement of disputes \nso as to protect and preserve our excellent record as a region of \npeace. We must face the fact that global developments present a \ngloomy picture. The ongoing economic crises, combined with the arms \nrace, resulted in grave and explosive situations in various regions. \nThe tragedy that we have witnessed over a quarter of a century in the \nMiddle East has recently evolved into a sequence of events which have \nhorrified the human conscience. Even when guided by the utmost \nprudence in approaching this complex problem one cannot but lay the \nblame for this disturbing state of affairs on the State of Israel. \nWhile Israel occasionally professes the wish to live in peace with \nits neighbours, it has over the months systematically applied an \naggressive policy and has acted against vested principles and rules \nof international law and, more specifically, against the territorial \nintegrity of its neighbours. In this connection I wish to recall the \nannexation of the Syrian territory of the Golan Heights, the \nprovocative and oppressive acts of the Israeli army against \nPalestinian civilians living in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip \nand, lately, the transgression of Lebanese borders, leading to the \nmassacre of thousands of defenceless Palestinian men, women and \nchildren. That crime against humanity has deservedly received \nuniversal condemnation, not only of those who committed that savage \nact but equally of those who facilitated that repulsive crime. \nReaching the goal of durable peace in the Middle East will obviously \nrequire more than the adoption of resolutions by the Assembly and \nother international forums. The fate of the numerous resolutions \nadopted by the United Nations pertinent to this question is proof \nthat this approach is insufficient. It will require maximum efforts \nby the world community in general to bring an end to the continuing \ntragic events. Those members of the international community that are \nin a position to bring pressure to bear on the parties to the \nconflict have a special responsibility in this respect. My Government \nnotes with satisfaction that there is an emerging consensus. Any \nsolution of the Middle East conflict proposed will be futile if it \nignores the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to self \ndetermination and to the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian \nState. It is with pleasure that I note the growing numbers of \ncountries adhering to this basic principle for solving the Middle \nEast problem. Furthermore, my delegation expresses its satisfaction \nwith the consensus reached during the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference \non the proposed peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem. Most \nof the preceding speakers have forthrightly rejected and condemned \nSouth Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia and its aggression \ntowards neighbouring States. We cannot but agree with that position. \nIn our view, the application of racist policies by South Africa is \nnot just a case of violence by a minority against the majority, but \namounts to a qualitative contempt for and lack of respect for the \npeople living under that system, and a clear expression of the \neconomic exploitation of the racial majority in that country. My \ndelegation therefore holds the position that South Africa's domestic \npolicies and its stand towards neighbouring States can be dealt with \neffectively by the world community, in general, and by the developed \ncountries, in particular, only by applying international measures \ndesigned to bring about a fundamental restructuring within the South \nAfrican social and economic system. With regard to the presence of \nforeign troops in Afghanistan, my delegation reiterates its support \nfor the resolutions of the Assembly calling for their withdrawal. Our \nsupport for a political settlement of this issue on the basis of \nGeneral Assembly resolution 36/34 remains unchanged. Concerning the \nsituation in the Korean peninsula, my delegation again calls upon \nboth parties to make all possible efforts to promote reconciliation \nbetween the North and the South through dialogue in order to achieve \nthe peaceful unification of their divided homeland. it is a matter of \nserious concern to our Government that very little progress has been \nmade in solving the problem of Kampuchea. It is our hope that the \nopposing parties will approach this problem along the lines of the \nbasic principles laid down in the Charter of the United Nations. \nMoreover, we express the sincere wish that the countries members of \nthe Association of South East Asian Nations together with the Indo \nChinese countries involved, can cooperate to find an acceptable \nsolution to the problem in order to make South East Asia a region of \npeace, stability and cooperation. Within the chain of events that \nhave cast a shadow on the life and standing of the United Nations \nduring the past year, the failure of the second special session of \nthe General Assembly on disarmament stands out, and has given rise to \nserious concern for the Attire of world peace and stability. The arms \nrace continues at an unprecedented pace. It is the opinion of my \ndelegation that the lack of tangible progress in our attempts to halt \nthis costly and dangerous activity will have increasingly adverse \neffects on the inclination of States to settle their disputes through \npeaceful means, thus making peacekeeping ever more difficult for the \nUnited Nations. It is our belief that the availability of vast \nquantities of arms is responsible for the frequent use or threat of \nuse of force in international relations. It is unfortunate that many \nStates are still inclined to believe that they can better secure what \nthey perceive to be their interests through military strength rather \nthan by relying on peaceful means. Notwithstanding the right of \nindividual States to take the necessary measures to defend their \nterritorial integrity, we cannot but condemn the acceleration of the \narms race which represents a vicious circle. Under the pretext of \nprotecting alleged domestic interests, States devote to it the very \nresources that are needed to create the conditions for domestic and \ninternational peace and progress, drawing upon financial, natural and \nhuman resources that are so direly needed for development. Recent \nhistory has proved that the use of violence between developing \ncountries has been detrimental to the countries involved and has \nseriously weakened their capacity for independent development. We \ntherefore hold the view that developing countries should refrain from \nany participation in the arms race, and should collectively exert \npressure on the super Powers and other powerful nations to \ndiscontinue the absurdity of creating tension in order falsely to \njustify their continuation of the arms race. We reiterate Suriname's \ncommitment to all regional and global disarmament endeavours. Not \nsince the great economic depression has the world economy experienced \nsuch great instability and such severe disruption of sustained \ngrowth. Independent of the levels of development or the economic \nstructures of various States, economic expansion has decelerated \nmarkedly on a global scale. The situation confronting the developing \ncountries is manifested in increased unemployment, high rates of \ninflation, serious deterioration in terms of trade and increasing \ncurrent account deficits and debt service payments. The declining \nprices of primary commodities compared to the rising costs of \nmanufactured imports have not only seriously affected the \ndevelopmental process in many developing countries but, also as a \nresult, substantially affected the basic needs of their peoples. \nWithin the context of the present international economic situation we \nbelieve that it is of urgent and crucial importance to launch the \nround of global negotiations in the field of raw materials, energy, \ntrade and finance. Suriname maintains the view that resolution \n34/138, by which the General Assembly decided to launch global \nnegotiations, incorporates the appropriate set of elements needed to \ntackle the present international economic structure and achieve a \nsteady, equal and just economic order. It is clear that science and \ntechnology are major instruments in the developmental process. It is \ntherefore regrettable that in the world of today the developing \ncountries are still confronted with the monopolization of scientific \nand technological achievements. A few States and transnational \ncorporations still control the available scientific and technological \nknow how. In this respect my delegation considers it imperative that \nany bilateral or multilateral arrangement in the field of finance and \ninvestment, whether private or public, include clauses dealing with \nthe transfer of science and technology suitable to the level of \ndevelopment of developing countries. On the other hand, third world \ncountries must continue to devise and implement programmes which may \nfacilitate the transfer of technology among themselves. The \ninternational problems related to the financial crisis of the world \nrequire close evaluation and concerted effort in order to create the \neffects that are so urgently needed. We note that there are two \nimportant tendencies in the field of investment for development. In \nthe first place we had a tendency to move away from multilateral aid \nto bilateral aid. Secondly, we had that within bilateral treaties the \nGovernment to Government approach is being gradually replaced by \ninvestments through private financing institutions. Suriname is of \nthe opinion that these trends are detrimental to the development of \nthe recipient States, for the following reasons. First, they weaken \nthe regional integration that is vital to their international \nbargaining power vis a vis the industrialized States. Secondly, they \ncreate an atmosphere favouring measures of a coercive nature, which \nseriously affects a country's capacity for its own development either \npolitically or economically. Thirdly, with respect to the emphasis on \nprivate investments, in the experience of the developing countries it \nis becoming virtually impossible to attract foreign investors in the \nfield of infrastructural and social programmes essential for \nsustained and steady economic growth. As a result, investments for \nindustrial or commercial development are not in accord with \ncomprehensive planning for development. We are in favour of a blend \nof bilateral and multilateral aid, within which emphasis must be \nplaced on multilateral aid. However, we cannot but insist that for \nmultilateral aid to be effective substantial changes in the rules and \nprocedures guiding these multilateral institutions are necessary. A \nmajor step forward in this regard would be a fundamental change in \nthe existing voting structure in order to allow developing countries \ngreater participation in the decision making process of these \ninternational institutions. A majority of developing countries are \nfaced with the problem of immense foreign debts. In this respect we \nunderline the need to implement part B of resolution 165 adopted by \nthe Trade and Development Board on 11 March 1978, at its ninth \nspecial session, and which deals with the renegotiation of the debts \nof developing countries. As a small developing and trading nation, \nSuriname is sensitive to fluctuations in trade with our major trading \npartners. Our prosperity, like that of many other developing \ncountries, depends greatly on the export of relatively few primary \nproducts. The quantitative and qualitative improvement of our exports \nis the target of ambitious industrialization programmes, which absorb \nlarge amounts of capital. Whether we consider our present trade \nposition or the intended improvement, the developing countries are \nfaced with a growing crisis in the world market. This crisis is \nmainly characterized by increasing protectionist measures by the \nindustrialized States. To eliminate these tradebarriers the role of \nGATT must be directed towards new normative tasks, such as the \nestablishment of rules which do not hamper access by the developing \ncountries to international markets and which do not hinder their \ncapacity to regulate their own internal markets. Hence, my delegation \nstrongly appeals for a review of the international economic \ninstitutions. Without relaxing our efforts to work for more just and \nequitable terms of trade in the North South relationship, it is \nimportant to consider the intensification of trade among developing \ncountries as an integral part of collective action for the \nestablishment of a new international economic order. My Government \nholds the view that in regional, sub regional and bilateral relations \nefforts should be made to concentrate on exploring and exploiting \ntrade possibilities between developing countries. In this respect it \nis of vital importance that we take a pragmatic approach and try to \nend specific areas of trade. My Government is of the opinion that the \nprivate sector in developing countries may provide an excellent start \nfor broadening and deepening trade relations. The negotiations with \nregard to the law of the sea, which lasted almost 10 years, ended on \n30 April of this year with the adoption of the most ambitious \nConvention in history, the United Nations Convention on the Law of \nthe Sea. This Convention, which seeks to regulate almost every aspect \nof human activity in the oceans and tries to uphold the United \nNations resolution calling for the deep sea bed to be regarded as the \ncommon heritage of mankind, is now ready to be signed officially. \n From the Convention we may expect legal security, confidence and \nreliability, which preclude anarchy in the area of the international \nsea bed. It is regrettable that the Third United Nations Conference \non the Law of the Sea failed to meet its goal of unanimous adoption \nof the Convention. In this situation, with a good many of the \nindustrialized States failing to support the Convention, its \nviability and consequently its standing in international law are \nbeing undermined. We reject any separate arrangement in which the \nmajor industrialized States would simply proceed to share the sea bed \namongst themselves. We therefore fully support the statement made by \nthe President of the Conference on the Law of the Sea to the press on \n3 May of this year, indicating that the General Assembly should be \nrequested to seek an advisory opinion from the International Court of \nJustice on the legality of mining outside the Convention if the \nmining companies proceeded to mine under unilateral legislation or a \nlimited multilateral agreement. We welcome the recent statement made \nby the Soviet Union that it will sign the Convention, and we urgently \nappeal to the States that have rejected or failed to commit \nthemselves to the Convention on account of rigid ideological \nconsiderations based on a free market philosophy, or for other \nreasons, to be more pragmatic and become signatories when the \nConvention is presented to government representatives in Jamaica in \nearly December of this year. Despite all the problems involved, the \nConvention can be considered as the greatest step in international \nrelations since the founding of the United Nations. We, \nrepresentatives of the developing countries, had hoped that the \nConvention would be a major step forward towards the new \ninternational economic order which we have so long been demanding. We \ntherefore call for the good will and cooperation of the \nindustrialized States, without which the effort to establish a regime \nfor, among other things, the common heritage of mankind will have \nbeen largely wasted. Failure of the major industrialized countries to \ncooperate will only justify the conclusion that the political will to \nshape economic developments along equitable lines in the context of \nthe North South dialogue is still a long way off. I shall now turn to \na number of humanitarian and social issues. In our view, at this \nsession the General Assembly will need to pay more attention to the \nplight of people who are forced to flee their homelands. The effects \nof the 1982 war in Lebanon on the civil population will undoubtedly \nadd to the major concentrations of refugees and displaced persons \ncaused by regional conflicts during the last few years. Major refugee \nconcentrations in Somalia, the Sudan, Pakistan and South East Asia \ncontinue to cause concern, because in most cases little progress has \nbeen made in arranging for the refugees to return to their homelands. \nIt is our expectation that discussions at this thirty seventh session \non the status of women will focus on the World Conference to Review \nand Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women, \nto be held in 1985. We cannot but praise the good work done among the \nrural and the poor women by the Voluntary Fund for the United Nations \nDecade for Women. It is a well known fact that an overwhelming \nmajority of the disabled population of the world live in developing \ncountries, where the problems of resources and the lack of adequate, \ntrained personnel are considered to be the great obstacles to \nprogress. The delegation of Suriname hopes, therefore, that \ninternational programmes established to assist the disabled will \nresult in an adequate transfer of technology and resources to \ndeveloping countries.\nMy delegation is anxiously looking forward to a progress report on \nthe implementation of the Specific Programme of Measures and \nActivities'\\\" prepared by the Secretary General in consultation with \nMember States, specialized agencies and international youth \norganizations, especially in view of International Youth Year, which \nis scheduled for 1985. The increasing unemployment among the young \nmembers of our society is causing us great concern. My Government is \ntrying to give high priority to resolving the problems of the young.\nWhile we speak of the young, we should not neglect the elderly. \nAlthough Suriname has not escaped the adverse effects of a worldwide \neconomic recession, the Suriname Government is taking progressive \nmeasures to improve the situation of the aging in the fields of \nhealth, housing and social welfare. Much has been done to provide \ngeriatric and other training, with the assistance of international \norganizations.\nWe are pleased at the adoption of the International Plan of Action on \nAging at the World Assembly on Aging held in Vienna and express the \nhope that this Plan will be guide for Member States in dealing with \nproblems brought about by the rapidly increasing numbers of elderly \npersons all over the world. May I affirm ay Government's commitment \nto the cause of the aged and state that a society cannot call itself \nadvanced or progressive if it does not respect, protect, help and \nhonour the elderly and the aged.\nThe international system has entered a new phase. The intensification \nof international relations is unparalleled in history. At the same \ntime we find that the political, economic and institutional crisis \nwhich we are faced with tends to discourage us in our quest for the \ncreation of a world in which interdependence and a more collective \napproach to matters of common interest are globally accepted. My \nGovernment is of the opinion that defeatism could be replaced by \noptimism if we return to the basic principles and motives that led to \nthe establishment of the United Nations in 1945.\nThe goals of peace and development are still high on the banner of \nthe Organization. We call upon all Member States to support the \nSecretary General in his efforts to adapt and equip the United \nNations in order to enable the Organization to cope with the present \ncrises. As we did in 1975, my Government renews its pledge to uphold \nthe principles and objectives of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Speaking for all members of the delegation of \nUruguay, I wish to address to the President our \nwarmest congratulations on his election to the \npresidency of the thirty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly. Similarly, I wish to convey to \nhis predecessor, Mr. Kittani, our special \nappreciation for the efficiency with which he \ndirected deliberations at the last session.\n257.\tUruguay is taking part in this session of \nthe Assembly with the express desire of \nreaffirming once again as an absolute priority \nits historical commitment to peace. This \ncommitment has been made manifest ever since our \nindependence, in our support for dialogue as an \ninstrument for settling disputes, and in our \nunremitting defense of international law.\n258.\tIn a world troubled by the most serious \nthreats, where there is constant tension and \nconfrontations are rife, even where peace and \nsecurity have been firmly established, the \ninternational community must, without delay, \ndemonstrate in a specific, practical and \neffective manner, that its attachment to the \nprinciples and purposes of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations is not merely a formal promise or \na passive expression of hope.\n259.\tIt is deplorable to note that in the \ninterval since the last session of the Assembly \nnew clashes, with their tragic toll of death and \ndesolation, have taken place in many parts of the \nworld. The sad reality of ongoing wars lends \nadded urgency to the current negotiations and \nstrongly underlines the unavoidable \nresponsibility incumbent on each and every one of \nus, setting aside any dialectics.\n260.\tGiven the vicious circle of mistrust, \ntension and the arms race, civilized and fruitful \ncoexistence can be obtained only to the extent \nthat the various States exert their influence in \ntheir respective spheres in conformity with the \ninternational legal order and in strict \nobservance of the obligations set down in the \nCharter.\n261.\tIt was this line of thinking that led \nUruguay in a constructive spirit actively to \nparticipate in the work of the second special \nsession of the General Assembly devoted to \ndisarmament. When we take stock of the results \nachieved, it is frustrating to acknowledge the \nlack of substantial progress on a topic in which \na great many hopes had been placed, namely the \ncomprehensive program for disarmament. It is, \nhowever, important to mention that reaffirmation \nof the validity of the 1978 Final Document in \nresolution S-10/2, the commitment to abide by the \npriorities established in the disarmament \nnegotiations, and the adoption of two resolutions \non a World Disarmament Campaign and disarmament \nfellowships are concrete measures in the long and \nlaborious process of building up universal \nunderstanding. My country welcomes them with \nsatisfaction.\n262.\tWith regard to disarmament, Uruguay \nenthusiastically agrees that resources not spent \non armament should be reallocated to developing \ncountries. It also warmly supports as a form of \nprogress the idea of using these resources for \nthe development of nuclear-free zones which, \nalthough geographically limited, contribute to \nthe cause and objectives of disarmament. It is to \nbe hoped that this example, to which Latin \nAmerica made an outstanding contribution with the \nTreaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in \nLatin America (Treat of Tlatelolco), will be \nfollowed by other geographical areas, thus \nmultiplying the number of zones to be gradually \nfreed from the nuclear threat. However, the \ninalienable right of the developing countries to \naccess to nuclear technology for peaceful \npurposes should be strongly reaffirmed.\n263.\tWe should now like to offer some comments \nconcerning the many conflicts now under way. \nApart from constituting a threat to the basis of \nthe harmonious coexistence of nations, these \nconflicts ignore the essential fact that we are \nall part and parcel of the same civilization, \nwhich is based on shared ideals. This deeply \ntroubles the conscience of nations such as mine \nwhich regard any of their expectations as \nsecondary to the cause of peace and place all \ntheir endeavors at its service.\n264.\tDuring the conflict in the South Atlantic \nUruguay noted with concern and anguish how the \nuse of force\u00f3a procedure irreversibly proscribed \nby the Charter of the United Nations\u00f3emerged in \nthe American community of nations. Those \nresponsible chose to disregard the inexorable \ntide of history.\n265.\tOn various occasions and in various \nbodies my country has taken a position of \nsolidarity with Argentina. This position is based \non recognition of Argentina's right to claim \nsovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. Today \nUruguay confirms that recognition in keeping \nwith the best diplomatic traditions of my \ncountry, having been one of the first to put \nforward in this very body the unquestionable \nright of Argentina to the archipelago under \ndispute.\n266.\tUruguay also reaffirms its strong desire \nto help in the search for a negotiated solution \nto the conflict. We are ready to participate in \nefforts to attain this purpose. To that end my \nGovernment would like to restate its willingness \nto offer the necessary facilities to the \ninterested and concerned parties as well as to \nany possible mediators so that it may receive \nthem in the traditional Uruguayan environment of \npeace and security.\n267.\tWe have no doubt of the need for a \npeaceful solution to the crisis obtaining in the \nSouth Atlantic, but we should like to express our \nfirm desire that the solution not contravene the \ncourse of history or breed future confrontations.\n268.\tOnce again the situation in the Middle \nEast is causing particular concern to my \nGovernment, which, faithful to the juridical and \npolitical principles that underlie our \ninternational conduct, is particularly alive to \nthe anguish caused by the grave events that have \ncome to pass in Lebanon\n269 We appreciate the values that Lebanon \nrepresents. It is a nation that loves peace and \nculture. The close links of friendship and \nrespect between our countries prompt us to call \nfor the strictest respect for its sovereignty, \nterritorial integrity, unity and political \nindependence. In other words, we demand respect \nfor its right freely to choose its own future \nwithout foreign intervention. This obviously \nimplies the withdrawal from Lebanese territory \nof all occupying forces regardless of their \norigin.\n270.\tIn the judgment of my Government a strong \nand independent Lebanon constitutes an essential \nfactor for peace throughout the region. The \ninternational community must exert every effort \nto co-operate with the people and Government of \nLebanon in the attainment of these goals. It is \nlikewise imperative that the parties to the \nconflict adopt an unswerving policy to that end.\n271.\tUruguay will firmly support any action \ndesigned to bring about peace in the Middle East. \nThat is consistent with our position. It should \nbe brought about through agreements negotiated \namong the parties involved without violence and \nwith justice so as to guarantee all parties the \npossibility of living within safe and recognized \nboundaries in accordance with international law \nand the relevant resolutions of the Security \nCouncil.\n272.\tIn that spirit we are participating in \nthe Sinai multinational peace-keeping force, and \nwe are ready to co-operate in various actions to \nbe undertaken in order to consolidate and broaden \nthe process leading to a just and lasting peace \nin the region, regardless of extraneous interests \nand destabilizing factors.\n273.\tEqually it bears repeating here that the \nobjective of peace in the Middle East \npresupposes the existence and recognition of the \nState of Israel and its right and the right of \nother nations not to be attacked. Of course it is \nalso necessary for the international community \nto understand the legitimate aspirations of the \n[people of Palestine to have a territory in \nwhich to settle and establish a free and \nsovereign State.\n274.\tMy country's foreign policy has been \nbased on unswerving respect for fundamental \nprinciples such as non-interference in the \ndomestic jurisdiction of States and the right of \nall peoples to self-determination. The \napplication of these principles\u00f3which all have \nthe same source, the preservation of the right to \nexercise sovereignty\u00f3has been constantly and \nseriously hampered by the actions of countries \nand pressure groups which, because of their \nsupport for internal forces, internationalize \nconflicts that clearly fall within the domestic \njurisdiction of States. This has led to a \nsituation in which the inalienable right of \nStates to decide their own future without foreign \npressure or undue influence is disregarded. This \nis dramatically evident in regions such as \nCentral America, where, furthermore, violence and \nterrorism daily infringe the political, economic \nand social stability of countries, which is an \nessential element of the full development of the \npeoples of the region.\n275.\tWith regard to Afghanistan, the majority \nof the international community has expressed a \nstrong desire for detente, an end to military \nclashes so as to avoid greater suffering and \nmisery among the people, the immediate withdrawal \nof foreign troops, total respect for the rights \nof the civilian population and restoration of \neffective sovereign national authority. The \npersistence of the conflict creates a dangerous \nsource of friction that must be resolved as soon \nas possible.\n276.\tIn the context of these particular \nissues, I must state that my Government attaches \ngreat importance to the achievement of a peaceful \nindependent solution to the question of the \nunification of Korea through inter-Korean \ndialogue. That would help create conditions \nfavorable for mutual understanding and for the \ngeneral stability of the region.\n277.\tIt would be worth while to reactivate the \ngood offices of the Secretary-General in this \ncase for discus-sions between North and South \nKorea.\n278.\tIn all the international bodies in which \nit participates, Uruguay has always defended the \nprinciple of the self-determination of peoples. \nTherefore, we reaffirm once again the Namibian \npeople's right to independence and its right to \nchoose, in a climate of peace and free from undue \npressures and external influences, its own \npolitical constitution, within the framework \nguaranteed by the United Nations provisional \nadministration. Uruguay's stand on this issue is \nnot anomalous; it is consistent with, and a part \not', our unswerving commitment to peace and our \nemphatic rejection of any use of violence or \nterrorism.\n279.\tUruguay is a party to the International \nConvention on the Elimination of all Forms of \nRacial Discrimination We were the first State to \naccept the machinery set forth in that Convention \nfor receiving individual complaints and \ncommunications. That position is not one dictated \nby circumstances; it has been energetically and \nunswervingly held by my country's \nrepresentatives ever since the inception of the \nUnited Nations, ever since the Organization first \ngave impetus to the process of decolonization.\n280.\tAlthough the great majority of the \nnations of the international community have \nratified or acceded to that Convention, thus \nmaking it a universal instrument, discrimination \non the basis of color, race, national or ethnic \norigin, or social class remains a tragic fact \nwhich shocks our conscience and is an affront to \nthe spirit of progress of mankind.\n281.\tThe forced displacement of indigenous \npopulations; the marginal existence of national \nor ethnic minorities; the existence of \ndiscriminatory laws; the persistence of practices \nbased on notions of superiority or on racial \nhater: all these things convince us that the \nProgramme for the Decade for Action to Combat \nRacism and Racial Discrimination, which expires \nin December of next year, should be renewed and \nbroadened.\n282.\tUnfortunately the examples I have given \nare not the only manifestations of \ndiscrimination. It has also been manifested in \nthe most painful forms of religious intolerance, \nwhich, in various parts of the world, continue to \nprovoke a great deal of violence, persecution, \nand even genocide. In this connection, my country \nreaffirms its full support for the Declaration on \nthe Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and \nof Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, \nwhich the Assembly adopted fast year in \nresolution 36/55. At the same time we urge the \nprompt resumption of consideration of a draft \ninternational convention on this matter. That \ninstrument would serve as the basis, together \nwith other necessary efforts, to combat theories, \nsystems and institutions based on discriminatory \nprinciples which disregard the fundamental \nequality of the family of man.\n283.\tUruguay was also one of the first \ncountries to ratify the Convention on the \nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination \nagainst Women, which was adopted by the Assembly \nthree years ago in resolution 34/180, and we \nwelcome the fact that the Convention has come \ninto force. We express the hope that it will help \nto ensure the participation of women, on an equal \nfooting and at every level of society.\n284.\tIn that connection, we must mention a \nsystem that shocks the conscience of mankind and \nmakes a doctrine of iniquity:\tUruguay is \npleased to affirm with its usual conviction its \nradical opposition to that policy as well as to \nany other form of racism that openly and \nstubbornly contradicts the moral and \nphilosophical premises that form the basis of our \nmost deeply and dearly held cultural traditions.\n285.\tThe world crisis facing mankind is \nmanifested not only in the destruction caused by \nthose who ignore the single origin and nature of \nhuman-beings. It is also clear in the inability \nof the international community to put a stop to \nthe ongoing violence which has become an integral \npart of the political practice of nations, \nnations with a long tradition of institutional \nstability and those recently emancipated from \ncolonialism. That violence has resulted in \nconstant acts of terrorism, with their tragic \ntoll in murder, kidnapping and extortion; this \nseems to flourish in societies where democratic \ninstitutions prevail and where an attempt is made \nto preserve fundamental freedoms and individual \nrights. On the other hand, symptomatically, the \nphenomenon of terrorism does not appear in any \ncountry where totalitarianism exists with its \nsystematic violation of human rights.\n286.\tActs of terrorism are grave offences \nagainst common law; they violate the most \nfundamental principles of persona! and \ncollective security, whatever the political \npretexts invoked for their commission.\n287.\tUruguay is a party to all the conventions \nadopted within the United Nations system and the \nOrganization of American States with the aim of \npreventing and punishing acts of terrorism. It \nhas also participated very actively in the work \nof the Ad Hoc Committee on International \nTerrorism. Several of its proposals on the \nsubject have been approved by that Committee.\n288.\tNotwithstanding our recognition of the \nefforts that have been made, we must firmly state \nour dis-appointment at the fact that the \ninternational community has not adopted \npractical, specific and comprehensive measures \nto deal effectively with the grave and complex \nproblem of terrorism. Although the maintenance of \ninternal security is the responsibility of each \nindividual State, co-operation among countries is \nessential to prevent and punish, in a co-ordinate \nway, crimes with international implications.\n289.\tAlthough consideration of the underlying \ncauses of acts of terrorism and violence deserve \nattention, it must not lead us to delay \nindefinitely the search for remedies to deal with \nwhat is an undeniable fact: that acts of \nterrorism are invariably repeated, deserving the \nrepudiation of all civilized nations.\n290.\tThe efforts to prevent and punish crimes \ncommitted against diplomatic agents and other \npersons enjoying immunities established in \ninternational law are based on the adoption in \nNew York, m 1973, of the Convention on the \nPrevention and Punishment of Crimes against \nInternationally Protected Persons, including \nDiplomatic Agents. But we believe that a \nmultilateral machinery must be established to \ndeal with acts of terrorism affecting ordinary \npersons who do not enjoy the special protection \nof those immunities, but who are, none the less, \nentitled to international protection as human \nbeings.\n291.\tThis year we have witnessed a historic event of great importance: the \napproval by the great majority of the \ninternational community of the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea,- which \nestablishes a new and comprehensive legal order \napplicable to the seas and based on the \nrecognition of the sovereign rights and \njurisdiction of the littoral States in the waters \nadjacent to their coasts, in an exclusive \neconomic zone, and on the continental shelf, \nwith due regard for the jus communication and the \nrational exploitation of the resources of the sea.\n292.\tIt is also based on co-operation for the \ndevelopment of scientific research, the \nprotection and pres-ervation of the marine \nenvironment, the administration by an \ninternational authority of that zone, of the \nsea-bed and the ocean floor beyond national \njurisdiction with the necessary powers for \norganizing and controlling those activities \nrelated to the exploration and exploitation of \nresources and the establishment of a production \npolicy for that zone and a comprehensive system \nfor the settlement of disputes.\n293.\tHowever, we regret that some countries \nwere not able to overcome their difficulties with \nrespect to certain points and cast a favorable \nvote. Nevertheless, we trust and hope that they \nwill be able to reconsider their position for the \nbenefit of the common good. This would allow us \nto reach our objective, which would constitute an \nachievement of prime importance for the stability \nof international relations and the consolidation \nof world peace.\n294.\tWith regard to the environment, 1982 has \nbeen a year rich in important events, to which \nour country contributed decisively and with \nconviction. The session of a special character \nthat was convened by the Governing Council of \nUNEP last May in Nairobi commemorating the tenth \nanniversary of the United Nations Conference on \nthe Human Environment, which was held in 1972 in \nSweden, was followed by the tenth session of the \nGoverning Council. A signal achievement of these \ntwo meetings was the renewal of the \\\"spirit of \nStockholm\\\", the solemn ratification by more than \n100 nations of their commitment to preserve the \nenvironment, thus ensuring a vital framework for \nhumanity and the common heritage of future \ngenerations. The Nairobi and the Action Plan for \nthe Human Environment? that were adopted \nrepresent a new policy approach. It is a more \nsystematic and technical approach which includes \na considerable strengthening of international \naction on the subject and the implementation of \nthe resolutions adopted at the /M Meeting of \nSenior Government Officials Expert in \nEnvironmental Law, which my country was pleased \nto host in October and November 1981.\n295.\tThe Second United Nations Conference on \nthe Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space \nwas held last August at Vienna. The objective of \nthe Conference was to analyze at the world level \nthose problems concerning the cosmos at a time \nwhen we are approaching a quarter century of the \nspace age. Uruguay participated actively in the \nwork of that Conference, firmly convinced that it \nwas the appropriate time to take stock of the \npast and the present in order to make a realistic \nprojection for the future with a view to genuine \ninternational co-operation on this question.\n296.\tThe enormous increase in the field of \ncommunications and the interdependence of \npeoples that provide our civilization with a real \nsense of unity has made it imperative for the \nfield of communications to become an essential \nelement in the economic and social development of \nall countries.\n297.\tFaithful to this idea, we have adhered to \nthe proclamation by the General Assembly of the \nWorld Communications Year and we are ready within \nour means to take part in the Plan of Action to \nbe undertaken next year. To this end, we have \nalready established a National Committee in our \ncountry in which all the relevant ministries and \ngovernment services are represented.\n298.\tUruguay is a party to the international \nCovenants on Human rights, including the \nOptional Protocol to the international Covenant \non Civil and Political Rights. It has always \nfought in every forum against the death penalty. \nHence we were pleased to note the significant \nprogress made in the drafting of a second \noptional protocol to abolish capital punishment, \na vestige of history that denies the first right \nof man\u00f3the right to life.\n299.\tIn the same spirit, Uruguay has taken \npart in the work of the Commission on Human \nRights is preparing a convention against torture \nand other cruel, inhuman and degrading acts.\n300.\tWe have also reaffirmed our interest in \nany measure contributing to the strengthening and \nexpanding of the machinery of the Organization to \nimprove the effective enjoyment of individual \nrights and fundamental freedoms.\n301.\tWe also strongly support the planned \ninternational campaign against drug trafficking, \nwithin the context of the international Strategy \nfor Drug Abuse Control. This campaign is designed \nto achieve the eradication of another human \nscourge.\n302.\tThere are other initiatives aimed at \nconsolidating the objectives adopted by the \nAssembly when pro-claiming international years, \nsuch as the Year of the Child in 1979 and the \nYear of Disabled Persons in 1981. We support \nthese initiatives. Given my Government's prime \ninterest in these matters, we noted with \nsatisfaction the considerable progress made in \nthe drafting of a convention on the rights of the \nchild, as well as that concerning the \nimplementation of the World Programme of Action \nconcerning Disabled Persons, designed to prevent \nincapacitating disabilities and to promote \nrehabilitation and the full integration of the \nhandicapped into society.\n303.\tNone the less, it is our earnest hope \nthat these aims will not become obscured by \nrhetoric, as has unfortunately happened \nfrequently in the international community, which \nshows the international community's incapacity \nto go beyond the level of mere statements at a \ntime when crucial and ongoing challenges facing \nmankind call for strong substantive action.\n304.\tWe know that there are good intentions; \nwe know that there is no lack of theoretical \nconcepts; but the shaping of a more just and \nequitable world economy, as well as the \nestablishment of a legal order in a world fraught \nwith individualism and violence, is still mere \naspirations and nothing more.\n305.\tA question affecting the whole of mankind \non which we cannot remain silent is that of \nhunger and poverty which ruthlessly afflict more \nthan 900 million people in the world.\n306.\tUruguay, a developing country, cannot \naccept with criminal indifference the suffering \nof others as well as the passivity of the \nmachinery of a system that in practice violates \nthe basic tenets of the Organization.\n307.\tThese situations, which deny the very \nminimum of human solidarity, demand the priority \nattention of the Assembly in order to restructure \nthe links of interdependence and find solutions \ncapable of alleviating the scourge of hunger and \nits cause, destitution. We must have the \nnecessary political will to adopt appropriate \nmeasures allowing us to expect a certain measure \nof success in the struggle for better health and \neducation in order to improve the lot of mankind \nand enhance the sanctity of life.\n308.\tIn the field of health, it is fitting to \nmention specifically the fact that Uruguay has \nbegun a massive vigorous campaign to vaccinate \nall our population. This is the culmination of \nthe constant work of prophylaxis that has been an \nongoing concern of the health services of my \ncountry.\n309.\tIt is also worth noting that, in the Held \nof education, my Government is making every \neffort to implement an ambitious literacy program \nwhich will finally eliminate the already very low \nrate of illiteracy of no more than 5 per cent. \nThe first stage of this campaign has successfully \nbeen completed recently this year.\n310.\tIt is paradoxical to note that at this \ntime when we have witnessed the greatest \nachievements and progress and when science and \ntechnology borders on science fiction there still \nremain groups of people living in abject poverty. \nThis is a harsh reminder of our unavoidable \nresponsibility.\n311.\tThis question cannot be considered in \nisolation from the matter of trade, where we feel \nthe effects of tariff barriers in our efforts to \nattain efficient food and agricultural \nproduction. That is especially true in those \ndeveloping countries which have the good fortune \nof possessing great resources to contribute to \nthe feeding of the world but which, because of \nactions {taken by industrialized nations, must \nface trade and marketing problems, to which I \nshall refer later.\n312.\tConcerning the world economic situation, \nwe must express our. deep concern at the gradual \nand continuing deterioration within an acute \nprocess that seems to accelerate day by day. The \npersistence of recessionary and inflationary \nprocesses, the increase in unemployment, the \ninstability of exchange rates, imbalances in the \nbalance of payments of the industrialized \ncountries, the consequent irritating \nprotectionist reactions and, finally, why not \nsay it?\u00f3the indifference and the lack of the \npolitical will on the part of the industrialized \ncountries to face the demands imposed by the \noverwhelming world crisis\u00f3inexorably delay the \neconomic progress of the developing countries, \nwhich are the majority of those gathered in the \nAssembly.\n313.\tWithin an economic framework such as that \nwhich exists today, which is marked by an intense \nand ever greater interdependence among the \npeoples of the world, it is imperative to find \nsolutions based on a global economic approach, \nwhich makes it necessary to adopt a long-term \nglobal economic policy. This requires the optimum \nallocation of resources, which in turn signifies \nthe redistribution and relocation of industries \naccording to the competitive capacity of each \ncountry, the general  opening of economies in \norder to ensure an effective interplay of the \nlaws of competition, and the adoption of a \nstrategy capable of covering ail the developing \nareas without excluding key sectors.\n314.\tWithin the same line of reasoning and \nwith reference to international trade, we must \nnote the grave damage done to economic \ndevelopment in general and to food production and \nagricultural and industrial development in \nparticular by the discriminatory practices and \ntariff barriers applied in many parts of the \nworld, particularly by the developed countries.\n315.\tWe believe that the creation of an \neffective system of global security in the food \nsector must be accompanied by the parallel \ncreation of an international financing system \nwhich will not be prejudicial to the \nfood-producing developing countries. A new world \nfood order is a prerequisite for any \ninternational economic order.\n316.\tWithin the structural readjustment that \nwe are proposing, the problem of energy is also a \npriority that must be dealt with as a whole. A \nnew world energy order must assure access by all \nnon-oil- producing countries with a limited \neconomic potential to sources of supply at \nreasonable and predictable prices. We must also \nconsider the development and international \nfinancing of new and alternative sources of \nenergy. This must be a pre-condition of the \nestablishment of any new international economic \norder.\n317.\tThe developing countries are not resigned \nto this critical situation but insist upon a \nclear-cut position regarding the adoption of \ndecisions by international bodies and greater \nparticipation in the acceptance of such \ninstruments.\n318.\tWithin this context, we fully support the \naims of and the steps taken to ensure the \nrelaunching of global negotiations, on the \nunderstanding that what will be discussed \nconcerning this subject is of interest to \neveryone in the international community. These \nnegotiations must be carried out in conditions of \nabsolute equality.\n319. It is difficult to understand how in the \nworld of today we could reach agreements on \nenergy and financing, international trade, \nprotectionism and readjustment, raw materials and \nfood, and industrialization and technology \nwithout the representation of all those \ninterested and concerned. There must be an end to \nexclusion and selective participation and the \nquestion of the formal initiation of global \nnegotiations must as soon as possible be brought \nto the Assembly.\n320.\tIt is worth noting that the developing \ncountries have initiated a very significant \nattempt to establish a South-South dialogue \nthrough the implementation of a wide range of \nactivities involving economic cooperation. \nUruguay has participated and is participating \nwith enthusiasm and good faith in this process, \nwhich offers clear hope of widening the basis of \nthe economies of the developing countries and of \nbettering the standard of living if their \npeoples. That common effort is an appropriate and \nsuitable response to the needs and requirements \nof our time, always bearing in mind the \nsolidarity that must prevail among countries that \nare going through similar stages of development.\n321.\tWe firmly believe that development and \nsecurity are intimately linked concepts and it \ncould be said that there can be no integral \ndevelopment without the counterbalance of \ncollective economic security through a \nmultilateral juridical system that guarantees the \nfull implementation of the rules and principles \nof co-operation for development. This is also \napplicable to the area of defense, in the case \nof economic measures or actions aimed at \nthwarting the sovereign will of States, the \nmaintenance of the essential conditions of free \nand normal economic development and, in the last \nanalysis, the effective practical application of \ninternational economic justice.\n322.\tUruguay has voted in favor of the program \nbudget for the biennium 1982-1983. This is a \nbudget in which the concept of zero growth is \nused for the first time, after many years of \nsustained increases. The comprehensive nature of \nthe budget appropriations does not entail an \nincrease in the financial burden.\n323.\tThe support of my country for this policy \nof austerity is based upon the unavoidable need \nto rationalize the hyperactivity of the United \nNations and prevent the dispersal of effort. In \nthis context, we should like the process of \nidentifying and eliminating activities that are \noutdated, inefficient or of marginal usefulness \nto be intensified. This also applies to reduction \nof the very high percentage of costs absorbed by \nsalaries and staff contributions. That percentage \nbears no reasonable relationship to the funds \nappropriated by the Organization for programmes \nof work of a substantial nature in the economic, \nsocial and humanitarian fields.\n324.\tFinally, we should like to make reference \nto something of special importance\u00f3namely, the \nstrengthening of the role of the Organization and \nequitable representation of its members of the \nSecurity Council.\n325.\tAs I have already said, Uruguay fully \nunderstands and supports the purposes and \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, \nwhich are those that have always guided our \nforeign policy. Support for the objectives of \ninternational peace and security are, in the end, \nidentified with the aims of the civilization to \nwhich we all belong. We reaffirm our faith in the \npresent and permanent relevance of this \ncivilization and we express our steadfast support \nfor all measures aimed at overcoming the \nobstacles in the path of the development of \nharmonious relations and mutual respect based on \njustice among all the peoples of the world.\n326.\tWe place our greatest hope in the common \neffort of all those in the Organization and in \nthe firm and unswerving application of the means \nand instruments available to the Organization. \nIn this way we shall be able to make gradual but \nsteady progress in maintaining and consolidating \ninternational peace and security, developing \nco-operation among nations, promoting the rules \nof international law and improving relations \namong States as well as on questions of the \nprocedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes \nboth regionally and internationally.\n327.\tOnly two months ago, our President \nAlvarez, analyzing the Latin American scene \nduring a recent meeting of the Latin American \nIntegration Association, said:\n\\\"A world of super-Powers and mini-States, of \ngroups of countries with enormous imbalances in \ntheir relative development, is their share in the \nfruits of progress and in their capacity to \nnegotiate, calls for concerted action by those \ncountries that are more excluded than weak, in \norder that it may become more just.\n\\\"With its demographic influence, its common \ncultural tradition, its enormous and unexploited \nriches and its dedication to peace and law, Latin \nAmerica has a!! the conditions necessary to \nconstitute an influential area, not only in \neconomic alignment but in the political and \ncultural spheres as well, within an international \norder where im-balances of power give rise to \nvoluntary or involuntary situations of \ndomination.\n\\\"Setting aside questionable schemes used to group \ncountries according to their level of \ndevelopment or relative power, I should like to \nsee a Latin America that would be a totally new \nand independent force projected into the future \nas the continent of hope, of freedom and of \njustice, as the bridge and the link between the \nmore developed and the most backward areas of the \nworld.\\\"\n328.\tIn this same line of thinking, I have no \ndoubt that Uruguay will honor its commitment to \nAmerica and to the world for the harmonious \nconvergence of both currents, so that we can \ndevote all our efforts to serving the aim of \ncloser and more reciprocal constructive \nco-operation.\n329.\tWith regard to matters relating to the \nfunctions of the Security Council, the \ndistressing events that occurred during this year \nmake it more than ever necessary to amend the \nrule of unanimity that was established for the \nbenefit of the permanent members of the Security \nCouncil, a rule that tends to perpetuate an \nobvious situation of privilege the exercise of \nwhich paralyses the Council's mission for peace.\n330. It is also necessary to say that with the \npassing of time and in the light of many painful \nand enlightening experiences it will become \nnecessary to consider the possibility of giving \nthought to the most effective means of organizing \nthe system of voting in the Security Council, \nabove all in order to preserve intact its \nconstitutional power to act for the preservation \nof peace, which is the very reason it was brought \ninto being.\n33!. It is then fitting\u00f3and in this regard we \nfully agree with the proposal made by the \nSecretary- General\u00f3to hold a special meeting of \nthe Security Council. This would be a frank, \ndetermined action that would enable us \nrealistically to face those problems in the \nsolution of which we are all ineluctably engaged.\n332.\tIn conclusion, my Government is prepared \nto support any effort designed to strengthen the \nOrganization and to enable it fully to assume \nits responsibilities. Hence, we shall make a \nfirm contribution to creating a climate favorable \nto dialogue and trust, to civilized and fruitful \ncoexistence, starting along the road towards a \ncommunity of nations without tutors or pupils, a \ncommunity in which the legal equality of States \nwill be expressed through a policy of full \nrespect for the right of everyone freely to \nchoose his own future without interference or \naggression. This is the task we all face. It is \nan unavoidable and daily task that poses: a \ncrucial challenge, one we must face and one we \nmust overcome, guided by the same spirit of \nsolidarity and brotherhood, as we continue along \nthe path of peace and justice towards the new \nconditions the future holds in store for mankind.\n"

We welcome your presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly and should like to pledge the \ndetermined co-operation of the delegation of \nPanama. I am expressing the feelings of broad \nsectors of mankind when I say in addition that we \nwish to praise the outstanding job done by the \ndistinguished statesman of the third world, Mr. \nIsmat Kittani, as President of the thirty-sixth \nsession of the General Assembly. He is a tireless \npromoter of the ideals of the United Nations.\n\n3. Never before in the history of mankind has \nthere been so many sombre political and economic \nfactors as there are today which have created \nsuch an ominous world situation.\n\n4. Even for those who maintain that international \nlaw is an instrument of co-ordination and not \nconfrontation, the major problems on the \nAssembly's agenda place us at a crossroads where \nnegative factors in international life bring us \nto an impasse. There is the prospect of another \npossible conflagration with unpredictable results \nif common sense, wisdom and determination do not \nprevail in promoting the ideals. purposes and \nprinciple\u00a7 which inspired the authors of the San \nFrancisco Charter to draft a system of collective \nsecurity within the sphere of the United Nations \nfor dealing with the major conflicts of our era \nwhich threaten to bring about the \nself-destruction of mankind.\n\n5.\tIn  the  peaceful  settlement  of \ndisputes \u2022and  in cases of breaches of \ninternational peace, we find ourselves confronted \nwith an impossible  mission owing to the lack of \npolitical will on the part of the members of the \nSecurity Council, and in particular of tf1:.e \npermanent members. To undertake the task of \nmaking the United Nations system of security \neffective and imposing the coercive measures \ncontempl3ted in the Charter. This action is \nnecessary and urgent in situations as \nanachronistic and offensive to the  conscience of \nmankind as those occurring in Africa, the Middle \nEast, the eastern Mediterranean, Asia and Latin \nAmerica, especially in the Latin American South \nAtlantic.\n\n6. The large, medium-sized and small Powers in \nthis world assembly cannot do much in the way of \nmaking a positive contribution as regards events \nwhich have occurred in 1982. There has been no \nprogress in the global negotiations which created \nso much hope at one time as a means of realizing \nthe aspirations of mankind embodied in the \nInternational Development Strategy for the Third \nUnited Nations Development Decade.\n\n7. The second special session of the General \nAssembly devoted to disarmament resulted in' \nresounding failure in the face of the \nintensification of the arm  race between the \nsuper-Powers of the East and the West.\n\n8. As far as the non-aligned group is concerned, \nwe were saddened to see that as a result of the \nfratricidal war between Iraq and the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran it has not been possible to hold \nin Baghdad the Seventh Conference of Heads of \nState or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in \nwhich such hopes had been placed. The cycle had \nthen been broken which caused the non-aligned \ncountries, representing two thirds of mankind, to \nmeet at the level of heads of State or Government \nin order to bring here to the Assembly their \npositive, strong non-aligned influence projecting \nthe peace-loving doctrines of Nehru, Tito, \nNasser, Makarios, Pandaranaike and other great \napostles of peace.\n\n9. The injustices in the economic relations \nbetween the developed countries and the \ndeveloping countries have become more severe in \nthis ominous framework of inflation, public \nindebtedness, growing unemployment and economic \ncrisis afflicting the poor countries particularly.\n\n10. UNCTAD, which during the past two decades had \naroused the hopes of the developing countries, \nwas originally scheduled to hold a session in \nHavana in 1983, but, for well-known reasons, it \nwill not be held in that city. The preparations \nfor Belgrade have been adversely affected by \nnegative factors pertaining to economic relations \nand by the hard position lak n by the developed \ncountries in regard to the legitimate demands of \nthe countries of the third world.\n\n11. There are more and more reasons why the \nnon-aligned movement and the Group of77 should \nintensify their efforts to strengthen those \nmovements and bring about collective \nself-sufficiency so that the developing countries \nwill be able to establish, in an effective and \nsubstantial manner. real and significant economic \nco-operation. To the extent that political and \neconomic difficulties increase because of the \nresurgence of  colonialism and hegemonism on the \npart of the major Powers, the developing \ncountries must strengthen co-operation among \nthemselves both politically and economically.\n\n12.\tThe colonial aggression that Latin \nAmerica had to endure in the spring of 1982 has \nreaffirmed the fraternal ties of unity, \ncooperation and solidarity among the countries of \nthe region.\n\n13.\tOne positive event which should be \nstressed is the eighth meeting of the Latin \nAmerican Council, the supreme body of the Latin \nAmerican Economic System, which took place at \nCaracas at tile ministerial level in August 1982. \nApart from support for Panama in the \nimplementation of the Canal Treaties, which we \nhave noted with gratitude, the most outstanding\nachievement of the meeting was the adoption of \nthe programme of action for the implementation of \nthe measures provided for the Panama Declaration \non economic relations between Latin America and \nthe United States, adopted on 1 December 1981 at \nthe high-level consultative meeting of the Latin \nAmerican Economic System, which took place on the \ndate in the capital of my country. The Latin \nAmerican Council, in its Decision 114, decided to \nendorse the Panama Declaration contained in \nDecision 87, which, as was stated by our Foreign \nMinistry:\n\n\u201c\u2026after. stressing the inequality in the terrors \nof trade between the United States and Latin \nAmerica as a factor that obstructs economic, \nfinancial and social development in the Latin \nAmerican region, establishes a programme of \ncollective co-ordinated action and a working plan \nto rectify the asymmetries in the aforementioned \ntrade. The document sets forth a common strategy \nfor Latin America in these negotiations, based on \nthe criteria and actions which the plan defines. \nThe program the plan encompass all aspects of \nUnited States-Latin American economic relations \nand offer a series of recommendations which the \ncountries of the region should take into account \nin their economic relations, both individual and \ncollective, with the United States.\\\"\n\nIn the programme and in the plan to which I have \nreferred, there are set forth in a positive \nmanner fundamental principles to place, within \nthe framework of justice, equity, good \nunderstanding and co-operation, the relations \nwhich have existed between this group of \ncountries and the United States.\n\n14. Panama is situated in the extreme south of \nthe Central American isthmus and practically in \nthe middle of the so-called Caribbean basin. Its \nhistory and its geography have bound us \nindissolubly to Central America, to the \nBolivarian countries and to the Antilles. Our \ngeographical function, as a bridge between the \noceans, has linked us with practically all the \nmarkets and countries of the world. Ever since \nthe present Panama Canal was built it has, in \naddition, brought about special relations with \nthe United States.\n\n15. At the same time Panama  is one of the \ncountries with the most stable economic, social \nand political regimes in an area beset by complex \nsocial and international problems with dangerous \nimplications. My country has the unavoidable \nresponsibility of playing a role as conciliator. \nas part of the political\n\n\nefforts to overcome the crisis which might very \nweb turn the region into a disaster zone.\n\n\n16. In defining that role, I should like to \nrecall that the stability that exists in my \ncountry is due to the fact that in the past \ndecade we have made consider-able progress \ntowards peaceful revolution. Structural reforms \nhave been carried out which have brought about a \nsocial and territorial redistribution of wealth \nthat is much more just and balanced, and mixed \nand co-operative state sectors have been created \nwith a productive economy, conceived of from the \nsocial point of view. Social security, education, \nhealth and communications have been considerably \nenhanced. A system of representation and popular \nparticipation in the political decision-making \nprocess has been created. National integration \nhas been improved.\n\n17.\tIn contrast with many other countries of \nthe region, these economic, social and cultural \nchanges n:move the main causes of injustice, \nrepression and social discontent which are at the \nroot of the political disputes that have \ndi5rupted many countries in the area or have \npolarized their relations.\n\n18.\tMy country cannot be indifferent to the \nclimate of violence and the warlike acts that \nhave occurred in the region--either for ethical, \npolitical or security reasons. Internal tension, \nto which should be added outside interference of \none kind or another, in support\n\nof one side or another in conflicts, has already \ncreated a structure of militarization of forces \nand alliances which could at any moment lead to a \nwide-spread conflict. This would have \nuncontrollable consequences and could cause \nbloodshed and inevitably jeopardize the entire \ninternational situation and destroy the region.\n\n19. Hence, for the past decade, Panama has been \npursuing a regional policy that is most \ndefinitely aimed at trying to bring about a \npeaceful settlement of the problems of the area. \nWe want to avoid a spiral of internal \nconfrontations continuing in the region-this has \nalready taken on genocidal proportions and has \nled to warlike acts between sister countries. We \nhave found ourselves in considerable agreement \nwith Mexico and Venezuela as we have sought \nsolutions by means of multilateral political \nnegotiations among all the parties in dispute \nwithin our area.\n\n20. For this reason, too, we have promoted the \nprinciple, the right and the duty of maintaining \ngood relations with all countries of the region \nwithout exception, though they may have political \nsystems different from our own. Peacefully we \nhave defended the principle, the right and the \nduty of preserving the neutrality of Panama both \nas regards the forces in dispute in the area and \nas regards the super-Powers. We are aware that \nongoing dialogue and under-standing with all the \nother countries and forces, aimed at detente and \nharmonious coexistence, are the only way to \nrestore security in the area and preserve \ninternational security and the security of our \nown country.\n\n21. We want Panama to be a forum and an 'active \ncommunicator or intermediary in the bringing \nabout of agreements aimed at detente, and we do \nnot want to be one of the parties to a \nconfrontation. For this reason, and in the best \ndiplomatic traditions of my country, we have \nrefused to be part of any blocs or pacts that \nwould exclude other countries, although in \ncertain cases we have no doubts about their good \nintentions.\n\n22. Stability in Panama is also largely due to \nthe fact that during the past decade complex \nnegotiations have been held with the United \nStates regarding the status of the Panama Canal. \nThe TreatiesI that arose from those negotiations \nmet a large number of the national demands of \nPanama. In this respect Latin American solidarity \nwas of decisive assistance, as was the solidarity \nof the third world countries and others, which \nencourage us in our anti-colonialist policies. \nAlthough we did not obtain everything to which we \nwere entitled, great progress was made and the \nnew Canal Treaties establish much mere balanced \nrelations between Panama and the United States.\n\n23.\tMy country's rights over the Panama Canal \nare beyond any doubt, since it is a waterway fed \nby Panamanian fresh water and we have certain \nrights that spring from the permanent sovereignty \nof my country over its natural wealth and \nresources.\n\n24.\tIt is understandable and almost inevitable that \nan international pact should be designed to \nharmonize the interests of two sovereign \ncountries that may well have common though not \nidentical interests. There may, of course, be \ndifferences of interpretation between the parties \nwhen it is a question of implementation. That is \nwhat has happened in this case. In so far as the \nstipulations of the Treaty are concerned,\\\" Law \n96-70 of the United States Congress, which \nauthorizes the American executive to implanted \nthe Treaty, gave rise to differences of opinion \nbetween the two Governments. My Government has \nmade that known to the international community.\n\n25. Last Friday, I October, Ricardo de la \nEspriella, President of Panama, and Ronald \nReagan, President of the United States, had a \nworking meeting in Washington, a meeting of the \ngreatest importance, five years after the signing \nof the Torrijos-Carter Treaties and precisely on \nthe third anniversary of the entry into force of \nthose instruments.\n\n26. The purpose of the meeting was to consider \nrelations between two friendly countries, to \npromote complete compliance with the Canal \nTreaties of 1977, to bring about more just \neconomic relations between our peoples and to \nmake effective the common purpose of creating the \nconditions of harmony, justice and understanding \nindispensable to the efficient and optimal \nfunctioning of the Panama Canal.\n\n27. One of the merits of the visit of President \nde la Espriella was that it brought about in the \nnews media and United States public opinion an \nunderstanding of the reservations that the \nPanamanian Government had had regarding certain \nmeasures and actions by officials of the United \nStates that were not in harmony with the \nTreaties. It is our hope that a just solution to \nthe outstanding problems will be found, in \nparticular as regards the elimination of the \ndiscriminatory salary scale known as the Panama \nArea Wage Base, which as a result of actions by \nthe Panamanian leader, might be replaced by a \ngeneral salary scale that is not discriminatory \nif, as we hope, the United States co-operates \nwith Panama in the achievement of that result at \nthe next meeting of the Board of Directors of the \nPanama Car.al Commission, which will take place \nin November in Washington.\n\n28.\tWe should like to add that perhaps the \nmost serious concern  f my Government in this \narea has to do with a proper understanding of the \nspirit and purpose of the Treaty concerning the \nPermanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama \nCanal.\n\n29.\tNeutrality for the inter-oceanic waterway \nis a goal that my country has never been willing \nto abandon. Its security cannot be based on \nmilitary considerations. We want the Canal at all \ntimes-in times of peace and in times of war-to be \na path of concord open to all the countries and \nnations of the world. We have never wanted the \nCanal to serve warlike purposes. The Canal needs \nsecurity in a world like ours, in which, \nnotwithstanding the existence of the United \nNations, war 'and the use of force remain means \nof settling differences or international \ndisputes. We nevertheless consider that the \nsecurity of the Canal is based on relations of \ngoodwill, friendship and co-operation among \nnations.\n\n30. Defence of the Canal must be within the \nCanal, from the Canal and for the Canal. We \ncannot accept the possible use of armed forces \nstationed there or the weapons stocked there for \nmissions or warlike actions outside the borders \nof Panama. We do not want our land or the Canal \nbuilt in Panamanian territory to be used for \nactions that undermine the neutrality that Panama \nhas declared to the entire world. We do not want \nto be exposed as a military target to the \nuncertainties or risks of war that are so alien \nto us in terms of both motives and aims.\n\n31.\tSuch are the purposes of the neutrality \nTreaty, and we have therefore called upon all the \nnations of the world to adhere to the Protocol \nattached to that Treaty. We should like to renew \nthat call on this occasion.\n\n32.\tAccording to the Charter, the United \nNations and regional bodies are mechanisms for \ncollective security and indispensable for the \nmaintenance of international peace. It is only \nlogical that in order for them to be effective \nthis international body must encompass, without \nexception, all countries that have a right to \nmembership.\n\n33.\tThe results of the last world \nconflagration and the cold war for many years \nmade it impossible to obtain the goal of \nuniversality for the United Nations. As examples \nwe need only cite the opposition to the admission \nof the representatives of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China for 23 years and the resistance to \nadmission to membership of Spain, which was \nfinally admitted together with 15 other countries \nin E'55. In this latter case it was clear that \nthe establishment of diplomatic relations and the \nexchange of ambassadors and ministers with a \nGovernment does not imply any judgement regarding \nthe national policies of that government.\n34. Votes that are cast in the General Assembly \nfor reasons of State do not always reflect the \nwill of the peoples. In the cases that I have \nmentioned, and in many others, votes are often \ncast for reasons that arise from certain \ncircumstances, and at times only later do \njustice, reason, common sense and good-will \nprevail internationally and in the \ndecision-making process of Governments, which \nthen express their goals in international forums.\n\n35.\tThe same things happen regionally; \nsometimes the smooth functioning of a region is \nimpeded when important sectors do not participate \nin the system.\n\n36.\tOver the years Panama has maintained that \nthere is a need to restructure the bodies and \nnorms of the inter-American system. In our \nopinion, if the Organization of American States \n[VAS] is to be effective  it must be a pluralist, \nall-encompassing forum open to dialogue dealing \nwith more just economic relations in the American \ncontinent, like the North-South dialogue, with \nthe participation of all the nations of the \nwestern hemisphere.\n\n\n37.\tViewed thus the OAS will require as an \nessential distinction should be drawn between \nmeetings which element the contribution of the \nUnited States, and the incorporation of Canada \nwould be desirable. The incorporation or the \nreincorporation of those States of Central \nAmerica and the Caribbean which are not now part \nof and have been excluded from the organization \nwould indeed be indispensable.\n\n38. In the inter-American system, situations \narise which deserve serious and the dispassionate \nconsideration, bearing in mind the interests of \nthe States of the region. Frequently the question \nis asked: can the GAS function effectively \nwithout the United States? The answer is, \nobviously, that it cannot, on the understanding \nthat the United States, like other member States, \naccepts the obligations set forth in the charter \nof the OAS and in the other agreements of the \ninter-American system and provided that it \ncomplies with those agreements.\n\n39.\tThere is no doubt that within a regional \nsystem properly understood, it would be \nappropriate to ask if the OAS, which is \nexperiencing a profound crisis, would  be  able \nto  function  effectively  without  the \nparticipation of Belize, Canada, Cuba, Guyana and \nPuerto Rico. .\n\n40. The primary task of this new institutional \nconception of the inter-American system would be, \nin the political arena, examination of the \nCentral American question and of the Caribbean, \nnormalization of relations between Cuba and the \nUnited States, eradication of colonial enclaves \nin Latin America, the status of the Malvinas \nIslands and of the Guantanamo naval base and \nterritorial disputes between the countries of the \narea, as well as exploration of the possibility \nthat in this year, which marks the bicentenary of \nthe birth of the Liberator Sim6n Bolivar, a \nfraternal solution might be found by which \nBolivia might attain its legitimate aspiration to \nthe sovereign outlet to the sea of its \nforefathers.\n\n41. In the economic sphere, the inter-American \nforum' must undertake the task of considering the \neconomic relations between Latin America and the \nUnited States of America, to place them in adjust \nand equitable con-text, serving as a forum for \nnegotiations within the frameworkof North-South \nrelations.\n\n42. The problems besetting the region are \nnumerous in the area of trade, commodities, \nfinancing, trans-national corporations, foreign \ninvestment and the might  be  convened  by  the \nOAS  within  the  inter-American system and \nmeetings of a consultative or other nature at the \npurely Latin American Ievel.\n\n43. The idea of holding in Caracas 0\\\" 24 July \n1983, or an appropriate date, a Latin American \n\u2018Summit conference to commemorate the second \ncentenary of the birth of the Liberator has been \nlinked to the holding of a conference of Foreign \nMinisters of Latin America which might take place \nin Panama City, headquarters of the Amphictyonic \nCongress of 1826, which was convened by Bolivar \non the eve of the Battle of Ayacucho in 1824. At \nthe same time, initiatives have been taken by the \nGovernments of Uruguay and Colombia regarding the \nholding of an inter-American meeting of heads of \nState or Government of the region.\n\n44. In order to dispel any confusion on this \nmatter, a distinction should be drawn between \nmeetings which might be convened by the OAS \nwithin the inter-American system and meetings of \na consultative or  other nature at the purely \nLatin American Level. The former, on \ninter-American meetings, are held within the \nframework of the OAS, a regional organization \nwhich the United States and the Latin American \ncountries belong as of right, with the exception \nof Belize, Cuba and Guyana, which are not members \nof the regional body.\n45. The twelfth general assembly of the OAS, \nwhich will be attended by the foreign ministers \nof the United States and member States, will be \nheld in a few weeks, in November of this year, in \nWashington. It would not be logical to consider \nthe possibility of an inter-American meeting of \nForeign Ministers in December, as the November \nmeeting will offer an opportunity to consider at \nthat level matters of common interest to the \ncountries of the area.\n\n46.\tA different matter would be a \nconsultative meeting or a meeting to deal with \nmatters contained in a previously agreed agenda, \nattended by all Latin American countries, \nincluding Belize, Cuba and Guyana, which are \nexcluded from the OAS.\n\n47.\tThe Secretary-General of the OAS, Mr. \nAlejandro Orfila, effectively helped to clarify \nthe situation when, on 14 September, he went on \nrecord in favour of the proposal for a \nhemispheric meeting of heads of State becau.se, \nin his opinion., it is necessary to bring \ninter-American relations up to date. In his \nstatement, Mr. Orfila visualized an \ninter-American summit meeting within the \nframework of the OAS and, of course, without the \nparticipation of Belize, Cuba and Guyana. \nHowever, Mr. Ortila went on to say that it is \ntruly essential for Latin America to reach \nagreement on its own points of view, before those \nviews are brought up at the hemispheric level. \nWhat Mr. Orfila meant was that this was a Latin \nAmerican meeting, by Latin Americans and for \nLatin Americans. This cannot be interpreted in \nany other way.\n\n48. In his statement, Mr. Orfila considers the \nfeasibility of a exclusively Latin American \nmeeting at which, logically, Behze, Cuba and \nGuyana, which are Latin American countries, would \nalso participate.\n\n49. The Latin American meeting, which is \ndifferent from the inter-American meeting, would \nthen be the framework within which, without \nhostility or antagonism towards any country, \ngreat or  small,  an effort would be made to \nreach agreement on positions and strategies in \nthe political and economic spheres to defend\u2022 and \n,promote common interests of Latin American, \ncountries.\n\n50. The fact that the Inter-American Treaty of \nReciprocal Assistance,2 that is, the Treaty of \nRio de Janeiro of 1947, was ineffective during \nthe South Atlantic crisis has naturally caused \nconcern in all sectors of the Latin American \nregion concerning the future of collective \nsecurity for the countries of the hemisphere. \nThis is unquestionably a matter deserving of the \nclosest attention on the part of the Latin \nAmerican countries. It should be the subject of \nconsultations between them, in an effort\u2019s to \ndefine onceand for all tile fate of this regional \nagreement. A Latin American consultation on that \nsubject should precede a hemispheric meeting \nwhich, without doubt, must also, include in its \nagenda the status of the Rio Treaty.\n\n51. Lack of timely action would, in our opinion, \nmean that consideration might once again be given \nat title Seventh Conference of Heads of State or \nCommitment of Non-Aligners Countries, to be held \nb New Delhi in 1983, to the proposal to denounce \nthe Rio Treaty put forward by the host country at \nthe Sixth Conference held in Havana in 1979. That \nproposal was not discussed then because of \nPanama's firm opposition to that action. which it \nconsidered inopportune at that time, but it has \nbeen given a new dimension by the Malvinas crisis.\n\n52. International relations are now subject to a \ncaustic cold war dialogue. Local confrontations \nhave spread to other spheres and there are \nlegitimate fears that the lack of understanding \nand communication which make possible peaceful \nintercourse among nations in conflict can \ngradually lead to a third world war.\n\n53.\tLatin America has its own cultural \ncharacteristics and common interests of an \neconomic and social nature. as well as historical \nroots which bind us to the nations of Central \nAmerica. South America. Mexico and the Caribbean \nas a regional group with well-defined qualities \nof its own.\n\n54.\tThe community of Latin American nations \nattaches the highest importance to ail its \nrelations with the United States and is seeking \nto develop them in a harmonious. friendly and \ncordial way in a spirit of reciprocal \nco-operation and of respect for its territorial \nintegrity, sovereignty and independence and for \nthe principle of the sovereign equality of \nStates. When these relations have an adverse \neffect and when there is tension or friction \nbetween Latin American countries or between us \nand the United States as is the case with Cuba \nand Nicaragua, there is natural concern. 'as \nexpressed b) the President 'Of Mexico, Jose L6pez \nPortillo, and the President of Venezuela, Luis \nHerrem Campins, and a desire to seek the path of \nconciliation, understanding and peace.\n\n55. The regional bodies bringing together \nexclusively Latin American countries. which \nhistorically were brought together by Bolivar, \nwho wished to guide them towards unity and \nintegration are today a political reality which \nis part of the system of international relations.\n\n56.\tThe most representative Latin American \nbodies are part of' the group of Latin American \nStates within the' United Nations system and the \nLatin American Economic System, which is not only \na mechanism for Latin American consultation and \nco-ordination but also a part of its strategy of \nconducting economic relations under the wise, \nskilful and admirable leader-ship of the Latin \nAmerican statesman, Carlos Alzamora, to whom \nPanama expresses the appreciation and gratitude \nof the Latin American countries for what he has \ndone to promote the genuine interests of Latin \nAmerica.\n\n57.\tIn general, the regional organizations \nconstitute a typical example of modern \ninternational law. This is not just a phenomenon \npertaining to our region. Just as there is within \nthe United Nations the regional Latin American \ngroup, there are also, as independent and \nseparate entities, the group of Western European \nand other States, which includes the United \nStates, the African group, the Asian group and \nthe .Eastern European group.\n\n58. The importance of the regional groups of the \nthird world of manifested by the Group of 771 \nmade up primarily of the States of the Asian, \nAfrican and Latin American groups. Its work \naffects the North-South dialogue has to do with \nthe International Development Strategy for the \nThird United Nations Development Decade, the \n1980s, the process of global negotiations' and \nthe adoption of criteria for programmes of \naction. As regards the sessions of UNCTAD, the \nsixth session will take place in Belgrade in \n1983; each and Every regional group of the world \nincluding the Latin, American group, through the \nLatin American Economic System holds coordination \nmeetings prior to UNCTAD sessions, which lead to \na plenary meeting of the Group of 77, where \nspokesmen from. Latin America. Africa and Asia \nset forth criteria on each subject which will be \nput forward at the UNCTAD session.\n\n59. This explains why there are purely Latin \nAmerican bodies with the right to participate on \nan equal footing as the Asian and African groups, \nand the group of Western Europe and other States, \nwhich includes the United States, the Eastern. \nEuropean group and other organizations made up of \ncountries with common interests, such as the \nOrganization\n\n\n60. Latin America rightly wished to strengthen \nits capacity to negotiate within and outside this \nhemi-sphere using purely Latin American \nmachinery. Latin America wants Latin American \nsolutions to Latin American problems, from a \nLatin American point of view, implementing \nprinciples of friendship and\\\" co-operation with \nan countries of the world in accordance with the \nCharter of the United Nations.\n\n61. The designs of the former colonial empires do \nnot change in their anachronistic attempts to \ncontrol the maritime routes to nearby countries \nin the ocean spaces to which they attribute \nstrategic values. Both here in the Assembly and \n.in the Security Council, and in other \ninternational forums, we have said that \ncolonialism is reprehensible and must be \neliminated: regardless of the State or States \npractising It. We maintain that colonialism is an \nevil wherever it arises. In the inter-American \nsystem colonialism has no legitimacy. The concern \nexpressed in t 940 by the Foreign Ministers of \nthe States of the Americas as regards Nazi \noccupation of European countries with possessions \nin the Americas must, of course, apply to the \neradication of colonial situations which still \nendure in this hemisphere, as Bolivar stated when \nthe Panama Congress was convened.\n\n62. In accordance with its anti-colonialist \nposition, which is one of the constant features \nof Panama's foreign policy, we support \nArgentina's sovereign claim to the Malvinas \nIslands. Panama considers that from the historic \nand legal point of view these islands and the \nadjacent waters are part of the territory of the \nRepublic of Argentina. This was the position in \nlaw and in fact until, 150 years ago, Great \nBritain, pursuing its imperialist designs, which \nhad resulted in the domination of oceans and \ncontinents, set foot on those islands against the \nwill of Argentina.\n\n63. The British colonial presence there today is \ninconsistent with the principles of the Charter, \ncon-firmed and developed in so many General \nAssembly decisions to constitute a consistent \nbody of legal norms condemning colonialism and \nexpansionism, which must be respected by all \nMembers of the Organization.\n\n64. Faithful to these decisions, my Government, \ntogether with other Latin American countries, \nsup-ported the request by 20 Foreign Ministers to \ninclude this item in the agenda of this session \nof the General Assembly, in the hope that by \nmeans of negotiations under the aegis of the \nUnited Nations and on the basis of the principles \nand norms of inter-national law a final solution \nmight be found to this problem, which disrupted \ninternational peace and security at the cost of \nso many human lives.\n\n65. This final solution must be based on the \nreturn to Argentine sovereignty of the Malvinas \nIslands and their dependencies, the early \nwithdrawal of British forces and the adoption of \na statute guaranteeing the orderly transfer from \nBritish administration to Argentine \nadministration, safeguarding the interests of the \nemployees of the English Falkland Islands Company \nand the British nationals who are residents of \nthe islands.\n\n66. The case of the Maivinas Islands, which with \nits adjacent seas is de jure under the \nsovereignty of the Republic of Argentina, may be \nseen as similar to that of Namibia, which is so \ndear to the nations of southern Africa. South \nAmerica has invoked security needs to prolong its \narbitrary occupation of Namibia, saying that the \nCape route, as a means of access to the South \nAtlantic and European and North American ports, \nis essential to the survival of western \ncivilization. .\n\n67. In both cases the colonial Powers have raised \nobstacles to the settlement of nationals of the \ncountries under colonial oppression and almost \nisolated the occupied territories to keep out \nanything which might go against the colonial \nstructure, manipulating the demographic \ncomposition of the territories subjected to their \ncolonial domination for their own evil purposes.\n\n\n68.\tThis is the Pretoria regime's pretext for \nits claim that the territory, waters and air \nspace of Walvis Bay are an integral part of the \nterritory of South Africa.\n\n69.\tThis pretension of South  Africa's sordid \ncolonialism which has so frequently been rejected \nby the General Assembly, is the same as  that \ninvoked by the United Kingdom of Great Britain \nand Northern Ireland to keep the Malvinas Islands \noccupied by force. It is argued in England that \noccupation of the Malvinas Islands by a State \nmember of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n[NATO] is essential for the control of the \nmaritime routes of the South Atlantic and for the \ntransport of oil from the Persian Gulf to Western \nEurope and the eastern coast of the United \nStates. That is also related to the British \ndesire to maintain a strategic position in regard \nto its designs over Antarctica.\n\n70. With an effrontery equal to that of South \nAfrica in its claims to control Walvis Bay, \nEngland wishes to take from Argentina by force \nthe Malvinas Islands, an integral part of its \nsovereignty. Africa and Latin America, because of \ntheir anti-colonialist positions, and the rest of \nthe third world, will not allow the British and \nthe South Africans to continue in their brazen \nattitude and there will soon be independence for \nNamibia, including Walvis Bay as an integral part \nof its territory, just as the Malvinas Islands \nand their dependencies will be returned to \nArgentine sovereignty.\n\n71.\tIn the colonial war of the South \nAtlantic, Argentina's national honour remained \nuntarnished. In that southern sea there was a \nbrave display of heroism and courage by the \nArgentine armed forces, who shed their blood in \ndefence of the integrity of their home-land, \nwhich is also part of the Latin American \ncontinent, and they will make further claims and \nshow further courage for the homelands of \nSarmiento and San Martin.\n\n72.\tIn the face of the colonial anachronism, \nLatin America will join hands to bring about the \nrestoration of the Malvinas Islands to Argentina. \nLatin American nationalism must achieve that \nwithout delay. Impelled by the ideals and hopes \nof the Argentine people, we hope together for \nvictory. We stand together with them and with the \npresent and future generations of the heroic \nArgentine nation.\n\n73.\tOn 12 October, according to a \ncommunication we have received, there will be a \ncommemoration around Nelson's Column entitled\\\" A \nvictory march\\\", an attempt  o convey an \nimperialist picture of England. Why have they \nchosen 12 October? Why Columbus Day? On that day \n500 million people celebrate their Hispanic \ncultural heritage. Why should they be insulted in \nthis way? We should like to lodge a protest on \nbehalf of the many human beings who are offended \nby this action, which has no justification in \nmodern times.\n\n74. The Declaration on the Granting of \nIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples \nadopted by the General Assembly in resolution \n1514 (XV) of 1960 solemnly proclaimed the need to \nbring to a speedy and unconditional end to \ncolonialism in all its forms and manifestations, \nan end to all practices of segregation and \ndiscrimination. That charter on decolonization is \npart of the spirit  of our era and it is aimed at \nthe complete elimination of colonialism in the \nworld and at overcoming the opposition of the \ncolonial Powers to implementation of one of the \nbasic, supreme principles of the San Francisco \nCharter.\n\n75.\tThere still exist in Africa, Latin \nAmerica, Asia and Europe colonial enclaves which \ndo not belong in today's world. Sources of \nconflict are the British enclaves of Gibraltar, \nHong Kong and the Malvinas Islands, which are an \noffence to the countries to which they belong and \nmust be returned to the sovereignty of Spain, the \nPeople's Republic of China and the Republic of \nArgentina respectively.\n\n76.\tLet me take this opportunity to explain \nwhy the Government of China can reject the threat \nmade by the British Prime Minister and the \nallegation that the treaties by which the Manchu \nDynasty granted England the colony of Hong Kong \nare valid under international law. Beijing is \nright in saying that Hong Kong is part of the \nterritory of China. The three treaties going back \nto the nineteenth century on which Great Britain \nrests its case are contrary to inter-national law \nbecause they were unequal treaties; they were \nnever accepted by the people of China; \nconsequently Beijing is entitled to recover the \nentire colony when the conditions are ripe.\n\n77.\tThese unequal treaties are no longer \nrelevant. They are like the unequal treaties \nwhich were imposed on Spain in 1713 regarding \nGibraltar and on Panama in 1903 regarding the \ninter-ocean waterway. Hong Kong, the Malvinas \nIslands and Gibraltar are unjustifiable \nanachronisms which are in violation of the \nCharter of the United Nations. They threaten \ninter-national peace and security. These enclaves \nmust be returned to the People's Republic of \nChina, the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of \nSpain, as a sign of respect for the sovereignty \nof those countries and in the interests of \njustice, in harmony with the spirit of our time.\n\n78. I should like to refer to another subject. \nThe situation in the Central American isthmus is \na source of constant concern to my Government. \nThe civil war in El Salvador, the violence and \nthe terror which have gripped the countries in \nthe area, endangering the lives of the people, \nare rooted in the exploitation of human effort, \nthe economic and soci91 inequality which has \nexisted and the violations of human rights and \ndemocratic principles which have prevailed for \ndecades in the Latin American region. The present \narmed confrontation is an extreme and critical \nstage in the age-old fruitless struggle of \nthousands of men and women of all ages to secure \nproper living conditions within an economic, \nsocial and political system which each Central \nAmerican country has chosen for itself without \nany foreign pressure or interference.\n\n79. As a result of civil war in Central America, \npeaceful people have been displaced and \nbelligerants have been moved across frontiers, \nand this has given rise to clashes between the \narmed forces of the countries involved in those \nmovements. Everything is ripe for a conflagration \nwhich could involve the entire region and be a \npretext for open intervention by outside Powers \nand an international conflict of enormous \nproportions and complexity. That is why\n\nwe are alarmed at the increasingly crude language \nof the authorities of some countries in the area \nwho speak glibly of the possibility of war \nbetween certain countries and refuse to foresee \nthe terrible hardship which would ensue for \nthousands of women, children and old people in \nthe area.\n\n80. All those who can view with equanimity this \nsinister possibility, which many in the area \nwould have us do, recognize that this announced \nwar would be a disaster for all contending \nparties equally. They would emerge from it \nimpoverished and indebted and in a worse \nposition, without ever having solved the problems \nthey have to cope with today.\n\n81. It is the added misfortune of these heroic \npeoples that the rivalry of the super-Powers, \nwhich are unilaterally trying to seize world \nsupremacy, has encroached on the Central American \nregion, where they are threatening to make into \npawns in their struggles people who seek only \ntheir identity, their independence, their \nfreedom, justice and bread.\n\n82.\tIn that connection we can say confidently \nthat Central American problems cannot be solved \nwithout a dialogue. Panama has always been \nprepared to promote a dialogue, with the \nparticipation of all interested parties-in \nparticular, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, \nHonduras and Nicaragua.\n\n83.\tSimilar thoughts inspired President de la \nEspriella of Panama when lie said that there was \nan urgent need to promote machinery for regional \nand world reconciliation and to engage in \nnegotiations about the internal and- external \nconflicts of the Latin American region. The \nPresident of Panama also said that he was much in \nsympathy with, and supported, the initiative \ntaken by the Presidents of Mexico and Venezuela, \nMr. Lopez Portillo and Mr. Herrera Campins, to \nresolve these disputes by negotiation. These \nleaders sent letters to Commander Daniel Ortega \nSaavedra, Co-ordinator of the Governing Junta of \nNicaragua, to Roberto Suazo C6rdova, President of \nHonduras, and to Ronald Reagan, President of the \nUnited States of America, in an effort to promote \ndetente and peace in Central America.\n\n84. Panama's position on international affairs \nwas clearly set out in the speech by Pesident de \nla Espriella to the diplomatic corps in Panama on \n16 September last, when he said:\n\n\\\"Consistent with the policies of Omar Torrijos, \nwe have reaffirmed the Bolivarian, Latin America \n, neutral and non-aligned states of Panama and \nour recognition of the duties arising from that \nstatus. We confirm our country's tradition of \ndeveloping friendly relations with all the \npeoples of the world, on a basis of equality and \nmutual respect, and our constant readiness to \npromote detente and the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes, especially in the geographical area to \nwhich we belong.\n\n\\\"We support the principle of the sovereign \nequality of States... We continue to support the \ncollective purposes of the Latin American \ncountries and the countries of the third world in \ntheir efforts to bring about a new international \neconomic order and a new international political \norder, based on the sovereignty of States and the \npermanent sovereignty of all States over their \nnatural resources.\n\n\\\"This encompasses-Panama believes-the right to \nself-determination, which means that every people \nshould be able to choose whatever political \nsystem it considers to be in accord with its \ninterests and wishes, without outside \ninterference. For this reason, we shall continue \nto support the efforts of the peoples to fight \ncolonialism and defend their independence and \nintegrity, rejecting all forms of interference \nand threats against other countries, especially \nthose of our area.\n\n\\\"Consistent with our Latin American commitment \nand our Bolivarian traditions, we reiterate \nPanama's willingness\\\" as the historic site of the \nAmphictyonic congress, to be the setting for the \npeaceful settlement of the problems of our area.\\\"\n\n85. The independence of Puerto Rice) is one task \nof the liberating revolution of the Latin \nAmerican countries which has been long delayed. \nBolivar and other leaders of the prolonged \nstruggle started by the rebel-lions for \nemancipation knew that their great enterprise in \nseeking independence would end only when all the \npeoples of the Antilles had rid themselves of the \nEuropean colonizers.\n\n86. At the Congress of Panama there was \ndiscussion of the need for concerted action to \nbring about the independence of Cuba and Puerto \nRico  which were subject to Spanish domination. \nThat desire is not new in Panama or the other \ncountries of Latin America. In 1903 Mr. Belisario \nPorras, three times President of the Republic and \none of the greatest statesmen of this century \nsaid that the United States was opposed to \nSpanish domination of Cuba and Puerto Rico \nbecause it wished to exercise hegemony.\n\n87.\tIt was eight decades after the battle of \nAyacucho before Cuba was liberated, but Puerto \nRico emerged from Spanish domination only to fall \nunder the domination of the United States. The \npeople of Puerto Rico must be allowed to decide \non their own the question of their nationality \nand the character and structure of their \npolitical organization, free from all pressure \nand without any interference from any quarter.\n\n88.\tThe question of Puerto Rico has historic \nroots. The fact that it has not been included in \nthe agenda for this session does not mean that \nthere is a solution and does not prove that the \nproblem does not exist. It would be naive to \nbelieve that the votes cast here for reasons of \nState reflect public opinion in Latin America.. \nThe debate in the General Committee and in the \nGeneral Assembly should warn the administering \nPower that the vote of confidence many countries \nhave given it is not forever.\n\n89  It is' clear that there must be a dialogue \nfor peace and that an effort must be made to \nachieve a permanent, positive solution protecting \nthe Political and cultural personality of Puerto \nRico. Latin Americans have a special affection \nfor the people of Puerto Rico and recognize their \nright to self-determination and their option to \nbe part of the Latin American community, on an \nequal footing with all the other countries of the \nwestern hemisphere.\n\n90. The question of Lebanon is directly \\\"elated \nto the question of Palestine, which is the \ncentral element in the Middle East conflict with \nevery passing day it is more and more clear that \nit is not possible to bring about a just, \ncomplete and lasting peace in the area without \nthe Palestinian people exercising its \n.inalienable national rights.\n\n91. In its resolution 36/226 A of 1981, the \nGeneral Assembly, inter alia, strongly condemned \nIsraeli aggression against Lebanon and the \ncontinuous bombardment and destruction of its \ncities and villages, and all acts that constitute \na violation of its sovereignty, independence and \nterritorial integrity and the security of its \npeople.\n\n92. Panama rejects and condemns terrorism, \nwhether Moslem, Christian or Judaic whatever the \nsource-but we also reject and condemn State \nterrorism, which is among the crimes that are the \nmost execrable and offensive to the conscience of \nmankind. The massacre in the refugee camps in \nBeirut two weeks ago has horrified the universal \nconscience. Men, women, children and old people \nwere killed in cold blood in numbers that \namounted to genocide.\n\n93.\tPresident Reagan, who has conceived a \nplan for a Palestinian homeland on the West Bank, \nwas informed by the French Government of the \nchilling and terrible facts, which strike the \nhearer to the  soul. In his column on 22 \nSeptember, James Reston reported that when the \nFrench troops arrived at the Palestinian refugee \ncamps they were allowed to destroy the mines \nwhich had been buried, but the Israeli troops did \nnot allow them to protect the refugee camps. The \ncamps were entered by the IsraeIis' \\\"Christian\\\" \nallies, who killed the occupants while the \nIsraeli troops stood on guard outside.\n\n94.\tThe massacres of Shatila and Sabra, for \nwhich world public (\\pinion holds the Christian \nPhalangists and the State of Israel responsible, \nwill be an eternal blot on the names of those who \ncommitted this crime against humanity. The \ncondemnation of the world will hang over their \nheads, as a curse of dishonour and infamy, which \nwill spread through time and space to hang over \nthe heads of their descendants for successive \ngenerations. Those responsible for this atrocious \ncrime cannot associate themselves with the \nethical values of Christian or Jewish culture, \nwhich have so much to do with the civilization o \nour times.\n\n95.\tThe torture and suffering of the \nlegendary Maccabees and the tragic martyrdom of \nthe innocent children of Bethlehem murdered by \nthe order of Herod have remained in the memory of \nmankind in the same way as will the enormity of \nthe massacres at Shatila and Sabra. The Beirut \nmartyrs will not have  died in vain if their \nsacrifice means the birth of the Palestinian \nnation.\n\n96. It may be appropriate to remind the Assembly \nthat, in connection with the Conference of \nMinisters\u2022 for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned \nCountries which took place in Belgrade in 197 , \non behalf of the Torrijos Government I defined \ncertain fundamental principles of foreign policy \nof the Republic of Panama laid down in successive \nnon-aligned conferences. These are equally valid \nin 1982, and I will repeat what said.\n\n97.\tThe Government of Panama maintains \\\"as a \nfundamental tenet of its foreign policy its \nrejection of the presence\\\" or foreign military \nforces in any country of the world. The \nPanamanitm Government does not justify or excuse \nany action by East or West against the right to \nself-determination and the principles of \nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of other \nStates and respect for the sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of all States.\n\n98. Panama recognizes that it has an historic \nmission to promote the scientific and \ntechnological development of the countries of its \narea, in order to bring about their economic and \nsocial liberation and to accelerate their \nintegration. Panama promotes the idea of Latin \nAmerican nationalism, based on solidarity and \nrecognition of a pluralist reality. Panama \nreaffirms its view that we should strengthen that \nLatin American nationalism, which is particularly \nnecessary so that we may deal with our problems, \nfree from foreign interference, promote the \ninterests of Latin America and prevent anything \nentering into Latin American policies which could \nundermine the personality of our peoples and the \nsovereignty of our States.\n\n99. Panama devotes priority attention to its \nrelations with its sister Republics of Colombia \nand Costa Rica, which are neighbouring countries. \nIt recognizes the need to co-ordinate efforts to \npromote development and the balance and \nharmonious exploitation of our border areas.\n\n100.\tPanama respects human rights above and \nbeyond any political or ideological \nconsiderations.\n\n101.\tPanama, as a signatory of the Declaration \nof Ayacucho,3 respects the Treaty of Tlatelolc04 \nand co-operates in giving effect to the \nprohibition of nuclear weapons in Latin America \nand the limitation of conventional weapons in \nLatin American countries, although that does not \naffect our capacity to protect our territorial \nintegrity and defend ourselves from colonialist \naggression from this continent or other'\\\" \ncontinents.\n\n102.\tLatin America is anxiously watching the \ncontroversy regarding possession of the \nterritories of the Esequibo. All the countries of \nthe Latin American region are confident that this \ndispute will be settled by negotiation and will \nbe resolved rationally, with no room for ill \nfeeling between neighbouring countries, on the \nbasis of understanding and a sense of justice.\n\n103.\tPanama welcomes the efforts to normalize \nrelations between the United States and Cuba. We \nrestate our position in support of the \ntermination of the embargo against Cuba and our \nsolidarity with that country in its demand for \nthe return of the Guantanamo naval base.\n\n104.\tAs a result of the good offices of the \ncountries of the area, we hope that relations of \nGrenada and Nicaragua with the United States will \nbe improved on the basis of understanding, \nco-operation and good-neighbourliness.\n\n105.\tWith regard to the Middle East, Panama \nbelieves that existing conflicts should be \nsettled peacefully within the framework of the \nUnited Nations. A just  and lusting settlement, \nin the opinion of Panama, must include the \nwithdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab \nterritories and respect for the inalienable \nrights of the Palestinian people and the right of \nIsrael and all the peoples and countries of the \narea to live in peace within recognized and \nsecure boundaries.\n\n106. Panama recognizes the inalienable right of \nthe Palestinian people to self-determination and \nto its own independent State As regards \nJerusalem, Panama, like the Vatican,\u2022 does not \nrecognize the annexation of Jerusalem and \ninsists on  the  internationalization of the Holy \nPlaces. Similarly, we do not recognize the \nannexation of the' Golan Heights, which belong to \nSyria, or the annexation of any other occupied \nArab territory.\n\n107.\tPanama will continue to call for the \nwithdrawal of the Turkish army from Cyprus and \nfor respect for the territorial integrity, \nindependence and non-aligned status of the \nisland. We demand. compliance with the relevant \nUnited Nations resolutions and, in  particular, \nGeneral Assembly resolution 3212  and Security \nCouncil resolution 365.\n\n108.\tPanama deplores the continuance of the \nabsurd war between Iran and Iraq, which must be \nbrought to an end by means of a just and \nhonourable political settlement which restores \npeace between those two sister countries in \naccordance with the principles If  the Charter of \nthe United Nations.\n\n109. We hope that the great Korean nation will \ninitiate a constructive dialogue between the: \ncom-munities of the North and the South, leading \nto the peaceful brotherly reunification of that \ngreat political entity in the Korean peninsula.\n\n110. Tension must be reduced in South-East Asia \nand comprehensive politica1 solutions must be \nfound through negotiations, with the active \nparticipation of all the parties concerned, in \nthe hope that peace will quickly be restored to \nthe area.\n\nIll. As regards southern Africa, Panama is \nopposed to racism, racial discrimination, \napartheid, and the unjust oppression by the \nPretoria regime of the great African national \nmajority. We support unreservedly the aspirations \nof the people of Namibia and Azania and reaffirm \nour solidarity with the front-line countries and \nthe national liberation movements of South \nAfrica, in particular the South West Africa \nPeople's Organization [SWAPO] and the African \nNational Congress [ANC].\n\n112.\tPanama, which was the first Latin \nAmerican country to recognize the existence of \nthe Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic, supports \nthe right to self-determination of the people of \nWestern Sahara.\n\n113.\tPanama was also one of the first \ncountries to speak out against Soviet \nintervention in Afghanistan; calling for \ncompliance with the resolutions of the General \nAssembly demanding the withdrawal of foreign \ntroops and respect for the territorial integrity \nindependence and non-aligned status of \nAfghanistan.\n\n114.\tAs a maritime country using the Indian \nOcean and belonging to the third world, Panama \nmaintains its enthusiastic support for the \nDeclaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of \nPeace, and condemns the rivalry of the \nsuper-Powers of the East and the West in that \narea, since it constitutes a threat and a source\\\" \nof anxiety to the coastal States of the Indian \nOcean.\n\n\n115. The ideas expressed by the Secretary-General \nin his report on the work of the Organization \n[A/3711] are very thought-provoking. Although we \ndo not wish to make any comparisons with the \nreports of his predecessors, in our opinion this \nis a document notable for its clarity and \nsincerity in describing the  5tuation of the \nUnited Nations and indicating the omissions, \nevasions and insufficiencies in the fulfilment of \nits responsibilities of under the Charter. The \nSecretary-General affirms that these shortcomings \nhave undermined the confidence of the world \npublic and makes positive suggestions as to the \naction that should be taken to regain that lost \nconfidence.\n\n116. In 1978, when I participated in the general \ndebate at the tenth special session, the first \nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted \nto disarmament, I said:\n\n\\\"The United Nations, which came into being at the \nend of the Second World War as a system of \nco-operation and not of confrontation, has not \nbeen able to operate successfully the machinery \nprovided in the San Francisco Charter for the \nmaintenance of international peace and security. \nProof of that is to be found in the tragic \nconflicts between the Arab nation and the states \nof Israel in the Near East, the Calvary of the \nPalestinian nations with its inalienable rights \ntrampled under foot, the infamous aggression and \nuntold suffering to which the people of Lebanon \nhave been subjected, the tragic occupation of the \nRepublic of Cyprus by the illegitimate action of \nthe Turkish army, the repugnant subjugation of \nNamibia by the racist regime of Pretoria, the \nabominable imposition of apartheid at the expense \nof the vast native majority in South Africa... \nthe blood!' conflict among sister nations on the \nAfrican constraint 2-.nd the reprehensible \ncolonialist cells which still persist as hateful \nblots on the Latin American map:'\n\n117.   Without  trying  to  unravel  the  many \npolitical puzzles of the United Nations, Panama, \nduring the six years of the past decade that it \nwas a member of the Security Council, tried to \nfree that United Nations organ from its inertia, \nso that it could carry out its sacred duties \nunder the Charter.\n\n118. when we began our work of' found ourselves \nin a situation similar to that just before the \nSecond World War, which came about as a result of \nthe failure of the League of Nations, the cause \nof which was the negative attitude of the major \nPowers as manifested in their reluctance to take \nthe enforcement action provided for in the \nCovenant, thus robbing the League of its \neffectiveness, bringing it into discredit, and \nfinally to extinction.\n\n119. Hesitancy in dealing with critical \nsituations that require preventive or corrective \naction to deal with conflicts, tensions and \nconfrontations among Member States; failure to \ncomply with General Assembly and Security Council \ndecisions by large, medium-sized and small Member \nStates; the persistence of the super-Powers in \nmanufacturing and stockpiling nuclear weapons and \nconventional weapons with indiscriminate effects, \nincluding chemical and bacteriological weapons; \nthe indifference of those countries to decisions \nadopted at special sessions of the General \nAssembly on disarmament and many other cases of a \nsimilar nature today, as in the past, have led to \ndismay and frustration on the part of the peoples \nof the entire world.\n\n120. Year after year, we the representatives of \nthe small and medium-sized countries which make \nup the vast majority of the Organization, have \nbeen repeating our denunciations, confirming our \naspirations, casting votes in support of \nsolutions which are not only just but also \nobviously viable; but nothing has changed in the \nconduct of the Organization. There have been the \nsame flouting of the law, the same deplorable \nconditions for hundreds of millions of human \nbeings who are asking only for bread  justice and \npeace. We have brought these things to the \nAssembly's attention and debated them, but they \nhave resulted only in thousands of pages now \nfiled away in the archives of this body.\n\n121. All that is the background to the views put \nbefore us by the Secretary-General, which sound \nin our ears like a shout of alarm, a cry of \nanguish. We must repeat the truth, again and \nagain, even though it is painful  to realize that \nwhatever we say is a waste of breath. \nNevertheless, it Is  impossible to resign \nourselves to the deterioration of the \nOrganization. This can be halted; it can be \nremedied. In carrying out my official duties I \nfrequently travel throughout tile countries of \nthe third world; that is why I am certain that \nthe lack of confidence of peoples in the United \nNations is not a repudiation of the Organization. \nThey wish [0 revitalize the Organization, and \nenable it to solve the vital problems of mankind, \nutilizing the plentiful resources available.\n\n122. The small and m': Hum-sized countries will \nnot renounce their ideals and aspirations, forged \nin the fires of the Second World War and \nexpressed in the Charter of the United Nations. \nThere will be no slackening of efforts for a just \nand lasting peace, no cessation of the call for \ncollective and personal security. They have not \nresigned themselves to oppression, nor have they \nlost their faith in right. .\n\n123.\tThey are confident that their firmness \nwill lead to the removal of the obstacles that \nhave impeded action by the United Nations and \nobstructed the realization of the goals of the \nCharter-\u2022the assurance of peace, the \nconsolidation of security and the establishment \nof a new international economic order.\n\n124.\tThe small and medium-sized countries lack \nthe physical means to build a more erective \nsystem of collective security. But what we can do \nis speak out in international forums, as we are \ndoing in the General Assembly. We can speak in \nunison and call on the major Powers to stop their \nrivalry and confrontation and to place their \nresources and potential at the service of the \nUnited Nations, and implement the \nSecretary-General's proposal to hold a meeting of \nthe Security Council at the highest possible \nlevel to discuss in depth the burning problems of \nthe inter-national community.\n\n125. We must enhance the dignity of the United \nNations by returning to the spirit which \nprevailed at its founding and devoting itself to \nthe tasks jointly undertaken, in a moment of \nenlightenment, by the Powers which had suffered \nthe material and human devastations of the \nNazi..Fascist aggression .which caused the Second \nWorld War.\n\n\n126. With a sufficient amount of imagination and \ndetermination we can join forces to keep the \nsacred promise to mankind made in the San \nFrancisco ChaI1er-to save present and succeeding \ngenerations from the scourge of war and \nself-destruction.\n\n127.\tThere is still time to heed the appeal of \nthe non-aligned at New Delhi to turn a page in \nthe history of mankind, a page revealing an \nawareness of our common destiny and the \nsolidarity of all peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "May I, on behalf of the delegation of the \nDemocratic Republic of Afghanistan, congratulate \nMr. Hollai of Hungary on his election to the high \noffice of the presidency of the thirty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. His election to \nthat important post is not only precognition of \nhis professional and human qualities, but also a \nwell-deserved tribute to his country, with which \nwe enjoy the best of relations. These relations \nwere further consolidated by the signing 10 days \nago of the Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation \nbetween our two countries during the visit of \nBabrak Karmal, General Secretary of the Central \nCommittee of the People's Democratic Party of \nAfghanistan and President of the Revolutionary \nCouncil, to his fraternal country. I hope that \nunder his presidency the current session of the \nGeneral Assembly will make a notable contribution \nto the cause of strengthening international peace \nand security. I should like to assure him that \nthe Afghan delegation will fully co-operate with \nhim and help him in every way to discharge his \nduties. May I also express my appreciation to his \npredecessor, the prominent Iraqi statesman and \ndiplomat, Mr. Kittani, for his skilful conduct of \nthe deliberations of the last few sessions of the \nGeneral Assembly. I should further like to pay a \ntribute to the Secretary-General for his tireless \nefforts to make the United Nations more efficient \nin maintaining peace and security.\nAt the thirty-sixth session, during the general \ndebate, we spoke at length about two trends in \nthe world arena. Since then the confrontation of \nthese two trends has acquired a still more acute \nand tense character.\nNumerous facts in international affairs clearly \ntestify to a growth in the tendencies of the \nforeign policy of the imperialist forces, the \nUnited States of America in the first place. The \nimperialists are engaged in all-round \npsychological and material preparations for war, \ncarrying on the arms race on an unprecedented \nscale and building up their military strength \nboth qualitatively and quantitatively. Their \ninterference in the affairs of sovereign States \nis being expanded, special forces are being set \nup for armed intervention, their military \npresence in various parts of the world is being \nincreased old bases are being modernized and new \nones are being established. One of the negative \nconsequences of that policy is the fact that the \nnon-aligned developing countries are becoming \nmore and more involved in the ruinous arms race, \nwhich undermines their struggle to achieve \neconomic independence and social progress. The \nimperialist policy of the use of force has \ndragged the whole world closer to the edge of \nnuclear catastrophe. That is an alarming reality \nof the present- day situation, which poses a \nserious threat to the very existence of all \ncountries and peoples, large or small, developed \nor developing. This threat urgently demands the \ncollective efforts of all peoples of the entire \nglobe to put an end to the arms race, \nparticularly the nuclear one, to prevent the \nimperialist, adventurist and militarist circles \nfrom carrying on their mad drive towards a new \nwar, to improve the international climate, to \nfind solutions to the crucial problems at the \nnegotiation table and to secure peace all over \nthe world. The concern of millions of people over \nthe destiny of mankind was vividly expressed in \nthe statements by most of the delegations during \nthe second special session of the General \nAssembly on disarmament and in the mass \nmanifestations throughout the world.\nTo avert the threat of an outbreak of a \nthermonuclear war is the main and primary task of \nthe United Nations, which was created for the \nvery purpose of preserving peace and preventing \nthe destruction of man's civilization. In a world \nwhere attempts are made in some quarters to \nconvince the public of the admissibility of \n\\\"limited\\\" or \\\"protracted\\\" nuclear war, will the \nOrganization be able to prevent the world from \nslipping into such a war? We hold the strong \nopinion that it is within our ability to avert \nthe danger of a nuclear holocaust. The policies \nand the tireless efforts of the peace-loving \nforces, represented by socialist States and the \nnon-aligned countries, are aimed at that very \npurpose. It is only natural that we have given \nour support to all initiatives and proposals for \ncurbing the arms race and, first of all, the \nprevention of the use or threat of use of nuclear \nweapons. We regard the unilateral declaration by \nthe Soviet Union on non-first-use of nuclear \nweapons as a gigantic step towards reducing the \ndanger of the outbreak of a nuclear \nconfrontation. If complemented by similar \ndeclarations by the other nuclear-weapon States, \nthe possibility of such an outbreak would be \nreduced to naught.\nWe also warmly welcome the two new proposals by \nthe Soviet Union which were advanced in the \nstatement of the Foreign Minister of the Soviet \nUnion, Mr. Andrei Gromyko, aimed at warding off \nthe threat of nuclear war and achieving the \ncessation of the nuclear arms race.\nWe earnestly hope that the thirty-seventh session \nof the General Assembly will give a strong \nimpetus to the negotiations on the most urgent \nconcrete problems\u2014halting the arms race and \nachieving real disarmament\u2014and thus help to \nconsolidate international detente.\nCountries in different parts of the world are \nraising more and more insistently the question of \nadopting and carrying out regional measures aimed \nat creating more harmonious relations among the \ncountries of their regions and promoting \nstability, which in turn would strengthen \ninternational peace and security.\nIn this connection I should like to say that the \narmed incursions with the use of sophisticated \nweaponry into the Democratic Republic of \nAfghanistan still continue unabated, which \naggravates the situation around Afghanistan.\nThe hypocritical and demagogic approach of the \nimperialist countries, particularly the United \nStates, the Chinese hegemonists and other \nreactionary quarters is yet another obstacle to \nthe steady and natural improvement of the \nsituation in the region of South-West Asia. In \naddition to the previous United States \nAdministration's covert and overt actions, the \nUnited States Senate took another provocative \ndecision in recent days on the supply of arms to \nthe bands of terrorists attacking Afghanistan \nfrom abroad. This is an of clear and outright \ninterference in the internal affairs of a State \nMember of the United Nations and is a blatant \nviolation of international law and all norms \ngoverning international relations. It is \ntantamount to instigating terrorism against a \nsmall country and exporting terrorism into that \ncountry. It must be firmly condemned, and we \nbelieve that the international community will \ntake note of it.\nWe emphatically state to the aforementioned \nquarters and to all others who still cherish the \nillusion of turning back the wheels of history in \nAfghanistan that our heroic nation has determined \nits destiny once and for all and is resolved to \nconstruct an independent, democratic and just \nsystem. With or without the obstructionist \ndesigns adopted by the enemies of our revolution, \nthe glorious march towards those goals will \ncontinue unhindered.\nAs for the present-day situation inside my \ncountry, the corrective actions and principled \nline of the Revolutionary Government have yielded \nthe fruits which were expected. A greater degree \nof stability and normalcy has made possible the \nspeedy recovery of economic and social \nactivities. As a result of the recent call made \nby Babrak Karmal, large numbers of Afghan \nnationals who had gone to the neighbouring \ncountries for various reasons have returned to \ntheir homes. Had certain quarters not created \nobstacles, the number of returnees would have \nbeen much higher. More and more sectors of the \nsociety are how rallying behind their Government \nand taking an active part in the defence of the \nrevolution and its achievements.\nThe mercenaries and hirelings of imperialism and \ninternational reactionary forces are suffering \nsevere blows; most of their hideouts have been \nwiped out and their arms captured. Needless to \nsay, banditry and terrorism would have long since \nvanished were they not supported, financed and \nequipped from external quarters. These \ninterventions and incursions constitute the cause \nof instability and differences in our region \nwhich can and must be tackled by peaceful means, \nthrough negotiations. Time has demonstrated the \nvalidity of our approach to the problem and has \nclearly shown that our initiatives put forward on \n15 May 1980 and 24 August 1981 are flexible and \nrealistic enough to be a sound basis for a \ncomprehensive settlement of the situation and \nnormalization of relations among neighbouring \ncountries.\nWe shall continuously and sincerely pursue our \nefforts for the resolution of the situation \naround Afghanistan. As was stated by Babrak \nKarmal at the ninth plenum of the Central \nCommittee of the People's Democratic Party of \nAfghanistan:\n\\\"We have declared many a time and once again \nproclaim that it is our desire to make our \nrelations with our eastern and western \nneighbours, that is, Pakistan and Iran, normal \nand even friendly on the basis of good will and \nreason through constructive talks. ... the Geneva \ntalks showed that foundations existed for the \nachievement of agreements acceptable to both \nsides on all of the issues concerning an \nall-sided critical solution and that only good \nwill and understanding were needed to solve the \nexisting differences. We are ready, as far as the \nDemocratic Republic of Afghanistan is concerned, \nto meet them half-way in order to improve \nconditions in the region and to normalize our \nrelations with them.\\\"\nWe express our appreciation to the Secretary- \nGeneral and his personal representative, Mr. \nDiego Cordovez, for their efforts to bring the \nparties concerned closer in order to achieve a \nnegotiated settlement, and assure them of our \ncontinued co-operation.\nThe question of strengthening security and easing \ntension in the Indian Ocean has acquired great \nurgency in the past few years. The right of the \nnations of that region to peaceful life and their \ndesire to concentrate their efforts on their \neconomic and social development have been \njeopardized by the increased military activity of \nthe United States, by its constant blocking of \nthe efforts to convene the Conference on the \nIndian Ocean. We have invariably supported the \ndesire of the coastal States of the Indian Ocean \nto turn that region into a zone of peace where \nall foreign military bases would be dismantled \nand no one would threaten the security, \nindependence and sovereignty of the States in the \nregion. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan \nresolutely supports the holding of the Conference \nin Colombo on 9 May 1983 as proposed by \nnon-aligned countries that are members of the \n/If? Committee on the Indian Ocean We reaffirm \nour support for the proposal by the President of \nthe Democratic Republic of Madagascar, Mr. \nRatsiraka, for the convening of a summit \nconference of hinterland and littoral States of \nthe Indian Ocean region, to be held in \nAntananarivo.\nIn the context of regional security my delegation \nspeaks out in favour of the initiative of the \nMongolian People's Republic on the signing of a \nconvention on mutual non-aggression and non-use \nof force in the Asian and Pacific region. The \ndecision and proposals of the Conference of \nForeign Ministers of the three Indo-Chinese \ncountries held in Ho Chi Minh City on 6 and 7 \nJuly 1982 constitutes a concrete and realistic \nprogramme for the normalization of the situation \nin that region of South-east Asia. These steps, \nif accepted, will undoubtedly contribute to a \nsubstantial improvement in the political climate \nin the region in favour of peace, stability and \nco-operation between the Indo-Chinese countries \nand the countries members of the Association of \nSouth-east Asian Nations.\nThe recent setting up of the so-called Coalition \nGovernment is but a scheme of China in collusion \nwith United States imperialism and other \nreactionary forces to cover up the abominable \nface of the genocidal Pol Pot clique and to be \nused as an instrument against the rebirth of the \nKampuchean people and for interference in the \ninternal affairs of the People's Republic of \nKampuchea, to create tension and to haltthe \ntendency towards reconciliation and co-operation \nin the region.\nThe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan also \nsupports the proposals of the Democratic People's \nRepublic of Korea for the reunification of Korea \nin a peaceful and democratic way as a \nconstructive step towards peace and stability in \nthe region.\nAfter over three decades of wars and \nconfrontations the situation in the Middle East \nhas acquired still further explosive dimensions \ndue to the aggressive, expansionist and racist \nnature of the Zionist entity supported by United \nStates imperialism. During the recent Israeli \naggression against Lebanon the world was outraged \nto witness how far Washington's support of Tel \nAviv's aggressive plans spreads and how \ndisproportionately great are the ambitions of the \nIsraeli leaders, who are ready to use every means \navailable to achieve their delirious \nover-ambitious aims regarding the creation of \nGreater Israel.\nThe hideous Israeli crimes of genocide and \nmassacre of the Palestinian civilians in the \nrefugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in west Beirut \nwill forever remain unsurpassed in the history of \nmankind. But the Israeli aggressors and their \nAmerican patrons must remember that the popular \nmovement based on the legitimate aspirations of \nthe Palestinians cannot be suppressed by brute \nforce. The Palestinian people will never be \ncrushed by an aggressor. Their just cause will \neventually triumph. It is evident that the \naggressor would not be able to behave so brazenly \nif its partner in strategic co-operation were not \nthe biggest imperialist Power. That is why the \nUnited States shares responsibility for the \nhorrendous crimes that have been and are being \ncommitted in Lebanon.\nIsrael's designs to win an easy victory by \nforcing the Palestinians to surrender proved to \nbe miscalculations. The aggressors met with \nvaliant resistance from the Palestinians, the \npatriotic Lebanese forces and the Syrian armed \nforces, whose courage has won them admiration.\nThe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, as a \nstaunch supporter of the Palestinian and Arab \ncause, once again expresses its all-round \nsolidarity with our Palestinian brothers in their \nheroic struggle. We demand the immediate and \ncomplete withdrawal of Israeli troops from all \noccupied Arab territories and restoration of the \ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people, \nincluding their right to establish their national \nState in Palestine.\nAfghanistan believes that it is now imperative to \nstart a collective search for an all-embracing, \njust and realistic settlement in the Middle East \nwithin the framework of a specially convened \ninternational conference as set out in the \nBrezhnev six-point plan. We have also noted with \ninterest the relevant outcome of the Twelfth Arab \nSummit Conference, held at Fez.\nAt its thirty-seventh session the General \nAssembly is expected to bring pressure to bear on \nthe Zionists and their imperialist supporters, \nparticularly United States imperialism, with a \nview to ensuring full compliance with the \nrepeated calls of the international community.\nSince the beginning of the unfortunate armed \nconflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of \nIran, the continuation of which will seriously \naffect not only those two neighbouring Islamic \ncountries but the entire region, we have \nsincerely hoped that the Governments of Iran and \nIraq will desist from actions that may cause the \nsituation to worsen still further and that they \nwill find peaceful ways and means of resolving \ntheir disputes.\nWe express our appreciation for the work done by \nthe Secretary-General and his mission in this \nregard. We urge him to continue his efforts aimed \nat finding a just and peaceful solution to this \ntragic conflict.\nAs in the past, Afghanistan expresses its full \nsupport for the independence, sovereignty, \nterritorial integrity, unity and non-aligned \nstatus of the Republic of Cyprus.\nWe stand side by side with our African brothers \nin their struggle against imperialism, \ncolonialism, neo colonialism and\tfor \nindependence, social justice and development.\nThe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan strongly supports the \npeople of Namibia, which, under the leadership of \ntheir sole legitimate representative, SWAPO, are \nstruggling against the apartheid regime's \noccupation,\nWe reaffirm our solidarity with the heroic \npeoples of South Africa in their struggle to free \nthemselves from the abhorrent system of \napartheid. We resolutely condemn the South \nAfrican racist regime's continued aggression \nagainst Angola and other front-line States and \nits attempts to topple the Governments of some \nindependent African countries, particularly that \nof Seychelles.\nIn our view the Assembly should take action to \nincrease assistance to the national liberation \nmovements with a view to accelerating exercise of \nthe right of self-determination and the \nindependence of peoples still under alien and \ncolonial domination.\nIt is in this context that we express support for \nthe struggle of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic \nRepublic for full sovereignty over its territory.\nWe are in solidarity with the people of Puerto \nRico trying to exercise their right to \nself-determination and full independence.\nMy delegation reaffirms the fU.t support of the \nDemocratic Republic of Afghanistan for \nMauritius's sovereignty over Diego Garcia Island.\nWe also strongly demand the return of the \nMalagasy Islands of Glorieuses, Juan de Nova, \nEuropa and Bassas da India to the Democratic \nRepublic of Madagascar.\nIt is our belief that the Malvinas Islands are an \nintegral part of the Argentine Republic.\nThe situation in Central and Latin America and in \nthe Caribbean has been further aggravated as a \nresult of the interventionist, aggressive \npolicies of the United States.\nWhile strongly condemning the sinister plots of \nthe United States Administration in the region, \nthe Government of the Democratic Republic of \nAfghanistan expresses full solidarity with the \nrevolutionary peoples of Cuba, Nicaragua, \nGrenada, El Salvador and other peoples of Latin \nAmerica in their struggle against United States \nimperialism.\nThe present state of the international economic \nsituation constitutes a source of deep concern \nfor the developing countries. The reluctance of \ncertain capitalist countries regarding the \nlaunching of a genuine dialogue with the \ndeveloping countries within the framework of the \nUnited Nations has so far prevented the \nachievement of agreements on structural changes \nin the mechanism of international economic \nrelations. The prevailing uncertainty about the \nworld economy clearly shows the essential need \nfor a new and just international economic order \nthat would benefit all. Therefore no effort \nshould be spared within the framework of the \nUnited Nations and within the regional \norganizations to overcome the disparities of the \npresent situation. That situation, coupled with \nthe economic policies adopted by many Western \ncountries, places serious constraint for the \ndeveloping countries, attempts to attain the \ngrowth rates established in the International \nDevelopment Strategy for the Third United Nations \nDevelopment Decade. This adverse impact has been \nparticularly grave for the least developed \nlandlocked countries. Their growth rate has been \nretarded, and they have witnessed an actual \ndecline in their per capita gross domestic \nproduct in recent years. While in 1970 the \naverage per capita gross national product of the \nleast developed countries was 36.3 per cent of \nthat of all developing countries, it declined \nfurther, at the end of 1979, to 29.1 per cent.\nCompared with the average annual growth of 3.1 \nper cent in the gross domestic product of all \ndeveloping countries in past decade, the \nachievement of the least developer countries was \neven less than one per cent during the same \nperiod. We thus emphasize the need for special \nmeasures, large-scale assistance and continued \nsupport by the international community for the \ndevelopment of the least developed countries and \nwe stress the need for full and timely \nimplementation of the Substantial New Programme \nof Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed \nCountries adopted in Paris.\nThe distinctive and disadvantageous position of \nland-locked countries and their need for adequatetransport \nand transit facilities in the promotion of their \ntrade and economic development has been \nrecognized by various United Nations agencies and \ninternational conferences, and numerous \nresolutions have been adopted specifically to \novercome those problems. However, it is \nregrettable that effective and full \nimplementation of those decisions, including the \nestablishment of a Special Fund for Land-locked \nDeveloping Countries, has not materialized.\nWe stress the importance of economic cooperation \namong developing countries as a means of \npromoting the rational and efficient use of \nhuman, material and financial resources available \nfor the progress of developing countries. I \nshould also like to stress that the international \ncommunity should generate the necessary pressure \nto put an end to the arms race, in order to \nrelease the enormous resources badly needed for \ndevelopment programmes for the developing \ncountries. Realistically, it would be impossible \nto analyse in one statement all the economic, \nsocial, political and security problems facing \nour world. It is even less possible to suggest \nthe solutions required for those problems. \nNevertheless, due attention must be paid to those \nwhich are outstanding and remain global in \ncharacter.\nTo underline the approach taken by the Democratic \nRepublic of Afghanistan to those problems, allow \nme to quote briefly from a statement by Babrak \nKarmal:\n\\\"The Government of the Democratic Republic of \nAfghanistan, in full harmony with its decisive \nrevolutionary domestic policy, follows a \nprincipled, peaceful path in its relations with \nall countries of the world. Afghanistan is and \nwill remain a non- aligned nation. We will \nprofoundly and actively support the principles of \npositive and active non- alignment, peaceful \ncoexistence, the policy of detente and general \ndisarmament. And we will fight against \nwarmongers, against old and neocolonialism, \nagainst imperialism and Zionism, against fascism \nand racism, against racial discrimination and \ntogether with the peace-loving forces in a vast \nglobal front.\\\"\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like first of all to \ncongratulate you on your election as President of \nthe current session of the General Assembly. It \nis my particular pleasure to welcome you, the \nrepresentative of a neighbouring country with \nwhich Yugoslavia has been developing friendly \nrelations and comprehensive good-neighborly \nco-operation, to this important and responsible \npost.\n93.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to \nthe Secretary- General for his high personal and \nstatesmanlike qualities, as well as far the \nselfless efforts he exerted during the short but \nvery dynamic and difficult period since his \nelection. We are very pleased to see the \nrepresentative of friendly and non-aligned Peru \nin this high and exceptionally important post. \nHis election also honors the whole Latin American \ncontinent, as well as being recognition of the \ngrowing influence of the policy and movement of \nnon-alignment in international relations.\n94.\tI avail myself of this opportunity to \npoint out our particular gratitude and \nappreciation to the President of the thirty-sixth \nsession Mr. Ismat Kittani, the representative of \nIraq, a country with which Yugoslavia has firm \nfriendly ties, for the outstanding efforts, \nobjective attitude and skill with which he guided \nthe thirty-sixth session of the General \nAssem\u00acbly, the second special session on \ndisarmament and other meetings of the General \nAssembly in the course of the past year, which \nwas fraught with numerous problems and \ndifficulties.\n95.\tAlthough there are certain differences in \nthe assessments of the causes of the present \nstate of affairs in the world, we believe that \nthere is almost no dispute that we are now \nwitnessing one of those crucial turning-points in \nthe history of international relations, when a \nchoice has to be made between a perilous downhill \nslide caused by the increase of tension, and a \nhalting of this dangerous trend by reversing the \ndevelopments and directing them towards the \nrenewal of international confidence and \nrespon\u00acsibility, which have been so badly eroded. \nThis would pave the way for a process of \nequitable and peaceful negotiation on a number of \nconflict situations and crises present in the \nworld. There is no doubt that the situa\u00action in \nall spheres of international relations has \ndeterio\u00acrated to such an extent that the whole \ninternational community is faced with that \nchoice, which is all the more dramatic since \nthere are no signs of improve\u00acment. On the \ncontrary, many things are getting out of control \nand are acquiring their own momentum which, in \nturn, produces more tension.\n96.\tThere are three phenomena which \nconstitute an inseparable whole and which are the \nmajor causes of negative developments. These are \nthe unabated and spiraling arms race, which has \nacquired unforeseen proportions; the denial to \ncountries and peoples of their right to free \nsocial development and self-determination; and \nincreased rivalry, based on positions of \nstrength, in establishing new boundaries of \nspheres of interest and influence and shifting \nthe existing boundaries. All this is being done \nin the name of a self-arrogated right to protect \nsocial systems, to impose foreign models of \ndevelopment and to declare entire regions as the \ninviolable zones of security of big Powers. The \nuse of force tends to become a legitimate form of \nbehavior aimed at imposing the blocs as sole \narbiters in international affairs. To this end, \nbloc policy resorts to the use of the most \ndiverse methods of destabilization, ranging from \ninterference in internal affairs and economic \npressure to military intervention and direct \naggression.\n97.\tThe Secretary-General was, therefore, \nright when he said in his thought-provoking \nreport on the work of the Organization that \\\"The \npast year has seen an alarming succession of \ninternational crises as well as stalemates on a \nnumber of fundamental inter-national issues\\\". \nThis is a grave but regrettably true and \nirrefutable observation. This situation is less a \nresult of cyclical aggravation than of the \nprofound crisis of the post-war bloc system based \non the balance of terror. The entire development \nof international relations since the Second World \nWar has shown that the historic processes of \nemancipation and the striving for independent and \nundisturbed develop\u00acment are deeply rooted and \nuniversal. In spite of all attempts to the \ncontrary, the policy of the division of the world \ninto blocs, aimed at controlling those processes \nand at preserving the system of domination and \nthe policy of rivalry, has failed. This could not \nbe achieved either through the cold war or by \nlimited detente, by outbreaks of situations of \nconflict and other forms of interventionism or by \nattempts to crush the resistance of peoples to \nforeign domination and their will to establish \ntheir own national and social identities. In \nshort, the arms race, limited wars and military \ninterventions have not given any substantive \nadvantage to either bloc, nor have they \nstrengthened their internal cohesion. On the \ncontrary, the bloc perception of international \nrelations not only has failed to remove the \npossibility of global war but has constantly led \nthe world to its brink.\n98.\tThe blocs cannot solve in the old way the \ncrises existing both within their own ranks and \nin inter\u00acnational relations and they are not \nwilling to do so on the new basis; they are \ntrying to overcome them at the expense of small, \neconomically and militarily weak countries. All \nthis undoubtedly points to the obsolescence of \nthe existing system of international political \nand economic relations, which is caught today in \na web of mutual contradictions. The blocs are \nattempting to find a way out by intensifying and \nexpanding their power. They are incapable of \ncom\u00acprehending the altered structure of the \ninternational community and the growing awareness \nof nations and peoples, which have never been \nstronger, better organized and more committed to \nchanging the existing international relations. \nNever has the gap been wider between the old \nrelations and the new needs and possibilities for \nchanging the existing state of affairs for the \nbetter, nor have the dangers threatening the \nworld ever been so immediate and so far beyond \ncontrol. There is practically no field in \npolitical and economic relations in which serious \naggravation of difficulties has not occurred. The \nrelaxation of tensions and the efforts to settle \ndisputes by peaceful means are giving way to \nincreased manifestations of the cold war and the \nuse of force. Major channels of negotia\u00action, \nwhether bilateral or multilateral, have been \nblocked, and communication for the purpose of \nnegotiation has been reduced to the lowest level. \nThe security and independence of many nations, as \nwell as the most essential conditions of economic \ndevelopment, are threatened daily. The \nmanifestations of such a state of affairs are, \nunfortunately, very numerous.\n99.\tThe arms race, with the unrestrained and \nuncon\u00actrolled growth, quantitative and \nqualitative, and stock\u00acpiling of weapons, \nconstitutes today a most direct threat to world \npeace and an instrument for preserving the \nexisting inequitable system of international \nrelations. Negotiations on specific aspects of \nthe limitation of the arms race or its control or \non disarmament have for years been bogged down, \nwhile the Programme of Action contained in the \nFinal Docu\u00acment of the Tenth Special Session of \nthe General Assembly, unanimously adopted at the \nfirst special session devoted to disarmament, has \nnot been implemented. At the second special \nsession on disarmament the Assembly was not only \nunable to do further work on an international \nstrategy for a long-term process of disarmament, \nbut, in a way, took a step backwards. Detente not \nonly failed to become a coherent strategy for \npeace but, as the transition from cold war to \npeace, experienced a crisis precisely at the \nmoment when it was about to achieve the most \ndurable results, particularly in Europe.\n100.\tThe existing focal points of crisi are \nconstantly becoming linked with new ones in an \nuninterrupted chain stretching from the \nMediterranean, through the region of the Gulf, \nthe Indian Ocean, southern Africa and South \nAmerica to the Caribbean and Central America.\n101.\tThe longstanding practice of tolerating \nIsrael\u2019s aggressive policy in the Middle East has \nbrought about a situation which has no precedent \nin recent history, and for which it would be hard \nto find a parallel even in the Second World War. \nNot only does there seem to be no end to the \nIsraeli policy of expansionism and its violation \nof all the decisions of the United Nations and \nall the norms of inter\u00acnational behavior, but \nIsrael has resorted to genocide against the \nPalestinian people and keeps encroaching upon the \nindependence of Lebanon, A premeditated and \ncold-blooded massacre of helpless Palestinian and \nLebanese people is carried cut before the eyes of \nthe whole of mankind, which is unable either to \nprevent the crimes or to punish the perpetrator. \nIt has become obvious that this is a continuous \nand premeditated policy of aggression against and \nextermination of the Palestinian people and an \nattempt to find a \\\"final solution\\\" to the Middle \nEast crisis without it or against its will. Such \na policy is based on the illusion that the \nPalestinian question can be resolved without \nfulfilling the aspirations of the Palestinian \npeople, which are, like those of any other nation \nin the region, to live in peace and security on \nits own territory and in its own independent \nState; without recognizing the PLO as the \nlegitimate representative of the Palestinian \npeople; and without Israel's withdrawal from all \nterritories occupied in the 1967 war.\n102. The Twelfth Arab Summit Conference, at Fez, \nadopted a constructive plan, the implementation \nof which should be supported by the entire \ninternational community. It is encouraging, also, \nto see a positive development even among those \nelements that until yesterday supported Israel \nautomatically in all mani\u00acfestations of its \naggressive policy. It is high time to put a stop \nto this policy of extermination of the \nPalestin\u00acian people and to enable it to exercise \nits inalien\u00acable rights. From the latest \ndevelopments we should draw the lesson that it is \nno longer sufficient to express anger, \ndisappointment, abhorrence or guilty conscience \nand to engage in the rhetorics of propa\u00acganda but \nthat it is indispensable instead to take resolute \naction. No one can avoid responsibility for the \nlatest brutal atrocities in Beirut, least of all \nthose that could have prevented it.\n103.\tIn South-East and South-West Asia the \nstate of crisis persists unchanged. The peoples \nof Afghan\u00acistan and Kampuchea are prevented from \nexercising their right to a free life and are \nstill subjected to foreign intervention. The \ninternational community has, through United \nNations resolutions and the positions taken by \nthe conferences of the non-aligned countries, \nlaid down the basis for a peaceful political \nsolution of these problems, which can be achieved \nonly through the withdrawal of foreign troops and \nthe elimination of all forms of outside \nintervention.\n104.\t3n Africa, particularly southern Africa, \nracist and colonialist strongholds still exist, \nwhile attempts are being made to tum that \ncontinent into an arena of bloc rivalry. These \nneo-colonialist tendencies threaten the \nindependence and security of the coun\u00actries of \nthe continent and obstruct the positive role \nplayed by the Organization of African Unity. It \nis high time that the question of Namibia was \nsolved, and the long-expected final agreement on \nits accession to full independence should be \nreached at this very session of the general \nAssembly. We believe that this is indispensable \nand will be possible if we exert additional \nefforts and show greater resolve. Success in \nsolving the outstanding problem of Namibia would \nshow that the most complex issues can finally be \nresolved through negotiations. It would help to \nreawaken the shaken faith in the United Nations. \nOn the other hand, procrastination would \nundoubtedly bring the already tense situation in \nthis part of the world to the brink of explosion, \nwith wider inter\u00acnational implications. The \nliberation of Namibia on the basis of Security \nCouncil resolution 435 (1978), as well as the \ncreation of conditions enabling the people of \nWestern Sahara to express its will freely within \nthe framework of the right to self-determination, \nwould be of the utmost importance for the \nstrength\u00acening of the independence and the faster \neconomic and social development of all African \ncountries. The people of Korea has net yet \nexercised its right to unification, in spite of \nthe position of the Democratic People's Republic \nof Korea, which de\u00acserves international support.\n105.\tCyprus remains divided. United Nations \nefforts based en clearly formulated positions on \nthe establish\u00acment of an independent, united and \nnon-aligned Cyprus have yielded no results. We \nwelcome the continuation of the intercommunal \ntalks and hope that they, together with all the \nother efforts being exerted, will bring about a \njust and lasting solution.\n106.\tIn Central America and in the Caribbean \npeo\u00acples are fighting for their national and \nsocial identity and for liberation from all kinds \nof patronage and foreign interference.\n107.\tThe deterioration of the situation in \nEurope is manifested primarily through the \nescalation of the arms race, the introduction and \ndeployment of new types of weapons and the \nobstruction of the channels of eco\u00acnomic, \ncultural and other forms of co-operation among \nEuropean countries. In addition, European \nsecurity is directly affected by the situation \nand security in the broader region of the \nMediterranean, including the Middle East, as well \nas by the relations between blocs in all parts of \nthe world. Therefore, we attach great importance \nto the resumption of the Madrid follow-up meeting \nto the Conference on Security and Co-operation in \nEurope, the successful outcome of which would \nmost certainly have a positive impact on \ninternational relations in general.\n108.\tOur efforts in the Mediterranean are \ndirected to transforming this sea and its \nhinterland from a region of confrontation and \nconstant sabre-rattling into a region of overall \nco-operation, security and mutual interaction of \nthe cultures of Mediterranean countries and \npeoples. In a word, our efforts should be \ndirected towards creating the conditions of \npeace, co-operation and progress for all.\n109.\tThe economic situation is becoming ever \nmore critical and a prolonged crisis is \npermeating all areas of the world economy and \ninternational relations. Although no country is \nimmune to certain difficulties, the developing \ncountries, which are victims of both the crisis \nin the world economy and the inequitable system \nof international economic relations, are hardest \nhit by such a situation.\n110.\tThe critical situation in the world \neconomy is accompanied by ever more frequent \nsevering of economic ties, retrogression of \nmultilateral economic co-operation and withdrawal \ninto one's own narrow boundaries. International \neconomic co-operation is stagnating and giving \nway to unilateral and bilateral moves which do \nnot lead to solutions but provoke even sharper \nconflicts. The causes of the present crisis lie \nabove all in the structure and the existing \nimbalance and inequality of the current system of \ninternational economic relations. That is the \nsource of the constant widening of the economic \ngap between developed and developing countries, \nwhich not only further destabilizes the world \neconomy but also constitutes an increasing danger \nto peace and security in the world.\n111.\tThe greatest responsibility for such a \nstate in the world economy is borne by the \nindustrially most developed countries. Their \nextremely restrictive eco\u00acnomic and monetary \npolicies have not only led to deep recession and \nincreased unemployment but also hampered economic \ngrowth in developing countries, considerably \nincreased their indebtedness and criti-cally \naggravated their balance of payments.\n112.\tThe present financial crisis which is \nshaking the world economy and the international \nfinancial system is a direct consequence of the \nlongstanding stagnation of the world economy and \ninternational economic relations. Many countries, \nparticularly the developing ones, have found \nthemselves in a critical financial situation. The \nfact that the developed countries show \ninsufficient understanding of the efforts of \ndeveloping countries to overcome these \ndifficulties seriously threatens the economic \ngrowth and development of the latter, and this \ncould have far-reaching political and social \nconsequences.\n113.\tThe way out of the present particularly \ndifficult economic situation can be found only in \nthe strength\u00acening of multilateral economic \nco-operation and the establishment of the new \ninternational economic order. The solution of the \naccumulated economic problems would be in the \ninterest not only of developing coun\u00actries but \nalso of the entire world economy and of progress \nin general. In the context of the present \nsituation, which is fraught with a number of \nproblems and uncertainties, global negotiations \nwithin the United Nations system and progress in \ngeneral appear to be the only possible course. \nThe launching of global negotiations has never \nbeen so urgent.\n114.\tThe general unfavorable development of \nthe situation in the world has blocked the work \nand the functioning of international \norganizations and almost all multilateral \ninstitutions. Particularly disquieting is the \nsituation in which the United Nations finds \nitself. The Organization is becoming ever more \nhelpless in its efforts to play the role of an \neffective guardian of peace, the protector of the \nindependence of countries and peoples and a forum \nfor solving major inter\u00acnational issues by \npromoting co-operation. The impotence of the \nSecurity Council was manifested recently in \nconnection with the Lebanese crisis, as in \nsimilar cases in the past, owing to the lack of \npolitical readiness on the part of the big Powers \nand the abuse of the right of veto. Victims of \naggression can rely less and less on the United \nNations for effective support.\n115.\tThe constant deterioration of \ninternational rela\u00actions calls for a most urgent \nglobal response from the world community. It is \nbecoming ever more obvious that the key issues of \nthe present-day world cannot be dealt with and \neven less resolved in a bilateral context, \nbetween blocs and the big Powers. These issues \ncan be solved only on the basis of equal \npar-ticipation and joint responsibility of all \nmembers of the international community in their \ndefense of peace as the common heritage of \nmankind, and within the framework of a new system \nof international relations. The movement and \npolicy of non-alignment\u2014which is constantly and \nactively contributing to the develop\u00acment of a \nnew concept of international community and to the \nsolving of international issues\u2014have always \nadvocated the need for such global responses. \nThere\u00acfore, a strong and independent non-aligned \nmovement, which is constantly limiting the areas \nof bloc con\u00acfrontation, narrowing the room for \nthe creation of spheres of interest and widening \nthe basis for inter\u00acnational co-operation, is \nessential not only to the non- aligned countries \nbut also the entire international community.\nH7. The non-aligned countries will urge once \nagain at the current session that the existing \ntensions be overcome through a dialogue in which \nall countries would participate on equal terms. \nTheir assessment that peace cannot be built on a \nbalance of terror, the arms race, bloc division, \nspheres of interest, imposition of foreign will \nand diktat upon peoples and countries, has been \nfully confirmed. Not only would such peace be \nfragile but it would also condemn the world to \nperpetual instability. Only such peace enabling \nall countries and peoples to exercise the right \nto free development and equal security can be \nstable and lasting. Those positions of the policy \nand movement of non-alignment are more important \nand crucial today than ever before.\n118.\tSuch a conception of non-alignment is \nfounded on the irrepressible aspiration of \npeoples to participate in international life \nfreely and on a footing of equality. The validity \nof such an approach is also confirmed by the fact \nthat the number of non-aligned countries in the \nworld has never been larger, that it constitutes \ntoday two thirds of the international community, \nthat they have neverbeen more determined to \noppose any policy of force and that resistance to \nthe suppression of freedom and equality has never \nbeen more resolute than now. Indeed, owing to \nnon-alignment inde\u00acpendence today does not amount \nto mere balancing between the blocs or to \nneutrality, but to active involvement in \ninternational affairs. That is the basis for our \noptimism that a way out of the current crisis can \nbe found and that the international community \nmust not be engulfed by desperation.\n119.\tAt this session we are confronted with \nthe major and responsible task of opposing \nenergetically any further deterioration of \ninternational relations and to begin solving \nissues on which agreement can already be reached. \nThe dangers are too imminent and the priorities \ntoo well-known to allow any hesitation which \ncould have irretrievable and unforeseeable \ncon-sequences. AH the States Members of the \nUnited Nations should be actively involved along \nthese lines, regardless of ideological, bloc, \nregional and other orientations, and irrespective \nof the level of economic development. Special \nresponsibility is borne by coun\u00actries which have \ncertain special rights due to their military and \neconomic power. There is a solid basis of common \ninterest for such an effort. Resolute political \naction should be taken for the purpose of \nchanging the present state of affairs, broadening \nthe foundations of co-operation and returning to \ndetente. That would be beneficial to all \ncountries.\n120.\tIn order to achieve this, it is necessary \nto proceed to broad political negotiations, aimed \nat halting the arms race and controlling it \nwithin the framework of the process leading to \ngeneral and complete disar\u00acmament. Each step \ntoward that end would be welcome; it could be \ntaken without any danger of diminishing security, \nsince the leading nuclear Powers possess a \nsufficient quantity of weapons for multiple \nmutual destruction. If this is not done, the race \nagainst armaments will be lost. No question of \nprestige or illusory political advantage anywhere \nin the world should prevent talks on the halting \nof the arms race.\n121.\tFar-reaching decisions on starting the \nnego\u00actiating process on all problems are also \nnecessary, taking into account that they should \nnot infringe upon the legitimate right of all \npeoples and countries to security and an \nindependent development. Any com\u00acpromise in this \nsense would be not only amoral but also \ndestabilizing. Therefore, such negotiations \nshould deal not only with the arms race, because \nthe halting of the arms race, and even the \nlaunching of the process of disarmament, in spite \nof its significance for the problem of world \npeace or war, could not bring about peace and \nsecurity for all peoples unless the use of force \nis restrained.\n122.\tIt is an illusion that stability and \ndevelopment can be limited to one part of the \nworld, while other parts remain hunting grounds \nand spheres of rivalry and exploitation. It is \nconfirmed every day that the big Powers cannot be \nsole arbiters even in their own backyards. That \nis why fundamental changes should take place not \nonly in their mutual relations, but also in their \nrelations with the rest of the world, proceeding \nfrom the perception that the world has changed, \nthat peace is indivisible, that peoples are not \nready to accept positions of passive resignation \nor to live in permanent political, economic and \ncultural sub-jugation.\n.123. The non-aligned countries have always \nunder\u00aclined the particular importance of and the \nneed for the strengthening of the role of the \nUnited Nations as an irreplaceable forum for the \nmaintenance of peace and security in the world \nand for the solving of major international \nproblems. The principles and the goals of the \npolicy of non-alignment are in their essence \nlinked with the principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, with which they constitute an \nindivisible whole. For this reason the \nnon-aligned countries are deeply interested in \nthe full implementation of the Charter and of the \nrole of the United Nations that inspired its \ncreation.\n124.\tWe believe that it is never redundant to \nemphasize that all countries in their \ninternational behavior should strictly comply \nwith the obligations they undertook when signing \nthe Charter. We are thinking here above all of \nnon-interference in the internal affairs of \nState, the absolute inadmissibility of the use of \nforce in international relations, full respect of \nindependence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, \nas well as the right of all peoples to decide on \ntheir own destiny.\n125.\tThe United Nations should become an \ninstru\u00acment which will enable these principles to \nbecome everyday practice. The Organization, \nnamely its Member States, must strive for the \nestablishment of a system of collective security \nwhich will guarantee freedom and opportunity for \nindependent development to every country. The \npresent very dramatic moment in international \nrelations is the consequence of nu\u00acmerous \nviolations of obligations undertaken on the basis \nof the Charter and of the non-implementation of \nthe decisions adopted by the General Assembly and \nthe Security Council.\n126.\tA system of international relations \nshould be established which would fully secure \nrespect for and implementation of decisions \nadopted by the main United Nations bodies. The \nprimary responsibility for this is borne by the \nSecurity Council, which according to the Charter \nis the principal organ for the main\u00actenance of \ninternational peace and security. We consider \nthat particular obligations of the permanent \nmembers of the Security Council for the \nmain\u00actenance of international peace, respect for \nthe principles of the Charter and the \nimplementation of the decisions of the United \nNations should again be pointed out. As a first \nstep in that direction we should secure at least \nthe full implementation of decisions adopted \nunanimously in the Security Council.\n127.\tWe propose that comprehensive and \ncon\u00accrete action be undertaken for the \nrealization of the effective role of the United \nNations in solving major international issues. We \nconsider that there is enough room for the \npromotion of such a role for the United Nations. \nPerhaps this is the right time for a \ncom\u00acprehensive review of the functioning of the \nUnited Nations, namely, of ways of improving its \neffec\u00activeness. To that end, the experience \ngathered during almost 40 years of existence and \nwork of the United Nations should be studied. \nArticle 109 of the Charter could serve as the \nbasis for such an endeavor, embracing all efforts \nof the Member States and the organs of the United \nNations. In this way, concrete and practical \nmeasures for the future could be elaborated.\n128.\tWe believe that a particular role should \nbe played by the Secretary-General, who in his \nreport has pointed to the existing problems and \ndifficulties. We should request him to devote \nparticular attention to the effective functioning \nof the United Nations and to suggest adequate \nmeasures. His efforts can, of course, yield \nresults only to the extent to which he will be \ngiven support by the Member States.\n129.\tLet me now add a personal note in this \nplaydoier on the urgent need to undertake \nconcrete measures to strengthen the role of the \nUnited Nations. There are now assembled in this \nHall many represen\u00actatives with considerable \nexperience of the work of the Organization. \nSpeaking for myself, in the many years of my deep \nand active involvement in the work of the United \nNations I have looked to this rostrum where 1 am \nnow standing from all possible angles in this \nHall, from all different vantage points, as a \nmember of a delegation, as a permanent \nrepresentative and even as President of the \nGeneral Assembly. We have wit-nessed here many \nhistoric events and heard the addresses of so \nmany statesmen and distinguished figures from all \nover the world. In all those years I have \nlistened, probably, to more than a thousand \nspeeches and addresses in the general debates of \nthe general Assembly alone. Many representatives \ngathered here have done the same. Why should we \nnot benefit from our own experience, from the \nmany lessons we have been taught, by advancing \nmany suggestions on how to strengthen the role of \nthe United Nations by improving the organization \nof the work of the General Assembly and its main \nbodies, by improving the procedures and \neffectiveness of the work of this unique world \norganization?\n130.\tThe role of the United Nations and the \neffective\u00acness of its work can be strengthened \nand improved first of all by influence from \noutside, with the political willingness of the \nMember States and their Govern\u00acments, but it \ncould be strengthened also from inside, with a \nbetter atmosphere for work and a more dedicated \ninvolvement of all representatives and members of \nthe Secretariat. At this historic moment in \ninternational affairs, with aggravations and \nescalations of all kinds, the time is coming to \nreview again the experiences of the past in the \nwork of the United Nations and to design new \nmoves for strengthening the role and \neffec\u00activeness of the Organization, which, with \nits place in the history of mankind, should never \nbe doomed to failure.\n131.\tIn conclusion, may I say that we expect \nthe Assembly at this session to contribute to the \nnon-use of force against independent countries \nand to securing their free national and social \ndevelopment; to render collective resistance to \nthe arms race; to contribute to the establishment \nof a universal relaxation of tension; to \ncontribute to the launching of global \nnegotiations, for which, in spite of all \ndifficulties and ambiguities, favorable \nconditions have been created proceeding from the \nfact that all sectors have publicly acknowledged \nthat global negotiations are a political and an \neconomic necessity of the world today; to give \nimpetus to the resolving of crises, primarily \nthose which involve the liberation of peoples \nunder foreign and colonial domination as well as \nall other crises where security, territorial \nintegrity, indepen\u00acdence and the \nself-determination of countries and peoples are \njeopardized; and to prevent any encroach\u00acment \nupon the sovereignty, territorial integrity and \nindependence of peoples and to undertake resolute \nmeasures against all those who have violated the \nwidely accepted principles and goals of the \nUnited Nations as well as the decisions adopted \nby its bodies.\n132.\tOtherwise, we should find ourselves faced \nwith chaos and world catastrophe. The imposition \nof the policy of faits accomplis as practice in \ninternational relations must not be allowed.\n133.\tThe delegation of the Socialist Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia, together with the \ndelegations of non- aligned countries and all \nother countries offering their co-operation, will \nmake its full contribution to the achievement of \nthat goal.\n134.\tWe are aware that the differences in the \nper\u00acception of the world will remain, that they \nare constant and ever-enriching elements of its \npluralistic nature but, in our opinion, they \nshould not be incompatible with our common \ninterest in maintaining universal peace, which is \nincreasingly becoming the pre-condition for the \nsurvival of humanity.\n"

        "file_text": "As we come to this session of the General \nAssembly, the international situation is in some \nrespects more serious than it has been since the \nend of the Second World War and the establishment \nof the Organization. The quantity of armaments is \nmuch greater, weapons are more devastating, \nhunger more severe, destitution more extensive, \nand the curse of unemployment more far- reaching \nthan ever before since the establishment of the \nOrganization. We have certainly made some gains \nand that we must not forget. But much more \nglaring are the cases where success has been \nlimited, or when no results at all were achieved. \nI intend to deal with a few of those aspects here.\n283.\tWhen I addressed the General Assembly in \nSeptember 1981 meeting, I referred to a number \nof provisions of the Charter and of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. I compared the \nwords to the deeds. In the past year there has \nbeen a continual deterioration in these matters \nin many parts of the world. Amongst the most \nserious events are those in the Middle East and \nin Poland, although they are different in nature. \nBut, regrettably, a number of further examples \ncould be cited.\n284.\tIn his report on the work of the \nOrganization, the Secretary-General raises a \nmatter of great concern, namely, the increased \nlack of respect for Security Council resolutions. \nI endorse whole-heartedly his words of warning \nthat we are perilously near to international \nanarchy. The structure of the Organization, and \nin particular the veto, has been both its \nstrength and its weakness. Changes in that basic \nstructure could result in the collapse of the \nOrganization, and therefore I do not regard such \nchanges as being open to debate. But it is \nevident that the ability of the United Nations to \npromote the peaceful settlement of disputes is \nvirtually non-existent when a State with veto \npowers perceives its direct or indirect interests \nthreatened by actions of the Organization. Such \nsituations occur more and more frequently. In \naddition, there is an increasing tendency by \nother States to feel that they are strong enough \nto defy the unanimous decisions of the Security \nCouncil. They are confident that the unity of \npurpose of the Organization is not such that \nwords will be translated into action. That trend \nmust be reversed. It cannot be achieved by \namending the Charter of the United Nations but, \nrather, as a result of nations becoming \nincreasingly cognizant of the danger to world \npeace if those developments continue.\n285.\tAt the recent meeting of the Nordic \nForeign Ministers, the strong support of the \nNordic countries was reaffirmed for the United \nNations and for measures aimed at settling \ninternational disputes by peace-ful means, in \naccordance with the principles of the Charter \nconcerning respect for the territorial integrity \nand political independence of all States. In that \ncontext an appeal was made to all States to \nrespect the internationally accepted rules \nguiding relations between States. It was declared \nthat the Nordic countries would continue to work \nto strengthen the United Nations as a universal \norganization for peace. Further-more, the \nministers were in agreement on the need to \nexamine and to discuss with other States measures \nwhich could strengthen the ability of the \nOrganization to act in conflicts and crises. I \ndraw attention to those statements of the Nordic \nForeign Ministers and reiterate the appeal \ncontained therein.\n286.\tThe situation in the Middle East has been \ndiscussed in the United Nations from its \ninception. But still we seem far from a peaceful \nsolution of these disputes, which constantly \npoison the atmosphere and cause the inhabitants \nof the region suffering and death. That tragedy \nculminated in the massacre in the refugee camps \nin Beirut earlier this month. All those who wish \nto uphold respect for the Charter must insist on \nan independent investigation of that crime as \nsoon as possible.\n287.\tThe invasion of Lebanon by Israel is one \nmore episode in a long history of revenge and \nretaliation in the Middle East. At the same time, \nit is a tragic example of the disrespect for \nSecurity Council deci-sions to which I have \nreferred. I declare my full support for the \nUnited Nations resolutions condemning the \ninvasion and occupation of Lebanon by Israel and \nits refusal to abide by the Security Council \nresolutions.\nThat behavior increases the difficulty of \nattaining a comprehensive, just and lasting \nsolution of the disputes in this area. Such a \nsolution must be based on Security Council \nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and must \nsafeguard the security of all States in the \nregion, including Israel, and ensure justice for \nall peoples, including the Palestinians. In that \nconnection, I would also emphasize in particular \nthe necessity for realizing the legitimate \nnational rights of the Palestinians through the \nexercise of their right to self- determination, \nincluding their right to participate in \nnegotiations on their own future.\n288.\tI welcome the proposals for a solution of \nthe major problems in the Middle East which have \nbeen put forward by the President of the United \nStates and the Arab Summit Conference. It is \nstill too soon to predict whether those proposals \ncan form a basis for negotiations by all the \nparties, but I sincerely hope that they will. \nIndeed, many elements of both proposals are \nworthy of further consideration.\n289.\tI should like to turn briefly to a number \nof other questions, questions which are the most \nblatant examples of the disrespect for the \nequality, sovereignty and political independence \nof all nations. These are principles which should \nbe respected under the Charter of the United \nNations but which are in fact disregarded in \npractice when the more powerful States perceive \ntheir interests to be better served thereby.\n290.\tThe situation in Afghanistan has not \nimproved since we met here one year ago. The \nmilitary occupation has now lasted nearly three \nyears. Efforts continue with limited success to \nforce the submission of the people and compel \nthem to resign themselves to the situation. \nRepeated United Nations resolutions are \ndisregarded. Much the same can indeed be said of \nwar- torn Kampuchea.\n291.\tJust over two years ago, new waves of \nfreedom spread through Polish society. The people \nsought a greater voice in their own affairs. \nAgreements were reached with the authorities on a \nslight relaxation of controls and the \nestablishment of free trade unions was allowed. \nThese tendencies towards freedom were to be \nshort-lived. They ended with the imposition of \nmartial law on 13 December 1981.\n292.\tA list of this kind could be long. There \nare many States which suffer under \ntotalitarianism and oppression where the \nprinciples of the Charter are ignored.\n293.\tWhile such situations recur at short \nintervals, it is extremely difficult to lower the \ntension in international relations and to \nproceed to effective and realistic measures to \npromote and preserve peace and security in \naccordance with the fundamental aims of the \nOrganization. Such measures are indeed essential \nnow.\n294.\tThe quantity of armaments is of a much \ngreater dimension and weapons are more menacing \nthan those the world has ever seen before; but \nstill the frantic arms race continues. The debate \non who is the most powerful could no doubt go on \na J in/M/Mm. In fact, the debate would probably \nnot be resolved unless the unthinkable should \nhappen\u00f3that the big Powers put the matter to the \ntest. It is not likely that many would be left to \njudge the outcome, and the winner would not be in \na very much more enviable position than the \nloser. The weapons of mass destruction can at any \ntime bring total devastation to mankind. The \nnuclear Powers carry a heavy burden. They are, \nindeed, responsible for the fate of the world.\n295. Mankind has but one option. The only \nalternative which would not sooner or later lead \nto destruc-tion is effective and genuine \nagreements on arms reduction as a first step on \nthe long road to total disarmament, which should \nbe\u00f3indeed must be\u00f3the vision of those who believe \nin the high principles of the Charter.\n2%. The demand for realistic action on \ndisarmament is more pronounced now than it has been \nfor a long time. In that light, it is tragic to \nhave to admit that the second special session on \ndisarmament yielded practically no results. We \nmust therefore hope and trust that concrete \nresults will be achieved in the negotiations \nbetween the United State s and the Soviet Union \non reducing stockpiles of a number of the main \ntypes of nuclear weapons, in the negotiations on \nmutual and balanced force reductions and in the \nwork of the Committee on Disarmament and, of \ncourse, at the Madrid Conference on Security and \nCo-operation in Europe, should it result in an \nagreement on a conference on confidence-building \nmeasures and disarmament in Europe. The \nimplementation of disarmament must be based on \nreciprocity. Anything else would be neither \nrealistic nor justifiable. The aim should be to \nachieve a balance\u00f3not a balance of terror, but a \nbalance based on a reduction, not an increase, of \narms.\n297.\tAs a representative of an island nation \nwhich depends for its existence on the living \nresources of the sea, I am bound to express grave \nconcern about the increased armaments in the \noceans and, in particular, the enlarged fleets of \nsubmarines armed with nuclear weapons. Even in \npeacetime, an accident under adverse conditions \ncould destroy the economic basis of such nations. \nThus I would emphasize that the proper response \nto the opposition of people in continental \nEurope and America to an even greater increase in \nthe number of nuclear missiles in their countries \nis not to move these weapons to the oceans but, \nrather, to agree to a real reduction. Only thus \nwill the threat posed by such weapons be \ndiminished.\n298.\tAs regards the law of the sea, I would \ncall on those countries which are still not \nprepared to agree to the Convention to reconsider \ntheir position. Through the participation of all \nnations in the Convention on the Law of the Sea, \nwe can avoid severe conflicts between individual \nStates on various law-of-the-sea issues and thus \ntake an important step towards the world \nstructure to which we aspire in the Charter.\n299.\tEarlier, I dealt particularly with States \nand their relations with other States and the \nlack of respect which is all too often evident in \nthose relations. It is a fact that it is usually \nthe individual human being who is the victim in \nsuch circumstances, although in the name of \nsafeguarding the interests of one State against \nanother. But it is the responsibility of each \nState\u00f3and indeed an obligation undertaken by all \nthe States Members of the United Nations\u00f3to \nensure respect for the individual and for human \nrights. That obligation is unfortunately not \ncomplied with by a large number of Governments \nwhich here represent the inhabitants of their \ncountries. This is even true of many Governments \nwhich in other respects abide by their \ninternational obligations.\n300.\tIn referring to fundamental human rights, \nI include therein the right of every human being \nto an equitable share in the world's resources. \nOther human rights are of little avail to those \nwith no prospects but starvation. It must \ntherefore be one of the principal aims of the \nOrganization to strive to ensure that every child \nbom in this world has sufficient food and health \ncare and education in accordance with his or her \nability. The mottes of this session of the \nGeneral Assembly might, indeed, be decreased \nhunger, lower military expenditures and increased \nrespect for international obligations.\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Hungarian delegation, Sir, I \noffer you heartfelt congratulations on your \nelection as President of the thirty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. We are pleased \nat your election to that high post, for it is an \nexpression of international recognition both of \nsocialist Hungary's peace-loving foreign policy \nand of its activities in the United Nations. It \nis our sincere hope that under your guidance the \nGeneral Assembly will carry out the tasks of this \nsession successfully and in a constructive \natmosphere.\n2.\tThe thirty-seventh session of the General \nAs\u00acsembly is taking place in an international \nsituation full of controversy and fraught with \ndangers. Since last year, subversive activities \nthreatening peace and security have been stepped \nup; tension connected with certain specific \nevents continues to grow.\n3.\tThe main reason for the deterioration in \nthe international situation is that extremist \nimperialist circles are striving to upset the \nbalance if power which has emerged between the \ntwo world systems. They are striving to attain \nmilitary supremacy, and to that end have started \nto arm themselves on an unprecedented scale. They \nare seeking to establish international conditions \nin which they can impose their will on other \nStates. I could give many examples of the way in \nwhich existing crises have worsened and in which \nnew crises have emerged, aiding and abetting the \nreactionary forces.\n4.\tThe extremist imperialist circles are \nsystematically seeking to impair relations \nbetween the socialist and the developed \ncapitalist countries, and to destroy the results \nwhich have been achieved in the development of \nEast-West co-operation on the basis of mutual \ninterests. In order to attain their goals, they \nare exerting growing pressure on the developing \ncountries and on the liberation movements. They \nhave been launching campaigns of slander and \npropaganda against the socialist and other \nprogressive countries and have been ceaselessly \nattempting to interfere in their internal affairs \non various pretexts.\n79\n5.\tWe are convinced that it is in the \ninterest of the peoples of the world to put an \nend to these processes. It is promising to note \nthat more and more countries and larger and \nlarger masses of the people are op\u00acposing the \nunbridled arms race, the policy of force, \nsabre-rattling and measures aimed at creating \ntension.\n6.\tMy Government decisively condemns the \nattacks launched against detente and the attempts \nthat are being made in poison the international \natmosphere and to step up the arms race. We \nconsider that our most important foreign policy \ntask in the present situa\u00action is to make the \ngreatest contribution we can to the safeguarding \nof peace throughout the world, to the improvement \nof the international atmosphere, to the \nstrengthening of international security, to the \npromo\u00action of the cause of disarmament and to the \nstrength\u00acening of friendship and multilateral \nco-operation among States and peoples. We \nconstantly advocate this in international forums \nand in bilateral relations. We consider that \nevery opportunity should be seized to expand \ninternational co-operation and that increased \nefforts should be undertaken to find constructive \nsolutions to the problems that stand in the way. \nThus, we attach particular importance to the \nmaintenance of the bilateral relations which have \nevolved during the past decade on the basis of \nthe principle of the peace\u00acful coexistence of \ncountries with different social systems. \nMoreover, we deem it necessary to intensify \npolitical contacts and dialogue and to broaden \neco\u00acnomic and other relations which serve our \nmutual interests.\n7.\tIn order to achieve these goals, we must \ncontinue to strengthen the role of the United \nNations so that it can be more effective in \nbolstering the cause of peace,\n8.\tThe Hungarian People's Republic is a \nstaunch champion of disarmament and of the \nlimitation and reduction of armed forces and \narmaments. My Govern\u00acment takes active part in \nvarious international disarmament forums and also \nseeks in its bilateral relations to promote the \ncause of disarmament. We are convinced that none \nof the pressing problems of peace can be solved \nby armaments. Stockpiling weapons will not result \nin more stable, guaranteed security or peace, \neven for the countries which possess those \nweapons.\n9.\tToday's balance of military power in the \nworld is characterized by parity between the \nSoviet Union and the United States, and between \nthe Warsaw Treaty countries and the countries of \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NAO]. \nThere is now approxi\u00acmate parity in both nuclear \nand conventional weapons. That parity is an \nhistoric victory for the countries and peoples \nwhich are fighting for socialism, progress and \npeace; they therefore advocate maintaining it, \nand strive to ensure that it is maintained at the \nlowest possible level.\n10.\tHence the socialist countries, together \nwith other peace-loving countries, in the United \nNations and in all other international forums, \nare making constant efforts to curb the arms race \nwhich has reached senseless proportions and to \nachieve tangible, sub\u00acstantive results in the \nfield of disarmament. That goal is served by a \nnumber of proposals and draft treaties submitted \nat this session of the General Assembly which \nprescribe specific commitments.\n11.\tNaturally, given the state of armaments \ntoday, peoples of the world and peace-loving \nGovernments are concentrating first and foremost \non eliminating the danger of nuclear war. My \nGovernment also gives priority importance to \nnuclear disarmament. We are anxious to see the \nurgent adoption of measures and the conclusion of \ninternational agreements that would reduce the \narms race and at the same time be specific steps \ntowards nuclear disarmament.\n12.\tWe consider the general and unilateral \ncommit\u00acment of the Soviet Union as being a \nsignificant con-tribution to the cause of peace \nand disarmament, and welcome it, namely, that in \nno circumstances would it be the first to use \nnuclear weapons. If all nuclear Powers were to \nmake that commitment, in practice that would mean \nthat the use of the most dangerous weapons of \nmass destruction would be impossible. Trust \namongst States would be signifi\u00accantly increased \nand we could hope for the success of disarmament \ntalks with justifiable optimism.\n13.\tWe regret that the nuclear Powers which \nhave not yet taken this step are adhering to \ntheir plans for manufacturing new types of \nnuclear weapons, and some of them are still \ncontinuing to disseminate the absurd doctrine of \na limited nuclear war.\n14.\tFrom the point of view of strengthening \nuniversal peace and security, relations between \nthe Soviet Union and the United States are of \ndecisive importance; hence their talks to limit \nand reduce strategic nuclear weapons, as well as \nmedium-range nuclear missiles, are particularly \nimportant. It is urgent that practical agreements \nbe reached as soon as possible in those talks, oh \nthe basis of the principle of equality and equal \nsecurity.\n13. In the struggle against armaments an \nimportant role would be played by a ban on \nnuclear-weapon testing in all spheres. Along with \nmany other coun\u00actries, we were amazed at the \nrecent decision of the United States \nAdministration not to resume the trilateral talks \non a general and complete ban on nuclear-weapon \ntesting. We follow with anxiety the fact that \nthere is an increase in the number of indi\u00acvidual \ncountries which intend to become nuclear- weapon \nStates. We consider that one of the most pressing \ntasks which demand tremendous responsi\u00acbility is \nthe prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons. \nThat is why the United Nations should also strive \nto bring that about.\n16. The goal of fostering nuclear disarmament \nrequires that in addition to efforts towards \nresolving the baste problems, it is necessary to \nuse all other opportunities which directly or at \nleast indirectly could promote a reduction of the \nnuclear threat. In this respect we believe that \nfurther efforts should be made to reduce the \ndeployment of nuclear weapons, to create \nnuclear-free zones and zones of peace, to \nguarantee the security of countries which do not \npossess nuclear weapons and to prevent the accidental \nuse of nuclear weapons.\n17.\tThe Government and people of the \nHungarian People's Republic express regret that \nbecause of the existing unfavorable international \nsituation and the lack of political will among \ncertain influential Powers, the second special \nsession devoted to disarmament did not yield the \nexpected results. However, one should not \nunderestimate the significance of the fact that \nat that session the overwhelming majority of the \nStates Members of the United Nations unanimously \nexpressed their concern at the threat of war. \nThey clearly stated that the elimination of the \nnuclear threat was the most urgent task of this \nperiod.\n18.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's \nRepublic constantly devotes great attention to \nEuropean security and co-operation. Although our \ncountry is small, still, as far as we can, we too \npromote the practical implementation of the \nrecommendations and spirit of the Final Act of \nthe Conference on Security and Co-operation in \nEurope, signed at Helsinki. Our delegation to the \nMadrid session of the Conference, which is to \nresume its follow-up to questions of European \nsecurity and co-operation next November, will \nwork in the interest of guaran\u00acteeing a \nconstructive spirit for the talks and the \nadop\u00action of a meaningful, balanced and \npurposeful final document.\n19.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's \nRepublic is anxious that the Madrid session \nshould conclude its work successfully. We \nconsider it partic\u00acularly important that that \nConference should adopt a decision to convene a \nEuropean conference on confidence-building, \nsecurity and disarmament. The delegations rf all \ncountries participating in the Madrid Conference \nshould be guided by a will to achieve agreement. \nThe responsibility of the participating \ncoun\u00actries is particularly great, since the \nshaping of the international political situation \nand prospects for disarmament depend to a large \nextent on how rela\u00actions evolve among the \nparticipating countries and what sort of \nco-operation will be established among them.\n20.\tThe growth of international tension has \nbeen fostered also by the fact that in effect no \nprogress has been made in eliminating pockets of \ntension that have either long existed or recently \nemerged. Furthermore, in some places the \nsituation continues to worsen, and the prospects \nfor settlement are becoming ever more remote. My \nGovernment believes it abso\u00aclutely urgent to \nadopt specific steps speedily to eliminate \npockets of tension and local conflicts and to \nresolve controversial issues by peaceful means.\n21.\tIt may seem strange that in this context \nI should also mention Europe. In the past, we \nused to talk about Europe as a region of peace \nand tranquility. However, events that have \noccurred in recent years \u2014the decision by NATO to \nstation 572 medium-range nuclear missiles in \nWestern Europe, the American refusal to ratify \nthe SALT II agreement, the Western plan for a \nvastly accelerated arms build-up and the \ninadmissible Western interference in the events \nin Poland\u2014have increased tension in our continent \nto a significant degree. We hope that the ongoing \nSoviet- American talks will ultimately yield \nresults that will foster peaceful co-operation \namong the European countries.\n22.\tThe extremely tense situation in the \nMiddle East that has evolved in recent months has \ncreated profound concern. That region has for \nmany years been the source of one of the world's \nmost tragic crises. The Government of the \nHungarian People's Republic and public opinion in \nour country most vehemently condemn the \naggressive expansionist policies of Israel and \nits barbaric war against the Lebanese and \nPal\u00acestinian Arab peoples which, together with \nthe imperialist maneuvers designed to achieve a \ntotal domination over the Middle East, has \ncreated a serious threat to peace and security \nfor the peoples in that region and for the entire \nworld. We express our sympathy for the victims of \nthe terrible tragedy that has occurred in \nLebanon, and we continue to support the just \nstruggle of the Arab peoples. Our people learned \nof the bloody massacre in Beirut with indigna\u00action \nand we vehemently condemn that evil deed. The \nUnited Nations should take decisive measures to \nrestrain Israel, which has consistently \ndisregarded Security Council and General Assembly \nresolutions and which regularly violates the \nelementary norms of international law.\n23.\tThe aggression against Lebanon is a new \nand premonitory proof of the fact that the policy \nof separate dealings and the blatant use of \nmilitary force cannot lead to any real settlement \nof the Middle East crisis but, on the contrary, \nwill lead to an exacerbation of the situation in \nthat region. The Hungarian Govern\u00acment will \ncontinue to advocate a comprehensive and just \nsettlement of the Middle East crisis and the \nestablishment of lasting peace in the region. It \nfirmly believes that in order to achieve this it \nis urgent that there be a complete and \nunconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from \nthe Arab territories that have been occupied \nsince 1967, as well as from Lebanon; that there \nbe a guarantee of the inalienable rights of the \nPalestinian Arab people, including their right to \ncreate an independent Palestinian State; and that \nthere be international guarantees for the \nsecurity and inde\u00acpendent existence of all States \nin the region. It supports the idea of convening \nan international conference with the \nparticipation of all parties concerned, including \nthe Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], in \norder to promote a comprehensive and just \nsettlement. The six-point proposal of the Soviet \nUnion that was put forward by the General \nSecretary of the Communist Party and Chairman of \nthe Presidiums of the Supreme Soviet, Leonid \nBrezhnev , meets all those requirements, and we \ntherefore believe it to be acceptable for the \nresolution of the problem.\n24.\tThe development of the international \nsituation has been adversely affected by the \nbaleful influence of circles seeking to maintain \nand to worsen tension and which continue \nartificially to support the inclusion of the \nso-called Afghan and Kampuchean questions OH the \nagenda. With regard to Afghanistan, my \nGovern\u00acment continues to maintain its firm \nposition that the key question is a cessation of \nthe interference by the forces of international \nreactionary forces in the internal affairs of \nthat country. We support the pro\u00acposals of the \nGovernment of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union \ndesigned to bring about a political solu\u00action of \nthe situation prevailing around Afghanistan. We \nhave followed with interest the activities of the \nPersonal Representative of the Secretary-General. \nWe hope that the States directly concerned will \nfind a way to resolve the problem by talks, which \nmust include recognition of the legitimate \nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of \nAfghanistan as well as guarantees for the \nsecurity of that country.\n25.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's \nRepublic, as is well known, feels solidarity with \nthe countries of Indo-China. It welcomes and \nsupports the proposals of the Ministers for \nForeign Affairs of the three Indo-Chinese \ncountries dated July 1982, which show that those \ncountries are seeking peace and dialogue on \nsubstantive matters, as well as friendship and \nco-operation with their neighbors. The attempts \nbeing made through the vestiges of the former \nregime, which formed the so-called coalition \ngovernment, to undermine the legal order of the \nPeople's Republic of Kampuchea are doomed to \nfailure. We are convinced that recognition of the \nexisting political realities is the only right \nway to guarantee peace and stability in that \nregion.\n26.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's \nRepublic supports the proposal of the Government \nof the Mongolian People's Republic for the \nconvening of an international conference of the \nAsian and Pacific countries to discuss questions \nrelating to the conclusion of a convention on the \nnon-use of force and mutual non- aggression. \nAmong the factors hindering an improve\u00acment in \nthe international situation we should mention the \nproblems created by the Korean question, which \nhas remained unsettled for so long. My Government \ncontinues to support the just struggle of the \nDemo\u00accratic People's Republic of Korea and the \ncause of a peaceful and democratic unification of \nthe two parts of the country free from outside \ninterference. My Government regards as of \nparticular importance the restitution of the \nterritorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus \nand its Government's policy of non- alignment. It \nsupports a peaceful solution to the ques\u00action of \nCyprus through negotiations that would serve the \ninterests of both communities in that State in \naccordance with the relevant United Nations \nresolu\u00actions, and it supports efforts undertaken \nin that direction.\n27.\tAt this session of the General Assembly, \nmany speakers will undoubtedly express their just \nconcern about the fact that with a view to \nsecuring their interests imperialism and neo \ncolonialism are in\u00accreasing their pressure on the \ndeveloping countries and the non-aligned \nmovement, and that they are trying to frustrate \nthe success of the national liberation movement. \nIn this forum, I should like to reaffirm the \nsupport of the Government of the Hungarian \nPeople's Republic for the struggle of peoples for \nsocial progress, national independence aid \nself-determination and our opposition to colonial \noppression and neb- colonialist aspirations. We \nare decisively opposed to racial discrimination \nand condemn the policy of apartheid?\n28.\tWe feel that the United Nations must \nadopt more decisive and effective measures than \nit has done so far to eliminate once and for all \nthe vestiges of colonialism in order to guarantee \nthe rights of all peoples to self-determination.\n29.\tThe South Atlantic armed conflict which \ntook place in recent months with regard to the \nFalkland (Malvinas) Islands also has shown how \nmany complex and far-reaching international \nproblems can be created by the vestiges of the \ncolonial system and what a serious threat they \ncan constitute for peace. We consider that that \nproblem too should be resolved through \nnegotiation.\n30.\tNotwithstanding the derisions of the \nUnited Nations and all efforts made thus far by \nthe progressive forces in the world, the South \nAfrican racist regime continues to occupy \nNamibia. The situation which has emerged in \nsouthern Africa poses a serious threat to \ninternational peace and security. That is why one \nof the most urgent tasks is to resolve the fate \nof Namibia, to guarantee the independence of that \ncountry. My Government supports the just struggle \nof the Namibian people which it has been waging, \nunder the leader\u00acship of the South West Africa \nPeople's Organization [SWAPO], its sole \nlegitimate representative, against the South \nAfrican occupiers to win genuine indepen\u00acdence \nfor the country. Hungary rejects the Western \nmaneuvers, the aim of which is to maintain \nforeign domination, both political and economic, \nand to pre\u00acserve the influence of the South \nAfrican racist Govern\u00acment. We favor the \nimplementation of the United Nations plan. The \nbasis for a negotiated settlement can only be \nSecurity Council resolution 433 (1978), which \nshould be implemented without any change or \ndistortion.\n31.\tNowadays we often receive news about \npres\u00acsures and threats aimed against Cuba., \nNicaragua, Grenada and other Latin American \ncountries, about the heroic struggle of the \npatriots of El Salvador and of actions against \nthe dictatorial regimes in many coun\u00actries of \nLatin America. We believe that in this region of \nthe world, too, we should respect the right of \npeoples to self-determination.\n32.\tWe believe that the non-aligned movement \nis an important, positive factor in international \nlife. We were concerned that recently imperialist \nmachinations to shatter the movement have been \nstepped up. We believe that the non-aligned \ncountries can maintain and strengthen the \nanti-imperialist unity of their movement in this \nsituation too, and can remain true to their \nwell-tested principles.\n33.\tMy country is very concerned about the \nun\u00achampered development of mutually advantageous \ninternational economic, trade and financial \nrelations. I must note with regret that the \ntension in the inter-national situation has long \nhad an unfavorable influence onall fields of \ninternational economic, trade, financial and \nscientific and technological co\u00acoperation. We \ndecisively reject the policy of economic \nsanctions against the socialist countries, the \npolicies of embargo, boycott and discrimination. \nSuch policies have not been successful in the \npast, and at the present time no one will be able \nto move the socialist countries away from the \npath of building a new society and promoting \nprogress. Such attempts can only lead to a \nworsening of the international atmosphere. All \nthis not only has an unfavorable impact in \nrelations between East and West, but does damage \nto the interests of the developing world and \nfurther delays the establishment of a new, just \ninter\u00acnational economic order, based on \ndemocratic prin\u00acciples.\n34.\tMy Government believes that the \ndifficulties in international economic \nco-operation should be eliminated and that \ncountries of the world, both large and small, \nshould equally, without any discrimination, enjoy \nthe mutual advantages which result from the \ninternational division of labour.\n35.\tDespite the more tense international \nsituation and the unfavorable political processes \ntaking place in the world, we believe that the \npossibilities of peace\u00acful development have not \nyet been exhausted. This view is imposed by \ncommon sense and by the interests of the peoples \nof the world. We are convinced that joint actions \nby all the political elements and serial forces \ndesirous of maintaining peaceful international \nrelations and co-operation among States can, in \nthe final analysis, overcome the determination to \nseek confrontation To bring about that end my \ncountry is prepared to join with all countries \nwho are conducting a sober, responsible policy. \nIt is in that spirit that our delegation will act \nat this session of the General Assembly.\n\n"

        "file_text": "  Your election, Sir, to the presidency of the \nthirty-seventh session of the General Assembly is \na tribute to your outstanding qualities as a \ndiplomat and recognition of your vast experience. \nIt is also a guarantee that the work of this \nAssembly will be conducted effectively and with \nwisdom. Please allow me to congratulate you most \nwarmly. On this occasion, I should like also to \nexpress my warmest wishes to the outgoing \nPresident, Mr. Ismat Kittani. He has earned the \ngratitude of this Assembly for the exemplary way \nin which he guided its work, for his constructive \ninitiatives and for enhancing the prestige of his \nhigh office. It also gives me particular pleasure \nto congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier \nPerez de Cuellar. In this first year of his term \nin office he has carried out his mission with \ndedication and unusual skill, thereby justly \nwinning for himself great trust and high esteem.\n173.\tThe President of the Council of Ministers \nof the European Community, Mr. Ellemann-Jensen, \nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark, has \npresented to the Assembly, at the 8th meeting, \nthe views of the 10 members of the Community on \nthe main international problems. I should like \nto state here, however, that the foreign policy \nof the Greek Government is basically guided by \nabsolute respect for the principle of the non-use \nof force in international relations. \nConsequently, we attach great importance to the \npromotion of detente and disarmament as well as \nof international co-operation. We also support in \nthe strongest possible terms any effort towards \nenhancing respect for human rights all over the \nworld. At this point, I should like to analyze in \ndetail the position of my Government on problems \nwhich are of particular interest to Greece.\n174.\tIn the first place, there is the problem \nof the Middle East. Apart from its major \ninternational importance, it is of special \ninterest to Greece, not only because of our \ngeographical proximity to the region where the \ncrisis is evolving, but also because of the \ntraditional bonds which link us to the Arab \nworld. This explains the many initiatives taken \nby my Government in the past few months, within \nthe European Community as well as other \ninternational forums, with a view to promoting \nthe Palestinian cause and restoring peace in \nLebanon.\n175.\tThe opening of the thirty-seventh session \nof the General Assembly has been marked by an \nappalling crime\u00f3the massacre of hundreds of \ninnocent Palestinians in the camps of Beirut. \nThe precise circumstances of this cold-blooded \nslaughter will not be known until an appropriate \ninquiry into the matter is conducted.. However, \nit is an undisputed fact that the massacre \noccurred in an area under the firm control of the \nIsraeli army. Therefore, Israel cannot escape the \nblame for what has happened.\n176.\tMy Government has repeatedly condemned in \nthe strongest terms the Israeli invasion in \nLebanon. When the special United States envoy, \nMr. Habib, managed to arrange a peaceful lifting \nof the siege of west Beirut, we felt hopeful that \nevents in the Middle East might take a \nconstructive turn. Our optimism was short-lived, \nsince in the aftermath of the assassination of \nthe President-elect of Lebanon the Israeli \nforces, violating the Habib agreement, invaded \nwest Beirut, throwing the door open to the \nappalling massacre of Palestinian civilians that \nfollowed. My country was quick to request the \nSecurity Council to take adequate and effective \nmeasures to safeguard the civilian population in \nLebanon.\n177.\tHowever, there are still a few \nencouraging signs. I am referring to the Reagan \nplan, which could be considered as the first step \nof a process which might lead to a solution to \nthe Palestinian problem. I should also like to \nstress in this context the proposals of the \nTwelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez, which were \nannounced a little later. I emphasize the fact \nthat the Arab countries which participated in the \nConference were unanimous in putting forward a \nseries of constructive proposals aimed at a \ncomprehensive solution which would be \nsatisfactory for the Palestinians.\n178.\tThis is a time for action, not only by \nthe parties to the conflict but also by the \ninternational community as a whole. The position \nof the PLO should be enhanced to enable it to \nplay a more meaningful part in the peace process \nif we do not wish to see the strong feelings of \nfrustration and despair of the Palestinians after \ntheir recent experiences in Lebanon find their \nexpression in a new wave of international \nviolence. In this connection we think that along \nwith the recognition of the right of \nself-determination of the Palestinian people, \nincluding the right to establish their own \nindependent State, the PLO should be recognized \nas their representative, with the right of full \nparticipation in the peace negotiations. In \nstating this we think that Israel's right of \nexistence should be affirmed beyond any doubt, \ntogether with its right to live in peace along \nwith the other States of the area within \nrecognized and secure boundaries. Israel should \nrealize that it will achieve its security not \nthrough the use of force but only through \ndialogue and nego-tiations.\nRecent events have proved that stability in \nLebanon has a direct bearing upon the search Mr a \npeaceful settlement of the Middle East question. \nFor that reason, as well as for the sake of \nsolidarity with Lebanon, the population of which \nhas suffered so cruelly, we must encourage all \nsteps leading to a stable Lebanon through the \nreturn of normality in that country and the \nrestoration of the authority of the Lebanese \nGovernment over the whole of its territory. It is \nin that spirit that we greet the election of a \nnew President and earnestly hope that this \ndevelopment will mark the beginning of a new era \nin that country.\n180. The problem of Cyprus is of paramount \nimportance to the Greek Government, both because \nof the well-known links between the peoples of \nGreece and Cyprus and because Greece is one of \nthe guarantors of the sovereignty, independence \nand territorial integrity of the Republic of \nCyprus under the terms of the 1960 Treaties.\n181.\tThe main components of this problem could \nbe summarized as follows: More than 36 per cent \nof the territory of the Republic of Cyprus is \noccupied by Turkish troops. Consequently, the \nGovernment of the Republic of Cyprus is unable to \nexercise its sovereign rights over the whole \nterritory of the Republic. Thousands of Greek \nCypriots have been displaced and live as \nrefugees in their own country. On the other hand, \nthe Turkish Cypriot minority expresses deep \nconcern over its own security. Similarly, the \nGreek Cypriots are deeply concerned over their \nown security because of the permanent threat \nwhich materialized in a dramatic manner through \nthe Turkish invasion and subsequent occupation of \nthe island. Moreover, we cannot overlook the \ndetermining factor of the Cyprus problem, namely, \nthat 80 per cent of the population of the \nRepublic of Cyprus are Greek Cypriots whereas \nonly 18 per cent are Turkish Cypriots. Although \neight years have already elapsed since the 1974 \ninvasion, the intercommunal talks, which have \nbeen going on ever since under the auspices of \nthe Secretary-General, have failed to produce any \nresults.\n182.\tFaced with those realities and with such \nan ominous deadlock, the Prime Minister of \nGreece, Mr. Andreas Papandreou, made a \nconstructive proposal a few months ago the \nsubstance of which is the withdrawal of all \nforeign troops from the territory of the Republic \nof Cyprus and the expansion of the United Nations \npeace-keeping forces, in an effort to allay the \nfears that the Turkish minority might otherwise \nfeel for its security. In this regard the Greek \nPrime Minister specified that Greece is prepared \nto make a substantial financial contribution in \norder to meet the additional expenses that such \nan expanded peace keeping force would require. \nOnce the foreign troops are withdrawn and an \nexpanded United Nations force is in place, the \nconditions will be set for truly constructive \ntalks to start between the two communities with a \nview to achieving a just solution to the Cyprus \nproblem acceptable to all. The final goalis the \nsafeguarding of the independence, territorial \nintegrity, unity and non- aligned character of \nCyprus, in accordance with the relevant \nresolutions of the Assembly.\n183.\tThe Middle East and Cyprus problems are \nnot the only ones which have resulted from the \nresort to force in contravention of the \nprinciples and obligations of the Charter. Other \nmajor international crises are also the result of \nthe illegal use of force which has led to the \ncontinuing occupation of the territory of other \ncountries, notwithstanding the repeated unanimous \ncondemnations of the Assembly and its calls to \nput an end to such occupation, as in the case of \nKampuchea and Afghanistan. Greece has \nconsistently and firmly condemned all acts of \ninvasion and foreign occupation, regardless of \nwho the aggressor is.\n184.\tWhat I have just said does not mean that \nwe do not sympathize with the struggle of peoples \nwhich have been denied their fundamental right to \nself- determination. It is in this context that \nmy Government lends its moral support to national \nliberation movements. I wish at this point to \nexpress more particularly the concern of the \nGreek Government at the situation in Central \nAmerica and more specifically in El Salvador and \nNicaragua and at the threat of regionalization of \nthe conflict in El Salvador. Greece calls for a \nnegotiated political settlement in El Salvador \nand expresses its firm belief that the Frente de \nLiberacion Nacional Farabundo Marti and the \nFrente Democratico Revolucionario should be \nincluded in such a settlement as representative \npolitical forces.\n185.\tIn the same spirit, we condemn in the \nstrongest terms the continued illegal occupation \nof Namibia by South Africa, express our firm \nsupport for the efforts of the Western countries \nwhich make up the contact group and urge them to \ndo whatever they can to enable Security Council \nresolution 435 (1978) to be implemented without \nany further delay. It is encouraging that these \nefforts have recently led to encouraging progress \nand that as a result the independence of Namibia \nhas come much closer than it has ever been before.\n186.\tThe Secretary-General submitted to the \nAssembly his courageous, comprehensive and fore- \nsighted report on the work of the Organization. \nHe refers, in no uncertain terms to the decline \nof the Organization, and I fully share his \nassessment. I feel compelled at this juncture to \nexpress the profound disappointment of my country \nat the fact that the United Nations has failed to \ncontribute to the maintenance of peace and to \nprotect the sovereignty of Member States. I am \nafraid that I am stating the obvious when I say \nthat if this trend continues the Organization, \nwhich was created to fulfill the hopes and \nexpectations of mankind, which had been \ndevastated by the Second World War, will be \ntransformed into a decorative international \nbureaucracy. This is not the moment for me to \ndeal with the causes of the crisis. However, all \nagree that the responsibility of the great Powers \nfor the decline of the Organization is not small; \nnor is that of many States which demonstrate \ntheir contempt for the fundamental principles of \nthe United Nations.\n187.\tGreece, a traditionally peace-loving \ncountry, has followed with genuine interest \nrecent developments concerning disarmament, and \nparticularly the proceedings of the special \nsession of the General Assembly devoted to \ndisarmament which was convened a few months ago. \nUnfortunately, despite the fact that nobody \ndenied the urgent need for disarmament, the \nspecial session did not produce the results for \nwhich we all hoped. Nevertheless, it should not \nbe forgotten that it demonstrated the \ndetermination of all peoples to live in peace, \nwithout the scourge of war. All Governments, and \nespecially those of the super powers, should \nunderstand the real meaning of this message and \nincrease their efforts. Practical steps should be \ntaken urgently to promote detente and \ncooperation among States and to open the way for \nthe adoption of effective measures of arms \ncontrol and disarmament. The efforts should be \ndirected to both nuclear andconventional \ndisarmament. It is essential to remember that the \nformer cannot be achieved satisfactorily unless \nit is coupled with disarmament in conventional \nweapons and other weapon;, of mass destruction.\n188.\tIn this spirit we welcome the \nnegotiations which are currently going on in \nGeneva between the United States of America and \nthe Soviet Union. We earnestly hope that they \nwill result in positive developments. For our \npart, we are opposed as a matter of principle to \nthe division of the world into antagonistic \nblocs. It is an integral part of our long-term \npolicy to overcome this division. In this \nconnection we express our appreciation to the \nnon-aligned movement for its role in furthering \nthe cause of peace. We cannot but congratulate \nits members on their decision to keep away from \nthe military blocs.\n189.\tPeace would not be complete, however, if \nit were not accompanied by respect for human \nrights and by the development of economic \nco-operation between countries. Democratic \nGreece, because of its age-old cultural and \nnational traditions, is strongly and unshakably \ncommitted to respect fbr human rights. Nobody has \never been persecuted in Greece because of race, \nreligion or creed. It is with deep regret, \ntherefore, that we note that in several \ncountries people are being tortured, disappear \nwithout leaving a trace or are deprived of their \nfundamental rights. Furthermore, some countries, \non the pretext of resisting interference in \ntheir internal affairs, refuse to co-operate with \nthe appropriate international organs for the \ncontrol of human rights violations. Greece \ncondemns any form of racial discrimination, in \nparticular the policy of apartheid pursued by the \nSouth African Government notwithstanding the \npersistent demands of the international \ncommunity that it be ended immediately.\n190.\tThe adverse economic situation prevailing \nthroughout the world has caused a serious setback \nas regards North-South issues. The recessionary \ntendencies in the developed market economies, \nwhich are far from being resolved, preclude any \nimmediate relief for the developing countries, \nwhose already weak and vulnerable economies \nshould be propelled forward at an acceptable \npace. The North-South dialogue appears to be \nmoribund. Immobility and stalemate have become \nthe norm.\n191.\tThus, it is all the more to be hoped that \nat this session the Assembly will finally bring \nabout the agreement on the launching of the \nglobal negotiations that has eluded us for so \nlong. The meetings of Cancun in October 1981 and \nVersailles in June 1982 represent serious \nattempts to give impetus to the global \nnegotiations. Endeavors in that direction must \ncontinue within the United Nations and should be \nthe responsibility of all Member States. The \ndeveloped world in particular must assume its \nappropriate share of that responsibility. My \nGovernment will lend its support to any effort to \nthat end. It is more than obvious that failing to \nnarrow the gap between the rich and the poor \nnations will only increase political instability \nand endanger peace all over the world.\n192.\tThe United Nations Conference on New and \nRenewable Sources of Energy, held at Nairobi, \nrepresents a global challenge in trying to find \nnew ways for increased utilization of such \nsources of energy. The meeting of the Interim \nCommittee, which was held in June in Rome, has \ncreated a positive climate for the continuation \nof the consultations regarding the implementation \nof the Nairobi Programme of Action.?\n193.\tA strong and more vibrant United Nations \nshould carefully examine possible solutions to \nthe multitude of economic problems facing the \nworld today, and the Organization needs to be put \nto more practical use.\n194.\tIt would be an omission if I did not \nrefer to the Third United Nations Conference on \nthe Law of the Sea. Greece, being a maritime \nnation, welcomes the conclusion of the work of \nthe Conference. We consider this an important \ndevelopment, which will, we hope, greatly \ncontribute to the solution of existing \ndifferences between countries and strengthen \ninternational co-operation. We urge all States \nto sign and ratify the United Nations Convention \non the Law of the Sea?\n195.\tIn the course of this statement I have \nexpressed the disappointment of my country over \nthe poor per-formance of the United Nations, and \nparticularly its failure to discharge its major \nmission\u00f3namely, to help maintain world peace and \nprotect the sovereignty of its Member States. \nHowever, I feel compelled also to express the \nwarm wish that the United Nations shall gradually \novercome its weaknesses, so that it manages to \nfulfill the mission entrusted to it by mankind. \nDespite its many shortcomings, the Organization \nremains\u00f3should remain\u00f3a great hope of \npeace-loving people the world over. In this \ncontext I assure the Secretary-General that he \nwill have the earnest support of my Government in \nhis noble endeavor to restore the prestige and \neffectiveness of the Organization.\n"

Venezuela wishes to praise the frankness \nand direct style reflected in the report and at \nthe same time to confirm our absolute adherence \n6o the Charter and our hope that the political \nwill of nations will be expressed without \nreticence in favour of collective action for \npeace and security, as stated in that document.\nIf, as the Secretary-General states in the \nreport, we are \\\"perilously near to a new \ninternational anarchy\\\", that is largely due to \nthe constitutional role of the international \norganizations, which has led and leads to \nconflicts between national aims and the goals of \nthe Organization, as is pointed out in the report.\nResort to confrontation, violence and war in the \npursuit of national interests has not \ninfrequently been encouraged by the historical \npractices of powerful States and the growing \nscepticism regarding the results of measures \ntaken by multilateral organizations whose actions \ntowards peace are halted by the very States which \nenjoy privileges within the United Nations.\nWe believe that the tragic conflict In the South \nAtlantic would not have led to such bloodshed if \nthere had been multilateral action towards peace \nand timely attention to the just claims of \npeoples which had suffered from the unpunished \naggression of the empires that were all-powerful \nin an international order which no longer exists \ntoday.\nThe States with the greatest relative power in a \nworld living in conditions of a balance of fear \nand the constant risk of a nuclear war can hardly \nexpect to consolidate their privileges by \nconsidering overall relations among peoples in \nterms of their own specific interests. These \nprivileges in many cases were acquired at the \nexpense of the dignity and the resources of the \nweaker people. As long as justice and respect for \nthe nations which represent two thirds of all \nmankind are not reflected in resolute action by \nUnited Nations organs constant disappointment \nwill merely foster a phase of absolute cynicism \nin international relations,.\nThe consequences of colonialism and \nneo-colonialism have been devastating for peace. \nVenezuela maintains that the continent of Latin \nAmerica should be a reserve of peace. We share \nthe feeling of all the fraternal people of our \nhemisphere that the elimination of the colonial \nstrongholds which still exist in our hemisphere \nbrooks no delay. There is no valid argument for \nany European nation to retain territories, \nauthority or troops in America.\nIn order \\\"to reinforce the protective and \npre-emptive ring of collective security\\\", as the \nSecretary- General urges in his report, we, the \nMember States without hegemonistic ambitions, \nwould like the United Nations machinery to be \nrespected and imposed upon ail States equally, \nfor disappointment regarding he effectiveness of \nthe Organization and the lack of hope of any \nfuture improvement are caused by the belief that \nthe powerful accept mechanisms and deci\u00acsions \nonly when it suits them, and that when it does \nnot they create obstacles to them or ignore them.\nSerious consideration of practical ways for the \nUnited Nations to develop its capabilities and to \nbe used as a positive institution in the \npromotion of the free and peaceful progress of \nmankind in our time forms part of the \nSecretary-General's plan of action. Venezuela \nconsiders that his report contains coura\u00acgeous \nideas and is prepared to respond constructively \nwithin the possibilities open to it.\nMy country wishes to point out that the ability \nto use properly the means available today to the \nOrganization to tackle the grave problems which \nmankind faces depends decisively on the States \nwhich have the privilege of being permanent \nmembers of the Security Council.\nWe are convinced that the Assembly will adopt \nsensible and just resolutions on the Malvinas, \nthe Middle East, apart/ten/ and Namibia, \nratifying and strengthening previous resolutions \non those delicate subjects, to mention only some \nof the more striking matters referred to in the \nSecretary-General's report.\nIf hope and confidence in the United Nations are \nto be restored, ways must be found to make those \nresolutions effective, with the full support of \nthe international community, ways which will make \nit possible to overcome the obstacles which \nselfishness and injustice are undoubtedly raising \nin order to prejudice the harmonious coexistence \nof peoples.\nThe statement made by the President of Venezuela, \nMr. Herrera Campins, at the thirty-sixth session \nof the General Assembly had as its motto \\\"Faith \nin the United Nations and hope for peace. At \nthat time he affirmed that \\\"This is an \nOrganization of peace-loving countries'. In that \nspirit it was created, and in that spirit it \nshould continue. That is the spirit that imbues \nVenezuela's foreign policy in all situa\u00actions.\\\"\nVenezuela is attending this most important yearly \nexercise of the United Nations at a time when the \nOrganization's reputation and effectiveness have \nbeen shattered. International crises succeed one \nanother and continue. One of the problems which \ncauses most concern is the situation in the \nMiddle East, which has been exacerbated by recent \nevents in Lebanon. We are following closely the \ntragic events there, realizing that we live in a \nworld in which important and far- reaching events \ncannot be viewed as isolated facts. Violence in \nall its forms is rampant in the region. What has \nhappened in Lebanon has shown the extreme cruelty \nto which some will resort\nMass crimes have become a new practice in the \nface of which the international community has \nfound itself unable to act. Today the world is \nthe victim of an evil game which threatens to \nbring it to catastrophe and chaos, in the absence \nof effective machinery to enable all States to \nlive together harmoniously.\nVenezuela considers that at this session, more \nthan any other, because no other session has been \nheld in the shadow of such painful and complex \ncircum\u00acstances, the General Assembly must make an \neffective contribution and find a valid solution \nwhich will put an end to war and map out as soon \nas possible the road leading to peace. The \nescalation of acts of retaliation seems to be \nuncontrollable, encouraging and increasing the \nuse of violence.\nAs Mr. Herrera Campins said in his speech at the \nthirty-sixth session with regard to the Middle \nEast, \\\"peace cannot be achieved nor kept until \nthere is a global solution to the conflict \naccepted by all the parties involved and until \nthe legitimate rights of both the Palestinian and \nIsraeli peoples to live in peace and freedom are \nrecognized\\\" [%?/<?., para. PR].\nIn its international conduct, Venezuela has \nconsistently followed a policy of decolonization. \nThis attitude is demonstrated by its constant \nsupport for the innumerable resolutions that have \nbeen submitted on the subject. Puerto Rico has \nbeen a special concern of Venezuelans ever since \nthe beginning of the struggle for the \nemancipation of Latin America led by our \nLiberator Simon Bolivar. Venezuelans share, with \na deep-rooted feeling, his ideal that Puerto Rico \nshould be a member of the Latin American family. \nWe recog\u00acnize the existence of democratic \nfreedoms in that sister island, and we expect \nthat its sovereign future will be an expression \nof its people's legitimate right to \nself-determination.\nThe Government of Venezuela recently took a step \nof great significance in the Held of \ndecolonization when it recognized the Democratic \nArab Sahraoui Republic as a sovereign and \nindependent State, one closely linked to Hispanic \nculture.\nVenezuela has formally applied for full \nmember\u00acship in the movement of non-aligned \ncountries. Venezuela shares the fundamental \nprinciples and objectives which brought that \nmovement into being and recognizes it as a forum \nin which the majority of the countries of the \nworld are represented, thus constituting a force \nto promote peaceful coexistence, economic and \nsocial development and the political independence \nof its member States.\nThe twelfth special session of the General \nAs\u00acsembly, which was held at United Nations \nHead\u00acquarters this year, ended in virtual failure \nbecause of the Assembly's inability to adopt the \ncomprehensive programme for disarmament. The \nresults of the special session should serve as a \nlesson for States, particularly nuclear-weapon \nStates, which bear the greatest responsibility in \nthis field, and they must redouble their efforts \nin the cause of disarmament and see to it that \nthose efforts are reflected in concrete action in \nthe Committee concerned.\nVenezuela is persevering in its policy of \nco\u00acoperation with the countries of Central \nAmerica and the Caribbean. Accordingly, the \nprogrammes derived from the San Jose Agreement \nremain fully in force. Our commitment to the \ninstitutionalization of freedom and democracy in \nthe area has been maintained without interruption \nand with absolute clarity, as has our rejection \nof interference by bloc politics.\nWe support the effort of the Government of El \nSalvador, which bore fruit with the exemplary \ncivic testimony of the elections held on 28 \nMarch. The people of El Salvador went to the \nballot boxes in numbers unprecedented in their \nhistory, bearing witness to their desire for \npeace and their repudiation of violence. \nVenezuela welcomes the happy out\u00accome of the \ndemocratic process in Honduras and expresses its \nhope that complete normalization will soon become \na reality in Guatemala and in Panama.\nWe reaffirm our unswerving determination to \nco\u00acoperate in the strengthening of peace, \nfreedom, justice and a pluralist democracy in an \narea in turmoil where nothing that happens is \nalien to us. In this respect, the President of \nVenezuela, the only head of State invited to \nattend the celebrations marking the third \nanniversary of the Nicaraguan revolution, \nrecalled on that occasion the international \ncommit\u00acment to respect pluralism that the leaders \nof that country had entered into.\nThe efforts of Venezuela and Mexico with regard \nto the tension between Honduras and Nicaragua are \nbeing made in the context of a striving for \npeace, freedom and democracy within Latin \nAmerican channels without recourse to foreign \naction.\nVenezuela, like many other developing coun\u00actries, \nviews with profound concern the persistent \ndeterioration and swift decay of the \ninternational economic situation. Nobody is \nunaware of the extreme gravity of those \ndevelopments and their inevitable social and \npolitical consequences, which are the most \nserious threats to stability, progress and peace \nin the world. It is noteworthy that the most \nrecent analyses of the world economy by \ninternational organizations shows such agreement. \nFrom a broader and universal perspective, the \nUnited Nations itself in the 1981\u00ac1982 economic \nsurvey, when referring to the wide\u00acspread \nstand-still in the world economic expansion, \nstated that this \\\"slow-down affected all major \nregions and groups of countries, independent of \ntheir level of development or economic structure. \nThe decel\u00aceration was particularly intense in the \ndeveloping countries\\\".'\nTaking a similar view, the report by the UNCTAD \nsecretariat categorically affirms that \\\"the \ndeveloping world is facing the gravest economic \ncrisis since the Great Depression,\\\" and that \n\\\"this is the product of the malfunctioning of the \neconomies of developed market-economy countries, \nand has been intensified by the growing disarray \nin the trade and financing systems\\\".\nFor their part, organizations and specialized \nagencies such as GATT and IMF confirm those \nevalua\u00actions. The symptoms of this situation can \nbe summarized by the following indicators: low \ngrowth rates in production, the collapse of \nprices for commodities, the contraction of \ninternational trade, the revival of protectionism \nand counter trade practices, monetary and \nexchange instability, extensive and sudden \nfluctua\u00actions in the balances of payments, \nextraordinarily high levels of indebtedness and \nsoaring debt- servicing costs, a pull-back in \nproductive investments and a flare-up of \nfinancial speculation, alarming and rising \nunemployment rates, lowering of expenditures for \nsocial purposes, growing military costs and an \nacceleration of the arms race by the great Powers.\nThe situation I have just described is the result \nof contradictory and mistaken economic policies, \nas well as of the disorganization and \nmalfunctioning of the world economy in its three \nbasic aspects, commercial, financial and \nmonetary. The increasingly blatant absence of \nrules and growing arbitrariness make forecasting \nimpossible and thus sustain widespread unrest.\nThus, we see how the developed countries, instead \nof strongly encouraging the development of \nexports by the developing countries by just \nremunera\u00action for their commodities, which in the \nlong run would have led to a healthy expansion of \ninterna\u00actional trade for the benefit of all, have \npreferred to finance the imports of the third \nworld on scandalously exorbitant terms. The \neffects of those actions are striking: after a \nphase of expansion of international trade, which \nwas artificially and pathologically sustained, in \nlarge measure, by the rising indebtedness of the \nthird world, the burden of the corresponding \nfinancial charges is now being turned against the \nindustrialized countries themselves as a result \nof the drastic curtailment of the import capacity \nof the developing countries, which virtually \neliminates them as factors promoting \ninternational trade.\nThe total debt of the developing countries will \nbe far in excess of the incredible amount of$6P0 \nbillion by the end of 1982. This debt imposes \nintolerable burdens on the foreign exchange \nearnings of the developing countries and makes \nthem increasingly insolvent. In Latin America \nalone the debt will amount to $280 billion by the \nend of this year. The amortiza\u00action of this debt \nrepresents the equivalent of 56 per cent of Latin \nAmerican exports. This situation, which in the \ncontext of traditional conditions is now to be \nreinforced for strategic purposes, could have \ngrave political and social consequences.\nThe situation I have described is an \nunpre\u00accedented challenge to the international \nfinancial system. The developing countries will \nhave to make constant efforts to revitalize their \neconomies, increase their productivity and \nimprove their efficiency in the management of \nfinancial resources. All this will have to be \ndone in a way that will be socially and \npolitically bearable.\nThe developed world must accept its \nresponsi\u00acbilities, not only for the sake of the \nprinciple of justice, but also in its own \ninterest. Financially, it will be necessary to \npreserve the capacity of international \norganizations which supply funds on preferential \nterms. This implies the need to review \ncontributions to IMF, the World Bank, the \nInter-American Develop\u00acment Bank and similar \ninstitutions so that their resources bear some \nrelation to the size of existing problems. There \nis one fact which cannot be ques-tioned: the \neconomies of the industrialized countries cannot \nbe sustained without the support of strong \ndevelopment in the third world.\nThe time for major decisions is drawing near and \nwe cannot afford to let slip any opportunity to \nhave our voice heard. We, the developing \ncountries, must reaffirm by our presence and \nactive participation the importance of forums \nsuch as UNCTAD and must be attentive to what \nmight happen at the next GATT ministerial meeting.\nWe have been fighting for a complete \nrestruc\u00acturing of the international economy, and \nwe have denounced the policy of making the \ndeveloping coun\u00actries bear the brunt of that \nreadjustment. All this has brought the world \neconomy to the critical situation in which it \nfinds itself today. It would be senseless to \nexpect that the steps the situation calls for \nwill be taken overnight, just as it has been \nsenseless to postpone the essential dialogue. An \natmosphere of mutual trust must be established to \ncontribute to the charting of a new course for \nthe world economy. This is a pre-condition of the \nlessening of international tension and the \nbuilding of a more rational and more humane \nworld, in which harmony, justice and peace will \nprevail.\nThe developing countries promoted the idea of \nglobal negotiations and the international \ncommunity endorsed it when resolution 34/138 was \nadopted by the Assembly in 1979, but so far the \nmomentum needed to make them a reality has been \nlacking. Despite all the efforts made\u2014not only by \nthe Group of 77 but by practically the entire \ninternational com\u00acmunity\u2014hesitation, mainly on \nthe part of the United States, has prevented the \nlaunching of global negotia\u00actions although these \nwere approved at Cancun with the agreement of the \nhead of State of that important country, without \nwhich the negotiations would lose their true \nscope and meaning.\nIn these circumstances, we, the developing \ncoun\u00actries, have been thinking about the need to \nbe less vulnerable to the dealings of the \ncountries of the North and, in any case, to \nstimulate effective co\u00acoperation among ourselves \nas a consequence of our solidarity.\nBarely a month ago the Intergovernmental \nFollow-up and Co-ordination Committee, a key \norgan which was established in 1981 in the \nCaracas Pro\u00acgramme of Action,3 held its first \nmeeting in Manila. The results of the meetings of \nexperts were reviewed there, and on that basis \nimportant recommendations were made, to be \nsubmitted shortly to the ministerial meeting of \nthe Group of 77. Without any doubt, it can be \nconcluded that the Caracas Programme of Action is \nfunctioning. It is complementary to efforts which \nmight be made in North-South negotiations and a \ncontribution to the establishment of the new \ninternational economic order.\nIn the last quarter century Venezuela has \nsucceeded in consolidating a genuine democracy \nsolidly rooted in the conduct and beliefs of the \nVenezuelan people, a democracy which endeavours \nincreasingly to play its part within a philosophy \nof social justice and respect for the freedom and \ndignity of all citizens. The promotion and \neffective defence of and respect for human rights \nhave been important tenets in the foreign policy \nof Venezuela. These form the basis of our support \nfor people that are struggling to gain, maintain \nor recover their right to freedom, as a \ncontribution to the solution of present conflicts \nwhich affect and bar the progress of mankind in \nits quest for peace and well-being for all.\nIt is of the utmost importance for Venezuela to \nseek a peaceful and practical solution to the \nterri\u00actorial controversy with the Co-operative \nRepublic of Guyana.\nVenezuela is a country in which the mixture of \nthe indigenous peoples of America with the \nSpanish conquistadors and African groups has \ncreated a population which rejects all forms of \nracial discrimi\u00acnation and in which political, \nsocial and economic democracy is practised, thus \nsetting an example of coexistence and pluralism.\nIt is fitting to recall that Venezuela in its 172 \nyears of independent life has never had a single \nwar, not even an armed encounter, with any of its \nneighbours. This is an assertion which few \ncountries in the world could make, and it is a \nsource of satisfac\u00action and pride for \nVenezuelans. The land borders of Venezuela with \nColombia and Brazil were established by peaceful \nmeans. The maritime borders with four countries \nhave already been set by common agreement, and \nVenezuela is at all times opento negotiations \nwith its neighbours to solve all matters of \ncommon interest.\nFor 16 years now Venezuela has been tirelessly \nrepeating its invitation to Guyana to negotiate, \nto seek mutually acceptable solutions to the \ndispute. The cause of the dispute is the \nmutilation of our territory by the British \nEmpire. During the last century, starting from \nthe Esequibo River, which was the boundary with \nthe sector of Guyana which they had taken away \nfrom Holland, the British advanced from year to \nyear, almost day after day, over the territory of \ndefenceless Venezuela, making a mockery of its \nprotests, until this culminated in an \nunprecedented legal farce, in which a so-called \nArbitration Tribunal, with no Venezuelan judge or \nlawyer, imposed a totally arbitrary demarcation \nline. It did not even take the trouble to give \nany kind of justification, reason or explanation, \nhowever spurious or unprecedented, of what was \nfrom every point of view an unbridled plundering.\nThe history of this humiliating mutilation cannot \nbe forgotten by Venezuelans. Our entire tradition \nand all our instincts move us to desire to \nmaintain and develop with the Guyanese people the \nclosest relations of friendship, co-operation and \nsolidarity. In truth, like ourselves, they were \nthe victims of British impe\u00acrialism and, like \nourselves, they are a people which is trying to \nachieve development. For this very reason v\\\": \nhave insisted tirelessly on holding real and \nsincere negotiations, inspired by justice and \nequity, which will lead us to overcome this \nproblem that we have inherited, in a satisfactory \nand practical way.\nThe obligation for Venezuela and Guyana to \nnegotiate their differences is not only a moral \nimper\u00acative, not only a duty under international \nlaw, but, in this specific case, a commitment \nfreely entered into in the Agreement signed at \nGeneva on 17 February 1966/ In fact, although the \nVenezuelan territorial claim naturally preceded \nthe independence of Guyana, Venezuela, faithful \nto its tradition and to its principles, was most \ncareful to do nothing which would in any way be \nused as a pretext to thwart or delay \ndecolo\u00acnization for its neighbouring people. \nShortly before the proclamation of indepen\u00acdence, \nVenezuela and the United Kingdom, with the full \nparticipation of the Government of what was then \nBritish Guiana, negotiated and signed the Geneva \nAgreement, designed to seek satisfactory \nsolutions for the practical settlement of the \ndispute. This international instrument is the \nlegal and political framework for the pursuit of \nsolutions to the dispute and Venezuela has \nadhered to it in all its actions. A is \nregrettable that thus far the Government of \nGuyana has failed to comply with its obligation \nto negotiate seriously and sincerely. \nNevertheless, Venezuela has insisted that, within \nthe peaceful procedures provided in the Geneva \nAgreement, the injustices of the past should be \ncorrected, and thus lay more solid founda\u00actions \nfor a fruitful and lasting co-operation between \nthe peoples of Venezuela and of Guyana.\nGuyanese spokesmen have for years been carrying \nout a systematic campaign to incite feelings of \nsympathy, by presenting their country as a small \nand poor nation whose territory is the object of \nthe covetousness of a rich and powerful \nneighbour, and trying to create an image of \nVenezuela as an aggressor country, indifferent to \nthe laws, to justice, and to the solidarity that \nshould exist between countries which are \nstruggling to develop. This kind of assertion, \nrepeated relentlessly, tends to produce \nprejudices among those who have not had an \nopportunity to know and analyse the facts. For \nalmost two decades international forums have been \nhearing Guyanese assertions about an imminent \naggression, and yet it is an obvious fact that \nthere has been no aggression.\nWe have explained the conduct of Venezuela from \nits birth to independent life and regarding the \ndispute that we are dealing with. There is not \nthe slightest basis for asserting that the \nVenezuelan terri\u00actorial claim is prompted by \ncoveting of present or potential riches which the \npeople of Guyana could have used to achieve \nprosperity and development. Before the \nindependence of Guyana, British companies were \nexploring for and exploiting oil on a large scale \nboth in Venezuela and in Trinidad. British \ncompanies went mining gold in Venezuela and \nbauxite in Demerara. It will be easily understood \nthat the British, before liberating their colony, \nhad thoroughly eval\u00acuated the potential oil and \nvaluable minerals of the lands that they \ncontrolled. Although prospecting has continued \nsince the date of independence, no exploitable \nmineral resource has been found on the territory \nwhich Venezuela claims.\nThe truth is crystal clear: Venezuela's claim is \nbased neither on territorial ambition nor on \ncovetous- ness of the wealth of others. Had it \nbeen so based, our claim could never have \nreceived, as it has, the unanimous support of \nVenezuelans of the most varied political \ntendencies under all democratic Governments, \nwhich, during the last five presidential terms, \nwithin a system of complete freedom of \nexpression, have defended the rights of our \ncountry. That is because this unanimity of the \nVenezuelan people has its origin in a very deep \nwound. For this reason, we fail to under\u00acstand \nthose who, representing the Guyanese people, take \nthe stand as heirs to the fruits of British \ncolonial imperialism and defenders of its \nunjustifiable abuses.\nAfter repeated rejections of our formal \ninvita\u00actions to the Government of Guyana to begin \nnegotia\u00actions which will provide a satisfactory \nand practical solution, Venezuela will submit to \nthe Secretary- General 3ts decision to indicate a \nmeans to settle the dispute; thus our conduct \nwill be in accord with the letter and the spirit \nof the international treaty signed between the \nparties, known as the Geneva Agreement, with a \nview to finding a solution to the dispute by \npeaceful means.\nVenezuela would like Guyana to participate as the \ncontinent moves towards integration. Venezuela \nwishes to have a positive relationship with its \nneigh\u00acbour. We feel certain that the people of \nGuyana share that desire. We greet all Guyanese, \nconvinced as we are that an appropriate solution \nto the differ\u00acences we have inherited from \ncolonialism will spur us on our way to \nconvergence toward progress and development. \nVenezuela wishes above all to win the battle for \npeace and brotherhood with Guyana, because we are \nneighbours and because in large measure we are \nborn of the same American history.\nOn 24 July 1983 it will be two centuries since \nthe birth of the Father of our Venezuelan nation, \nSimon Bolivar, one of the great liberators of \nAmerica. The United Nations, with appropriate \nsolemnity, commemorated in 1976 the one hundred \nand fiftieth anniversary of the convening by the \nLiberator Bolivar of the Amphictyonic Congress in \nPanama and in 1980 the one hundred and fiftieth \nanniversary of his death. My country wishes to \nexpress its gratitude in advance for the tribute \nwhich will be paid to the Liberator in this \npolitical forum of the nations of the world on \nthe occasion of the bicentenary of his birth.\nHis prophetic thinking on the need for a \nuni\u00acversal organization in which matters \nregarding the peaceful coexistence of nations \ncould be dealt with has a particular significance \nand pertinence today. Bolivar's bicentenary \nbrings all Latin America together in harmony on \nthe international scene. It demands that we make \na constructive effort to make the new hemispheric \ndialogue a shining success. It leads us to \nstrengthen our ties with all peoples, especially \nthose who have faced historical and political \nchallenges similar to those faced by us.\nVenezuela reaffirms its absolute loyalty to the \nideals of Bolivar and commits itself to pursue a \npositive policy in all its actions as regards \nboth our hemisphere and the world as a whole.\n"

His country \nattachment to peace, together with his \nstatesman-like and diplomatic qualities, as well \nas his perfect mastery of the major problems of \ninternational concern, gives us the certainty \nthat the work of this session will be conducted \nwith competence and efficiency. The delegation of \nZaire assures him its whole hearted co-operation. \nI also express our appreciation to his \npredecessor, Mr Kittani, for the competence, \ndevotion, tact and efficiency with which he \nconducted the proceedings of the thirty sixth \nsession, at a particular difficult time of \ninternational affairs. I should like in addition \nto extend once again to Mr. Perez de Cuellar the \nsincere congratulations of the President, the \nExecutive Council and the Republic of Zaire on \nhis election to the post of Secretary General, to \nassure him of our whole hearted cooperation and \nto express our best wishes for success in \ndischarge of his mandate in the ultimate interest \nof peace security and development in the world\nThe delegation of Zaire wishes to pay a special \ntribute to the Secretary-General for his report \non the work of the Organization, in which his \nlucid and striking analysis confirms the merits, \ncompetence and experience of a man eminently \naware of our common concern for international \npeace and security, progress and development \nthrough the confident cooperation of nations and \npeoples. This report is an invitation to all of \nus to renew our commitment to the letter and \nspirit of the Charter and to reaffirm our \ncommitment to the maintenance of international \npeace and security, the promotion of co-operation \nfor development, the easing or reducing of \ntension in the world, the adoption of measures to \nincrease confidence m international relations, \nrecourse to the collective security machinery \nprovided for in the Charter; in a word, the \nprinciples of international law governing \nfriendly relations and co-operation among States.\nThe Republic of Zaire, whose policy has always \nbeen guided by the goals and principles of the \nCharter, attaches the utmost significance to the \nrole of the Organization. Our struggle for the \nrecognition on our right to security, a \nprerequisite of development, and of our right to \ndevelopment and to a share in world prosperity, \nand our right to our own identity, stems from a \npeaceful vision of international relations; the \nsame vision which one can glimpse in the words of \nthe Charter and which fails well within the \nframework of the general struggle of the peoples \nof the third world for greater justice and equity \nin international relations.\nWe have never committed aggression against \nanyone, nor have we threatened to, and it is our \nfirm intention, as firm as it ever was, to pursue \na policy of peace, good-neighborliness, \nco-operation and openness to all nations of the \nworld, on the basis of mutual advantage, and with \nrespect for our sovereignty, our dignity and our \nright to a separate identity.\nAll our efforts in Zaire are focused on the \nbuilding of a democratic, peaceful, modem and \nprosperous Zairian society, open to the enriching \ncontributions of the outside world, but at the \nsame time profoundly rooted in and respectful of \nour own authentic values\nOn behalf of the President and Government of the \nRepublic of Zaire, we wish to state that we \nthreaten no one, politically, ideologically, \neconomically, or militarily, and we expect that \nour partners in the world need commitment on our \npart. The peace loving nature of our country, \nopen to friendship and internationalism, \nco-operation, derives not only from its colonial \nhistory, which was marked by suffering and \ndepredation of every kind, but also by the \nincessant struggle in different ways for national \nliberation. It also derives from our history \nafter independence, one of division and secession \nresulting from two evils \u00f3tribalization and \nservile adoption of imported ideologies\u00f3but also \none of a courageous struggle waged by the popular \nmovement of the revolution, our party of the \nrally of the masses, headed by its founder, \nMobutu Sese Seko, to regain its cultural identity.\nWe base our struggle for cultural liberation on a \npolicy of a return to our authentic values. It \ncan be defined as a critical and vigilant \napproach in which, without disregard for the \ncontributions of other cultures, we draw, above \nall, from our own rich cultural heritage whatever \nis likely to permit us to affirm our own identity \nand personality and to achieve our overall \nobjectives in the building of our country, and \nthus contributing to world civilization. We want \nto live in peace and friendship with other \nStates. We do so as a country situated in the \nheart of the African continent, which shares more \nthan 10,000 kilometers of borders with nine other \ncountries, each with its own history, and using \nas a means of expression the French, English, \nPortuguese and Arabic languages.\nThis policy of peace, friendship and co-operation \nfollowed by Zaire has been demonstrated in each \nparticular case by policies of \ngood-neighborliness, attachment to Africa, and \nrespect for the policy of non-alignment and the \nprinciples of the Charter governing relations \namong various countries.\nSpeaking of peace, what can we see about us \ntoday? At the present time, failure to respect \ncommitments, in terms of peace, decolonization, \ninternational co-operation, the interdependence \nof States, human solidarity, the rights of \npeoples and individuals, and general and complete \ndisarmament under effective international \ncontrol, are today the major sources of tension, \nconflict, war and mistrust in international \nrelations, of economic and moral crises and of \nthe failure to attain the objectives unanimously \nproclaimed in the Charter.\nIf the 1970s ended on a note of bitterness, the \nprospects for the 1980s hardly seem more \npromising. political, economic and social matters \nof major concern, which were the focus of the \ninternational community's attention, at the \nthirty-sixth session of the General Assembly and \nelsewhere, have remained, in some cases, without \nsatisfactory solutions, and in other cases \ndeadlocked.\nThere is every reason to believe that the \ninternational situation will continue to be \nmarked in the immediate future by increasing \ntension, distrust in relations between States, an \nescalation of the arms race, interference in the \ninternal affairs of other States, recourse to \nviolence, and difficulties in international \nco-operation for development, thus jeopardizing \npeace and, hence, the very survival of mankind.\nThe crisis, at once political, economic and \nsocial, which is at present unsettling the world, \nhas severely handicapped the United Nations in \nawning its objectives. This inability of the \nUnited Nations, resulting from the failure of \nStates to respect commitments freely entered \ninto, has had the effect of adding to the \ncomplexity of the problems of the world today, \nand has aroused a general feeling of insecurity.\nArticle 2 of the Charter lays down the principles \nof Jus Cogens, which has binding force and binds \nall States in the international community. \nUnfortunately, however, a number of States, in \nabusing their power, quite often shirk their \nobligation not to have recourse to force, not to \ninterfere in the internal affairs of other \nStates, and peacefully to settle their disputes, \nthus undermining the authority of the \nOrganization of which they are Members. Some go \nso far as to institutionalize methods of \nviolence, the sole goal of which is to ensure \nthat they continue to benefit from unjust and \narbitrary situations.\nSince the creation of the United Nations 37 years \nago, the question of disarmament has been the \nsubject of numerous rounds of negotiations. \nResolutions and treaties are concluded and by \nnegotiating bodies, both within and outside the \nframework of the United Nations, and proliferate. \nUnfortunately, and this must be said, none of \nthis has served to halt or turn back the arms \nrace. Quite the contrary, the arms race proceeds \napace.\nIn spite of the international instruments prohibiting nuclear-weapon testing, \nwe are daily shocked to learn of new developments \nand improvements in weapons whose destructive \ncapacity boggles the imagination. Under the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons, many States have undertaken not to \nproduce or to possess such weapons. Nevertheless, \nthe major Powers continue the nuclear arms race \nin the name of a so-called balance of power and \nthe dangerous theory of deterrence, each day \naccumulating ever- greater quantities of nuclear \nweapons and refusing to give negative guarantees \nto the nan-nuclear-weapon States.\nThanks to the facilities granted it by certain \nPowers in contravention of Security Council \nresolution 421 (1977), imposing an embargo on \narms shipments to South Africa, and in disregard \nof the OAU Declaration on the Denuclearization of \nAfrica, South Africa's possession of the atomic \nbomb, places all African States, and its \nneighboring African States in particular, in a \nsituation of total insecurity.\nIf the nuclear arms race is quite rightly a \nmatter of concern to the international community, \nthe question of conventional weapons must also be \nthe subject of our concern, because they are the \nweapons that are at present being employed \nwherever hotbeds of tension exist in the world. \nThe Republic of Zaire welcomed the adoption by \nthe United Nations on 10 October 1980 of the \nConvention on the Prohibitions or Restrictions on \nthe Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May \nBe Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have \nIndiscriminate Effects, and three Protocols \nthereto.\nHowever, to be more fruitful, subsequent \nnegotiations should examine the most crucial \naspects of the problem posed by conventional \nweapons, namely, their overproduction, their \nsophistication and their transport towards areas \nof tension. Responsibility for this state of \naffairs lies solely with the manufacturers, who \nare more concerned about the profits they earn \nfrom the arms industry than about the danger the \ndissemination of weapons poses to international \npeace and security.\nThe Final Document of the Tenth Special Session \nof the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, \naptly laid stress on the need to approach the \ngamut of disarmament problems from the standpoint \nof development, because the arms race swallows up \nconsiderable resources that could be used to \nsolve urgent economic and social problems. \nIndeed, in 1981 alone, arms expenditures amounted \nto $600 billion at a time when UNICEF, to mention \nonly that organization, was drawing attention to \nthe tragic plight of children throughout the \nworld. Only 1 per cent of that figure would have \nbeen enough to alleviate their suffering.\nThe reduction of military budgets is something \nthat falls within the context of the goal of \nhalting and reversing the arms race in order to \nfree the resources necessary for economic \ndevelopment, in particular that of the developing \ncountries. Resolutions adopted by the United \nNations to that effect have not been implemented \nbecause the international community's interest \nhas not been sufficiently aroused. This impotence \nof the international community has once again \nbeen illustrated by the failure of the second \nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted \nto disarmament, which was able only to produce a \nprogramme for the World Disarmament Campaign.\nAs the President of Zaire recalled at the recent \nconference of heads of State of France and Africa \nheld in Kinshasa, the tragic events in Lebanon \nhave highlighted the complexity of the crisis in \nthe Middle East, where the situation remains \nextremely disturbing\nThe search for a comprehensive, just and lasting \nsettlement of the Middle East conflict is on a \ndifficult road. The importance the international \ncommunity attaches to a rapid settlement of the \nMiddle East crisis emerges clearly from the \nvarious peace initiatives or proposals put \nforward over the past few years. It would appear \nthat the international community has genuinely \nbecome aware of the true gravity of the situation \nthat exists in this part of the world that is \nparticularly sensitive, regarding the maintenance \nof international peace and security.\nIn General Assembly resolution 181 (II), the \nUnited Nations assumed the historic \nresponsibility for guaranteeing the existence in \nPalestine of a Jewish State, an Arab State and a \nspecial international regime for the Holy City of \nJerusalem. The Security Council, and the five \npermanent members of the Council in particular, \nshould envisage the adoption of special measures \nto guarantee the security, stability and \nintegrity of all States in the region in order to \nusher in an era of peace, stability and harmony \nin that part of the world. The Palestinian people \nhave the same rights as do the people of Israel, \nnamely, the right to form an independent State, \nto a homeland of their own and to live in peace \nwithin secure and recognized frontiers free from \nacts of force.\nWe are convinced that the settlement of the \nMiddle East conflict requires, at the minimum, \nrespect for and implementation of the following \nprinciples: first, recognition of the right of \neach State of the region to live in peace within \nsecure and recognized frontiers; secondly, \nrespect for the territorial integrity, political \nindependence and sovereignty of each State; \nthirdly, mutual recognition among States in the \nregion; fourthly, respect for the principle of \nthe inadmissibility of the acquisition of \nterritories by force; fifthly, recognition of the \nfact that the question of Palestine lies at the \nheart of the Middle East problem and, sixthly, \nrecognition of and respect for the inalienable \nrights of the Palestinian people, including the \nright to create an independent State under the \nleadership of the PLO, the sole, legitimate \nrepresentative of the Palestinian people.\nAll these elements can be found in General \nAssembly resolutions 181 (II) and 194 (III) and \nin Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and \n338 (1973). Taken together, those four \nresolutions contain all the elements necessary \nfor a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement \nof the Middle East problem, for they are mutually \ncomplementary and provide for a global approach \nto the various aspects of this problem. It is in \nthat context, in particular, that we welcome the \nFrench-Egyptian initiative in the Security \nCouncil and the conclusions reached by the \nTwelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez. The \ninternational community and the United Nations \ncan today find in all those initiatives based on \ngood faith the elements necessary for resolving \nthe conflict.\nZaire, a member of the Security Council, has \nassociated itself with all the resolutions \nadopted by the Council since the outbreak of the \nLebanese affair and it will continue to give its \nsupport to the effective implementation of those \nresolutions in the recognized interests of \nLebanon. Zaire, whose policy is based on the \ngoals and principles of the Charter and which \nattaches great importance to the role of the \nOrganization, associated itself with the \ncondemnation of the criminal massacre of \nPalestinian civilians in the Shatila and Sabra \ncamps and demands that the rights of the civilian \npopulation be respected, without any \ndiscrimination, while at the same time it \ncensures all acts of violence against civilian \npopulations. We believe that those responsible \nfor these massacres cannot remain unpunished. As \nwas quite rightly stated by the President of the \nRepublic of Zaire in his masterly statement on 8 \nOctober 1982, no morality, no pretext of any kind \ncan possibly justify the massacre of innocent \ncivilians.\nWith regard to the problem of Namibia, the \nposition of Zaire has recently been recalled most \nclearly by the President of the Republic in the \naforementioned statement, and we venture to \nrepeat its main points in the Assembly.\nIn terms of the proposed settlement of the \nNamibian question approved by Security Council \nresolution 435 (1978), Namibia was to become \nindependent in 1978. But, five years after the \napproval of that proposal, the transfer of power \nto the people of Namibia with the assistance of \nthe United Nations has still not been carried out \nand South Africa is maintaining its illegal \noccupation and administration of this Territory, \nin defiance of the relevant resolutions of the \nUnited Nations and international public opinion.\nWhile SWAPO has repeatedly given proof of its \nconstant readiness to co-operate in the \nimplementation of the United Nations settlement \nplan, South Africa's attitude has been \ncharacterized by frequent recourse to delaying \ntactics and other maneuvers designed to impede \nthe implementation of Security Council \nresolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) and to \npostpone for as long as possible the inevitable \nindependence of Namibia.\nWe must all realize that the continuance of the \nillegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa, \ntogether with the denial of the inalienable \nrights and fundamental freedoms of the Namibian \npeople, the extension of the policy of apartheid \nto this Territory and the transformation of \nNamibian territory into a springboard for attacks \nand aggression against neighbouring independent \nAfrican States, in particular Angola, Mozambique, \nZimbabwe and Botswana, constitute a grave threat \nto peace and security in this region.\nFurthermore, the injection into the Namibian \nmatter of extraneous factors which can serve only \nto distort this problem, which is in essence \ncolonial, contains within itself the germs of a \ngrave threat to international peace and security, \nwhile at the same time removing the protagonists \neven further from the climate of tranquility and \nconfidence so necessary for a negotiated \nsettlement of the Namibian question.\nAfrica as a whole desires authentic and rapid \nindependence for Namibia. Although we are \nconvinced of the need to take into account \ncertain practical considerations, we believe that \nresolution 435 (1978) remains the only basis for \na negotiated settlement of the Namibian question \nthat will bring about authentic independence, on \nconditions acceptable to the Namibian people and \nhence to the international community.\nWe have been following with keen interest the \nconsultations among the five members of the \nWestern contact group and all parties concerned, \nand we have noted with satisfaction the \nconstructive approach of SWAPO and the front-line \nStates to the most recent proposals of the \ncontact group. South Africa must adopt a similar \napproach in its consideration of these proposals \nand respond to them without delay.\nI should like to take this opportunity to repeat \nour firm condemnation of the illegal occupation \nof Namibia by South Africa and its repeated acts \nof aggression against neighboring States, and we \nappeal for an increase in material and financial \nassistance to SWAPO in its just struggle for \nnational liberation. Aware of its \nresponsibilities towards Africa, Zaire will do \neverything within its power and its means, \ntogether with other members of the OAU and the \nUnited Nations, to help Namibia to become \nindependent in 1983.\nTo talk of Namibia is in a sense also to refer to \nthe distressing situation in which the black \npeoples of South Africa have been kept for \ndecades. To these victims of atrocious \nhumiliation, who are suffering in the middle of \nthe twentieth century, under the shameful yoke of \nthe criminal policy of\twe say that Zaire, in \nunison with all the States of the world that \ncherish peace, justice, freedom and equality, \nreaffirms its solidarity in their just struggle \nfor national liberation and the recovery of their \nrights.\nThe situation prevailing in South Africa has all \nthe characteristics of a typical colonial \nsituation, aggravated by the elevation of racism \nand racial discrimination to the government \npolicy known as apartheid, an outrageous policy \nwhich the United Nations and the whole civilized \nworld have condemned as a crime against humanity. \nIt follows from this condemnation that every \nState, every member of the international \ncommunity, is duty-bound to help to ensure the \nabolition and eradication of\nand to refrain from any action that might \ndirectly or indirectly give comfort to South \nAfrica in its pursuit of this policy and its \ndenial of the inalienable rights and fundamental \nfreedoms of the black population of South Africa.\nIt is our dearest hope to see emerge in South Africa a genuinely democratic \nsociety governed by the majority and guaranteeing \nthe rights of all the minorities without \ndistinction as to race, color, sex or religion.\nThe situation which has arisen in the extremely \nsensitive area of the Gulf with the persistence \nof the conflict between the Islamic Republic of \nIran and Iraq, two brother countries members of \nthe non-aligned movement, is particularly \ndisturbing. We can only deplore the fact that the \nefforts which have been made so far within the \nUnited Nations and the non-aligned movement, as \nwell as the Organization of the Islamic \nConference, to bring about the peaceful \nsettlement of this conflict have not proved \nsuccessful.\nWe should like to appeal once again most urgently \nto the parties to overcome their differences and \nco-operate in good faith in a search for a \nnegotiated solution in accordance with the \npurposes and principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. HO. The situation in South-West \nand South-East Asia is another matter of profound \nconcern for the whole international community. \nIndeed, at its thirty- fifth and thirty-sixth \nsessions the General Assembly adopted resolutions \nwhich in particular condemned the invasion and \noccupation of Kampuchea and Afghanistan and \ndemand the withdrawal of all foreign forces of \noccupation from those countries. Unfortunately, \nthose resolutions have not been complied with. \nDifficulties persist with regard to the \nimplementation of those resolutions and the hopes \nthat their adoption had aroused seem to have been \ndashed by the hardening of the positions of the \nparties concerned.\nIn Kampuchea the military conflict continues. The \nhuman, material and food situation of the Khmer \npeople both within the country and on its \nfrontiers has not improved.\nIn Afghanistan the foreign intervention and \noccupation is continuing. That situation is \nfraught with danger to international peace and \nsecurity.\nOnly strict respect for the relevant resolutions \nof the United Nations, particularly General \nAssembly resolutions 34/22, 35/6 and 36/5 on \nKampuchea and resolutions 35/37 and 36/34 on \nAfghanistan can bring about peace in these areas. \nWe therefore appeal urgently once again to the \nforeign occupation forces to evacuate these \ncountries and leave their peoples to determine \ntheir own destinies in freedom.\nIn the Korean peninsula there has been constant \ntension for 37 years now as a result of the \ndivision of the country by the victors in the \nSecond World War. We believe that it is for the \nKorean people alone to settle the problem by \npeaceful means through dialogue between the North \nand the South, in a climate free from any \nexternal pressure or interference, in accordance \nwith the principles of the Charter. In the \ninterests of peace and detente, the United \nNations should take new initiatives to create \nfavorable conditions for the resumption of \nnegotiations between the two Koreas.\nFaithful to its policy of non-alignment, Zaire \nhas recognized the two Koreas and maintains with \nboth excellent relations of friendship and \nco-operation. We believe that the admission to \nthe United Nations of South Korea and North \nKorea, without prejudice to subsequent \nreunification, could, as in the case of the two \nGermanies, contribute to an easing of tension in \nthat part of the world.\nWith regard to the question of Cyprus, the \nresumption of intercommunal talks appears to us \nto be the best method of bringing about a just \nand lasting settlement of the crisis afflicting \nthat country. We believe that the United Nations, \nthrough the Secretary- General, should continue \nits efforts to help the two communities to find a \nnegotiated solution to their differences and \ncreate the necessary conditions for the \nrestoration of peace.\nIn the economic field, the international \ncommunity is facing a serious crisis, a symptom \nof a profound breakdown in the structures of the \npresent international economic and monetary \norder. Indeed the present international economic \norder is widening the gap between North and South \nand seems incapable of dealing with the problems \nfacing both the developing countries and the \ndeveloped countries themselves. There are \ntendencies towards protectionism and impediments \nof all kinds to international trade. Similarly, \nthe machinery of co-operation is being distorted \nby prolonging relations of domination and \nexploitation. In this regard, the situation \ncontains the seeds of a grave threat to \ninternational peace and security, particularly \nbecause the industrialized countries are \ncontinuing to refuse to make the structural \nchanges called for by the vast majority of the \nStates of the world.\nThe various economic summit meetings of the \ncountries of the North in which the countries of \nthe South had placed so much hope have not lived \nup to their expectations; the multilateral trade \nnegotiations continue to mark time, while the \nglobal negotiations remain deadlocked.\nIn the realm of trade, the developed countries \ncontinue to be both judges and parties by \nunilaterally setting prices for primary \ncommodities, to the detriment of the third world \ncountries, for which the increasingly serious \ndecline in the terms of trade, the high rate of \ninflation, unemployment and the increase in the \nburden of foreign debt lend dramatic dimensions \nto the crisis.\nThe negotiations under way in UNCTAD, in the \nframework of the Integrated Programme for \ncommodities, have made no progress. Of the 18 \nproducts on the Nairobi indicative list only \ncoffee, cocoa, tin, natural rubber and sugar have \nbeen the subject of agreement. The Common Fund \nfor Commodities which should in particular \ncontribute to the financing of measures for \ncommodity development so as to improve market \nstructures and strengthen competitiveness and the \nlong-term prospects for these products, has not \nyet been put into effect.\nWe hope that the wealthy countries will \ndemonstrate a greater measure of political will \nso that the sixth session of UNCTAD, which will \nbe held in June 1983 in Belgrade, can produce \nbetter results than the fifth session.\nIn the industrial field, the objectives pursued \nsince the Second General Conference of UNIDO in \nLima in 1975 are far from having been attained. \nWe hope that everything possible will be done to \nensure the success of the Fourth General \nConference of UNIDO, which will be held in Kenya, \nand we appeal once again for a spirit of sincere \nco-operation on the part of the industrialized \ncountries.\nThe Vienna Programme of Action on Science and \nTechnology for Development, adopted in August \n1979,s has so far not even begun to be \nimplemented and no agreement has been reached on \nits financing. The same applies to an \ninternational code of conduct for the transfer of \ntechnology negotiated within the framework of \nUNCTAD. I should like to stress the role and the \nimportance which the third world countries \nattribute to this question of the transfer of \ntechnology as a catalyst for development, whether \nit be within the framework of the International \nDevelopment Strategy for the Third United Nations \nDevelopment Decade in the more general framework \nof the establishment of a new international \neconomic order.\nIt is appropriate here to make an urgent appeal \nto all Member States to embrace a new ethic of \ninternational solidarity, without which no \nprogress is possible. At a time of \ninterdependence, we believe it essential that \ninternational development aid, technical and \nfinancial assistance and all other forms of \ninternational co-operation be derived from this \nnew ethic and be based upon the principles of \ncomplementarity and mutual advantage. Indeed to \nbe effective the organizing of development aid \nand technical and financial assistance must take \ninto account the mutual interests of the parties \nas well as the specific realities and the dignity \nof the recipients.\nIf there is one thing on the credit side of the \nbalance sheet for this year, it is undoubtedly \nthe adoption on 30 April of the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea. We must, \nhowever, deplore the fact that it was adopted by \na vote and not by consensus and that some States \nhave not felt that they could undertake to sign \nit. This Convention represents a victory for \nreason and it is an important step towards bringing \nabout the new international economic order.\nThe results achieved after such difficult \nnegotiations have certainly not satisfied all \ndelegations\u00f3my own included\u00f3but nevertheless they \nconstitute a basis which will allow for some \nimprovement in the course of the work of the \nPreparatory Commission for the International \nSea-Bed Authority and for the International \nTribunal for the Law of the Sea.\nThere remain a certain number of problems, \nparticularly for the developing countries that \nare land producers of the same mineral resources \nas those found in the sea-bed and ocean floor, \nand the Republic of Zaire has already, from this \nvery rostrum, drawn the attention of the United \nNations Conference on the Law of the Sea to the \nharm that may be done to land producers, \nincluding ourselves, as a result of uncontrolled \nexploitation of the resources of the seabed and \nthe ocean floor and any disruption of the \nstructure of international markets which may \nfollow.\nThat is the international environment in which \neconomic relations between States are evolving at \npresent. All projection studies indicate that \nthis international environment will continue to \nbe marked by an increase in protectionism on the \npart of the industrialized countries, their \nadherence to an outmoded and anachronistic \ninternational economic order and the erosion of \nmultilateral co-operation, leaving the way clear \nfor politically and ideologically inspired \nbilateralism.\nIn the view of my delegation, the time has come \nfor the international community to take specific \nmeasures to ensure the launching of global \nnegotiations under the auspices of the United \nNations, which is the only appropriate framework \nfor a global, coherent and integrated approach, \nin conformity with General Assembly resolution \n34/138 and the Charter of Economic Rights and \nDuties of States.\nIn parallel with these actions, the developing \ncountries should continue and strengthen their \nefforts to promote fruitful and mutually \nadvantageous cooperation. We cannot repeat too \noften that that should be considered a \nfundamental requirement for the establishment of \nthe new international economic order. It must \nmake it possible for us to constitute a force, \nnot against the North, but to strengthen our own \nposition as equal and full partners in \ninternational economic relations.\nIt is in this context that we call upon the \ninternational community to support the Caracas \nProgramme of Action^ and the Lagos Plan of \nAction, the purpose of which is to put into \neffect a strategy of collective autonomy.\nAnother question which continues to concern the \ninternational community is that of hunger in the \nworld. My delegation believes that to build a \nworld system of effective food security, rather \nthan confine ourselves to emergency assistance, \nthe international community should over the long \nterm focus its efforts on increasing agricultural \nproduction.\nI turn now to the questions of the draft World \nCharter for Nature, which is before us for \nadoption at this session, and Zaire's particular \nproblems in transport, transit and access to \ninternational markets.\nIt will be recalled that in its resolution 35/7 \non the draft World Charter for Nature, the \nGeneral Assembly invited Member States to conduct \ntheir activities in recognition of the supreme \nimportance of protecting natural systems, \nmaintaining the balance and quality of nature, in \nthe interests of present and future generations. \nLast year, at the thirty-sixth session, the \nSecretary-General presented to the General \nAssembly the revised draft World Charter, which \ntook account of all the observations made by the \nvast majority of Member States. Following the \nadoption of the Nairobi Declaration, which \nrecognized the fragility of the environment, I \nshould like to express the sincere hope that the \nfinal version of the draft World Charter will be \nadopted by consensus.\nWith regard to Zaire's problems in the matter of \ntransport, transit and access to international \nmarkets, I remind the Assembly that because of \nits geographical situation Zaire was placed in \nthe category of semi-land-locked countries by \nUNCTAD resolution 110 (V), adopted at Manila in \n1979.\\\" That resolution called for studies to be \ncarried out with a view to helping countries in \nthat category overcome their difficulties. \nFollowing that, the General Assembly adopted \nresolutions 34/193, 35/59 and 36/139 in 1979, \n1980 and 1981, and the Economic and Social \nCouncil adopted its resolution 1981/68 in July \n1981. The Republic of Zaire hopes that at the \ncurrent session the Assembly will consider \nconcrete measures to accelerate the \nimplementation of those resolutions, on the basis \nof the Secretary-General's report.\nThat is the substance of what Zaire wishes to say \nat this session, which, as I have already said, \nis being held at a particularly difficult time in \nthe evolution of international relations. At the \npolitical level, the arms race and the many areas \nof tension in the world threaten international \npeace and security. In the field of economics, \nthe developed countries, the beneficiaries of an \nanachronistic international economic cadre, \ncontinue to resist the legitimate claims of two \nthirds of mankind, while recession, inflation, \nrising unemployment, the constant deterioration \nin the terms of trade, imbalances in the balance \nof payments and external debts are exacerbating \nthe economic difficulties of the third world.\nIn spite of these negative findings and the \ngloomy prospects, the Republic of Zaire reaffirms \nits unshakable faith in the ideals of the United \nNations and proclaims its devotion to the \nprinciples and purposes of the Charter, for, as \nPresident Mobutu Sese Seko said from this very \nrostrum at the twenty-eighth session of the \nAssembly, on 4 October 1973:\n\\\"... thanks to the UN and through it, we shall be \nable to do more to promote co-operation among the \ninhabitants of our planet in the economic, \ncultural, scientific and technical fields, for \nthe building of a better, fairer and more just \nworld, in absolute respect for the authenticity \nof everyone.\\\"\n\n"

        "file_text": "  Sir, it gives me particular pleasure to extend to you the heartfelt \ncongratulations and best wishes for success on your election to the \nlofty post of President of the thirty-seventh session of the General \nAssembly.\n44.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to express the \nRomanian Government's appreciation for the activities engaged in by \nthe Secretary-General and to assure him of our Ml support in the \ndischarge of the mandate of great responsibility entrusted to him.\n45.\tThe General Assembly at this session is called upon to take \nup particularly serious problems and questions of vital importance \nfor the cause of peace and international co-operation and the \nindependence and progress of all peoples.\t,\n46.\tInternational life is charged with extreme tension. Conflicts \nare raging in various parts of the world. We see an intensification \nof the imperialist policy of domination, of spheres of influence and \nof violation of the sacred right of nations to freedom and \nsovereignty. The arms race, in particular the nuclear arms race, is \nbeing pursued at an unprecedented rate and there is an increased risk \nof seeing a nuclear war break out, thereby imperilling the very \nexistence of human civilization. The world economic crisis has been \nexacerbated and the gap between the developed and developing \ncountries is widening. That gap between rich and poor countries is \never more acute and wider in scope, thus increasingly becoming the \nfundamental contradiction of our times.\n47.\tOn the other hand, there is in international life the growing \nwill of peoples to put an end to the imperialist policies of force \nand diktat, to put an end to the arms race and to proceed to \ndisarmament, primarily, nuclear disarmament. Never before have the \naspirations of millions throughout the world to lead a life of \ndignity, freedom and independence and to co-operate in peace and \ngoodwill been so obvious and achieved such scope. Never before have \nthe protests of world public opinion been so vigorously raised \nagainst the arms race, against acts of aggression and interference, \nagainst inequity and inequality between States and, in particular, \nagainst war, which is the most abnormal way of dealing with \ninternational disputes. This awareness of the peoples, their refusal \npassively to accept a foreign policy doing great damage to their \ninterests and eagerness with which they demand their right to life, \nfreedom, peace and progress constitute a remarkable positive factor, \na source of optimism and hope that a better future will dawn and that \nthere will be a more equitable and reasonable world.\n48.\tThe solution, in the interests of peoples, of all problems \nconstituting a heavy burden in international life which have caused \nserious tension in inter-state relations requires that all \nGovernments and peoples unite their forces and co-operate more \nclosely to halt the dangerous course of events in order to resolve, \nby political means, situations of war and tension and resume and \nstrengthen the policy of detente, co-operation, independence and \npeace.\n49.\tThe highest duty of conscience for all heads of State and \nGovernment, for politicians of all persuasions, is to identify with \nthe vital aspirations of their own peoples and of mankind as a whole, \nto devote their energies to serving them, to become faithful and \nactive interpreters of the peaceful ideals of mankind, to prove \nthemselves dynamic activists for the attainment of those ideals. That \nis the highest reason that should guide the statesman and politician \nin their task. It is also their chance to stamp their personalities \non the destiny of our age, to go down in the history of these \ntumultuous times as shining examples of humanism and progress.\nIn the spirit of those major requirements of the contemporary world, \nRomania and President Nicolae Ceaugescu himself are persevering to \nimprove the international climate, to resolve by political means, in \nthe interests of all peoples, the enormous problems confronting \nmankind, seeking to establish relations between States on the basis \nof new, democratic, equitable principles. The frequent meetings and \ntalks by the head of our State with the leaders of other countries \nand politicans of all persuasions, and Romania's whole foreign \npolicy, are constantly aimed at achieving better co-operation and \nunderstanding among States, at combining the efforts of all nations \nto eliminate force completely from relations among States, and at \ndefending the freedom and independence of peoples and the fundamental \nright of and nations to live in peace in a world of co-operation and \nunderstanding, free from weapons and wars.\n33. The course of events has clearly shown that the outdated policy \nof the use of force and the threat of force, of domination and \ndiktat, of \\\"might is right', is the cause of phenomena which have led \nto and now maintain the present state of tension in the world, as \nmanifested in various aspects of international affairs. Resort to \nforce is the origin of hotbeds of tension and conflict, of all \nactions which disregard the legitimate rights of other peoples and \nthe independence and sovereignty of States. It is one of the main \nreasons for confrontation and armed conflict and for the \nintensification of the arms race, and one of the main obstacles in \nthe way of economic and social progress and the establishment of a \nnew international economic order.\n54.\tResolving the major problems of mankind, ending existing \nconflicts and preventing new ones, therefore demands firm action to \neliminate from international life the use of force or the threat of \nforce, and the establishment of a new system of inter-State \nrelations. Any strategy for tackling the problems of today, for \nstriving to establish peace and bring about a new international \npolitical and economic order, must be based on the requirement that \nthe use or threat of force must be completely renounced.\n55.\tThe complete rejection of the policy of force for the \nsolution of international problems is deeply rooted in the traditions \nof the Romanian people. The great Romanian diplomat Nicolae \nTitulescu, Foreign Minister of Romania between the two world wars, \nwhose centenary is being celebrated in many countries this year, \nsaid: \\\"War is never, absolutely never, the solution to a conflict.\\\" \nThat conviction led him to urge that the \\\"force of law\\\" replace the \n\\\"law of force\\\".\n56.\tToday more than ever the use of force is a double- edged \nweapon. Apart from the human losses and material damage that it \ncauses, as well as the opprobrium of world opinion and the vigour \nwith which peoples unite in solidarity with the victims of acts of \naggression, the very results of the acts of force turn against those \nwho have perpetrated them. It is true that no people will any longer \nallow itself to be oppressed and that the brutal external policies of \na State and the violation of the norms of international law and of \nthe Charter of the United Nations in the end redound against the \nnation concerned. Therefore, the saying that a people that oppress \nother peoples can never be free is still valid, always and in all \ncircumstances.\n57.\tToday, in a period of profound revolutionary transformation, \nof broad changes and the reshaping of relationships on a world scale, \nof the establishment of a new balance between States and groups of \nStates, the new system of international relations must be based on \nthe principles of equality, of respect for national independence and \nsovereignty, non-interference in the internal affairs of other \npeoples, and the settlement of all international problems and \ndisputes by exclusively peaceful means. We firmly believe that there \nare no problems, however complicated, which cannot be resolved by \npeaceful means, by negotiation, if the starting-point is respect for \nthe right of each people to develop in full freedom and independence \nand in accordance with the general interests of world peace and \nsecurity. The Romanian Government also advocates, and acts resolutely \nin favour of, the settlement of all disputes and states of tension \nand conflict between States solely by political means, through \nnegotiation; the total elimination of the policy of force and \ninterference, and efforts by the States concerned to stifle a \nconflict as soon as it emerges in order to avoid new military \nconfrontations likely to increase the dangers to world peace and \nsecurity. As President Ceausescu recently emphasized, no matter how \ndifficult and hard the negotiations, those are the means, and no \nothers, that must be used to solve problems, completely renouncing \nmilitary solutions and acts of force, which always bring about loss \nof human life and material damage, causing heavy losses and great \nsuffering to peoples.\n58.\tThe talent and genius of statesmen in this field should be \nproved at the negotiating table, in the subtle and rational analysis \nof ways to eliminate conflict and promote understanding among \nnations, in seeking mutually acceptable solutions; there should be \ncompromise between the parties, elimination of factors that provoke \nconfrontation, and the safeguarding of understanding, friendship and \nco-operation between peoples. That was, is and always will be the \ngreat vocation of the real politicians who are destined to go down in \nhistory. Negotiations are preferable to even the smallest military \nconflict, and we must therefore everywhere and in all circumstances \nfollow the normal path of starting negotiations with a view to \npreventing military actions, not begin peace talks after force has \nalready been used, after blood has already been shed and after \nserious human and material losses have already been caused.\n59.\tAt this period so crucial for the fate of mankind, and for \npeace, the United Nations should carry out the task entrusted to it \nby the Charter and make good use of the possibilities open to it in \nterms of its purposes and principles and its universal character. It \nshould support with its full authority the independence and \nsovereignty of States and the right of each people to decide its own \ndestiny, as a central pillar for building new international \nrelationships in which the non-use of force or threat of force should \nbecome an effective rule in international life.\n60.\tIn the light of these considerations, we believe that we must \nact without further delay, and as resolutely as possible, to resolve \nall conflicts between States by political means, through \nnegotiations, in order to prevent new disputes and military \nconfrontations.\nThe grave situation in the Middle East, in particular that resulting \nfrom the aggressive actions of Israel against Lebanon and the \nPalestinian population in that country, is a cause of the utmost \nconcern. The Romanian Government has strongly condemned the military \ninvasion of Lebanon by Israel, and in particular the atrocities \ncommitted against the civilian population in the refugee camps of \nwest Beirut, following the occupation of that part of the city by \nIsraeli troops. We are strongly in favour of the prompt withdrawal of \nIsraeli troops from Lebanon, of the guaranteeing of that country's \nindependence and national sovereignty, and its unity and territorial \nintegrity, and of a broad-based reconciliation of all political \nforces in Lebanon, in order to permit the reconstruction of the \ncountry and to bring about peace and tranquillity.\n61.\tIt is now imperative that we step up political and diplomatic \nefforts to bring about a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement \nof the situation. in that area, on the basis of the withdrawal of \nIsrael from the Arab territories occupied as a result of the 1967 \nwar; the solution of the problem of the Palestinian people through \nthe recognition of its right to self- determination, including the \nestablishment of its own independent State; and the guaranteeing of \nthe integrity, independence and sovereignty of all the States of the \narea. In view of its conviction that the settlement of the \nPalestinian problem is the key to peace in the Middle East, Romania \nconsiders that a Palestinian State must be created alongside the \nindependent Israeli State, and that everything must be done to ensure \nthe peaceful coexistence of those two States and of all the countries \nof the region, each of them enjoying appropriate guarantees of its \nsecurity and independence.\n62.\tRomania and its President believe that it would be necessary \nand useful to convene an international conference under United \nNations auspices and with the participation of all interested States \nand parties, including the PLO as the legitimate representative of \nthe Palestinian people, as well as other States which could make a \npositive contribution to the establishment of peace in that region, \nincluding a contribution to the solution of the Palestinian problem.\n63.\tA series of proposals has recently been made for the \nresolution of the conflicts in the Middle East. These contain new \nelements and positive approaches and set forth a basis for the \nintensification of political and diplomatic activity in order to \nachieve a comprehensive, just and lasting solution of the situation \nin that region.\n64.\tRomania, which maintains relations of friendship and \nco-operation with both Iran and Iraq, considers that it is necessary \nto put and end to the fighting between those two neighbouring \ncountries, which has already caused great losses of human life and of \nproperty for both parties, and that their troops must be withdrawn to \nthe international boundaries which existed before the outbreak of the \nwar. It is necessary to move on to a political solution of the \nproblems between the two countries.\n65.\tI take this opportunity also to reaffirm Romania's solidarity \nwith and active support for the position and initiatives taken by the \nPeople's Democratic Republic of Korea aimed at the peaceful and \nindependent unification of Korea.\n66.\tWhile working for the elimination of existing conflicts, it \nis necessary to act resolutely and to adopt measures to forestall the \nappearance of new conflicts States must renounce all acts of force \nand settle all their disputes by peaceful means; the United Nations \nmust make a greater contribution in this field. In this connection we \nhave followed with interest, and we support, the Secretary-General's \nefforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations in the \nmaintenance of international peace and security, which is an \nobjective of vital interest for all States.\n67.\tAt this session the General Assembly is to take a decision on \na draft declaration on the peaceful settlement of international \ndisputes, which has been negotiated over the last three years. We \nbelieve that the adoption of that text by consensus would constitute \nan important concrete step towards strengthening the ability of the \nUnited Nations to make an effective contribution to the prevention of \nconflicts and to the peaceful settlement of disputes among nations.\n68.\tRomania considers that, in order to prevent the appearance of \nnew military confrontations and to find viable solutions to existing \nconflicts, it is necessary to create in the United Nations framework \na special body for good offices, mediation and conciliation, which \nwould act closely with the Security Council to organize talks and to \nresolve differences among States, exclusively by peaceful means.\n69.\tRomania's initiative regarding the strengthening of \ngood-neighbourliness between States is aimed at the same goal of \nconsolidating international peace and security by stimulating the \ndevelopment of relations of co-operation and understanding between \nneighbouring States. We hope that the consideration at this session \nof the Secretary-General's report on ways of strengthening \ngood-neighbourliness will constitute a step forward towards the \nattainment of this important goal.\n71. Three months ago it was my honour, on instructions from President \nCeausescu and on the basis of the mandate handed down by the Grand \nNational Assembly, to stand at this rostrum, at the 22nd meeting of \nthe twelfth special session, and set forth Romania's position and \nproposals regarding disarmament problems.\n72.\tThat second special session of the General Assembly devoted \nto disarmament highlighted the demand of the world's peoples to put \nan end to the arms race and to proceed to specific disarmament \nmeasures. Halting the arms race and moving towards disarmament\u00f3in the \nfirst place, nuclear disarmament\u00f3are the central problem facing \nmankind. The very existence of life on our planet, and of a \ncivilization which has been built up over thousands of years, is \nthreatened. Never before has the burden of the arms race weighed so \nheavily on the shoulders of all peoples, on the economies of all \nStates, including the most powerful and highly developed; never \nbefore has the impact of the incredible military expenditures on \neconomic development been so sorely felt.\n73.\tWeaponry is a tragic and absurd waste of the resources of our \nplane and of the work of mankind, a terrible factor in the \nimpoverishment of peoples, and an obstacle on the path of \ncivilization, at the very time when two thirds of mankind can barely \nsubsist. Nuclear catastrophe has become a world-wide obsession, a \nsource of terror for all, and has left its gloomy imprint on future \ngenerations. It is high time for all men of conscience throughout the \nworld to unite to put an end to this anomaly, this absurdity.\nAlthough at that special session the representatives of States came \nof strongly against the danger looming over mankind, the Assembly was \nunable to adopt decisions leading to concrete measures for \ndisarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, on the basis of a \ncomprehensive programme. We consider that especially important \nproposals were put forward during the special session and that those \nproposals should be taken into consideration to identify common \nelements which could form the basis for the elaboration of the \ncomprehensive programme of disarmament and which should be taken up \nby the working bodies on disarmament.\n73. Romania is expressing the unanimous will of the Romanian people, \nwhich has taken and continues to take broad action for disarmament \nand peace, by continuing to struggle for the achievement of the vital \naspiration of mankind to live in a world free from weapons and free \nfrom war. At the special session, my Government for its part put \nforward a set of specific proposals on disarmament, the stronger for \nbeing subscribed to by 18 million of its citizens.\n76.\tWe believe that the highest priority must be given to nuclear \ndisarmament and, first and foremost, to halting the manufacture of \nnuclear weapons and to moving forward to the gradual reduction of \nexisting stockpiles to the point of their total elimination, and to \nbanning completely all nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction. That process should begin with the significant reduction \nof nuclear weapons by the two great Powers, for example a 30 per cent \nreduction in an initial phase, as a step towards the total \nelimination of nuclear weapons.\n77.\tin order to halt the arms race, Romania has proposed a freeze \non military expenditures at 1982 levels, and their subsequent \nreduction by 40 to 13 per cent by 1983. A portion of the funds thus \nreleased would be used to support the efforts of developing \ncountries, the remainder being devoted to the economic and social \ndevelopment of the countries which have made those reductions. \nRomania intends to act in that direction at the present session, to \nencourage efforts towards the freeze and reduction of military \nexpenditures and towards the enunciation of principles which could \ngovern the activities of States in this field.\n78.\tAlso of particular importance for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security would be the adoption of effective \nmeasures for the substantial reduction of conventional weapons and \nfor building confidence among States. Romania is in favour of the \nestablishment of a common agreement on the part of the two blocs and, \nin general, between the two sides, on as low a ceiling as possible \nfor the principal weapons: aeroplanes, tanks, warships, missiles, \nheavy guns, and so forth.\n79.\tThe implementation of a set of measures for halting the arms \nrace and proceeding to disarmament should be carried out in \nconditions of reciprocal trust and equal security for all countries, \nthrough the achievement of a military balance at levels as low as \npossible and under suitable international control.\n80.\tTo this end, we are in favour of the creation within the context \nof the United Nations of an international body having the right to \ninspect and monitor the implementation of agreed disarmament \nmeasures. To make real progress towards disarmament it is necessary \nto do everything to dismantle opposing military blocs.\n81.\tGiven the particularly serious situation in Europe, we are \nresolutely in favour of a halt in the stationing of new medium-range \nmissiles in Europe. We favour the withdrawal and destruction of \nmissiles already installed and the elimination from the continent of \nall nuclear weapons. In this spirit Romania welcomed the negotiations \nbetween the Soviet Union and the United States of America on \nmedium-range nuclear missiles as well as those on strategic weapons \nand expressed the hope that those negotiations would yield positive \nresults. Since the problem of medium- range missiles is of direct \nconcern to all European nations, we expressed the opinion that in one \nway or another all States of the continent must participate in the \nGeneva negotiations. The bringing about of urgent agreements on these \nquestions is of vital importance for all States, since missing this \ncrucial opportunity would mean the opening up of a new long phase of \nmilitary competition, with incalculable consequences for Europe as a \nwhole and indeed for all mankind.\n82.\tAs a European country Romania is constantly endeavouring to \nbring about security and co-operation on the continent so that when \nit resumes its work the Madrid session of the Conference can proceed \nfruitfully and constructively and agree on the convening of a \nconference on confidence-building and disarmament in Europe and thus \ncontribute to the full implementation of the provisions of the Final \nAct of Helsinki and ensure continuity in the proceedings of the \nConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.\n83.\tAs part and parcel of its policy of peace, security and \ndisarmament in Europe, Romania is striving for the comprehensive \ndevelopment of relations among the States of the Balkans so as to \ntransform that region into a zone of friendship, co-operation, \ngood-neighbourliness and peaceful coexistence and a \nnuclear-weapon-free zone.\n84.\tBy its very structure and functions, and because it is a \nforum for all States, the United Nations must play a particularly \nimportant role in an authentic disarmament process. In view of the \nprimary responsibility of the United Nations for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security its role and its contribution to \ndisarmament must be strengthened by bringing about, under its \nauspices negotiations and the adoption and monitoring of disarmament \nmeasures.\nThe extensive demonstrations for peace and disarmament that have \ntaken place recently, and which continue to take place in a number of \ncountries, including Romania, eloquently prove the strength of \npeoples and their ability to bring about, by acting in increasing \nunity, the transition to effective measures of disarmament that would \nstave off the nuclear danger. We believe that these movements must \nenjoy full support, including support from the United Nations, \nbecause in the present circumstances the role of the peoples of the \nworld as a whole is really decisive in the bringing about of \ndisarmament, in guaranteeing the national peace and independence of \nall States. In this regard a particular role and responsibility \ndevolve on scientists, who know better than anyone the destructive \ncapacity of modem weapons and the catastrophic consequences of a \nnuclear war. Through United Nations studies and research on \ndisarmament, and conferences, symposiums and seminars organized with \nthe broad participation of non-governmental organizations and the \nmass media, and with the help of scientists representing world public \nopinion, the United Nations can make a signal contribution to \nensuring effective support for the struggle for disarmament.\n85.\tBroad dissemination, within the framework of the World \nDisarmament Campaign, of the latest report of the Secretary-General \nentitled economic and social consequences of the arms race of \nmilitary expenditures will help to emphasize the extremely harmful \nconsequences of the increasing stockpiling of weapons for the \neconomic and social life of all peoples and for world peace and \nsecurity.\n86.\tStill within the framework of the World Disarmament Campaign, \nRomania recently hosted at Mamaia an important meeting of \nrepresentatives of public opinion with the participation of \nrepresentatives of non-governmental organizations from the majority \nof European countries, the United States and Canada. They had a \nconstructive and fruitful exchange of views on specific ways to halt \nthe arms race and to bring about disarmament. In the same spirit, \nRomania proposed the convening of a world conference on the role of \nthe mass media\u00f3radio, television, the press\u00f3in promoting a climate of \nunderstanding, confidence and co-operation that could contribute to \npeace and disarmament.\n87.\tThe present division of the world into rich and poor \ncountries, a result of the long policy of imperialist and colonialist \ndomination, and the persistence of unjust and inequitable economic \nrelations among States have engendered grave economic anomalies and \ntension in international life and have reduced, sometimes to nothing, \nthe results of efforts at the economic and social level made by \ndeveloping countries, worsening the economic gap between the \ndeveloped countries and the developing countries. Unfortunately, the \nconferences and meetings that have taken place in recent years on the \nnew international economic order have yielded virtually no result. \nUrgent actions are necessary to bring about the adoption, through \ninternational negotiations of effective measures to speed up the \neconomic and social progress of the developing countries, to \nrevitalize economic activity at the world level and to bring about \nnew relations among States on justice and equity and mutually \nadvantageous economic trade through ensuring that the developing \ncountries have broad access to modem technology.\n88.\tIn this regard Romania believes that it is particularly \nimportant to embark on global negotiations without delay within the \nframework of a United Nations conference to examine and resolve basic \nproblems concerning international economic cooperation. This is \nespecially important and necessary since the world economy is now on \na particularly dangerous slope.\n89.\tThe arms race and the economic policies followed by certain \ndeveloped countries, far from opening up prospects for the overcoming \nof crisis phenomena and instability, which are proliferating, merely \naggravate the situation, with extremely negative consequences for the \ndeveloping countries. The recession in the capitalist developed \ncountries, the high cost of energy, the excessive interest rates, the \nprotectionist policies\nand the drop in the price of raw material, coupled with increased \nprices for manufactured goods, have created obstacles in \ninternational economic relations and severely damaged the developing \ncountries, thwarting their efforts to develop their human and \nmaterial resources.\n90.\tGiven the growing interdependence that characterizes the \nworld economy there is a real danger of being plunged into a crisis \nof devastating proportions. In one way or another, all the peoples of \nthe world are affected by the world economic crisis. All nations are \npaying for the upheavals which have taken place in the world, and the \neffects of the continual slide of the economy are unforeseeable. It \nis in the interest of all States, irrespective of size, social system \nor degree of development, to act together in joint efforts to \neliminate factors that artificially heighten the crisis, to find \nreasonable solutions to economic conflicts and contradictions, to \nbring about new and equitable relations among States so that the new \ninternational economic order may be established.\n91.\tThis present session of the General Assembly must also be \navailed of to launch comprehensive negotiations, and the sixth \nsession of UNCTAD must be used to translate into reality the \nprogrammes of action adopted under the auspices of the United Nations \nand in general to produce a radical change inthe state of affairs \nthat characterizes the world economy. Proceeding to disarmament is a \nmajor imperative in the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity, and the establishment on a new basis of economic relations \namong States is just as vital in the safeguarding of the prospects \nfor progress of all the peoples of the world.\n92.\tIn recent years we have witnessed the intensification of the \ndeveloped countries' practice of recruiting qualified personnel from \nthe developing countries. The exodus of skilled people to the \ndeveloped countries, which in fact represents an important transfer \nof human resources, only perpetuates and aggravates the imbalances \nand difficulties in the economies of the developing countries, with \ngrave economic and social implications. Since it deprives these \ncountries of an important part of their skilled labour force\u00f3an \nessential factor in economic growth, for the training of which those \ncountries made great efforts, expending important material and \nfinancial resources\u00f3such an exodus of skilled people acts as a brake \non economic and social development and thus contributes to widening \nfurther the gap between the developed and the developing countries. \nThat is why Romania considers it necessary that the United Nations \nassume a greater role in extending international co-operation aimed \nat stopping this practice, encouraging the return to their countries \nof origin of qualified personnel settled in developed countries, \ncompensating the developing countries for the expenses they have \nincurred and assisting the developing countries in training and \nretaining qualified personnel in accordance with the requirements of \ntheir national economies.\nIn present circumstances, we believe that we must expand and \nintensify efforts staunchly to defend the supreme fundamental right \nof peoples and nations to life, peace and a free and independent \nexistence. This right should be more forcefully and more Clearly \nreflectea in the debates and documents of the General Assembly. \nPriority attention should be given to the solution of problems as \nimportant to the human condition as the guarantee of the right to \nwork for all members of society, the effective exercise of the right \nto education and the assurance of living conditions which permit the \nfull flowering of the human personality.\n93.\tRomania, the Romanian people, affirm their active solidarity \nwith the Namibian people in their struggle under the leadership of \nthe South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] to accede to \ncomplete national independence, and act consistently to ensure the \nelimination of the policy of\tand racial discrimination in South \nAfrica, condemning acts of aggression committed by that country \nagainst neighbouring States. We must most resolutely combat the \nactivities and ideologies which foster hatred and violence, while \ntaking every care to protect the younger generations from their \nbaleful influence.\n94.\tThe problems facing youth will be thoroughly examined by the \nGeneral Assembly in the framework of the preparations for \nInternational Youth Year, which will be celebrated id 1985 under the \nmotto \\\"Participation, Development, Peace\\\". At its second session, the \nAdvisory Committee for International Youth Year made substantive \nrecommendations concerning the implementation of the Specific \nProgramme of Measures and Activities to be undertaken prior to and \nduring that Year. It is our view that activities undertaken during \nInternational Youth Year should be directed at strengthening \ninternational co-operation in the solution of the specific problems \nwhich are today of concern to the younger generations. We attach \ngreat importance to the proposal to draft a declaration on the rights \nand responsibilities of youth.\n95.\tAn important role will also be played by the Organization in \n1983 in five regional meetings devoted to youth, including a meeting \nthat the Romanian Government has offered to host in Romania. We \nbelieve that all these meetings will provide opportunities thoroughly \nto consider the specific problems of the younger generations on all \ncontinentsand will make a valuable contribution to the preparation \nfor and successful celebration of International Youth Year. The \nRomanian delegation, aware of the ever greater interest of States in \nproblems relating to youth, expresses its conviction that the General \nAssembly will approve all the recommendations drawn up by the \nAdvisory Committee for International Youth Year at its second session.\n96.\tIf the complex problems confronting mankind today are to be \nsolved it is more than ever necessary to strengthen the role that the \nUnited Nations is called upon to play in the maintenance and \nconsolidation of peace and security, the promotion of international \nlaw in relations between States and the democratization of \ninternational life.\n97.\tIn the view of Romania and of President Ceausescu, the United \nNations can and must play a more active role in resolving the major \nproblems of the contemporary world in the interest of the peoples. It \nmust act resolutely to establish relations between States on new and \ndemocratic bases which guarantee the participation in conditions of \nequality of all\nStates, irrespective of their system, size or potential, in solving \nthe problems confronting mankind. It is particularly necessary to \nensure conditions that will enable small and medium-sized countries, \nthe developing countries and the non-aligned countries to play an \nincreasingly active role in the debate on and the settlement of all \nproblems arising in relations between States. We must not forget that \nthe balance of power has changed radically, that a diversification of \nthe centres of power has occurred, that the so-called third-world \ncountries represent the great majority of the world's population and \nthat, consequently, they must have an important voice in all world \npolicies, in the consideration of controversial issues and in the \nsearch for new solutions which meet the interests not only of a group \nof States but of the international community as a whole. In this \nrespect, we attach particular importance to the drafting and adoption \nof a universal code of conduct concerning the fundamental rights and \nobligations of States.\n98.\tIn order to obtain those goals, it is necessary to improve \nthe activity of the United Nations, democratize its organs, \nstructures and functions, increase its effectiveness and adapt it to \nthe present and future requirements and realities of the \ninternational community. The United Nations must become a dynamic and \neffective forum for the political settlement of international \nproblems, conflicts and situations of tension among States and for \nholding multilateral negotiations.\n99.\tIn order to enhance the role and the contribution of the \nUnited Nations in resolving international problems, it is imperative \nthat each State strictly respect the decisions of the Organization \nand that the obligations and commitments undertaken during the \nnegotiating process be fulfilled in good faith.\n100.\tIn conclusion, the Romanian delegation wishes to reaffirm \nfrom this rostrum its determination to co-operate closely with all \nother delegations in the search for the best way of achieving all \nthose objectives, so that the present session may by its results \ndischarge the great responsibilities with which the United Nations is \nentrusted in the fulfilment of the aspirations of all peoples to \npeace and progress.\n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe \ncannot remain silent in the Assembly regarding its profound concern \nat the grave problems beclouding the &ea of international relations, \nwhich by their very gravity are imperilling the security of the world \nand threatening peace and solidarity among nations.\n\n197.\tToday more than ever before the peoples of the world want to \nlive in dignity and freedom, but they are threatened. They are the \nvictims of barbarous aggression, intolerable interference and covert \nblackmail by those whose vocation and nature it is to sow grief, \npain, suffering, terror, poverty and destruction wherever people are \nproclaiming their right to self-determination, wherever people are \nfighting and dying for freedom.\n\n198.\tWe cannot fail at such a time to be conscious of the heroism \nof the Palestinian people, the courage and determination of the \nPalestine Liberation Organization [PLO] and its brave fighters, who, \nin the face of a deluge of fire and steel, have taught Zionism and \nits allies a masterly lesson in popular resistance.\n\n199.\tIt is almost unbelievable that so much horror and barbarism \nshould have b en committed at the threshold of the twenty-first \ncentury by an imposter State protected by guilty accomplices, a State \nwhich has now reached the last stages of paranoia. These atrocities \ndemonstrate clearly to responsible mankind the dangers which lie in \nwait for it and which can only be dispelled by a greater \ndetermination in our\n\ncommon defence of the ideals and cardinal principles cherished by the \npeoples of the world and by forging a network of unbroken solidarity.\n\n200. The plot aimed at exterminating the Palestinian people must be \ndenounced, condemned and resisted, vigorously and with determination, \nby the international community. The appalling pictures of the \nholocaust in west Beirut and the most recent massacres in the \nPalestinian refugee camps have stirred the conscience of the millions \nof men and women who have identified with the Palestinian cause and \nfirmly refuse to take refuge in blindness and amnesia in the face of \nthe most monstrous crimes in the history of the struggle of peoples \nfor self-determination and independence.\n\n201. What crime is it that Zionism and the imperialist forces hold \nagainst the Palestinian people and the PLO? The Palestinian people \nhas quite rightly proclaimed its right to a homeland, to the \nestablishment of the State of its .choice and to the recovery of its \nterritories occupied by force. What is that people to do, that people \nrobbed of its land for 35 years, condemned to exile and murder, other \nthan fight for' the recognition of its inalienable rights, which \nothers affect to ignore.\n\n202. Israeli barbarism in Lebanon, the occupation by the Zionist \nforces of part of the territory of that sovereign State, a Member of \nthe Organization, and the' systematic use of the right of veto by the \nUnited States to prevent any unanimous condemnation of these criminal \nacts and the application of sanctions under the Charter lead us to \nthe conclusion that law and international practice governing \nrelations between States are being scornfully disregarded by some in \norder the better to preserve their unnatural alliances.\n\n203.\tSao Tome and Principe supports the Palestinian people and the \nPLO, its sole representative, because we also cherish honour, dignity \nand national independence as high values which no one will ever \nsucceed in destroying.\n\n204.\tThe invasion of Lebanon and the occupation by force of the \nArab territories by Zionist troops lead us to mention the invasion of \nthe People's Republic of Angola and the occupation of parts of its \nterritory by the racist and terrorist troops of the apartheid regime, \nwhich is another shameful phenomenon of contemporary life. Those \nactions illustrate the identity and the complementary nature of the \nviews and actions of Tel Aviv and Pretoria.\n\n205. To link the independence of Namibia, under the aegis of SWAPO, \nwith the withdrawal of the inter-nationalist Cuban forces from \nAngolan territory is intolerable interference inthe affairs of a \nsovereign State, a Member of the United Nations. Furthermore, no one \ncan claim to be unaware of the reasons which led the Angolan \nGovernment to appeal for the solidarity of friendly countries the \nbetter to defend the sovereignty and integrity of its territory, so \nseriously threatened by the massive presence of terrorist racist \nSouth African troops. Those troops are illegally occupying part of \nthe territory of the People's Republic of Angola and once again the \ninternational community seems to be acquiescing in a situation where \ninter-national rules are being flagrantly violated. This passivity is \nof the greatest possible benefit to South Africa, which is able with \ntotal impunity to massacre the innocent civilians, destroy \nsocio-economic infrastructures and maintain its illegal occupation.\n\n206.\tIn spite of the existence of a recognized political and \njuridical framework for conducting the negotiations on the \nindependence of Namibia in accordance with Security Council \nresolution 435 (1978), those negotiations are at a standstill and all \npossible pre-texts, even the most threadbare, are being presented as \npre-conditions for any settlement of the Namibian problem. Certain \nWestern countries which have economic and strategic interests in \nNamibia want to prevent that Territory from becoming truly \nindependent and the Namibian people, represented by SWAPO, its sole \nand legitimate representative, from being able to live in peace, \nfreedom and dignity .\n\n207.\tIn South Africa, in Western Sahara, in East Timor and in \nPuerto Rico, heroic struggles are being waged by their peoples to put \nan end to apartheid illegal occupation, colonialism and foreign \noppression.\n\n208. The presence of foreign troops is preventing the peoples of \nCyprus and Korea from realizing their legitimate aspirations.\n\n209. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and \nPrincipe wishes to reaffirm from this rostrum its unswerving support \nfor and Its active solidarity with the people of East Timor and \nexpress the hope that the statements of the administering Power on \nthe subject of the decolonization of East Timor will lead to recourse \nbeing had to the machinery provided under the Charter to permit the \nMaubere people to express its views freely on its own future.\n\n210. Our delegation also wishes to express its militant support for \nthe peoples of Western Sahara, Puerto Rico, Cyprus and Korea in their \nstruggle to preserve their national sovereignty, self-determination, \nindependence, national unity and peaceful reunification.\n\n211. A vast plot by the imperialist and reactionary forces is \nthreatening the peoples and Governments of Africa, Latin America, \nAsia and elsewhere. An infernal\n\nmachine is being unleashed against us in order to destabilize regimes \nfreely chosen by our peoples and all possible means are being \nused-the creation of puppet movements and armed gangs, the \ndispatching of mercenaries, the establishment of military bases, the \npersistent refusal to make the necessary changes in the structure and \nmachinery of international economic relations, the stopping of \ninvestment credits, aid blackmail, and so on. These actions have one \npurpose in common: to safeguard the economic and strategic \nneo-colonialist and imperialist interests in the region.\n\n212. Furthermore, armed border conflicts are being fanned into flame \nand fuelled among the developing countries to weaken our human and \nmaterial resources and prevent our using our strength and solidarity \nin true programme of national reconstruction.\n\n213.\tIn this vast plot, international and regional organizations \nare not spared. Those bodies are threatened with paralysis and may \nvery we)), in this context, cease functioning. It is as if the forces \nof\n\nevil want to prevent the peoples of the third world from gaining \naccess to credible forums where they can denounce and condemn the \nplots, the manoeuvres and the massacres and diminish the historic \nrole of those bodies, that is, to defend the struggle for \nemancipation of the peoples of the world against every kind of \nexploitation and discrimination.\n\n214. It is because the United Nations, the OAU and the non-aligned \nmovement have remained faithful to their original vocation that \nserious threats are posed to their future and their capacity to take \njust and courageous decisions enabling responsible mankind to \nundertake commitments of solidarity and jointly to meet the challenge.\n\n215. In this context the task of the new Secretary-Charter, they are \noffered only resolutions which remain General are not an easy one. A \nson of the third world, renowned for his qualities and his \nexperience, General is not an easy one. A son of the third world, \nrenowned for his qualities and his experience, he will through his \nenlightened leadership enable the United Nations to succeed in \ndefending international order, justice, peace and the progress of the \npeoples of the world so that the Organization can continue to deserve \nthe confidence of all peoples and in particular of the peoples whose \nhuman dignity has been diminished. The United Nations, in particular \nat the sessions of the General Assembly, must not become a kind of \nconfessional, where we all find ourselves under the spell of words \nand exorcise the evil spirits, thus relieving our conscience, because \nin sanctioning the practice of the use of words without accompanying \naction the Organization is likely to become the graveyard of the \nhopes of the peoples.\n\n\n216. Our delegation is among those that whole-the many complex \npolitical problems on the agenda  of  heartedly endorse the idea that \nthe United Nations the General Assembly for the establishment of a \nnew international order in which dignity, freedom, wellbeing, peace \nand progress can become a reality and not a mirage for mankind.\n\n217. The delegation of Sao Tome and Principe wishes to assure the \nSecretary-General that the people and Government of the Democratic \nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe will make a constructive \ncontribution to the performance of this honourable task.\n"

        "file_text": "95.\t I should like to join those who have preceded me in placing one more flower in the bouquet of congratulations that the President has received and with justification. I do so with the confidence that the vast experience and skill that he possesses will be put to the service of this parliament of nations which he now heads. Upon his shoulders now lies the mantle worn by many distinguished statesmen, the latest being his worthy and immediate predecessor, Mr. Kittani, who led the Assembly safely through the turbulence of the thirty-sixth session.\n96.\tThe universal character of this body is no more exemplified than in the fact that a distinguished son of another region our region, the Latin American and Caribbean region has been honored and with him the entire region to hold the office of Secretary- General during this most crucial and exacting period in the history of the Organization. The delegation of Saint Lucia not only congratulates Mr. Perez de Cuellar upon his election to that high office, but notes with commendation the imprint of his dedicated personality, which is already in evidence on the Organization.\n97.\tThe Secretary-General has assumed office at a time when peace-makers the world over need the consolation that they are called blessed and we all hope that by his efforts and those of other peace-makers, man will continue to inherit the earth. The report on the work of the Organization produced by the Secretary-General in so short a time and in times punctuated with such anxiety for the process of peace amply justifies the confidence that was placed in him when he was chosen as Chief Executive of the Organization. It is the duty of all of us who are dedicated to the cause of peace to ensure that the guidelines laid down in the report are followed and that the conclusions of so excellent an analysis do not lose their fragrance in the desert air of barren rhetoric.\n98.\tThroughout the world the war drums continue to throb. Throughout the world the production, stockpiling, sale and distribution of weapons of war and destruction continue at an ever-escalating pace. The hungry furnaces of armaments suck in and consume enormous and ever-increasing proportions of the world's treasures. While the specter of famine is a constant and ever-present companion of millions in the Sahel and in sub-Saharan Africa, the weapons of war pour into the Horn of Africa. The arms trade between the industrialized nations and the nations of the third world now reaches the obscene proportions of billions of dollars annually and much of that trade is with the poorest of the poor nations, to whose relief much of the work of the specialized agencies of the United \nNations is directed. The arms bazaar teems with merchants of death, eager to place sophisticated weapons in the hands of mere children. Generous credits are extended to the purchasers of weapons, while such agencies as UNDP are left short of funds to support programs designed to lift the poor out of the bondage of poverty. What a saH harvest we sow for our children.\n99.\tBut what are the immediate consequences of this widespread irrationality? The economies of the world are so burdened with the cost of arms, so starved of resources that are deflected to the purchase of weapons of destruction that we are now faced with the looming spectacle of a depression which shows signs of being wider and deeper than that of the 1930s, and for scores of nations and hundreds of millions of people nothing short of catastrophe looms. While nations continue upon this irrational course, while the treasures and the blood of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq are poured out upon the desert sands, while the refugee camps of Africa swell with the ever- increasing tide of human misery, the arms race continues and the merchants of death prosper.\n100.\tAs so much of the world's resources are sucked into this insatiable vortex, the economies of the world stagger drunkenly under the excessive burden of armaments. Countries are forced to borrow not for development, but to pay interest rates that have now risen to unprecedented heights; inflation rages through economies with the speed and destructiveness of forest fires; the debt burden of nations reaches staggering proportions; the lines of the unemployed cast an ever-lengthening shadow; and nations producers of primary products are pushed to their very knees as the value of their exports reaches its lowest levels since the 1930s.\n101.\tWith all these warning signs of economic collapse and with the instruments and devices for averting this catastrophe within our control, we nevertheless appear to stand transfixed and helpless waiting for the collapse, waiting for the new depression before we take action to avert it.\n102.\tSaint Lucia is convinced that nothing short of a halt to this senseless expenditure on arms and armaments can avert the severe economic crisis which faces us, as we hold most steadfastly that therein lies the root cause of our current economic difficulties. The Government of Saint Lucia will therefore support with zeal any initiative to bring the World Disarmament Conference to a successful conclusion. And we note with joy that the crown of honor has been placed upon the work of one of the most persistent workers in the cause of peace, Mr. Garcia Robles, the Permanent Representative of Mexico, for his efforts in the Committee on Disarmament.\n103.\tWithin recent times, members of this body, in violation of their obligations under the Charter, have resorted to or threatened to resort to the use of force in the settlement of disputes; in some instances, as in the case of the Falkland Islands, while the dispute was under the mediation of the Security Council and within sight of a peaceful solution. Such action will find no support from the Government of Saint Lucia but on the contrary will be visited with swift condemnation. On the specific case of the Falkland Islands,\nthe position of the Government of Saint Lucia is that there must be the right of self-determination, as has been frequently restated in resolutions of this body, and further, that international disputes should be settled by peaceful means. From this position we shall not waver.\n104.\tThis means of mediation and restraint we commend to all Member States and in particular those within our hemisphere. Although the territorial dispute between Guyana and Venezuela has not yet been satisfactorily resolved, the Government of Saint Lucia notes with approbation that both countries have been most restrained in the pursuit of their competing claims and have expressed their willingness to seek resolution through mediation. We urge them to continue on this course of conciliation.\n105.\tThis restraint is not apparent, however, in the claim by Guatemala against the territorial integrity of Belize. The Government of Saint Lucia notes with regret the bellicose attitude which Guatemala continues to exhibit with reflect to the sovereign State of Belize and urges other States to give no aid, comfort or assistance concerning such intentions against a State Member of the United Nations.\n106.\tIn the very bosom of the Americas, a region for over a century protected by the ocean from great- Power conflict, there are now ominous rumblings and this must cause us some concern. The problem of unequal distribution of land and wealth, a legacy of the colonial past, cannot be solved by the introduction of armed conflict into the region. But the social order of \\\"the rich man in his castle, the poor man at his gate\\\" can no longer be tolerated in our hemisphere. It must be accepted, too, that social and economic problems are not amenable to military solutions. Nations in which such manifestations of social and economic injustice exist must seek through structural changes in the society to deal with this by conciliation and mediation within their own societies, and no nation should seek, by the introduction of arms and military advisers into the region, to extend its sphere of influence by taking advantage of this tragic situation. Any assistance to the region should be directed, rather, into avenues which assist in the removal of the root cause of the problem; instead of being channeled into arms, training camps and military advisers to fuel the conflict and exacerbate human suffering, it should be used to replenish the resources of the International Development Association and for financing land reform and other measures for the restructuring of the economy of the countries concerned.\n107.\tBut, while some countries hold the footlights of the world stage, the center stage and the spotlight are still occupied by the events in the Middle East. The tragic and savage events in Beirut and the continued hemorrhaging of Lebanon cannot but arouse the righteous indignation of the civilized world and the condemnation of the Organization. There can be absolutely no justification for this savagery. These events are the more lamentable in that involved in them, however indirectly, is a nation whose centuries of suffering have introduced into the languages of the world the words \\\"diaspora\\\" and \\\"holocaust\\\".\n108 The right of Israel to exist and to live within secure and defensible boundaries is a right which the Government of Saint Lucia has and will continue fervently to support. The bloodletting in the region we have always deplored, the indiscriminate killings of civilians we have always condemned, but these brutal acts against the conscience of humanity will always continue unless Israel whose people through centuries of tribulations and Diaspora, throughout the holocaust, kept their faith alive by the hopeful greeting, \u201cTomorrow, in Jerusalem\\\" understands another people's longing for a homeland; until the intense desire of the Palestinian people for a homeland is satisfied, there will be no peace in this troubled land because there will have been no justice. The Government of Israel should realize that the iron bars of a prison cannot confine an ideal, nor the mass burial grounds of Beirut inter a dream. The dream of the Palestinians will continue to haunt the corridors of this Organization until their search for justice is successful. The Government of Saint Lucia hails the valiant effort of Mr. Philip Habib to end the conflict in Lebanon and looks forward to the day when that troubled land will be free of foreign troops and its people permitted to live in peace under their own vines and fig trees.\n109.\tThe racist regime in South Africa cannot, however, be permitted to live in peace by segregating itself from the rest of the civilized world. How long can this racist and oppressive regime continue to thumb its nose at the Organization? How long will it be permitted to occupy the United Nations Trust Territory of Namibia and impose upon its people the abhorrent doctrine of apartheid? These are questions which cry out for answers^ answers that the contact group of Western States is slow to provide. South Africa not only has subjugated its people by oppression, legislative acts and naked police terror but, like any outlaw, has sought to extend its reign of terror beyond its boundaries, threatening the stability of States in the region. Until the activities of South Africa can be brought within the pale of civilized conduct neighboring States will harbor uneasiness regarding their own security and seek appropriate measures in this regard. South Africa cannot be permitted to impose conditions for Namibian independence, and the Government of Saint Lucia awaits with eagerness the long-delayed admission of this country to the community of independent nations.\n110.\tI believe that I voice the sentiment of all third world and developing countries when I say that we are tired of conflict, tired of wars and rumors of wars, and we look forward to the time when nations will beat their swords into ploughshares, and when the rich products of man's mind, the products of science and technology, will be put to man's service in the fight against his ancient enemies, poverty, hunger and disease. We look forward to the time when such technology, now so triumphant in the exploration of space, will be extended to the exploration of the riches of the sea-bed. It is a tribute to the statesmanship of Members of the Organization that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, after years of patient negotiations, is now within our grasp. This act of statesmanship is intended to prevent the kind of rapacious colonialization and exploration of the\nsea-bed and exploitation of the resources of the sea which, when applied to other spheres, brought to the African continent a legacy of suffering suffering which has yet to be helled. As island States, we in Saint Lucia and in the Caribbean have an intense and abiding interest in this Convention, and although some points of detail remain to be resolved, the Government of Saint Lucia looks forward to the signing and ratification of the final act, in another Caribbean island State, Jamaica, in December of this year. In the encircling gloom of the world economy, this is a tiny ray of hope that shines like a beacon.\n111.\tBut no such light can be seen on the horizon of the global economic negotiations. The so-called North-South dialog on the new international economic order is now stalled. What we have instead is a rising tide of protectionism that threatens to stifle world trade and economic co-operation. As the economic storms lash our shores, nations now tend to seek refuge within their fortress of economic isolation, erect strong tariff walls against each other and pull up their drawbridge behind them. Such devices, simple and politically attractive though they may appear, cannot work in a world where economies are so intricately intertwined and interdependent. Such action is but an admission of powerlessness, of an erosion of confidence in the conventional wisdom and of orthodoxy recently so fashionable, of a sense of being overwhelmed by forces beyond national influence or international control. That there can be so abject a surrender to economic forces renders all our statements here but empty rhetoric.\n112.\tBut not only is our economic well-being threatened; our political structures may well be convulsed, if the international community does not face up to the need to provide mechanisms for global management of the world economy and assist in its recovery. The mechanism for recovery was adequately analyzed and documented in the Brandt Report, and it should form the basis for urgent negotiations. The procedural objections being used as delaying devices should be beneath the contemplation of some of the major countries of the North, but unfortunately this is not the case. In the three or so years since the Brandt Report was published, and in the many months since the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development, held in 1981 at Cancun, there has been no discernible progress or meaningful discussion on this initiative.\n113.\tHere again we stand transfixed without will, huddled in our own igloos, hoping that the more rabid manifestations of world economic disorder will pass us by. But we live in one world. The vast majority of the consumers of manufactured goods live in the South, and unless this vast potential is mobilized all our efforts at economic readjustment, all the aid to keep the teeming multitudes from starvation, will be no more effective than putting a band-aid on a cancer. What is necessary, and what the Brandt Report urges, is to restructure a system created many years ago to satisfy the needs of a few industrialized countries so as to meet the present-day realities of the emergence on the international scene of a hundred or so new nations, which are now the majority in this world Organization.\u2003\n114.\tNo country, no nation, wants to suffer the indignity of being for ever on the bread line of the world. But countries* emergence from this condition is not helped by the attitude of some Member States which seek to avoid their humanitarian obligations to provide multilateral assistance through United Nations specialized agencies by advancing the specious argument that all the ills of the third world countries are but the legacy of colonialism, and that therefore the obligations for relief and assistance must be borne only by the former colonial Powers. This argument the Government of Saint Lucia unequivocally rejects as spurious and untenable, since no such argument is used when bilateral aid is offered as an extension of foreign policy and in the extension of spheres of influence. These multilateral agencies have been specifically designed to assist poorer nations to extricate themselves from the bonds of poverty, and it is by the support of these programs that the righteousness of one's utterances can be judged.\n115.\tWe live in one world, the frontiers of which are being shrunk daily by the advance of science, a world which now demands an answer to the question \u201cAm I my brother's keeper?\\\"\\\" It is because it sees it as being in keeping with that question and as a tentative attempt at an answer that the Government of Saint Lucia welcomes the Caribbean Basin Initiative outlined by President Reagan. Some aspects of this initiative still require refinement and qualification, but in principle it affords the countries of the Caribbean covered by the proposal a unique opportunity to help themselves. It is by giving people an opportunity to develop themselves and contribute to the world's stock of resources, by initiating and supporting programs that give people that sense of participating, that sense of ownership, that sense of belonging, that an era of peace can be ushered in an era when the war drums will throb no longer and the battle flags are furled.\n116.\tWe in our part of the world, in the blue and placid Caribbean Sea, wish to be no one's satellite or ideological appendage. Left out of the ideological struggles, we wish to devise an economic system uniquely our own, and to live in peace under the protective mantle of this unique organization, of which we are a proud member and a staunch supporter.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "We have gathered together here, as we do every year at this time, in \nthe supreme body of the United Nations system, the General Assembly, \nto think about and exchange views on the important problems which \nconcern the international community as well as our respective States.\n151.\tFirst of all, I should like to discharge a most pleasant \nduty-to extend our warm congratulations to Mr. Hoilai, on behalf of \nthe delegation of the People's Republic of Benin, and express the \ngreat satisfaction we feel about his election to the presidency of \nthe thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We regard his \nunanimous election as a tribute to his great merits and outstanding \nqualities as a statesman and seasoned diplomat and at the same time \nas eloquent testimony to the respect in which the international \ncommunity holds his country, the Hungarian People's Republic, for its \nactive participation in our common task of peace and co-operation \namong all nations. Our delegation is convinced that under his \nenlightened leadership our deliberations will lead us to important \ndecisions that will help to bring about concrete action designed to \nestablish a new international order based on principles of justice \nand solidarity among peoples and for the maintenance of international \npeace and security. Our delegation would also like to take this \nopportunity to express its gratitude and admiration for the masterly \nway in which his predecessor, Mr. Kittani, of Iraq, guided our work \nand the good will he displayed during the thirty-sixth regular \nsession of the Assembly as well as the second special session devoted \nto disarmament and the seventh emergency special session, on the \nquestion of Palestine. We would also like to express once again to \nthe Secretary-General the appreciation of our country, the People's \nRepublic of Benin, for the thought he is giving to ways to make the \nworking of the United Nations system more effective and to enable it \nfully to shoulder its responsibilities in the face of the serious \nproblems facing the world. We would also like to take this \nopportunity to welcome the action the Secretary-General has taken \nwith vigour and determination since his election in dealing \nresolutely with the delicate task of making the voice of the United \nNations heard amidst the clamour of passions and injustices of every \nkind.\n152.\tThe international situation is extremely distressing. The \nworld is in a state of crisis at all levels -political, economic, \ncultural and social-and we feel powerless when we see that, despite \nour efforts, the resolutions and recommendations we have managed to \nadopt in this Hall have not had the results we had hoped for in \nsettling the grave problems with which we and mankind as a whole are \nfaced.\n153.\tThe self-same problems thus re-emerge in a more acute form. \nThe serious events that have recently shaken the world and that \ncontinue to persist show the extent to which the international \nsituation has deteriorated. Indeed, we are witnessing a sudden \nincreased level of tension in the sensitive areas of the world that \ndefies reason, and the exacerbation of conflicts is moving the world \nswiftly towards an explosion fraught with unforeseeable consequences.\n154.\t.We are extremely concerned-how could we not be?-when we note \nthat some Powers employ force with disconcerting ease as a means of \nsettling disputes. Flouting international rules and conventions, \nthose colonialist, imperialist, expansionist, racist Powers have \nsystematized their irregular, illegal, immoral, amoral practices. \nArmed aggression, military intervention, the occupation of the \nterritories of other States, the use of mercenaries and open \ninterference in the internal affairs of other independent States have \nbecome their favourite means of imposing their domination and of \nachieving the triumph of their selfish and hegemonistic interests, to \nthe detriment of the rights of other peoples.\n155.\tWith the exception of the problems connected with general and \ncomplete disarmament and periodic crises, the majority of the world's \npolitical problems are centred in Africa, Latin America and Asia. The \nagenda of the present session of the General Assembly, like the \nagendas of preceding sessions, merely reflects this situation. Hence, \nthe delegation of the People's Republic of Benin believes that the \npoor countries, which an unjust international economic system \ncontinues to make poorer with each passing day, are the very same \ncountries as are being subjected to the most despicable policies and \nin which situations that no longer exist in the northern hemisphere \nhave become everyday practice, although their peoples seek only to \nlive in peace and understanding with others in an international \ncommunity in which rules of conduct are respected.\n156.\tIn Africa, we must once again stress the importance of the \nproblems of Namibia, Western Sahara and apartheid. It is not our \nintention to go back over the origin of those questions; rather, we \nwish to emphasize that the efforts of the Organization are being \nflouted by a coalition of powerful States Minded by sordid short-term \ninterests, to the detriment of justice and the protection of the \nvital interests of the African peoples.\n157.\tThe situation in southern Africa can be explained only on \nthose bases, and we have no hesitation in saying that the key to the \nsolution of the Namibian problem, for instance, like that of the \napartheid and the racist South African regime, is being held by those \nPowers friendly to the white racists of South Africa. In that region, \nwhere the voice of reason has been stilled and where relevant \nresolutions of the United Nations, particularly Security Council \nresolution 435 (1978), have been Routed by an oligarchy of criminals \nand racists, the oppressed populations have been constrained to \nresort to the only solution still open to them, namely, armed \nstruggle. It is time for the reactionary supporters of colonialism \nand racism in Pretoria to realize that there can be no peace, \nstability or security in southern Africa as long as Namibia has not \nregained its true independence and as long as the abhorrent system of \napartheid has not been completely eradicated. It is time for the \nPretoria clique to abandon the easy resort to delaying tactics and \ntemporising and to Ml into line with the course of history by \nparticipating in the process of negotiations on Namibia's \nindependence.\n158.\tThat is why our country, the People's Republic of Benin, has \nsupported and will continue to support the Namibian people and its \nleaders, SWAPO, headed by our brother Sam Nujoma, until the \nachievement of total victory and independence without any political \nor territorial restriction. For the same reason we categorically \nreject the claim that there is a link between the presence of Cuban \nforces in the People's Republic of Angola and the process of \ndecolonization of Namibia.\n159.\tLikewise, the South African combatants struggling for the \nestablishment of equality Justice and the eradication of racism in \ntheir homeland have always enjoyed the support of the People's \nRepublic of Benin and deserve a greater degree of support from the \nOrganization. In this connection the People's Republic of Benin has \nalways advocated and will continue to call for the cessation of the \norganized murder of South African nationalists and for the liberation \nof Nelson Mandela and all the South African patriots and nationalists \nimprisoned or arrested by the Pretoria clique for having spoken out \nloudly against a system of government founded on racial \ndiscrimination and for having taken vigorous action to put an end to \nthe anachronism and the scourge of our century, must be denounced and \ncondemned by the international community.\n160.\tCaught up in the spiral of a policy which seems to embody \nhuman folly those who practise apartheid attempt to export to \ncountries of the region the violence and desolation which they \ninflict every day upon the people of many districts which for them \nare nothing but Bantustans. States Members the United Nations are \ndaily attacked by South Africa, and with impunity. Angola, Botswana, \nLesotho, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe are constantly diverted from \ntheir task of national reconstruction and development in order to \ndefend themselves against an enemy financed by and under the \nprotection of international imperialism. In the face of these \nintolerable acts of the so-called South African Republic, the \nOrganization must make greater efforts to prevent its decisions from \nbeing cynically flouted and treated with derision. We owe it to \nourselves to condemn the acts of aggression and destabilization \nperpetrated by the South African racists against Angola and the \nfront-line States, and we must also disapprove of the use of \nmercenaries, a particular scourge of our century.\n161.\tThe international community must remain firmly behind SWAPO \nand support its just struggle for self-determination, national \nliberation an independence of a united and prosperous Namibia. The \nSecurity Council must take all necessary measures to ensure respect \nfor its resolutions and decisions. It must consider undertaking \nglobal sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter, including an oil \nembargo, against South Africa, to make it see reason. Resolution 435 \n(1978) remains the basis for the settlement of the problem of \nNamibia, and any other approach must be rejected.\n162.\tIn the same context we deplore the paralysis of the Committee \nof the Security Council established under its resolution 421 (1977), \nentrusted with the supervision of the mandatory embargo on arms for \nSouth Africa. Our delegation hopes that the report of the Committee, \nwhich is at present before the Council for discussion, will be \nadopted in order to strengthen the means of surveillance of the \nmandatory arms embargo.\n163.\tWe must with the same determination consider the situation in \nWestern Sahara, which we mention with sorrow because the colonial \ninvasion in this case is African and does not come from outside. The \nUnited Nations, in co-operation with the OAU, has adopted bold \nresolutions aimed at achieving the self-determination of the martyred \nSahraoui people. Our country condemns the obstructionism and the \nrefusal of frank and open collaboration displayed by the invader in \nthe face of all the constructive proposals designed to find a \nsolution to the illegal occupation of the territory of another \ncountry, an occupation which threatens the peace and security of the \nregion, with increasing risks of internationalizing the conflict.\n164.\tThe People's Republic of Benin supports the just cause of the \nSahraoui people and condemns most strongly the colonialist and \nexpansionist policy which continues to deprive that courageous people \nof the exercise of its inalienable rights. The People's Republic of \nBenin reaffirms its solidarity with the Sahraoui Arab Democratic \nRepublic in its heroic struggle against foreign occupation. The \ndesire to restore peace in the region demands that the Sahraoui Arab \nDemocratic Republic and the Kingdom of Morocco consider forthwith the \nways and means of bringing an end to that conflict.\n165.\tRegarding the situation in the Middle East, no one should \nunderestimate the dangers of the tension in the region. The \naggression perpetrated by Israel in its invasion of Beirut and its \npolicy of genocide against the Palestinians constitute a \ncharacteristic aspect of the policy of global Zionism of the Tel Aviv \nauthorities in the Middle East. The stubbornness of the Zionists of \nTel Aviv in pursuing this policy of aggression, occupation and \nextermination is encouraged by the unconditional and massive support \nof international imperialism, which provides them with logistic \nsupport, the arms and the finance-which is no secret to anyone. The \nbarbaric aggression and genocide perpetrated by Israel, such as the \nrecent massacres of Sabra and Shatila, deserve nothing but \nindignation and strong and unequivocal condemnation.\n166.\tIsrael must withdraw its occupation forces forthwith and \nunconditionally from Lebanese territory and all Arab territories \noccupied since 1967. Israel must return to the strict practice of \ninternational morality for the right to one's own life does not imply \nthe right to exterminate others.\n167.\tThe Palestinian people have the right to a national life, a \ncountry with recognized, secure and guaranteed boundaries and their \nown territorial entity. The People's Republic of Benin will always \njoin in bilateral and multilateral efforts effectively to achieve \nthat objective.\n168.\tThe international community must become increasingly aware of \nthe grave situation in the Middle East and find the means to make the \nZionist aggressors understand that they are placing international \npeace and security at risk, for peace in the Middle East necessarily \ninvolves the proper settlement of the Palestinian problem. The \nPeople's Republic of Benin condemns the Zionist policy in the Middle \nEast and supports the struggle of the Palestinian people and their \nright to their own homeland. The People's Republic of Benin reaffirms \nits political and diplomatic support for the PLO, the sole \nrepresentative of the oppressed people of Palestine.\nBy the same token we should like to reaffirm our support for the \npeople of Cyprus in their legitimate struggle for the reunification \nand integrity of their territory, for peace between the two \ncommunities, and against foreign interference.\n170.\tIn Asia, although the echo of gun fire seems to have \ndiminished lately, political and military tension is nevertheless \nhigh. Hence our delegation stresses its condemnation of all \nimperialist manoeuvres in that region designed to revive those crises \nthat the determination of the peoples involved is gradually \nresolving. The Kampuchean and Afghan peoples alone have the right to \nchoose their own political systems and we condemn any interference in \nthe internal affairs of Kampuchea and Afghanistan. The peoples of \nthose two countries must be left free to decide their destiny, and \nthreats to their security and foreign occupation must cease. This is \na meaningful massage for real peace in the region.\n171.\tThe People's Republic of Benin has recognized and will \ncontinue to recognize the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea \nand supports all its efforts to achieve the political unification of \nthe country and oppose foreign aggression and interference by \ninternational imperialist factions.\n172.\tThe people of Korea aspire to peace and to the peaceful \nreunification of their homeland free from foreign interference. This \nis the feeling in both the south and the north of the peninsula. The \nPeople's Republic of Benin welcomes the efforts of the North Korean \nauthorities to bring about the peaceful reunification of the great \nKorean country. In order to achieve this objective the Korean people \nmust be free to decide their future. Thus we call for the withdrawal \nof all foreign troops from the peninsula. This is the only way to \nensure a definitive and viable settlement of the Korean crisis. The \nPeople's Republic of Benin affirms its firm and unswerving support \nfor the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its valiant efforts \nto put an end to the artificial and arbitrary division of Korea by \nthe satisfaction of the legitimate aspiration of the entire Korean \npeople, that is, independent and peaceful reunification and the \nestablishment of the Confederated Republic of Koryo.\n173.\tWe also support the people of East Timor in their legitimate \nstruggle for freedom.\n174.\tThe People's Republic of Benin supports those peoples in \nCentral America and the Caribbean that aye courageously extricating \ntheir countries from the grip of international imperialism and \nstriving to take their destiny into their own hands. AH peoples \naspiring to independence in that region should be able freely to \nexpress their views on their future. In this context, my delegation \nbelieves that the relevant resolutions of the United Nations must be \nborne in mind and respected by all. Blackmail and military plots of \nall kinds are constantly used to ensure the failure of the \nrevolutionary experience of the countries of the region. The heroic \nresistance of the Latin American peoples, whose political maturity \ngrows stronger every day, deserves our full admiration and support. \nPeoples that cherish peace and justice must continue to support the \npeaceful cause of independence and freedom of Cuba, Nicaragua, El \nSalvador, Grenada and others.\n175.\tThe Indian Ocean has become an area of competition where the \ngreat military Powers are building their own gigantic arsenals for a \npossible future confrontation. Gigantic observation, control and \ncommunications complexes rise above the peaceful waters of that \nimmense Ocean and there are huge stocks of the most modem and \nsophisticated weapons on those floating bases. All these means of \ndestruction stockpiled on that Ocean constitute a threat to \ninternational peace and to the security of the coastal States. The \nPeople's Republic of Benin, concerned at this race to militarize the \nIndian Ocean, reaffirms its support for all measures and decisions \naimed at transforming the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. In this \ncontext, the bold proposals of the President, Didier Ratsiraka, of \nMadagascar should be accepted and given concrete form.\n176.\tThe subject of the demilitarization of the Indian Ocean \nbrings us to the problem of disarmament. It is by now no secret that \nwhen we bear in mind mankind's problems of life and survival the \nexorbitant expenses involved in the arms race are truly scandalous, \nif not utter madness: $450 billion are spent on it each year, when \n$20 billion would suffice for development assistance. Apart from the \nfact that this accumulation of increasingly dangerous equipment \nheightens the risk of general confrontation, it is also a heavy \nburden for the major Powers that prompts them to shirk their \ninternational responsibilities. We in the People's Republic of Benin \nare convinced that this arms race threatens not only the survival of \nmankind but also the economic development of the world. For the \nlimitation or complete elimination of the arms race would enable the \nPowers which now engage in that arms race to channel more money into \ndevelopment assistance and the improvement of the living standards of \ntheir own citizens.\n177.\tMy delegation regrets that at the second special session \ndevoted to disarmament the General Assembly failed to make any \nprogress, despite the many proposals from all sides. The Organization \nmust continue its efforts to achieve general disarmament, which at \nthis time of chronic economic crisis could permit the enormous \nfinancial resources that are today squandered on destruction and \ndeath to be reallocated to the fulfilment of the noble ideals of \npreserving life and promoting international peace and security.\n178.\tWe make a most urgent appeal to the conscience of both the \nSoviet and American peoples to induce their respective Governments to \nengage in sincere and decisive negotiations to put an end to the arms \nand to achieve a balanced arms reduction so as to release large \nquantities of resources which could then be devoted to the promotion \nof the well-being of peoples and to assistance to developing \ncountries.\n179.\tThose, in our opinion, are the main political concerns of the \ninternational community. They are not new, and the Organization has \ncontinually been adopting resolutions to deal with them. But we must \nnote that a great number of Member States flout United Nations \ndecisions to such an extent that we must wonder whether the \nOrganization would not gain from a restructuring-particularly the \nSecurity Council. It must be recalled that the Charter not only \nstipulates rights: it imposes duties upon States, as well. Legally \nadopted decisions must be implemented. At this juncture we would like \nto pay a sincere tribute to the Secretary-General for his commendable \nefforts to preserve international peace and security.\n180.\tThe critical situation in the world not only political in \nnature; it is also economic. Indeed, the international economic \nsituation gives us growing cause for concern. The persistence of this \neconomic crisis, which has lasted more than a decade and continues to \ndeteriorate, brings to light a long-term structural phenomenon: \nmonetary upheaval, galloping inflation, constantly soaring interest \nrates, unbearable instability in the balance of payments, and \nincreased indebtedness are its main characteristics; they have \nharmful effects upon the economies of the developing countries.\n181.\tThe development of those countries is seriously handicapped \nby that situation. Their investment capacity is reduced. The acute \ndeterioration in the terms of trade dangerously decreases their \nexpected export revenues. Their production effort is affected and \neconomic stagnation is compounded by social stagnation because of the \nincrease in unemployment.\n182.\tUntil recently we have devoted our efforts only to the \nexternal manifestations of this economic crisis and have attempted to \nsolve them with stopgap measures, but to no great avail. Is not the \nfundamental question really the problem of development itself and the \nestablishment of new relations in the system of co-operation among \nnations based on international solidarity, justice and equity?\n183.\tSince the holding of the special sessions devoted to the \nproblem of development and to the establishment of a new \ninternational economic order, and the various North-South dialogues \nin Paris, followed by the global negotiations under the aegis of the \nUnited Nations and the Cancun meeting, there has certainly been an \nevolution, in terms of vocabulary, if not of ideas. But the facts \nhave changed little. The intransigence of certain rich countries \nblindly attached to the privileges and advantages they have unjustly \nacquired prevents the appeal for solidarity from being heard and in \nno way fosters the establishment of a new international economic \norder.\n184.\tThe failure to restructure international economic life has \nresulted in a continuing, alarming deterioration of the world \neconomy, which is not likely to reduce international political \ntension, since the economically weaker countries have come to realize \nthat the economically stronger countries have deliberately been \ncontributing to keeping them in the status of marginal States. If we \nwant to strive for international peace and security, it is clear that \nthis intolerable situation cannot be allowed to go on much longer.\n185.\tInternational co-operation is obviously adversely affected by \nthe situation. Indeed, we note a deteriorating spirit of multilateral \nco-operation, the principal cause of the stagnation in international \nnegotiations. There is also a discernible disproportionate \nindebtedness in the developing countries.\n186.\tHow can those developing countries honour their foreign debt \ncommitments, which amount to hundreds of billions of dollars, we know \nthat they are undergoing an economic recession which seriously \naffects their budgets, when we know that their populations are \nsuffering hunger, malnutrition and disease, when we know that 25 per \ncent of the people proceeds from their meagre exports is sacrificed \nto pay the interest on the various loans needed for their investments \nin the public sector? The gap, the imbalance, between the rich \ncountries and the poor countries is continually increasing.\n187.\tThe rich countries alone monopolize 70 per cent of the \nrevenues from world trade, 80 per cent of industrial activities and \n90 per cent of technology. They are doing all they can to block the \nprocess of co-operation through the selfish practice of protectionist \nmeasures; we have seen an emerging and growing tendency towards \nselectivity in aid, accompanied by its progressive decline.\n188.\tRather than accepting the idea of global negotiations, which, \nin our view, could improve the chances of emerging from the present \neconomic stagnation and promote justice among nations, the countries \nof the North are clinging to palliatives, to caricatures of \nsolutions, which hardly conceal their desire to maintain their \nlong-standing domination and economic exploitation of our countries.\n189.\tThe delegation of the People's Republic of Benin believes \nthat the present economic crisis is extremely serious and deserves \nour full attention, and that no viable and lasting solution can be \nfound without understanding among all parties, and without a spirit \nof solidarity. It would be pointless to think that a national or \nsectorial search for solutions could solve the problems.\n190.\tOnly global negotiations, bringing together both developed \nand developing countries, are likely to improve the situation, in the \nframework of the establishment of a new international economic order.\n191.\tIn the short term, we believe that the developed countries \nmust try to reach the level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national \nproduct in aid devoted to the development programmes of the \neconomically weak countries. Multilateral assistance must be revived; \nin that connection the rebuilding of the financial resources of \ninstitutions such as the International Development Association is of \nhigh priority, and there is an urgent need for a far-reaching reform \nof international assistance machinery and the establishment of a code \nof conduct for transnational corporations, which must cease to \nplunder the wealth of the host countries with impunity.\n192.\tIt is appropriate now to bring to the attention of the \ninternational community the inadequacy of the Resources of UNDP and \nthe great needs of the countries that benefit from its assistance. \nThe People's Republic of Benin associates itself with the appeals \nlaunched from this rostrum that UNDP be granted the necessary means, \nto enable it to carry out successful its activities for the benefit \nof the developing countries.\n193.\tOur country, the People's Republic of Benin, suffers the \nconsequences of the economic crisis all the more intensely not only \nbecause it is among the least-developed countries, but also because \nthe consequences of the armed aggression to which it was victim are \nstill being felt.\n194. My country thanks the United Nations for the programme of \nspecial economic assistance established at that time and for the \nmeasures which are to be taken by the Assembly at the present session \nto complete the achievement of the goals of that programme. L would \nalso like to thank all the States which have contributed to the \nimplementation of that programme to assist the people of Benin.\n195.\tThat demonstration of solidarity constitutes support for our \ncountry at a time when it is making enormous sacrifices to build the \nfoundations of its economic development. A round-table of the \npartners in Benin's development will be held in June 1983 at Cotonou. \nWe earnestly hope that the States which have been invited and the \nUnited Nations bodies concerned will respond positively and massively \nto our appeal for broad participation. My delegation would be \ngrateful to the Secretary-General for any steps he might take to that \nend.\n196.\tWe thank the Secretary-General in advance, and through him, \nMr. Farah, the Under-Secretary-General, who personally worked to \nestablish the special programme for the benefit of the People's \nRepublic of Benin. His report, which will be considered at this \nsession by the Second Committee, will make it possible to continue \nefforts for effective international assistance in support of the \ndevelopment effort of the courageous people of Benin.\n197.\tWe should also like to express our gratitude to Mr. Bradford \nMorse and, through him, to Mr. Doo Kingue, for UNDP assistance in \norganizing the round-table which is provided for in our 10-year \nsocial and economic development programme.\n198.\tWe should like also to reiterate the gratitude of the \nPeople's Republic of Benin to all the friendly countries and \norganizations which have tangibly demonstrated their solidarity with \nthe people of Benin, who have been stricken by the recent floods in \nthe south of our country.\n199.\tThe People's Republic of Benin, which is among the \nleast-developed countries, is waging a courageous national struggle \nCar economic development. The People's Republic of Benin, its people, \nits party, its Government and its President, Mathieu Kerekou, hope \nthat our appeal from this rostrum will not be a voice crying in the \nwilderness. We rely on international solidarity and co-operation for \nthe success of the round-table planned in our country and for the \nachievement of the objectives of our programme of special economic \nassistance.\n20C. Despite the accusations of ineffectiveness so often levelled at \nthe United Nations, the Organization is an indispensable instrument \nfor the protection of peace and security. Thus, it is the historic \nduty of Member States to overcome their national selfishness to make \nthe Organization better able to function by granting it means \ncommensurate with its purposes and its universality. Member States \nmust act to ensure that the United Nations is not merely a gadget to \ngratify their selfishness; further, we must turn it into a real tool, \noperating full time in the service of peace, freedom, justice and the \ndevelopment of the people. Member States, large and small, rich or \npoor, must resolve to turn the United Nations into a real centre of \nconsultation and action to promote understanding and co-operation \namong peoples and to bring about peaceful coexistence between States \nwith different political systems.\n201.\tMay that thought inspire the representatives at this \nthirty-seventh session of the General Assembly to guarantee the \nsuccess of the Assembly, a success to which the delegation of Benin \npledges itself to contribute by means of dynamic and constructive \nparticipation.\n202.\tReady for the revolution, the struggle continues!\n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of the People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada \nwishes to join all those delegations which have extended their \ncongratulations and best wishes to Mr. Hollai on his election to the \npresidency of this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. \nThe success of this session will be measured by the yardstick of the \nAssembly's ability to steer us back to the paths of brotherhood, \ninternational understanding and peace. The experience, wisdom and \ndiplomatic skills of the one who guides the deliberations of the \nAssembly will constitute a critical factor in achieving any measure \nof success. Mr. Hollai's unanimous election is not only a deserved \ntribute to his widely acclaimed talents as a diplomat but also an \nacknowledgement by the international community of the invaluable \ncontribution made by his country, the socialist Hungarian People's \nRepublic, in favour of peace, justice and social progress. We are \nconfident that his distinguished record makes him eminently qualified \nfor his challenging task. My delegation also wishes to express its \nsincere appreciation of the manner in which Mr. Hollai's predecessor, \nMr. Kittani of Iraq, met the daily demands of his office, with \ncourage, even-handedness and an air of quiet and effective diplomacy.\n88.\tMy delegation further takes this opportunity to say a special \nword of greeting to the Secretary-General on the occasion of the \nfirst regular session of the General Assembly since he assumed \noffice. The elevation of Mr. Perez de Cuellar to that important \nposition has been and always will be a source of great pride and \nsatisfaction to us, the peoples of that part of the third world that \nthe renowned statesman and freedom fighter, Jose Marti, called \\\"our \nAmerica\\\". After a mere few months in exercise of his functions it is \nalready appropriate to take note of his untiring efforts in \nfurthering the cause of peace and the objectives of the United \nNations. For this we express ;o the Secretary-General our deep \nappreciation.\n89.\tThis session is taking place at a critical moment in the \nhistory of our planet and of mankind. It is a time when there are \ndangers born of a deep-seated international economic malaise, with \nthreatening storm-clouds resulting from the dangerous arms race, \nabove all: from the cruelty and callousness which comes from man's \napparent inhumanity to his brother and his neighbour, which threaten \nto engulf the world and annihilate us and our vaunted civilization. \nExactly one year ago, in my address to the Assembly at the 33rd \nmeeting of the thirty-sixth session, I expressed dismay, as did other \ndelegations, frightening state of international relations. Today, 12 \nmonths later, this session is being held with the global situation \nnot less but more alarming than ever.\n90.\tToday the United Nations has become, in more ways than one, \nmankind's hope for survival and social advancement. The Organization \nmust not only channel and accelerate the search for peace but also \npreside over the ushering in of a world economic ordering of \nresources which will allow the poor and the weak to live, not merely \nsurvive. But, in addition, the Organization, by the very ideals \nenshrined in the Charter, by its noble concept of economic and social \ndevelopment seen in the outreach of its specialized agencies and \nbodies such as UNDP and UNESCO; provides guidance for each individual \n.political authority represented in this Hall and appeals to aspects \nof the internal policy of every Member State.\n91.\tWe in Grenada are not only conscious of the relevance to our \nexperience of the declarations on the rights of man and of society, \nfor these, after all, are a product of the collective wisdom of the \nrepresentatives of mankind assembled here; we are not merely aware of \nthe evolution within the United Nations specialized agencies of a \npreference for development geared towards the satisfaction of \npeople's needs and people's aspirations our entire revolutionary \npolitical process, which triumphed in March 1979, focuses on such \npronouncements and our developmental model is constructed on the \nfoundations of people-oriented programmed and activities. The \ninternal achievements of three and a half years of the People's \nRevolutionary Government bear ample testimony to this fact.\n92.\tWe are engaged in an experiment in popular and participatory \ndemocracy where the people gather in their localities, as do their \ndelegates at the zonal and national level, to discuss, debate and \nmake their own proposals on every aspect of government policy, \nincluding the national budget. There is freedom of expression Car all \nour people based on a low guaranteeing democratic ownership and \ncontrol of the news media. We have made rapid strides towards \nguaranteeing in practice employment for every man and woman able and \nwilling to work Also, we are moving towards the point where Grenada \ncan provide free and modern health services for all its citizens, \nample food and nutrition for ail, adequate and decent housing for \nall, and ensure the extension of the basic amenities of modem living \nto everyone. There is free education up to the secondary school \nlevel, and our national literacy campaign and adult education \nprogramme are aimed at wiping out illiteracy and raising the \neducational standard of every worker and peasant to sixth-grade level \nby 1990, in accordance with the objectives and programmes set by \nUNESCO.\n93.\tSo the struggle goes on, the struggle to transform the \nsociety, to improve the unacceptably poor quality of life, and to \nachieve material and spiritual development and economic and social \njustice for all our people.\n94.\tOur approach to the question of relations with the world \naround us involves a thrust compatible and in consonance with our \npolitical preference for genuinely democratic structures and \npeople-oriented attitudes towards development. While we aim \ntherefore, in the true spirit of the family of the United Nations, to \nbuild normal state-to-state relations with all peoples, some of the \nmain pillars of the edifice of our foreign policy remains as follows: \nthose of non-alignment, anti-imperialism and good neighbourliness; \nthe struggle for world peace and security; the determination to \nsupport the struggle of those who are denied their sovereign right \nfreely to choose their path to development; and full support for the \ndemand for more democratically structured international financial \ninstitutions and a just and equitable ordering of the global economic \nsystem.\n93. Grenada is aware that the absence of those elements within \ninternational relations inhibits its own growth. The rate of \nadvancement of our small island nation, like other third world \ncountries with special disadvantages, would be severely restricted if \nthere were no peace or atmosphere of tranquillity and detente. In \naddition to strong moral and political considerations, our \ndevelopment is adversely affected to some degree if the peoples of \nNamibia and Palestine are denied the opportunity to release their \nenergies and the resources available to them into the common pool of \nSouth-South co-operation. And development will remain a dream for \nGrenada unless a way can be found to usher in a new order of \nrelations between our commodity prices and the prices of the goods we \nimport.\n96.\tThe problems of Grenada reflect the present state of the \ninternational economic situation. In the first place, the expanding \nindebtedness of the developing countries cannot be over-emphasized. \nThe current levels of this debt, along with the recent trends in the \nterms of trade and international interest rates, have become a \nnightmare to many countries in the developing world. For instance, \nthe price now being fetched for cocoa, one of Grenada's basic \nexports, is half of what it was two years ago.\n97.\tIn many cases third world countries, especially small islands \nand small land locked States, are attempting through even further \nexternal borrowing to cover the deficits in their external accounts, \ncaused partly by imported inflation, high energy costs and the \nopenness of their economies.\n98.\tThis problem of external over-indebtedness is made worse by \nthe rise of protectionism on the part of some developed countries. \nThese protectionist trends are becoming stronger each day-as was \nevidenced in the struggle the third world was obliged to wage in \nnegotiating the third multi-fibre agreement in December 1981. In our \nview, due to the interdependent nature of the world economy, it is \nnecessary for the developed world to open up markets to the exports \nof the developing world. Prohibitive tariffs, subsidies which violate \nthe principle of the international division of labour and quota \nrestrictions on many commodities, including sugar, should be removed.\n99.\tAnother major problem is the power and dominance of the \ntransnational corporations in the economies of developing countries. \nIt is part of the neo-colonial legacy left to developing countries \nfrom years of colonial and imperialist domination.\n100.\tIt is within the context of this unjust international \neconomic order that my Government sees the need for the reopening of \nglobal negotiations. My Government is convinced that only through the \nearly adoption of proposals for a new international economic order \ncan there be a framework of principles to solve these complex and \nvexing problems which now affect the international economic system.\n101.\tIn our opinion, the failure of the global negotiations so far \nstems from the intractable position taken by a few developed \ncountries, particularly that of a major country. These countries are \nfirmly opposed to any structural transformation of the present \ninequitable international economic system, and are only prepared to \nallow marginal reforms that gradually incorporate selected countries \nchosen solely on the basis of political considerations.\nl02. The continued resistance to negotiations by certain developed \ncountries is a strategy to perpetuate and increase the economic \ndependence of the developing world. My delegation echoes the call of \nthe Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, held at New Delhi to \nthe Group of 77 to remain firm with regard to its agreement on the \nbasic objectives of the global negotiations. In this regard, my \nGovernment welcomes and is greatly encouraged by the fact that a \nnumber of countries have achieved or are approaching the level of \neconomic assistance to the developing world laid down as a target by \nthe United Nations. We are also heartened by the recent decision of \nthe Government of France to increase its volume of aid to the \ndeveloping world in spite of the global economic crisis and, \nbeginning in January 1983, to extend its development aid programme to \ninclude Caribbean countries for the first time.\n103. The demand for a new international economic order must also have \nas one of its objectives the reform of the two most important \nmonetary institutions for the developing world-the International \nMonetary Fund and the World Bank. In order that these institutions \nmay provide greater and more effective flows of finance there is a \nneed for a change in the content of their programmes and the quantum \nof fund resources made available under current quota policies \ngenerally applied to small island and small land-locked economies. \nThere is an urgent need for a reappraisal and restructuring by the \nFund in three basic areas; liquidity and balance-of-payments support, \nthe indices of conditionally, and the nature and phasing of \nadjustment over both the short and medium term.\n104. On the issue of the reform of the World Bank, the People's \nRevolutionary Government has taken note of the several areas of the \nBank's operations where action has been taken or is under way to \nimplement reform. However, there is one important area of World Bank \nreform where no action has yet been taken. That is the desire for \nfairness in the criteria and mechanics for the allocation of \nassistance by the World Bank and the International Development \nAssociation to developing countries and efficiency in the \ndisbursement of such assistance. The Brandt Commission's \nrecommendations on this matter indicate that the present \nconcentration of staff -95 per cent of whom work in Washington at the \nBank's headquarters-tends to make the World Bank remote from the \nproblems and attitudes in borrowing countries. In addition, the \nBank's articles of agreement anticipated a decentralization of its \nactivities, but that has not yet happened. This decentralization \nwould, among other things, have enabled the Bank to attract and \nretain a wider range of staff from developing countries.\n103. The People's Revolutionary Government is firmly convinced that \nonly a reform of IMF and the World Bank along the lines just \nmentioned can assist the developing countries, including small island \nand small land-locked States, in their struggle to overcome external \nindebtedness.\n106.\tIn order to allow for stability and economic growth in most \ndeveloping countries and to ensure that transfers of appropriate \ntechnology can be implemented successfully, it is necessary that the \nlevel of development assistance be greatly increased. That can be \ndone through a reformed World Bank and IMF. Indeed, the economies of \nsome developing countries are threatened with total collapse unless \nthere are greater development assistance flows.\n107.\tIn our opinion, the United Nations Convention on the Law of \nthe Sea can be a catalyst for peace, serving to eliminate potential \nconflicts between neighbouring States. We view it also, of course, as \nproviding a welcome opportunity for economic development through the \nexploitation of our marine resources. The Grenada delegation is \ntherefore happy that the Convention has been adopted and will be a \nsignatory to it in the near future.\n108.\tWith respect to South-South co-operation the People's \nRevolutionary Government of Grenada recognizes that despite the \npotential, progress has been slow. This is not surprising, however, \ngiven the dependent nature of the relationship between developed and \ndeveloping countries. There is an urgent need, for instance, to \naddress the problem of air and sea transport facilities necessary for \nrealizing the goals of greater South-South trade and cooperation.\n109.\tThe High-Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among \nDeveloping Countries, held at Caracas in 1981, did, however, begin \nthe process of defining more relevant concepts and operative \nmeasures, including the creation of an institutional framework that \nwould permit developing countries to carry forward the programme for \neconomic co-operation among developing countries with greater \ndynamism than in the past. With proper follow-up action this goal \ncould be realized.\n110.\tEven as much of the international community continues to \nsuffer from the debilitating economic crisis, it is being further \npauperized and deprived of the benefits of much of its economic and \nother resources by the persistent squandering of massive sums on \nsophisticated armaments which threaten the world and its peoples with \nextinction. Over the past few years, mankind has been forced to \nlisten to gruesome accounts of the production of increasing \nquantities of monstrous weapons, and has been constrained to \ncontemplate, in apparent helplessness, its own destruction. In this \nfrightening context, Grenada appeals to the nuclear Powers to reverse \nthe present trend of nuclear proliferation and to begin the process \nof meaningful arms control and arms reduction.\n111.\tGrenada sees no logic in the concepts of nuclear first strike \nor limited nuclear war. Such formulations are inherently \ncontradictory, if not reckless, and suggest a willingness on the part \nof one nuclear Power to experiment with its nuclear toys. Therefore, \nGrenada applauds the bold undertaking by the Soviet Union at the \nsecond special session on disarmament not to be the first to use \nnuclear weapons. We recognize the positive impact of that obligation \nand call upon other nuclear States to respond in like manner, in the \ninterest of preserving world peace. Once again, Grenada calls for the \npurposeful ratification of the SALT II agreement on the limitation of \nstrategic offensive arms. Grenada is resolutely committed to the \nprocess of lessening international tension and the promotion of world \npeace and disarmament. As a result, Grenada will support any serious \nproposal from any quarter aimed at bringing an end to the arms race \nand achieving world peace and social progress.\n112.\tThe world has just witnessed the worst episode of damage and \ngenocide since the Nazi era. This shameless act of cruelty comes as a \ndirect result of the irresponsible arming of Zionist Israel. The \nextent of United States economic and military support to Israel is \nirrefutable. Since June of this year, the sovereign territory of \nLebanon has been the testing ground for all sorts of American and \nIsraeli arms, to the detriment of thousands of human lives and of \nLebanese cities and villages. As the world witnessed this despicable \nact of genocide and plunder, and was enraged thereby, the United \nStates shrugged its international responsibility and failed to \nrestrain its Zionist ally. In short, the two had become one in the \nexercise of the so-called strategic alliance.\n113.\tOf course, the massacre of hundreds of innocent, helpless \nPalestinian refugees in their beds is an integral part of that \nscenario and cannot be divorced from it. In this regard, Grenada \njoins the international outcry against such butchery. We solemnly \ncondemn Israel for its invasion of Lebanon and the death and \nsuffering it has meted out to the Lebanese and Palestinian people.\n114.\tGrenada is staunch in the belief that the territorial \nintegrity and sovereignty of Lebanon must be respected and demands \nthe withdrawal of the Zionist occupation forces. We sincerely hope \nthat the Lebanese people will move towards national reconciliation \nand address themselves to the honourable task of national \nreconstruction. Accordingly, Grenada calls upon the international \ncommunity to render all possible assistance to the people of Lebanon \nat this critical time.\n115.\tIt is well known that the Middle East conflict derives from \nthe expulsion of the Palestinian people from their homeland. \nTherefore, the conflict situation existing in that region can be \nresolved only through the settlement of the Palestinian question. \nGrenada urges an expeditious settlement of this matter in accordance \nwith relevant United Nations resolutions.\n116.\tWe recognize the signal importance of the peace proposals put \nforward by the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference in September. These \nproposals represent a reasonable basis for a resolution of the \nArab-Israeli conflict, and Grenada is proud to give them its total \nsupport. At the same time, Grenada cannot accept in their entirety \nthe proposals submitted on 1 September by the United States \nPresident, Ronald Reagan, on the issue, since they offer no solution \nto the key issue of the creation of an independent Palestinian State. \nThis plan also seeks to marginalize if not negate the role and \nimportance of the PLO and is, therefore, untenable and manifestly \nshort-sighted.\n117.\tThe United Nations has recognized the PLO as the sole \nauthentic representative of the Palestinian people. Unfortunately, \nthe State of Israel and its powerful patron do not respect this \ndecision. However, it must now be clear to such forces that the \nexpulsion of the PLO from Beirut and its dispersal throughout the \nArab world do not amount to its defeat. In reality, the blood of the \nPalestinian martyrs and patriots serves as a fertilizer that \nnourishes their just cause. Grenada wishes to reaffirm its resolute \nsolidarity with the PLO and the Arab people of Palestine and condemns \nmost vehemently the atrocities committed against these people. We \nalso reject the expansionist and oppressive policies pursued by the \nBegin-Sharon regime in the occupied territories.\n118.\tWar continues in the Gulf area much to the detriment of the \npeoples of that part of the world and to the apparent delight of \nimperialism. We call upon Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran to \ncease hostilities, settle their disputes through peaceful means and \nproperly direct their resources to the task of national \nreconstruction.\n119.\tIt is well known that the inhabitants of the People's \nRepublic of Kampuchea are shaping a new society through various \ndemocratic structures. We categorically dismiss the \nimperialist-sponsored \\\"Kampuchea Coalition Government in Exile\\\" as an \nunmasked attempt to hide the bloody hand of the Pol Pot clique and to \ngive legitimacy to their counterrevolutionary activities. Grenada \nreiterates its support for the Government of the People's Republic of \nKampuchea.\n120.\tThe situation in the Korean peninsula continues to be a \nthreat to world peace. Grenada urges the speedy reunification of \nKorea. We also demand the withdrawal of all foreign military forces \nfrom the peninsula.\n121.\tGrenada is hopeful that a meaningful political settlement \nwill be achieved in Cyprus without further delay and that the \ncountry's sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity will be fully \nrestored and respected.\n122.\tSimilarly, we support the call for self-determination for the \npeople of East Timor.\n123.\tIt is clear that some members of the so-called contact group \non Namibia have lost all contact with reality and have resorted to \ndilatory tactics in the negotiations for independence for Namibia. \nThe unique electoral device of one man-two votes as posited by the \ncontact group is clearly inimical to the interests of SWAPO and has \nbeen rightly rejected by the frontline States. The improper \nintervention into the negotiation process by the United States, \nthrough its irrelevant demand for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from \nAngola as a pre-condition for the granting of independence to \nNamibia, is largely responsible for the present impasse. The United \nStates position is also inconsistent with Security Council resolution \n435 (1978) and is an attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of \nAngola.\n124.\tBesides, South Africa has been covertly preparing to alter \nthe internal Namibian constitution and administration, in an attempt \nto erode SWAPO's support and delay the granting of independence to \nNamibia by ignoring demands for elections supervised by the United \nNations. The treacherous incursions into Angola at critical points in \nthe negotiating process must be interpreted in this context.\n125.\tGrenada emphasizes its resolute support for SWAPO and \nstresses the inalienable right of the Namibian people to \nself-determination and full independence. Grenada further calls upon \nthe United Nations to take expeditious action to bring about \nindependence for Namibia, since it is clear that the negotiations are \nat a standstill.\n126.\tThe situation in southern Africa is characterized by South \nAfrica's determination to destabilize regional States through \neconomic pressure and sabotage, direct military intervention and the \nsponsoring of mercenaries. The experience of States like Mozambique, \nAngola, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Lesotho and Seychelles attests to \nthis truth. Grenada urges southern African States to strengthen the \nstructures of the Southern African Development Co-ordination \nConference. At the same time, we emphatically denounce South Africa's \nrepeated attacks on these States, its support for disruptive groups \nand bandits and its policy of economic destabilization.\n127.\tIn South Africa itself, the monstrous apartheid system has \nbeen better armed and, no doubt, is more firmly entrenched-for the \ntime being. Our black brothers and sisters are held in veritable \nconcentration camps. Black workers are paid starvation wages for long \nhours of hard labour. Their trade unions are outlawed and their \ndedicated leaders are hounded like beasts. Yet, when we hear homilies \nabout the rights of trade unions and the importance of upholding \nworkers' democracy, the South African abuses are never highlighted. \nFaced with this difficult situation, ANC continues to be the vanguard \nfor the liberation of the oppressed in South Africa. Grenada pledges \nits continued support for ANC and our brothers and sisters of South \nAfrica in their struggle for human rights and majority rule.\n128.\tThe issue of Western Sahara has led to unfortunate \ndevelopments within the GAU which directly threaten to compromise its \nfuture. Grenada respectfully urges its African brothers and sisters \nto resolve speedily the dispute over Western Sahara. We reaffirm our \nsupport for the POLISARIO Front and the Government and the people of \nthe Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic in their just struggle for \nself-determination, national independence and sovereignty.\n129.\tThe yearning of third world peoples for peace and stability \nhas given increasing popularity to the concept of regional zones of \npeace. Parallel to our own struggle in the Caribbean and Central \nAmerican region, our brothers whose shores are washed by the Indian \nOcean have been calling for their region to be recognized as a zone \nof peace.\n13C. Conscious of the warmongering tactics of certain imperialist \nelements in that part of the world, Grenada hails the determined \nefforts of the Governments and the peoples of Mozambique, the United \nRepublic of Tanzania, India, Democratic Yemen, Mauritius, Madagascar \nand Seychelles in this direction. We fully support their common \ndemand for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Indian Ocean; \nthe non-introduction and non-deployment of nuclear and other weapons \nof mass destruction; the cessation of military manoeuvres by the \nallies of South Africa and Israel; and the right of States to be free \nfrom the threat of invasion by mercenaries.\n131.\tThis vexing question of mercenary activity continues to \nthreaten the peace and stability of a number of poor, developing \ncountries, as evidenced by recent attempts by imperialist-backed \nmercenaries to overthrow the Seychelles Government. Despite limited \nattempts by some countries to deal with this problem at the national \nlevel, the international community lacks effective and comprehensive \nmachinery for this purpose.\n132.\tGrenada and other countries of the hemisphere are \nparticularly conscious of this problem, since the likelihood of \nmercenary invasion in our region, backed by certain imperialist State \nentities, is quite real.\n133.\tWe once more register our support for the Roc Committee on \nthe Drafting of an International Convention against the Recruitment, \nUse, Financing and Training of Mercenaries. However, we note the \ninability of that Committee to complete its assignment thus far. Once \nmore we urge that the work be expedited so that effective measures \ncan be taken to outlaw the recruitment, training, assembly, transit, \nfinancing and use of mercenaries. The situation is one of urgency.\n134.\tIn the Latin American and Caribbean region, the militaristic \npolicy of the largest Power in the hemisphere seems aimed at \ndetermining all issues on the basis of brute force and ruthless \neconomic might-hence the threats to Nicaragua, Cuba and Grenada. The \ncontinued economic blockade and military threats against Cuba; the \never-increasing threats against Nicaragua, including the training and \nuse of mercenaries from bases in neighbouring States; the attempts to \ndestabilize the revolutionary process in our own country, Grenada; \nthe illegal and provocative violation of our air space-all of these \nmilitaristic postures display an amazing and unfortunate lack of \nunderstanding on the part of the United States. We condemn and \ndeplore all efforts to pursue militaristic policies and policies of \nconfrontation in the Latin American and Caribbean region.\n133. With respect to the so-called Caribbean Basin Initiative, it is \nour view that this constitutes an attempt to sow the seeds of \ndivisiveness, and thus extend hegemony over countries in the region. \nThe \\\"donor country\\\" seeks by its so-called gifts to hold an entire \nregion to ransom by making a mockery of the concept of ideological \npluralism subscribed to by CARICOM member States and by the United \nNations system. This exposes the utter contempt with which it views \nthe sovereign and independent processes of the developing countries \nof the region.\n136.\tGrenada is seeking its own path to development and exercising \nits sovereign right to find its own solutions to the problems which \nhave for centuries confronted its people. We therefore reject the \narrogant condescension of those who seek to dictate rather than \ndiscuss, to isolate those with whom they disagree and to attempt to \nmake pawns of sovereign, independent peoples.\n137.\tWe insist on the inalienable right of every country, \nirrespective of its size, to be master of its destiny. Recent events \nin Western Europe have clearly shown that, in the interests of \ndevelopment, countries will defend their sovereign right to conduct \nbusiness wherever they wish.\n138.\tIntent on seeking an improved quality of life for its people, \nand concerned about the integral development of the Caribbean region, \nGrenada repeats the call for the Caribbean to be declared a zone of \npeace, independence and development. This proposal was first accepted \nin 1979 at the La Paz meeting of the Organization of American States. \nAt the seventh meeting of the Standing Committee of Foreign Ministers \nof Caricom in March this year, Grenada reiterated that call. The \nCaribbean must not be a zone of militarism, tension and confrontation.\n139.\tGrenada issues a strong call for negotiations between \nArgentina and the United Kingdom to resolve the issue of the Malvinas \nIslands. Only through genuine negotiations held under the auspices of \nthe United Nations can there be a satisfactory solution to the \nproblem. The sad issue of the Malvinas provides one of these \ninadvertent lessons of history which developing countries would do \nwell to note. In the final analysis our interests lie in recognizing \nour own unity in diversity, in recognizing the need of the countries \nof, Latin America and the Caribbean to create mechanisms for dealing \nwith problems peculiar to us.\n140., Grenada wishes to reiterate that one of the firm principles on \nwhich its foreign policy is based is anti-colonialism. Therefore we \ndeclare once more our unswerving support for the people of Puerto \nRico in their just struggle to attain self-determination and \nindependence. We have another call for the elimination of this cancer \nof colonialism from the Caribbean. We also express our very deep \nconcern over events in Central America, where scores of people have \nlost their lives or have been forced to flee their homeland in search \nof peace. In the light of Israel's present deplorable role in the \ninternational arena, we further express our profound concern at the \npresence of Israeli military advisers in Central America.\n141.\tWe also wish to express our unshakeable solidarity with our \nChilean brothers and sisters who are heroically resisting a brutal \nregime and many of whom have been driven from their homeland to \nlanguish in exile.\n142.\tMy Government wishes to express its total support for the \nstruggling people of El Salvador. It is our conviction that justice \nand peace will ultimately triumph in that long-suffering country.\n143.\tOnce more we wish to declare our unstinting support for the \nindependent Caribbean nations of Belize and Guyana in their \ndetermination to preserve full territorial integrity. We call on all \nparties concerned to resort to measures as outlined in the Charter of \nthe United Nations to find a peaceful solution to the disputes; any \nother approach to solving these disputes will be counterproductive \nand catastrophic.\n144.\tWe reaffirm our full support for the just claim of Bolivia to \nregain its access to the sea. We recognize that that country's \ndevelopment is seriously impeded by a lack of such facilities.\n145.\tI now turn to an issue of increasing urgency on the \ninternational scene, one that affects my country most intimately. It \nis the question of the special problems of small Island and small \nland-locked developing States. For three years, including twice \nbefore in this forum, Grenada, supported by others within that \ncategory, has called the attention of the international community, \nand in particular the richer and technologically advanced nations, to \nthe peculiar circumstances and needs occasioned by the phenomenon of \nsmallness. Addressing the Assembly at the 27th meeting of the \nthirty-fourth session, our Prime Minister, Maurice Bishop, called for \nsmallness to be recognized as a new dimension in economic relations \nand urged a heightened awareness of the inherent handicaps.\n146.\tLast year, at the 33rd meeting of the thirty-sixth session, \nwe went further. My delegation, in an effort to sensitize the \ninternational community to these issues, enumerated the economic and \nsocial consequences of smallness in the present world economic system \nand elaborated in addition a minimum programme for ongoing assistance \nto those States.\n147.\tLast year also, at the meetings of the Commonwealth Heads of \nGovernment in Australia and the General Assembly of the Organization \nof American States in Saint Lucia, my country continued its appeal to \nthe international community for special consideration in the face of \nthese characteristic developmental problems of this group of \ncountries, namely, small States.\n148.\tMore recently, at the meetings in London and Toronto of \nCommonwealth Finance Ministers and the World Bank and IMF, \nrespectively, Grenada and other members of this specially \ndisadvantaged group raised again this pressing and critically \nimportant issue. We have taken the initiative and are strongly \nconvinced, in the light of the current international economic \nsituation to which I earlier referred, that there is a need for a \nspecial working conference in 1983, involving the United Nations and \nits development agencies and the major international financial \ninstitutions, like the World Bank, to examine the economic problems \nof this group of countries and to make practical recommendations for \ntheir solution. Out of that conference should come an international \naction programme with a specific time-table for implementation. For \nexample, consider the matter of hurricanes and other natural \ndisasters which frequently devastate the economies of small States in \none blow. Often international relief, always so deeply appreciated, \ntakes months to arrive-hence the need for a rapidly deployable \nrehabilitation scheme for such contingencies. Therefore, we appeal to \nall our brothers and sisters in small island and small land-locked \ndeveloping States and also the international community for support on \nthis vital matter, since any improvement in our economic situation \nmust have a positive effect on the wider global community.\n149.\tIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to reaffirm its \ncommitment to the noble principles enshrined in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. Even in the face of the crisis in international \nrelations, we are steadfast in the belief that the United Nations \nsystem constitutes the ultimate guarantee for peace and international \nsecurity. For our part we wish once again to express our willingness \nto engage in dialogue at any level whatever with a view to promoting \nregional peace and co-operation, thereby contributing to the \nconstruction of a more just and peaceful world.\n"

        "file_text": "At a time when mankind is frantically searching \nfor solutions to the problems of wars, disasters, \nhunger, poverty, violence and racism, it is \nindeed heartening that this body can meet and, \nwith collective determination, join the crusade \nin the search for a nobler and dignified destiny \nfor the human race. The task of saving mankind \nfrom wars and destruction is the collective \nresponsibility of Kt<; world's peoples, but the \nrole of individuals in the acceleration of this \nprocess must not be over\u00aclooked.\n317.\tIn this regard, I should like on behalf \nof the Government and people of Liberia to extend \nto the new President of the General Assembly my \nwarmest congratulations on his election to his \nhigh office. We are confident that his long years \nof experience in diplomacy will enable him to \ndischarge, with the utmost sincerity, the \nresponsibilities entrusted to him.\n318.\tI should also like to take this \nopportunity to offer thanks to his able and \ndynamic predecessor, Mr. Kittani, who guided the \nGeneral Assembly through the thirty-sixth regular \nsession and the second special session on \ndisarmament with the utmost dedication and \nefficiency.\n319.\tWe wish at this time to make special \nreference to the remarkable performance of the \nSecretary- General, who, after only nine months \nin office, has convinced us beyond all reasonable \ndoubt that our choice was a good one. We ask him \nto continue to discharge his duty with the \ncourage and convictions of his conscience. His \nfirst report on the work of the Organization \noutlines effectively the major problems and \nweaknesses of the Organization. We endorse the \nrecommendations in his report and are convinced \nthat, if implemented, they could strengthen the \nOrgani\u00aczation and restore to it the role \nenvisaged for it in the Charter.\n320.\tWe must pay homage, finally, to that \ngreat statesman of tolerance, integrity and \ndevotion, the former Secretary-General, Kurt \nWaldheim. His con\u00actribution to the progress of \nmankind will forever be stamped upon the minds of \nall those who fight for peace, justice and human \ndecency. He came to us as a son of Europe. He \nleft as a son of mankind, respected, admired and \ntrusted\u2014beautiful accolades for a man of peace.\n321.\tThe challenge facing humanity is to \nrefine the negative instincts of man, those which \nallow for the domination of others, for the \ndestruction of other peoples' cultures and values \nand for the development of those mental \naberrations such as racial superiority, parochial \nand aggressive nationalisms and individual and \nnational acquisitiveness with the attributes of \nexploitation, poverty and stagnation on the one \nhand, and affluence and indifference to human \nsufferings on the other. The refinement of man's \nnegative instincts will allow for the common \nunderstanding of human problems and make more \nmeaningful the search for fraternal relations \nbetween peoples.\n322.\tThe task of human refinement must begin \nat the national level, for it is at this level \nthat the con\u00acsequences of negative instincts are \nmost profound. Classes and groups which have no \nrespect for the rights of their own people will \nhave no regard for the rights of other peoples. \nIt thus becomes necessary for the national entity \nto purge itself of the unsavory attributes of \nman's inhumanity to man in order to join the \nsearch for international harmony and morality.\n323.\tMy country, in answering the challenge \nwhich history has posed to us as a people, took \nthe path of revolution to resolve the \ncontradictions in our society and awakened the \nconsciousness of our people to begin the frontal \nassault on the citadels of privilege, ethnic \narrogance and elitism. We are proud to say to the \nworld, to all men of conscience and decency, that \nthrough the struggle of our people and with the \nblood of our martyrs we destroyed an oligarchy \nwhich was brutal, arrogant and insensitive to the \nneeds and aspirations of the vast majority of our \npeople, as all oligarchies are. It is our \nGod-given right to destroy the shackles of \nservitude and allow our people to begin the \nprocess of making their own history.\n324.\tHere in this public forum, we pay homage to \nthe memory of our martyrs, especially to the \nhun\u00acdreds killed on 14 April 1979, when the \nformer regime unleashed a reign of terror on our \ndefenseless people who had raised their voices to \nquestion the right of that oligarchy to increase \nthe price of the staple food for its own profits. \nEternal glory to our martyrs!\n325.\tWhen people make revolution and advance \nsociety a step further, they are morally \nresponsible to show that they are more refined, \nmore decent and more dignified than those they \noverthrew. This is the only way that one can give \ncredence to the historical movement. In keeping \nwith our commitment to build a society where men \nwill live as brothers and be responsible for the \nwelfare of each and all, we decided to \nrehabilitate all those who had in the past \nparticipated in the maltreatment of the people or \ncondoned with their silence the injustices in \nsociety. In this regard, my Government has \nreleased all political prisoners and thus stands \nas one of the few countries in the world without \na single political prisoner. Also, to ease the \nburden of adjustment in the new society, we have \nreturned confiscated properties to former \npolitical prisoners.\n326.\tAs a further testimony to my Government's \ncommitment to respect the aspirations of the \npeople, our head of State, Commander-in-Chief \nSamuel Doe has proclaimed 12 April 1985\u2014the fifth \nanniversary of our revolution\u2014as the date for the \nreturn of our country to a democratically elected \ncivilian Govern\u00acment. In keeping with this \ncommitment, the Consti\u00actutional Committee \nappointed on the first anniversary of the \nrevolution is completing the final draft cf a new \nConstitution and drawing up the modalities for \nelec\u00actions. This is the state of affairs in my \ncountry 29 months after our revolution.\n327.\tI shall now make some remarks about the \ninter\u00acnational situation. It is indeed a sad \ncommentary on the state of world affairs that the \nopening of the thirty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly and the first observance of \nInternational Day of Peace on 21 September 1982 \nshould have taken place amid the ghastly specters \nof the Beirut massacre and the con\u00actinued war \nbetween the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq.\n328.\tElsewhere, the international situation \nremains fraught with tension. There seems to be a \ngradual decline in the use and effectiveness of \nmultilateral institutions and international \norganizations. Alliances and intergovernmental \norganizations that offered hope for a stable \nworld order in the period after the Second World \nWar are being threatened with disin\u00actegration at \nthe very core.\n329.\tThe non-aligned movement, which emerged \nto dismantle the exploitative colonial system and \ndid indeed provide an alternative to East-West \ncon\u00acfrontational politics for the developing \nnations of Africa, Asia and Latin America in the \nimmediate post-war era, has failed to convene the \nConference of Heads of State or Government on \nschedule for the first time in its 21-year \nhistory because of the conflict in the Gulf \nregion.\n330.\tSimilarly, the OAU, which has served as \nthe motivating force in accelerating the African \nliberation struggle and the search for African \nsolutions to African problems, has not been \nsuccessful in convening the Assembly of Heads of \nState and Government this year because of the \nadmission of the Sahraoui Arab Democrats Republic \nto the OAU. However, we are pleased to note that \nefforts are being made to resolve the issue. My \nGovernment has undertaken the responsibility of \nconsulting with other African Govern\u00acments on \nways to end the division within our organi\u00aczation.\n331.\tRecently, our head of State sent a team \nof emissaries to seven West African countries to \ndeliver messages relating to the current problem \nwithin the OAU. We are certain that in the end \nAfrican maturity will prevail and the OAU will \nsurvive, strengthened in its principles and \nrededicated to the total liberation and unity of \nthe African continent.\n332.\tMeanwhile, in the international system, \nmany States Members of the United Nations are \nincreasingly resorting to unilateral action, often \nbypassing the United Nations without regard to \ntheir obligations under the Charter. Resolutions \nof the Security Coun\u00accil and the General Assembly \nadopted through painstaking efforts and sometimes \nby consensus are being ignored by Member States \nunder the pretext of preserving national identity \nand security.\n333.\tWith respect to the global economic \nsituation, indications are that the world economy \nis experiencing greater instability than at any \ntime since the Great Depression. The developed \nmarket economies are characterized by slow \ngrowth, persistent inflation, high unemployment, \nprolonged monetary instability, intensified \nprotectionist pressures, structural \nmalad-justments and uncertain long-term growth \nprospects.\n334.\tFor their part, many developing countries \ncon\u00actinue to experience very low or even negative \nper capita growth, with severe constraints placed \non their development efforts by maladjustment in \ninternational economic relations, natural \nconditions and high energy costs.\n335.\tAlso, falling prices for commodities \nwhich are their major sources of income have \nimpeded their ability to meet interest payments \non loans, let alone repay the loans. Moreover, \nhigher interest rates for new debts and redded \naccess to external borrowing have all contributed \nto the economic difficulties of the developing \ncountries, thus augmenting the poverty and \ndeprivation of their peoples.\n336.\tThe optimism generated by the \nInternational Meeting on Co-operation and \nDevelopment, held at Cancun in October 1981, has \nyet to produce progress towards a movement in the \nglobal round of negotiations on international \neconomic issues.\n337.\tThese trends point to a disquieting \nsituation in the international system. For the \nweakening or collapse of multilateral \ninstitutions and regional organizations and the \nvicious cycle of poverty, with its attributes of \ndependence and underdevelopment, would serve to \nremove heretofore effective platforms upon which \nsmall developing nations exercised moral strength \nand courage for collective bargaining and \nsecurity.\n338.\tThe potential to unleash greater horrors \nand sufferings upon mankind must be checked by \nthe determined and honest efforts of the \ninternational community to reverse the present \ndrift towards eco\u00acnomic and political \ncatastrophe. My Government therefore calls on all \nMember States of this world body to rededicate \nthemselves to the principles and spirit of the \nCharter. The desperate lality of the \ninternational situation requires a resolution of \nthe apparent contradiction between the professed \naspira\u00actions of the United Nations and the \nunwillingness on the part of Member States to \nsupport those aspirations. A new global \ninitiative is needed to promote the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes in order to save the world \nfrom the ravages of war and prevent future \nhorrors of death and destruction such as those \nthe world has witnessed recently.\n339.\tI tum now to the subject of southern \nAfrica. In a world of conflicts and mistrust, it \nis reassuring to note the willingness to press \nahead with negotiations on the part of the \nparties to the Namibian question. In this \nconnection, I wish to state emphatically that my \nGovernment continues to view Security Council \nresolution 435 (1978) as the basis for a solution \nto the Namibian conflict. We welcome the \ninitiatives of the contact group of five Western \nStates and the African front-line States, and \nNigeria, to help overcome obstacles in the path \nof the implementation of the resolution for the \nindependence of Namibia. We should add that the \nindependence of that African Territory cannot be \ndelayed indefinitely.\n340.\tAlso, we should like to caution against \nlinking a settlement of the Namibian question to \nthe presence of Cuban troops in Angola. Any \nattempt to do that is morally wrong and \ndangerous, as the freedom of one people cannot be \nheld hostage to the alteration of the sovereign \ndecision of another people.\n341.\tToday, millions of Africans continue to \nlanguish under the despicable system of\tin South \nAfrica. My Government considers the perpetuation \nof this oppressive system as an intolerable \naffront to the dignity of the black race. We \ntherefore urge the international community and \nmen of conscience every\u00acwhere to lend every \nconceivable support to the total elimination of \napartheid in all its inhuman forms. In this \nregard, we welcome the launching of 1982 as the \nInternational Year of Mobilization for Sanctions \nagainst South Africa in order to make world \npublic opinion more aware of the grave situation \nin that part of Africa and also to win maximum \ninternational support for comprehensive and \nmandatory sanctions against the racist Republic, \nas laid down in Chapter VII of the Charter.\n342.\tOn the subject of the Middle East, the \nhorrifying scenes of slaughter in Beirut should \nonce more serve as a reminder to the \ninternational community never to allow historical \nsympathies to render us impotent in confronting \ncontemporary aggression. The inter\u00acnational \noutrage and revulsion generated by the mas\u00acsacre \nshould convince those who are determined and \nconsistent in committing such atrocities to \nabandon the notion that brute force is the only \nway to achieve peace and security. The \nsenselessness of the massacre can serve only to \nintensify the cycle of violence, suspicion and \nbitterness.\n343.\tMy Government is convinced that the \ndispersal of the Palestinians or the resort to \nexterminating them cannot provide a solution to \nthe problems of the Middle East. Only recognition \nof the inalienable rights of the Palestinian \npeople to a State of their own will lead to a \nlasting peace in that region. Additionally, there \nmust be a return to the pre-1967 borders and all \nStates in the region must be willing to recognize \nthe right of each and all to live in peace within \nsecure boundaries.\n344.\tIn this regard, my Government supports \ninitia\u00actives aimed at the restoration of the \nsovereignty of Lebanon and calls for the urgent \nreconstruction of that war-torn country.\n345.\tTurning to the Kampuchean question, my \nGovernment believes that no effective solution to \nthe problems in that troubled country can be \nachieved without a just and lasting political \nsettlement. Such a political settlement should \nprovide for the withdrawal of all foreign troops \nfrom Kampuchea and ensure respect for the \nsovereignty, independence, territorial integrity \nand the non-aligned status of that country.\n346.\tSome of the problems that cloud the \ninter\u00acnational horizon are rooted in the past. \nThe Korean question, which for many years has \nbeen a focus of the concern of the Organization, \nremains unresolved and explosive. The \npostponement of its solution could lead to a \nrenewal of hostilities on the Korean peninsula \nand threaten international peace and security. In \naccordance with the principles of the Charter of \nthe United Nations and of the joint communique of \n1972/9 issued by the two Korean parties, my \nGovern\u00acment urges that they both demonstrate \ntheir willingness to settle the Korean question \nby peaceful means.\n347.\tThe successful conclusion of the \nnegotiations and the adoption of the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea' \nrepresent a major step forward in our attempts to \nestablish order in the seas. The Convention is \nbased on the concept that the resources of the \nsea-bed are the common heritage of mankind. One \nsignificant outcome of the negotiations is a set \nof treaty provisions for States to co-operate \nregionally and globally to protect and preserve \nthe marine environment. This part of the \nConvention is consistent with the Declaration of \nthe United Nations Conference on the Human \nEnvironment.^\\\" We express our thanks to all of \nthose who laboured tirelessly to bring these \nnegotiations to fruition. My Government, \ntherefore, urges all Member States to sign and \nratify the Con\u00acvention, which will be opened for \nsignature as of 6 December 1982, in Jamaica.\n348.\tThe post-war period has witnessed an \nunabated acceleration of the arms race. This race \nhas consumed an increasing proportion of the \nworld resources as well as a greater percentage \nof internationally traded goods and services. \nThis situation has contributed to a significant \ndiversion of globalresources from pro\u00acductive to \nnon-productive sectors. Statistics show that in a \nworld where expenditures on armaments amount to \nabout $700 billion annually there are 870 \nmil\u00aclion adults who cannot read and write; 500 \nmillion people who have no jobs or are less than \nfully employed; 130 million children who are \nunable to attend primary school; 450 million \npeople who suffer from hunger or malnutrition; an \nannual infant mortality rate of 12 million babies \nwho die before their first birthday; 2 billion \npeople who do not have safe water to drink; and \n250 million people who live in urban slums or \nshanty towns. Serious efforts and concrete \nactions towards disarmament could release vast \nresources for the constructive cause of human \ndevel\u00acopment and the establishment of a more \nequitable international economic order.\n349.\tIt is against that background that my \nGovern\u00acment expresses regret at the disappointing \nresults of the second special session on \ndisarmament. We call upon the world community not \nto relent in the pursuit of the objectives of \ngeneral and complete disarmament, for on this \nhinges the survival of mankind.\n350.\tOn the subject of international economic \nco-operation, reports show that the fundamental \nprob\u00aclem facing the international community is to \nrestore the growth momentum in the world economy \nand achieve the growth targets in the developing \ncoun\u00actries as set forth in the International \nDevelopment Strategy for the Third United Nations \nDevelopment Decade. The realization of those \nobjectives requires that urgent and prompt \nattention be given to the critical problems \nconfronting the developing countries, such as \nunequal exchange on international commodity mar' \n^s, finance, food and energy.\n351.\tThere is a need for greater South-South \nco-oper\u00acation within the framework of the Caracas \nProgramme of Action^' in order to break the cycle \nof dependence, poverty and underdevelopment. The \ndeveloping coun\u00actries must undertake concerted \nefforts within the context of collective \nself-reliance to halt the misery of their \npeoples, since experience has shown that the \nsurvival of a people must begin with their own \nefforts.\n352.\tWe are convinced that in a world of \ngrowing expectation and increasing communications \nbetween nations and social groups, a lack of \nresponse to the pressing demand for more \nunderstanding, tolerance and selflessness can \nbecome a real source of conflict at both the \nnational and the international levels. We are in \nan interdependent world and must collec\u00actively \nface the challenge to remove people from the edge \nof survival and ward off catastrophe.\n353.\tThe state of the world today calls for \nthe utmost tolerance and understanding among men. \nWe have the moral responsibility to save our \nworld from the misery and destruction which twice \nin the past have brought human society to the \nbrink of extinction. We therefore declare from \nthis rostrum, before the entire world, that the \nchildren of tomorrow deserve a better world \norder, free from the suspicion, violence and \nhatred of today. They must be able to live in a \nworld where men will be responsive to the needs \nof other men and where the enlightened \nconsciousness of the people will usher in the \nbrotherhood of mankind. This, and only this, can \nsave humanity from the ravages of war.\n"

        "file_text": "  My first words will be words of congratulation\nto Mr. Hollai on his unanimous election to the\npresidency of this thirty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly. It is a choice which does\nhonour to his outstanding qualities as a person\nand an experienced diplomat and is also a tribute\nto his country, the People's Republic of Hungary,\nwhose positive contribution to the work of the\nOrganization is well known. It is a pleasure for\nme to assure him of my delegation's complete\nco-operation as he carries out the difficult but\nexalted task of guiding our work during this\nperiod of disarray, instability and violence in\nthe affairs of the world. I take this opportunity\nalso to pay a tribute to his outstanding\npredecessor in this post. Mr. Kittani of Iraq,\nfor the competence and patience without\nfirmness-which he demonstrated as he carried out\nthe lofty functions entrusted to him during the\nthirty-sixth session and the special sessions of\nthe General Assembly held this year. Finally\n1should like to express my admiration for the\nSecretary-General for the clarity, courage and\ncompetence with which he has been fulfilling for\nalmost a year now the prestigious functions\nvested in him by the Organization. We find\nstunning proof of these qualities in his report\non the work of the Organization and which raises\nthe vital question for the international\ncommunity-the future of the United Nations.\n\n264. It cannot be disputed that the erosion of\nthe authority of the Organization has for several\nyears now been a source of major concern to the\ninternational community. Never indeed has the\nfeeling of such a collapse been so keenly felt in\nthe world. Without respect for the principles of\nthe Charter, there could be no international\nsociety that would be peaceful, harmonious and\nbalanced, yet they have been systematically\nflouted. Instead of those principles the threat\nor use of force is often resorted to in the\nsettlement of disputes. The revival of the cold\nwar, the hegemonistic rivalries of the major\nPowers and the self-centred attitude of Member\nStates bring about a situation in which the\nUnited Nations is usually bypassed in the search\nfor solutions to the problems which the world\nfaces.\n265. When it happens that countries turn to the\nUnited Nations, it is often for the reason of\ngiving free rein to ideological confrontations\nfor propaganda purposes, or as an alibi. so that\nonly their own point of view prevails. If they do\nnot succeed, they do not hesitate to block the\nfunctioning of the Security Council by abusing\nthe right of veto. Nevertheless this right was\nestablished in order to serve as an instrument to\nsafeguard the priceless common good of peace and\nsecurity in the world; it was not meant to be a\nshield against sanctions that the Organization\ncan apply when there are flagrant violations of\nthe principles of the Charter.\n266. Moreover, we must feel alarmed at the\nserious financial difficulties, resulting from\nthe parsimonious contributions of Member States,\nparticularly the most wealthy, in the operations\nof the specialized agencies, which were\nestablished with the noble purpose of promoting\nthe harmonious and unified development of our\ncountries.\n267. Regardless of what idea one might have of\nthe role of the United Nations, it is the\nconviction of Cameroon, a former ward of the\nOrganization, that the Organization must remain\nthe single preferred instrument for maintaining\ninternational peace and security, the\nirreplaceable forum for international\nnegotiations and the tribune of the conscience of\nmankind.\n268. That is why we have constantly deplored the\nparalysis and the crumbling of the credibility of\nthe United Nations as a place for the settlement\nof international disputes during this period of\ntension and confusion, when it should enjoy\nauthority commensurate with the scope and the\ncomplexity of the burning issues of our time.\n269. Unfortunately the inclusion in the agenda of\nthis session of numerous questions that have\nfaced the world community for decades testifies\nto the growing weakening of our institution.\nAmong them we must cite, above all, the questions\nof disarmament. It was a matter of concern for\nall States even before the establishment of the\nUnited Nations, and that concern has been revived\nby the acute psychosis aroused by the threat of a\nnuclear holocaust that looms over mankind.\n270. In spite of long years of negotiation, of\nrecommendations of the General Assembly, and\nvehement protest on the part of the public, the\nsituation remains explosive because of the\nabsence of the political will among the major\nPowers, all of which have increased their\nmilitary expenditures and are continuing to\nmanufacture the most sophisticated and\nincreasingly deadly weapons.\n271. At the second special session devoted to\ndisarmament, which was held in June in New York,\nthe Assembly did not even manage to adopt a\nconsensus text as it did at the first special\nsession on disarmament in 1978. The sole\nachievement of that session was the granting of a\nfew disarmament fellowships. That surely proves\nthat the major Powers and their antagonistic\nmilitary alliances fighting for domination of the\nworld are not yet ready to join in a substantive\ndialogue that could lead us resolutely towards\nthe general and complete disarmament advocated in\nnumerous resolutions of the United Nations.\n272. The question of the Middle East, which has\nbeen before us since 1947, has undergone more and\nmore tragic developments, which have horrified\nand alarmed the international community, since\nthe invasion of Lebanon on 6 June of this year.\nWe vigorously condemn the hideous massacres of\nwomen children and old people in the Palestinian\ncamps in west Beirut. It is deplorable that the\nresolutions and decisions adopted by the Security\nCouncil on the question of the Middle East,\nparticularly with regard to Palestine, have\nremained a dead letter.\n273. As we' have never ceased to state  the\nsolution of the Palestinian problem is the key to\nany just and lasting overall settlement of the\nquestion of the Middle East. This implies that\nIsrael, which, like the other States in the\nregion, has the right to live in peace within\nsecure and recognized boundaries, must with draw\nfrom the Arab territories occupied since 1967\nincluding Jerusalem, and must recognize the\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people\nrepresented by the PLO, including the right to\nhave an Arab Palestinian homeland.\n274. The time has certainly come for the\nintensive efforts at present under way to end the\nlong tragedy being played out in the Middle East\nto take into account these fundamental facts;\notherwise international peace and security will\nremain threatened in that particularly sensitive\nregion of the world, which could serve as the\ndetonator for a world-wide catastrophe.\n275. The Namibian crisis and the base policy of\napartheid of the racist South Mrican regime\nconstitute in Africa two examples of typical\nsituations whose worsening over the period of\nthree decades constitutes a humiliating defiance\nof the international community In spite of the\nvarious means set forth in the Charter for ending\nthese anachronistic and universally condemned\nsituations, South Africa has not yielded an inch\n0 ground, in spite of the numerous statements and\nthe pretences of negotiation repeatedly launched\nin order to give the impression that it is\nprepared to co-operate with the United Nations in\nsettling these questions.\n276. Even though it IS a decolonization question,\nand even though it is so clearly defined that\nthere can be no doubt about it, the question of\nNamibia which has been under examination since\nthe first session of the AsseJ1lbly, in 1946, is\nstill on the agenda 36 years later.\n277. Nevertheless, it is important to recall that\nthe patient and laborious efforts of the\ninternational community have finally made it\npossible to c()me up with a broad consensus, with\nwhich South Africa has associated itself, to\nbring about a solution of the problem within the\nframework of Security Council resolution 435\n(1978). While that resolution remains the basis\nfor any peaceful solution to bring about\nauthentic independence for Namibia, the delays\nand turnabouts to which South Africa has\naccustomed us raise \u00a7some doubts about the real\nwillingness of the racist minority of Pretmia to\nrelease its grip on that international territory.\n278. The same is true for the inhumane policy of\napartheid, which has been unanimously condemned\nby the General Assembly as a crime against\nhumanity and which has been recognized by the\nSecurity Council as being a threat to\ninternational peace and security Nevertheless,\nhaving been outlawed and banished from the\ninternational community, South Mrica continues to\nevade the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII\nof the Charter, and continues to strengthen its\nrepressive machinery against the black majority,\nwhich is still denied the most elementary human\nrights.\n279. The criminal obstinacy of the racist regime\nof Pretoria can be explained only by the powerful\nsup-port it has been enjoying even within the\nOrganization, which it uses to carry out with\nimpunity acts of aggression against neighbouring\nAfrican States. We condemn those acts, which\ncreate and maintain in southern Africa a climate\nof instability and dangerous tension. We reaffirm\nour solidarity with the Namibian people in their\nstruggle to regain their independence and to\nenjoy all their rights under the aegis of SWAPO,\ntheir sole authentic representative. We also\nstand shoulder to shoulder with the front-line\nAfrican States, which have willingly been making\nheavy sacrifices so that the liberty and dignity\nof the black man in southern Africa may triumph.\n\n279.\tAll of us are well aware of the many very\nclear and firm resolutions and decisions of the\nGeneral Assembly and 'lf the Security Council on\nother important questions which have not yet been\nresolved and which give rise to instability,\ntension and con-fusion, all of which are\ndisturbing the international climate.\n\n280.\tFirst there is the question of Cyprus. In\nthis regard we have on many occasions asked for\nthe withdrawal of the foreign troops from that\ncountry as a basis for a settlement of this\nquestion, and we have reaffirmed the necessity to\nrespect the territorial integrity, the unity and\nthe non-alignment of that State. It is high time\nthe resolutions adopted on that matter were\nimplemented.\n\n282.\tWith regard to Kampuchea, again we must\nemphasize that the solution can only be a\npolitical one and it must not be interfered with\nfrom outside in any way. Therefore we wish to\nreaffirm that the Kampuchean people itself has\nthe right to decide its own .future and its\npolitical, economic and social options.\nEverything should be done to promote the\nachievement of those objectives.\n\n283.\tThe same is true  of Afghanistan, where\nthe situation still threatens the peace and\nsecurity of the whole of the region of South-West\nAsia. Here again, the withdrawal of foreign\ntroops and total respect\n\nfor the independence, sovereignty, territorial\nintegrity and non-aligned status of that country\nare in our view of .fundamental-importance to the\nsettlement of the question.\n\n284. We are deeply troubled by the alarming\ndevelopment of these problems, which are of\nfundamental concern to the international\ncommunity.\n\n28Sr The difficulties experienced by the United\nNations in playing its decisive role in the\nsafeguarding of international peace and security\nhave also prevented I it from effectively\nfulfilling another part of its lofty'\nmission-:-to achieve international co-operation\nin solving international problems of an economic\nand social character. In this regard the delay in\nthe launching of the global negotiations\nenvisaged in General Assembly resolution 34/138\nis an obvious example.\n\n286. Despite the major concessions that have been\nmade by the Group of 77 and the political will\nthat\n\n\nwas evident in that Group throughout the\nconsultations that took place during the\nthirty-sixth session, that resolution remains\nunimplemented because of the intransigence of\nsome industrialized countries. This blockage\ncannot but have negative and destabilizing\neffects upon the fragile economies of the\ndeveloping countries, because some of the\nessential objectives of the International\nDevelopment Strategy for the Third United Nations\nDevelopment Decade, such as increased official\ndevelopment aid or the mobilization of resources\nin favour of the least-developed countries, have\nnot been achieved within the envisaged timetable.\n\n287. The balance-sheet of the Third United\nNations Conference on the Law of the Sea\ndemonstrates that with regained and increased\nsolidarity and political will it is possible to\nattain results that safeguard the basic interests\nof all States and enhance the prestige of the\nOrganization. Indeed, after eight years of\nintensive and thorny discussions the negotiations\non the law of the sea led to the adoption last\nsummer of a new Convention dealing with all\naspects of this problem. How can one not regret\nthe reluctance of some countries to associate\nthemselves with that result? We urgently appeal\nto them to join in the general consensus.\n\n288. The state of the world economy, which is\ndominated by recession, unemployment, widespread\ninflation and monetary instability, gives us\nanother reason for deep concern because it\naffects all sectors of activity in an countries,\nparticularly the counties of the third world,\nwhich indeed are the major victims, as is\nindicated in the reports of all specialized\nagencies, particularly the World Bank, as well as\nIMF.\n\n289. Indeed, the situation of the developing\ncountries, and particularly the least developed,\nis extremely critical. Their current account\ndeficits are growing because of the continuous\ndeterioration in the terms of trade and rising\ninterest rates, whereas increased recourse to\ncapital markets and reserves to finance these\ndeficits burdens their external debt further and\nreduces their development opportul1lities.\n\n290.\tIn the view of my delegation this crisis\ncan be resolved only through implementation of\nmeasures on which there has been common agreement\nwithin the framework of the new international\neconomic order.\n\n291.\tWe should be wrong if we did not begin to\nface this problem with a sense of solidarity. It\nwould be useless for us to continue to resort to\nself-interested measures such as restrictive\npolicies exemplified by increased protectionism\nand some essentially\n\nmonetarist choices. Indeed the world economy as a\nwhole is taking a dangerous turn, and the\naftermath may be socio-political problems that\nmay threaten the very existence of young nations.\n\n292. Responsibility for this state of affairs\nrests basically with the developed countries, not\nall of which, apparently, are yet convinced that\nsolution of the current economic crisis requires\nan increasingly global approach rather than\nsimple domestic readjustments that in the final\nanalysis are merely temporarily palliatives. This\napproach deliberately disregards the true\ninterdependence of all the actors on the world\neconomic stage that has so often been\ndemonstrated by experience.\n\n293. So far as Cameroon is concerned, as has\nfrequently been stated by its head of State,\nthere can be no doubt that at this time the\nlaunching of global negotiations in the framework\nof the United Nations is the best way to promote\namong States the development of just and\nequitable economic relations. World economic\nturmoil can be alleviated only within a climate\nof co-operation, joint effort and dialogue\nbetween States and the peoples of all nations.\nThis means that international relations must be\norganized democratically and it presupposes a\nreal desire equitably to readjust relations\nbetween industrialized and third-world countries,\nin the context of world-wide solidarity.\n\n294. The United Nations was created to safeguard\ncertain ideals and principles that would\nguarantee international peace and security and\npromote the progress and united development of\nMember States while respecting a code of conduct\nwhose principles are clearly defined by the\nCharter. For that reason in the Charter the\nfounding  fathers of the Organization formally\nenjoined us to practise tolerance, to live in\npeace in a spirit of good-neighbourliness, to\nreject the use of force in the settlementof\nconflicts and to have recourse to international\ninstitutions to promote the economic and social\nprogress of peoples.\n\n295. A single generation separates us from the\nsolemn proclamation of that commitment. In view\nof some of the painful, indeed intolerable,\nsituations we have just mentioned, we feel we\nhave largely lost sight of that commitment, which\nwas freely entered into. The discrepancy between\nthe ideals of the Charter to which Member States\nsubscribed and the: actual conduct of those\nStates is a fundamental cause of the crisis\nbesetting the Organization, which, need it be\nreiterated, is no more than a mirror of our\nsociety.\n\n296. The expansion of the United Nations with the\nemergence of young nations has enhanced its\nuniversalist vocation and that means that all\nMember States must reaffirm their loyalty to the\nOrganization so that it can play its full role.\nThis increased universalization, which the law of\nthe majority has legitimized, must be the\nfoundation of international legal order. However,\nin our view this development has led the great\nPowers to feel disappointment-so much so that the\nOrganization is largely left to one side in the\nsettlement of the major problems affecting the\nfate of all peoples. We certainly recognize the\nparticular responsibilities of those Powers in\nthe conduct of world affairs. But, in a world in\nwhich the progress of science and technology has\naccentuated the interdependence of nations, we\nshall continue to reiterate that no State or\ngroup of States, however powerful can in and of\nitself solve mankind's problems.\n\n297. It is therefore a matter of urgency that we\nreturn to what inspired the creation of the\nOrganization and strongly support the wise\nproposal of the Secretary-General that a special\nseries of Security Council meetings be convened\nat the highest level to seek ways and means to\nreimbue that essential organ with the\neffectiveness and authority it needs to discharge\nthe special responsibilities conferred upon it by\nthe Charter.\n\n298. We are gratified that the Secretary-General\nhas unambiguously raised the question of the very\nusefulness of the United Nations. What is\ninvolved is whether we, the Member States, are\nready to let the Organization die a death similar\nto that of the League of Nations or whether we\nare determined to revitalize it by ensuring that\nour conduct accords with the principles and\nideals of the Charter.\n\n299. For Cameroon, the answer is clear. As Mr.\nAhmadou Ahidjo said from this same rostrum more\nthan 10 years ago:\n\n\\\"The unity of man's destiny is today more\nconcrete and more evident than ever before. For\u2022\nthe first time in history, mankind is consciously\nbecoming a unified whole. For the first time, man\nhas at his disposal the means of shaping his own\ndestiny, allaying poverty and triumphing over\nviolence.\n\\\"Is it utopian to ask the United Nations, which,\nwe repeat, embodies our hopes for a better world,\nto deploy all its resources so as to ensure that\nour era, which sees a universal civilization\ntaking shape, is the beginning of a reign of\ngenuine brotherhood in the world?..\n"

        "file_text": "64.\t Mr. President, I have the honor to convey to you and, through you, to the representatives greetings from my August Sovereign His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bucram Shah Dev and his best wishes for the success of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\n65.\tI have the great pleasure to extend to you, Sir, on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, our sincere congratulations on your election as President Ot this session of the General Assembly. You represent a country with which Nepal has friendly relations. We are confident that, with your experience, skill and wisdom, you will guide the work of this session to a successful conclusion. I also wish to express our appreciation to Mr. Kittani of Iraq, who guided the business of the last session of the General Assembly with impartiality and efficiency. I avail myself of this opportunity to pay our compliments to the Secretary-General for his exemplary devotion to the ideals of the United Nations and for the admirable manner in which he has been carrying out the heavy responsibilities of his high office.\nMr. Lusaka (Zambia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\n66.\tThe past year has been less than reassuring in many respects. Hie world political situation has not shown any sign of improvement. East-West relations and, in particular, relations between the two superpowers have further deteriorated, affecting a whole range of relationships in the international arena. Foreign military interventions in some parts of the world have not ended. Regional conflicts containing potential threats to international peace and security have assumed more dangerous proportions. The arms race, especially the competition in nuclear weapons, continues uncontrolled. Negotiations on vital economic issues remain deadlocked. These are ominous developments which cause us concern.\n67.\tThe world economic situation continues to be grim. International economic co-operation and the system of multilateral co-operation continue to erode at an alarming rate. Although there has been a greater awareness of the need for development, continuing world economic stagnation has actually resulted in a decline in the per capita incomes of a large number of developing countries. As a result, there has been a sharp increase in the number of people living in absolute poverty. This situation of continuing and increasing poverty constitutes a grave threat to international stability and peace.\n68.\tThe plight of the least developed countries remains particularly acute. This group of countries has been suffering serious setbacks in the form of slower growth and widening payment deficits as a result of the world economic crisis. The United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held last year, agreed on the need for special measures, including concessional assistance for such countries. The Substantial New program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries, adopted by that Conference, is an important link in the vitally needed interaction between the developed and the developing countries. We appeal for the urgent implementation of that program.\n \n69.\tThe serious erosion in the effectiveness of multilateral economic co-operation has been a matter of deep concern to my delegation. Serious resource constraints are hampering the operation of the International Development Association, which provides critically needed resources to the low-income developing countries. The efforts of the developing countries to make policy adjustments to meet the desperate situation have to be supplemented by some form of long-term assistance to avoid the need for the poorer countries to slow down growth as the only way of balancing their international accounts.\n70.\tUNDP has been rendering invaluable assistance to the developing countries in their efforts to create the necessary infrastructure for development. In this effort it has been trying to take into particular account the needs of the poorest countries. Other bodies and specialized agencies of the United Nations are also engaged most constructively in the socioeconomic development of the developing countries. The shortfall in voluntary allocations of resources has seriously affected the programs of these bodies. Only firm and predictable support from the Member States, the developed countries in particular, can ensure their continuous and effective functioning. My delegation fears that if these bodies are forced to cut back on their programs, it will have serious consequences for the implementation of the Substantial New program of Action, to which the international community has committed itself.\n71.\tThe problem of energy is a priority item within the overall structural readjustment that the United Nations is seeking to achieve. The United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, which was held at Nairobi in 1981, underlined that the interest of all countries would be served by an orderly transition to new and alternative sources of energy, in view of the finiteness of the traditional Source of energy. We 'tote with regret that no serious action has been taken to implement the Nairobi program of Action, especially in its institutional and financial aspects.\n72.\tThe difficulties facing the United Nations Financing System for Science and Technology for Development are still far from overcome. My delegation regrets the negative attitude adopted by some developed countries towards contributing to the resources of the system, in spite of the great flexibility shown by the Group of 77.\n73.\tThe growing trend towards protectionism and unilateral trade practices has aggravated the already difficult economic situation of the developing countries. My delegation hopes that the forthcoming meeting at the ministerial level of GATT will succeed in establishing a fair international trading practice responsive to the particular needs of the developing countries.\n74.\tEconomic co-operation among developing countries has assumed even greater significance in the present context. The 1981 Caracas program of Action has charted the course for collective self-reliance to break the cycle of dependence, poverty and underdevelopment. In this context the meeting of the Intergovernmental Follow-up and Co-ordination Committee on economic co-operation among developing\ncountries, held in Manila in August, is of particular significance.\n75.\tIn the light of these pressing economic and development issues, the sixth session of UNCTAD, scheduled to be held in June next year in Belgrade, assumes crucial importance. At that session UNCTAD will have to break new ground to redress the central problems and disruptions in world trade and development. Only a new beginning can ensure the revival of the world economy.\n76.\tEfforts in the past year have proved that it is becoming increasingly difficult to take timely decisions and necessary action to correct the international economic situation. There has been some progress in the drafting of a compromise which would permit the adoption of a resolution on the launching of the global negotiations. In the negotiations the Group of 77 has displayed great flexibility and accommodation in trying to meet the concerns of the developed countries. Regrettably, these serious efforts have not so far succeeded in breaking the deadlock over the substantive issues. Nepal fully supports the notion that the United Nations has to play a central role in any realistic program for global economic recovery. We call once again for the early launching of the global negotiations to face the challenges of the international economic difficulties. The stalling of the negotiations has withheld the impetus necessary for the effective implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade [resolution 35/56, annex].\n77.\tThere can be no enduring security in the world so long as widespread poverty and economic injustice prevail. It is on the basis of these two aspects of security and development that my Government watches with increasing concern the continuing rise in military expenditures. World military spending in 1981 is estimated to have reached a staggering $600 billion to $650 billion. Thus, the resources desperately needed for development are being rapidly drained away.\n78.\tThe second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament was the focus of great public attention and interest. Despite this popular concern and all the intensive work, the Assembly failed to reach any agreement on substantive items at that session. This failure is all the more regrettable because the great Powers went back on their solemn commitment to use the United Nations as a forum for disarmament negotiations. The failure of the special session was thus another example of the crisis of confidence in the United Nations system.\n79.\tThe building of trust between the East and the West is a difficult task, but Nepal believes that continuing dialog between the United States and the Soviet Union is necessary to open the way to the reduction and eventual elimination of the nuclear arms race. We welcome the resumption of negotiations between these Powers on strategic arms and on medium-range nuclear weapons, and we hope that they will speedily agree on balanced and verifiable reductions of these weapons.\n80.\tThe adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has been a major achievement of the United Nations. After years of intense\nnegotiations, the international community has adopted a legal instrument designed to regulate the use of the seas and the exploitation of their resources. My delegation welcomes this development as being a positive one which could bring great benefits to all the countries of the world, coastal and land-locked, on the basis of equity and justice.\n81.\tNepal has often repeated its firm conviction that the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of States, of peaceful coexistence and of respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries are sacrosanct. We can never accept any justification for armed intervention.*, nor csin we recognize any situation created by such interventions.\n82.\tIt is therefore with deep regret that we note that the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea has not yet come about, and that the efforts of the United Nations and the International Conference on Kampuchea to find a peaceful settlement have made no progress. Nepal welcomes the formation of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea under the leadership of His Royal Highness Samdech Norodom Sihanouk. Nepal once again urges all parties concerned to join in the efforts of the United Nations and the International Conference on Kampuchea to achieve a just political settlement of the problem.\n83.\tIn Afghanistan, likewise, the withdrawal of all foreign forces will constitute the essential first step towards the normalization of the situation. Only such normalization will enable the people of that country to exercise their inalienable right of self-determination. Nepal will continue to support the efforts of the United Nations to achieve a negotiated political settlement in Afghanistan.\n84.\tThe Middle East situation continues to dominate the affairs of the international community. The past year has regrettably seen no sign of progress towards a comprehensive peace, which alone can ensure a just and peaceful future for all the peoples and nations of the region. Nepal remains convinced that a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East has to be based on three basic principles: recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self- determination, and their participation in the overall peace negotiations; withdrawal of Israeli forces from territories occupied since 1967; and recognition of the right of all States in the region, including Israel, to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries, free from threats and acts of force. In this respect. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) have lost none of their validity with the passage of time. Given good will and accommodation, it is not impossible to achieve early and full implementation of these resolutions, together with a pledge by the international community to assure the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. Nepal hopes that the momentum generated by the recent important proposals for the settlement of the problem will not be allowed to dissipate.\n85.\tWhen we talk of the Middle East our attention naturally turns to Lebanon. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon came as a big shock to my delegation. Nepal has strongly denounced the Israeli military invasion\nand demanded the unconditional and total withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n86.\tNepal repeats its appeal to two non-aligned countries, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq, to seek a peaceful solution of their dispute.\n87.\tNepal reiterates its call for a peaceful solution of the question of Cyprus, a solution which respects the territorial integrity, sovereignty and non-aligned character of that country.\n88.\tWith regard to the Korean question, my Government continues to hold the view that the aspirations of the Korean people to national reunification should be fulfilled peacefully, without foreign interference or intervention.\n89.\tDespite occasional reports of progress, the stalemate over Namibia continues.\n90.\tThe persistence of the policy of apartheid in South Africa causes us profound sorrow. In total defiance of world public opinion, the racist regime has continued its policy of denying the vast majority of the population elementary human rights, uprooting large numbers from their homeland, and compelling many others to live in so-called homelands against their wishes.\n91.\tThe Secretary-General has presented a serious analysis of the state of the Organization in his first report on the work of the Organization. His honest description of the erosion of the authority of the United Nations and his suggestions for the restoration of its effectiveness are matters for serious study by all Member States.\n92.\tI cannot fail to express our great appreciation of the valuable support and assistance extended to us by the various bodies and specialized agencies of the United Nations in our development efforts. Nepal believes that despite its serious limitations there can be no alternative to the United Nations in achieving the goals of international peace and security and the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples. We have interwoven our faith in the United Nations and our respect for the lofty principles of the Charter with our policy of non-alignment. We have constantly endeavored to seek a coordinated approach to bilateral, regional and global issues. Guided by these ideas of mutual benefit and collective self-reliance, we have joined other nations to achieve a prudent exploitation of the vast human, material and natural resources for the collective benefit of the South Asian region. We are heartened by the unanimous support of all countries of our region for the concept of regional co-operation. Considerable progress ha; already been made in identifying the scope of co-operation in various agreed fields. Nepal believes that the promotion of mutual confidence and co-operation among neighbors can be a vehicle of peace, security and all-round economic development of the region. Our traditional national ideals, our unrelenting quest for peace and friendship, and our aspirations to development and co-operation are embodied in our proposal that Nepal be declared a zone of peace.\n93.\tThe United Nations keeps alive mankind's faith in its better self, in the ideals and principles which are worthy of being lived and striven for. In the\ndark hours of frustration and despair, these ideals renew man's determination to overcome problems that sometimes seem to overwhelm him. It is essential to renew dedication to these ideals. It is necessary to build, collectively and consciously, on the foundation that was laid 37 years ago, and to develop the vision to guarantee the future.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's \nDemocratic Republic, I should like at the outset \nto congratulate you, Comrade President, on your \nunanimous election to your high office for this \nsession of the General Assembly. In choosing you, \nthe General Assembly pays a tribute both to your \ncountry, the sister People's Republic of Hungary, \nwhose tireless efforts in the cause of peace and \nsocialism are well known and with which my \ncountry enjoys excellent relations of friendship \nand militant solidarity and to you and to your \noutstanding qualities as a diplomat for whom the \nworkings of the United Nations hold no secrets. I \nam therefore convinced that on the basis of your \nvast experience and thorough knowledge of \ninternational affairs you will lead the work of \nthis session towards fruitful results.\n141. I would also like to pay a tribute to your \npre\u00acdecessor, Mr. Ismat Kittani, who guided the \nthirty- sixth session of the Assembly, as well as \nthe special sessions, with authority and skill.\n142.\tI also wish to salute the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, on his \nelection to his high office, involving great \nresponsibility, and for his courage and untiring \nefforts in the cause of maintaining international \npeace and security.\n143.\tSince the beginning of the thirty-sixth \nsession of the Assembly, the international \nsituation has con\u00actinued to deteriorate and the \ninternational community has found itself faced \nwith a number of crises. For the most aggressive \nimperialist factions, per\u00acsisting with their \npolicy of adventurism, aggression and economic \nblocs, have created or rekindled hot\u00acbeds of \ntension in various regions of the world. \nInter\u00acnational peace and security have never been \nso threatened.\n144.\tIn the Middle East, the situation remains \nexplosive because of the policy of aggression and \nextermination being carried out by those who hold \npower ip Israel and those who support and arm \nthem against the Palestinian and Lebanese Arab \npeoples. The bloody crimes committed by Israel \nagainst the Arab Palestinian and Lebanese \npeoples, the occupa\u00action of Lebanon and other \nArab territories and the monstrous genocide \ncommitted in the Palestinian refugee camps have \nbeen condemned by the world. We express our \nunreserved solidarity with the Pales\u00actinian Arab \npeople and with the PLO, their sole legitimate \nrepresentative, with the Lebanese people and with \nall the victims of Israeli aggression and \nbarbarity.\n145.\tFor the Lao People's Democratic Republic, \nthe just and lasting solution to the question of \nPalestine and of the Middle East as a whole, \nwhich should be worked out through negotiations \nwith the partici\u00acpation of all the parties \nconcerned, including the PLO, presupposes the \nwithdrawal by Israel from all the Arab \nterritories occupied since 1967 and recog\u00acnition \nof the right of the Palestinian people to \nestab\u00aclish an independent State the six-point \nproposal of President Brezhnev, as well as the\nproposals of the Fez Arab Summit Conference  fully support this position.\n146.\tThe conflict between Iran and Iraq has \nalready been the cause of many losses, both \nmaterial and human, on both sides and has \nbenefited neither of the parties to it. Quite the \ncontrary, the longer it goes on, the more \nconditions favorable to the intervention and \ninterference of imperialism in the region it will \ncreate. The Lao People's Democratic Republic \nhopes that the two parties, both members of the \nnon-aligned movement, with succeed in reaching a \npeaceful solution to their differences.\n147.\tThe undeclared war being waged by \nimperialism and other reactionary forces against \nthe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan poses a \nserious threat to its independence and \nsovereignty and its revolutionary achievements. \nThe Lao People's Democratic Republic firmly \ncondemns such acts and supports the efforts of \nthe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to settle \nwith its neighbors by political means problems \npertaining to the maintenance of peace and \nstability in the region.\n148.\tIn the Korean peninsula, the situation \nremains tense. The ever-growing presence of \nAmerican troops in the southern part of Korea \nconstitutes a major obstacle to the process of \nthe peaceful and democratic reunification of \nKorea.\n149.\tIn the area of the Indian Ocean, the \nmilitary presence of the United States has \njeopardized the convening of the United Nations \nconference designed to establish the Indian Ocean \nas a zone of peace. The Lao People's Democratic \nRepublic associates itself with the coastal \ncountries in the region in calling for the \ndismantling of the Diego Garcia base and other \nso-called logistical military facilities. In \nreiterating our support for Madagascar's proposal \nand our commitment to the Declaration of the \nIndian Ocean as a Zone of, the Lao People's \nDemocratic Republic hopes that the envisaged \ninternational conference will be able to take \nplace as soon as possible.\n150.\tThe Lao People's Democratic Republic \ngives its whole-hearted support to the just \nstruggle of the South African patriots against \nthe repugnant apartheid regime and for the \nrecovery of their fundamental national rights and \nsupports the valiant struggle of the Namibian \npeople, under the leadership of SWAPO, for the \nindependence and territorial integrity of \nNami\u00acbia. We condemn the repeated acts of \naggression committed by South Africa against \nAngola, Mozam\u00acbique and other neighbouring \nAfrican countries, and we reaffirm our militant \nsolidarity with that peoples of those countries \nin the struggle for the defense of their \nindependence and sovereignty.\n151.\tThe Lao People's Democratic Republic \nreaf\u00acfirms its militant solidarity with the \nSahraaui people under the leadership of the \nPOLISARIO Front in their just struggle for \nself-determination and inde\u00acpendence.\n152.\tThe Lao People s Democratic Republic, \nwhich recognizes the sovereignty of Argentina \nover the Malvinas, believes that a final \nsettlement of this matter should be negotiated \nwithin the framework of the United Nations, \nbearing in mind its relevant reso\u00aclutions.\n153.\tThe policy and actions of American \nimperialism with regard to Cuba, Nicaragua and \nGrenada should be vigorously condemned. The Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic reaffirms its \nunswerving support for the just struggle of the \npeoples of those countries to defend their \nnational independence and their revolutionary \nachievements and demands the resto\u00acration of \nGuantanamo to the Republic of Cuba.\n154.\tThe Lao People's Democratic Republic also \nsupports the struggle of the Puerto Rican people \nfor its right to self-determination and \nindependence, and that of the people of El \nSalvador for its freedom and democratic rights.\n155.\tIn their efforts to destroy the \napproximate military and strategic balance in \nEurope and in the world as a whole, the Unite \nStates and other countries of NATO have been \nexerting undisguised pressure on Poland and have \nbeen interfering in its internal affairs with a \nview to perpetuating the crisis in that country. \nThe Lao People's Democratic Republic vigorously \ncondemns these acts and reaffirms its unswerving \nsolidarity with the Polish United Workers' Party \nand the Polish State in their efforts to maintain \npublic order and to promote the normalization of \nthe situation in that country.\n156.\tForeign interference in the internal \naffairs of Cyprus has been preventing the \nintercommunal talks from making progress. In the \ninterest of the Cypriot people as a whole, a halt \nmust be called to this inter\u00acference and the \nterritorial integrity of the country must be \nscrupulously respected.\n157.\tPeace and stability in South-East Asia \nare in constant danger from the expansionist and \nhegemonist policy pursued by the reactionaries in \nthe Chinese ruling circles who are striving to \nmaintain a state of tension on the Sino-Lao and \nSino-Viet-namese borders by massing troops there \nwhich engage in armed incursions for die purpose \nof provocation and sabotage, and also on the \nThai-Kampuchea border by helping the remnants of \nthe Pol Pot forces and a handful of Khmer \nreactionaries to undermine the rebirth of the \nKampuchean people.\n158.\tBut in spite of these hostile acts, Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic, Viet Nam and \nKampuchea, constantly motivated by the wish to \nlive in peace, friendship and co-operation with \ntheir neighbors, and in particular with China, \nhave over the last few years made a number of \nproposals, including the proposal to sign a \nbilateral or multilateral treaty of peaceful \ncoexistence between them and China with a view to \nnormalizing their relations.\n159.\tThe problems which now exist in \nSouth-East Asia have been essentially brought \nabout by foreign interventions and interference. \nIt is therefore of fundamental importance to \nproceed immediately to a comprehensive settlement \nof those problems. Any delay in doing this would \nserve only to inflame the situation which now \nprevails.\n160.\tIn accordance with that analysis and \ndesiring to make an active contribution to the \nconsolidation of peace and stability in \nSouth-East Asia, and also to promote the \ncontinuation of dialogue between the States in \nthe region, the Foreign Minister of the Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic, on behalf of the \nthree countries of Indo-China, sent a letter \ndated 15 Sep-tember i982, to their counterparts \nin the countries of ASEAN. Its essential Content \nis as follows: ''\n\\\"The Thai side regards the presence of units of \nthe Vietnamese army near the Kampuchea-Thailand \nborder as a threat to Thailand's security. \nMean\u00acwhile, Kampuchea, Viet Nam and Laos consider \nthe use of Thai territory by China and the Pol \nPot clique together with other reactionary Khmer \nforces against the revival of the Kampuchean \npeople a constant threat to the security of \nKampuchea and other Indo-Chinese countries.\n\\\"The realities of the past three years have shown \nthat the presence of Vietnamese troops in \nKam\u00acpuchea does not threaten in any way \nThailand's security. Many a time the Thai side \nhas stated that there is no need to sign \nnon-aggression treaties between Thailand and the \nthree Indo- Chinese countries since there is no \ndanger of aggres\u00acsion by Viet Nam against \nThailand. On the contrary, the activities of the \nPol Pot clique and other Khmer reactionaries \nbased in Thailand have seriously threatened \nKampuchea's security, causing a continually \nexplosive situation on the Thailand- Kampuchea \nborder. The recent founding of a so-called \ntripartite coalition Government is aimed at \nhelping the Pol Pot clique and other Khmer \nreactionaries step up activities against the \nPeople's Republic of Kampuchea, undermining the \nrevival of the Kampuchean people and aggravating \nthe tension on the Kampuchea-Thailand border. To \nmaintain and to give it their support, the ASEAN \ncountries cannot avoid running Airther counter to \ntheir objective of 'founding a political \nsolution' as they have declared. This will create \na dangerous precedent for foreign intervention \nagainst inde\u00acpendent and sovereign nations and \nviolate the principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations and the non-aligned movement.\n\\\"We deem it necessary to heed the security \ninterests of Thailand, and at the same time to \nheed the security interests of Kampuchea. To this \nend, there should be effective measures to check \nthe use of the territory of one country against \nthe other. Proceeding from this basic stand, the \nPeople's Republic of Kampuchea proposed in July \n1980 to establish a demilitarized zone along the \nKampuchea- Thailand border, but the Thai side did \nnot agree, saying that it cannot withdraw its \ntroops from a part of its own territory.\n\\\"At the recent Conference of the Lao, Kampu\u00acchean \nand Vietnamese Foreign Ministers, the three \nIndo-Chinese countries took notice of Thailand's \nstand on a demilitarized zone and put forward a \nnew proposal to set up a safety zone along the \nKampuchea-Thailand border. This proposal meets \nThailand's concern that troops of the Thai \nKing\u00acdom should not withdraw from a part of its \nterritory. The new proposal only asks for the \nwithdrawal of forces which do not belong to \nThailand or the People's Republic of Kampuchea \nfrom the safety zone. The three Indo-Chinese \ncountries voice their readiness to discuss and \nreach agreement with the Thai side on such \nconcrete matters as the width of the safety zone, \nthe scope of Vietnamese troops withdrawal from \nthe Kampuchea-Thailand border as well as the \nagreement of the transfer, of the Pol-Potist and \nother Khmer reactionaries and refugee camps far, \nfrom this border, the three Indo-Chinese \ncountries deem it necessary to agree on a form of \ninternational supervision of the safety.\n\\\"To show their good will, the People's Republic \nof Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam have of late made a first step by \nunilaterally withdrawing some units of Vietnamese \ntroops from Kampuchea. If the Thai side gives a \npositive response to this good will act, the \nPeople's Republic of Kampuchea and the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam will withdraw more units of \nViet\u00acnamese troops from Kampuchea.\n\\\"In case Thailand refuses to establish the safety \nzone, the three Indo-Chinese countries are ready \nto discuss and reach agreement with the Thai side \non any measure strictly to respect the Kampuchea- \nThailand border as well as any measure including \na form of international supervision to ensure \npeace and stability there.\n\\\"Many a time the People's Republic of Kam\u00acpuchea \nhas stated that the agreement on this question is \nnot related to the de jure recognition of each \nother. The People's Republic of Kampuchea will \nnot let the question of mutual recognition hinder \nthe discussion and agreement on the safety zone. \nThe realities of the past 30 years have shown \nthat the United States and Thailand signed with \nViet Nam and China the 1961-1962 Geneva Agreement \non Laos, and the United States and Viet Nam \nsigned the Paris Agree\u00acment on Viet Nam in 1973 \nwithout subsequent mutual recognition.\n\\\"The ASEAN countries have stood for the \ncon\u00acvening of an international conference within \nthe framework of the United Nations to settle the \nKam\u00acpuchea problem. They have unilaterally \nconvened this conference in disregard of the \nthree Indo- Chinese countries' protest. This is \nan imposition from one side. The three \nIndo-Chinese countries have put forward a \nproposal to convene a regional conference between \nthe two groups of ASEAN and Indo-Chinese \ncountries. This has not been agreed to by the \nASEAN countries and such regional con\u00acference has \nnot been convened.\n\\\"The realities of the past three years have shown \nthat an international conference is fruitful only \nwhen there is the agreement and participation of \nthe directly related parties. The international \nconference convened by the United Nations in July \n1981 only ended in an impasse. With the good will \nto find an issue for this abnormal situation, and \ntaking into consideration the ASEAN countries' \nproposal for an international conference and the \nthree Indo-Chinese countries' proposal for a \nregional con\u00acference, the recent conference of \nVietnamese, Lao and Kampuchean Foreign Ministers \nput forward a proposal for an international \nconference on Southeast Asia with the \nparticipation of nine countries inside and six \nothers outside the area. (The nine former are the \nthree Indo-Chinese countries, the five ASEAN \ncountries and Burma; the six latter are the \nSoviet Union, the United States, China, France, \nthe United Kingdom and India).\n.\\\"This conference will be convened only when \nagreement is reached between the, directly \nrelated countries, i.e. the ASEAN-and the \nIndo-Chinese counties,, on the composition; of \nParticipants, agenda, place and time of the \nconference.\n\\\"Regarding the composition of participants, there \nmay be disagreement on the countries taking part \nJ particularly on the representation of \nKampuchea. I think that this matter can be \ndiscussed and a formula acceptable to all can be \nfound. It should not hinder the convening of the \nconference. The three Indo- Chinese countries, \nwelcome the United Nations contribution to peace \nand stability in South-East Asia. But the United \nNations maintenance of the Pol Pot genocidal \nclique has inhibited its positive role.\n\\\"Concerning the agenda, there may also be \ndisagreement. I think that the conference can \ndiscuss all the problems in the region raised by \neach side on the principle of complete equality. \nFor us there are many ways: an agreed agenda, an \nopen agenda, or an agenda with agreed-upon \nproblems and open- ended problems.\n\\\"About the place, I think that the conference can \nmeet in a South-East Asian country, a neutral \ncountry in Asia or Europe, perhaps at Rangoon, \nNew Delhi, Paris, Stockholm or Vienna, as agreed \nby the two groups of countries.\n\\\"As for the time of the conference, I think that \nthe problems of peace and stability in Southeast \nAsia are most urgent and need to be settled, the \nsooner the better. Therefore I think that it \nshould be convened in the last three months of \nthis year or early next year.\\\"\n161.\tIn Kampuchea, Pol Pot and his criminal \nclique, before being overthrown in 1979, embarked \non the genocide of their own people and took the \ncountry back to the stone-age, at the instigation \nof foreigners. Blood, hunger and exodus were the \nprice of this process internally, while \nexternally bloody aggressions against \nneighbouring countries left an indelible imprint. \nSince that time the horror has ended for the \nKamrpuchean people, and under the leadership of \nthe Government of the People's Republic of \nKampuchea that people has witnessed a miraculous \nrevival in unity and national harmony and its \npolitical, economic, cultural and social \nsituation has undergone a striking return to \nnormal. The conditions of life of the people are \nunquestionably improving; National institutions \nhave been established at all levels throughout \nthe territory of the country after, the general \nelections J in particular the Constitution and \nthe Parliament. This legitimate Government, \nsupported by all Kampucheans, is unremittingly \npursuing a foreign policy of peace, friendship, \nco-operation and good-neighborliness.\n162.\tThe international community is now in a \nposi\u00action, knowing the facts, to draw impartially \nand objec\u00actively a comparison between the four \nyears of the reign of terror and genocide of the \nPol Pot regime and the three years of the \nGovernment of the People's Republic of Kampuchea \nand conclude which has done more for Kampuchea \nand its valiant people and which of the two \ndeserves the honor and the right to speak on \nbehalf of Kampuchea.\n163.\tFor its part, the Lao People's Democratic \nRepublic believes that the United Nations must \nrestore to the Government of the People's \nRepublic of Kampuchea, the sole authentic and \nlegal representative of the Kampuehean people, \nits proper place in the Organization and to expel \nfrom it the representatives of the former \nbutchers of the Kampuchean people regardless of \nwhat new guise they may appear in.\n164.\tIn so doing, the Organization would \nenhance its prestige and be doing simple justice \nto the Kam\u00acpuchean people and, above all, to the \nmemory of 3 million of them who were murdered.\n165.\tThe year 1982 has also been marked by the \nunbridled pursuit of the arms race by the \nimperialists and military circles of NATO. This \nhas been brought about by the policy of \nconfrontation of the current United States \nAdministration and even more by its ambition to \nattain a fallacious military and strategic \n\\\"superiority\\\" over the Soviet Union, and certain \nstrategists of the Pentagon who have gone so far \nas to advocate the first nuclear strike and even \nthe pos\u00acsibility of a so-called limited nuclear \nwar. In order to extract revenue from the \ntaxpayers and to win over public opinion to this \ncause, there has been no end to the fables that \nhave been concocted about the so- called Soviet \nthreat.\n166.\tNegotiations on arms limitations and \ndisarm\u00acament, in various United Nations bodies \nand other forums, in particular the Soviet-United \nStates bilateral negotiations, have not led to \nany results. They either run up against the \nopposition of the United States and its allies or \nare unilaterally abandoned by them. This is what \nhappened to consideration of the question on the \nprohibition of nuclear-weapon tests in the \nCommittee on Disarmament, the question of halting \nthe nuclear-arms race and negotiations on the \nprohibition of the development, manufacture and \nstockpiling of chemical weapons and their \ndestruction, for example.\n167.\tAlthough the twelfth special session, the \nsecond special session of the General Assembly \ndevoted to disarmament, held in June this year, \nyielded no con\u00accrete results, it was nevertheless \nof great significance because it showed the world \nwhich countries are working for the cause of \npeace and disarmament and which are striving to \nimpede attainment of that goal.\n168.\tPresident Leonid Brezhnev's message \ndelivered at the 12th meeting of that special \nsession announcing the unilateral undertaking by \nthe Soviet Union not to be the first to use \nnuclear weapons is an illustration of the \nLeninist peace policy pursued by the Soviet Union \nand it won the warm and total support of the Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic as well as that of \nall peace-loving peoples in the world.\n169.\tAt the second special session on \ndisarmament, the Soviet Union reaffirmed and \ndeveloped its pro\u00acposals* for the consolidation \nof peace, strengthening of detente and curbing of \nthe arms race\u2014proposals which it had put forward \nat the twenty-sixth Con\u00acgress of the Communist \nParty of the Soviet Union. Those proposals are \nconstructive and realistic, and members of the \nCommittee on Disarmament should examine them most \nseriously.\n170.\tIn the face of the ever-growing threat to \ninter\u00acnational peace and security represented by \nthe arms race, in particular the nuclear-arms \nrace and the race in other weapons of mass \ndestruction, the Lao People's Democratic Republic \nwelcomes any proposal aimed at eliminating that \nthreat. As a country that was the victim of \ncolonial and neo-colonial aggression and that \nlived under the constant threat of imperialism, \nexpansionism and hegemonism, my country supports \nthe proposal of the People's Republic of Mongolia \nfor the conclusion of a convention on \nnon-aggression and non-use of force in relations \nbetween Asian and Pacific States. The signing of \nsuch a convention would undoubtedly contribute to \npeace and co-oper\u00acation in that part of the world.\n171.\tThe deterioration in the world economic \nsitua\u00action, that has come about in the last few \nyears was even more marked in 1982. The developed \ncapitalist countries, whose responsibility it is \nto take appropriate measures to remedy this \nsituation, were unwilling to depart from their \nnegative attitude. This international economic \ncrisis provoked by the devel\u00acoped capitalist \ncountries has had an even greater effect on the \ndeveloping countries, in particular the \nleast-advanced among them. This serves only to \nstress the interdependence of the two groups of \ncoun\u00actries. The continued decline in the economic \nsituation in the developing countries could well, \nover the long term, entail adverse effects for \nthe developed countries themselves. It is \ntherefore in their own interests to demonstrate \ngreater political will and realism in order to \nrestructure the present system of international \neconomic relations which is founded on injustice \nand exploitation.\n172.\tThe picture I have just outlined would \nappear at first sight a little gloomy. \nNevertheless it is encour\u00acaging to note that \ncrisis mongers and fomenters of war are becoming \nmore and more isolated and coming in for \nincreased international condemnation and that the \nforces that are fighting for peace Justice and \nsocial progress, on the other hand, are becoming \nstronger with each passing day. This is proof \nthat the masses are no longer willing to live \nwith the specter of a nuclear conflagration \nhanging over them, in poverty and exploitation. \nThey are calling for a halt to the unbridled arms \nrace, for improvement of their living conditions \nand for a peaceful world for both their own \ngeneration and that of their children. In a word, \nthey are calling for change in the existing \ninternational order and its replacement by a \nnew\u2014just, equitable and democratic\u2014international \norder where relations would be based on true \nequality and mutually advan\u00actageous co-operation.\n173.\tBy combining our efforts to respond to \ntheir call and to their needs, we would be \ndischarging our obligations under the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. Presi\u00acdent, the delegation of the Ukrainian \nSoviet Socialist Republic warmly congratulates \nyou on your unanimous election to the presidency \nof the thirty-seventh ses\u00acsion of the General \nAssembly. Your outstanding personal qualities and \nyour diplomatic skill have won you the deep \nrespect of delegations. It is a particular \npleasure for us that the post of President of the \nAssem\u00acbly is occupied by a representative of the \nfraternal Socialist Republic of Hungary. Our \ndelegation would like to assure you of its \nco-operation and wish you success in the \nperformance of your responsible and difficult \ntask.\n2.\tWhenever one comes to the rostrum of the \nGeneral Assembly one is keenly aware of the high \nresponsibility entrusted by the peoples of the \nworld to the United Nations. Here at the United \nNations we find a reflection of the most urgent \nproblems facing mankind, which require collective \nsolutions in the interests of all countries and \npeoples.\n3.\tNo conflicts or contradictions among \nStates, no differences in social systems, \nideologies or ways of life can eclipse the common \nneed: to preserve peace and prevent a nuclear \nwar. The speeches of the majority of \nrepresentatives have had as their theme a feeling \nof alarm for the fate of the world, an awareness \nof the fact that it is at a dangerous point and \nthat everything must be done to avert the nuclear \nthreat hanging over mankind.\n4.\tToday, when the international situation \nhas seriously deteriorated\u2014and for this the \nimperialist forces are to blame\u2014when those forces \nare pursuing an unbridled arms race which \nthreatens to lead to a nuclear catastrophe, the \nwords of the Charter, that the United Nations is \ncalled upon for to save succeeding generations \nfrom the scourge of warfar , are particularly \nrelevant.\nThe Ukrainian SSR, which played its part in the \ncreation of the United Nations, in defining its \npurposes and principles, is working as always for \nan effective contribution by the United Nations \nto strengthening international peace and \nsecurity, overcoming crisis situations and \nenhancing its role in the struggle to rid mankind \nof the threat of war. We believe that more active \nefforts by the United Nations aimed at securing \npeace and developing co-operation among States in \naccordance with the provisions of the Charter are \nof particular importance today when the world \nfaces a situation in which its purposes and \nprinciples are ignored and violated.\n6.\tIn this difficult period of acute \nstruggle between two opposed orientations in \nworld policy there is no more important or more \nurgent task than that of limiting the arms race \nand striving for disarmament. The future of \nmankind depends upon the fulfillment of that \ntask. For those reasons the Ukrainian SSR, \ntogether with all the socialist countries, \nsupports the idea of the adoption of immediate \nand realistic measures to avert a nuclear war, to \ncurb the arms race and bring about disarmament, \nto eliminate the hotbeds of international tension.\n7.\tTo preserve peace, to ensure the peaceful \ncoexis\u00actence of States with different social \nsystems and to solve all controversial issues by \npeaceful means\u2014these are the key goals of the \nProgramme of Peace for the 1980s, adopted by the \nTwenty-sixth Congress of the Communist Party of \nthe Soviet Union. It is those goals which have \ndetermined the general thrust of the foreign \npolicy initiatives of the Soviet Union. This \ncoincides with the vital interests of the \nmajority of the non-aligned countries and is in \naccordance with the peace-loving aspirations of \nall peoples and with the purposes and principles \nof the Charter.\n8.\tAggressive imperialist circles, however, \nparticularly the United States of America, take a \ncom\u00acpletely opposite position on questions of war \nand peace. The United States and its closest \nallies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n[NATO] have adopted a course of intensifying \nconfrontation, speeding up the arms race, \nundermining the existing strategic stability in \norder to achieve military superiority, \ninterfering in the internal affairs of States and \nencouraging aggression and the rule of inter\u00acnational \narbitrariness.\n9.\tThe United States has blocked the \nnegotiations on the general and complete \nprohibition of nuclear- weapon tests, on the \nprohibition and destruction of chemical weapons, \non the [imitation and subsequent reduction of \nmilitary activities in the Indian Ocean, on the \nlimitation of trade in and transfers of \ncon\u00acventional weapons and on anti-satellite \nsystems. The NATO countries are to blame for the \nslowing down of the Vienna Talks on Mutual \nReduction of Forces, Armaments and Associated \nMeasures in Central Europe. United Nations \ndecisions aimed at prohibiting the manufacture of \nneutron weapons, the renunciation of the \ndevelopment of new types and systems of weapons \nof mass destruction and the holding of talks on \nnuclear disarmament remain unimplemented. \nMoreover, official representatives of the Unite j \nStates Administration and certain leaders of NATO \ncountries have put forward justification for the \nidea of the first use of nuclear weapons and the \nconstant building-up of nuclear arsenals to those \nends.\n10.\tIt is precisely that which is the true \nreason for the deterioration of the situation in \nthe world and the intensified danger of war.\n11.\tThe world has witnessed material \npreparations for war, the constant threat of the \nuse of force, the use of methods of power \ndiplomacy and the indoc\u00actrination of the \npopulation with a spirit of militarism. This is a \nconcrete manifestation of the reactionary nature \nof contemporary imperialism. Adventurism in \ninternational affairs which is inherent in \nimperialism is fraught with particular danger \ntoday precisely because the world has accumulated \na vast potential of the most deadly weapons, \nwhich are capable of destroying life on earth.\n12.\tIn stressing the great seriousness of the \ntime at which the thirty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly is being held, the delegation of \nthe Ukrai\u00acnian SSR believes at the same time that \nthe peoples of the world are entirely capable of \naverting a thermo\u00acnuclear conflict. The Ukrainian \nSSR, like other socialist countries, is convinced \nthat in the present conditions we must seal, ever \nmore actively ways and means of normalizing the \ninternational situation, using all available \nmeans which could serve to ease the unfavorable \npolitical climate. We believe that in this \ncontext the United Nations has a major role to \nplay. The United Nations must not allow one State \nor a number of States to wipe out or throw \noverboard all the benefits brought about in \ninternational rela\u00actions in the 1970s and what \nhas been achieved by detente, and edge the world \ncloser to the abyss of war.\n13.\tWhat we need today is a genuine \nbreakthrough towards the curbing of the unbridled \narms race and promoting disarmament, and the \nimmediate imple\u00acmentation of practical measures \nin that field. We do not need words declarations \nof good intentions. Only a constructive approach \nto the solution of the most acute present-day \nproblems can prevent mankind from slipping \ntowards the nuclear abyss.\n14.\tNumerous concrete and realistic proposals \non halting the arms race and on disarmament \nmeasures in various areas have been put forward \nby the socialist countries, with the aim of \nachieving this goal. They include the Declaration \non the Prevention of Nuclear Catastrophe, adopted \nby the General Assembly in resolution 36/100, on \nthe initiative of the Soviet Union, which \ndeclares that the first to use nuclear weapons \nwill be committing the gravest crime against \nhumanity and calls for joint efforts, through \nnegotiations con\u00acducted in good faith and on the \nbasis of equality, to halt and reverse the \nnuclear arms race.\n15.\tA concrete step of historic significance \nin this direction was taken by the Soviet Union \nwhen it unilaterally assumed the obligation not \nto be the first to use nuclear weapons. This \ngives a powerful impetus to the radical easing of \nthe threat of nuclear war and the strengthening \nof confidence in inter\u00acnational relations. But if \nthis is to be achieved, all nuclear-weapon States \nmust follow the example of the Soviet Union by \nassuming the obligation not to be the first to \nuse nuclear weapons. Then the threat of nuclear \nannihilation would be banished from the life of \nmankind, all aspects of international security \nwould acquire a completely new character and new \nprospects would open up for accelerating progress \nin resolving questions of limiting the arms race \nand bring\u00acing about disarmament.\n16.\tWe also believe that at this session the \nGeneral Assembly could contribute significantly \nto the imple\u00acmentation of the Soviet proposal on \nthe conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use \nof force in inter\u00acnational relations.' The \npreparation and conclusion of such a treaty is of \nparticular relevance today in the context of the \ndeterioration in the international situation and \nwhen certain States are not only ever more \nfrequently threatening to use force but, in \nviolation of the Charter and United Nations \ndeci\u00acsions, are actually using it in order to \nsubject other States and peoples to their \ndomination. A treaty on the non-use of force \nwould be a reliable instrument against the use of \nany weapons for purposes of aggres\u00acsion. The time \nis ripe for such a measure. We are sincerely \nconvinced that if the General Assembly made the \nrenunciation of the use or threat of force with \nany type of weapons, nuclear or conventional, \ninto a law of international life, it would serve \nthe security interests not only of the \nnuclear-weapon States but also of the \nnon-nuclear-weapon States.\n17.\tA solid basis for the cessation of the \nbuildup of the most dangerous means of warfare \nwas created by the new proposals of the Soviet \nUnion, put forward at the second special session \nof the General Assembly on disarmament,2 relating \nto the elaboration and stage-by-stage \nimplementation of a program of nuclear \ndisarmament, and the realistic proposals of many \nother States to curb and halt the nuclear arms \nrace. It can be stated with some assurance that \nsupport by the General Assembly for the practical \nimplementation of these measures for limiting \narma\u00acments and bringing about disarmament would \ncon\u00actribute to the strengthening of international \npeace and security.\n18.\tThere is no doubt that a significant \ncontribution towards the achievement of this goal \nwould be made by concrete agreements in the \ncurrent Soviet-American negotiations in Geneva on \nthe limitation and reduction of strategic weapons \nand the limitation of nuclear weapons in Europe.\n19.\tA serious obstacle to the development of \nnew types and systems of nuclear weapons, as well \nas to the emergence of new nuclear-weapon States, \nwould be created by the immediate cessation and \nprohibition of nuclear-weapon tests by all States \nin all environments. Twenty years have passed \nsince the conclusion of the Treaty Banning \nNuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer \nSpace and Under Watery but, because of the \nobstructionist position of certain nuclear \nStates, it has not been possible to achieve the \ncomplete cessation of nuclear tests. Furthermore, \nit is common knowledge that the Pentagon is \npreparing new programmes for the qualita\u00active \nimprovement of nuclear weapons and for the \ndevelopment of even more dangerous types and \nsystems of such weapons. The United States has \nbroken off the trilateral talks on the total \nprohibition of nuclear tests. In order to \novercome this deadlock, the Soviet Union has \ncalled for the preparation and conclusion without \ndelay of an international treaty on the complete \nand general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests \nand has submitted basic provisions of such a \ntreaty for consideration at this session. The \nSoviet proposal takes into account all the \npositive achievements of the many years of \ndis\u00accussion of the problem of the prohibition of \nnuclear- weapon tests, it also reflects the ideas \nand views of many States with regard, in \nparticular, to questions of verifying compliance \nwith any future treaty. The declaration by all \nnuclear-weapon States of a mora\u00actorium on ail \nnuclear explosions, including explosions for \npeaceful purposes, would contribute to the \ncreation of more favorable conditions for the \npreparation of such a treaty. Such a moratorium \nwould be effective pending the conclusion of the \ntreaty itself.\n20.\tThe delegation of the Ukrainian SSR is \nconvinced that the speedy resolution of the \nquestion of the immediate cessation and \nprohibition of nuclear- weapon tests would \ncontribute significantly towards curbing the \nnuclear arms race and in particular halting the \nqualitative improvement of nuclear weapons and \nthe creation of new types and systems of such \nweapons, as well as towards strengthening the \nnon- proliferation regime of nuclear weapons. \nAgreement on this very important issue\u2014provided, \nof course, that all nuclear-weapon States evinced \nthe political will and a constructive \napproach\u2014would contribute to lessening the threat \nof nuclear war.\n21.\tThe Soviet Union has proposed that at \nthis session the Assembly consider another item, \nentitled for Intensification of efforts to remove \nthe threat of nuclear war and ensure the safe \ndevelopment of nuclear energy. The Ukrainian SSR \nattaches great significance to this question. In \nour Republic we are actively engaged in the rapid \ndevelopment of nuclear energy by building nuclear \npower stations which enable us to satisfy the \never-goring need for energy of industry, \nagriculture and scientific research.\n22.\tIt goes without saying that the \ndestruction of peaceful nuclear facilities even \nusing conventional weapons would be tantamount, \nas far as the con\u00acsequences were concerned, to an \nattack using nuclear weapons, which the United \nNations has already described as the gravest \ncrime against humanity.\n23.\tTherefore, the need to ensure the safe \ndevelop\u00acment of nuclear energy flows logically \nfrom the task of preventing the unleashing of a \nnuclear war. In its approach to this question the \ndelegation of the Ukrainian SSR proceeds from the \nbelief that the safe development of nuclear \nenergy presupposes that both nuclear-weapon and \nnon-nuclear-weapon States, since they have an \ninterest in the development and compre\u00achensive \npeaceful uses of nuclear energy, should prevent \nactions which might lead to the deliberate \ndestruction of peaceful nuclear facilities. \nLeonid Brezhnev, in his message to the \nparticipants in the twenty-sixth session of the \nGeneral Conference of IAEA, stressed the need to \ndo everything possible to ensure that nuclear \nenergy\u2014which is the greatest achievement of the \nhuman intellect\u2014serves only the interests of \npeace and never becomes a means of destroying \nlife on earth.\n24.\tOne of the most pressing problems \ncontinues to be that of the prohibition and \nelimination of chemical weapons. The draft basic \nprinciples of a convention to that effect, which \nwere put forward by the Soviet Union during the \nsecond special session on disarmament are \ndesigned to make it possible to take a decisive \nstep in that direction.\n25.\tThe refusal of the United States to take \npart in the bilateral Soviet-American talks and \nits open policy of expanding the production and \nstockpiling of new types of chemical weapons, \nincluding binary weapons, as well as its policy \nof deploying them in some member States of NATO, \nhave dashed the hopes of the peo\u00acples of the \nworld for an early solution to this important \nproblem and increased the danger of chemical \nwar\u00acfare. Furthermore, the refusal to negotiate \nand the building-up of arsenals of chemical \nweapons have been accompanied and covered up by \nfalse anti- Soviet propaganda.\n26.\tThe draft basic provisions of a treaty \nput forward by the Soviet Union take into account \nthe views of other States, including the question \nof verification, and open up real prospects of \nreaching mutually acceptable agreements. To that \nend, it is necessary for the United States and \nits allies to show real willing\u00acness and adopt a \nresponsible approach to the matter.\n27.\tThe delegation of the Ukrainian SSR \nbelieves that it is necessary to step up the \nnegotiations on the prohibition of chemical \nweapons within the Com\u00acmittee on Disarmament and \nto resume the bilateral talks on this question \nbetween the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics \nand the United States of America. In our view, \nthe General Assembly could make a contribution to \nthe prohibition and elimination of chemical \nweapons by calling for a resumption of the talks \nand prohibition of the production and deploy\u00acment \nof new types of chemical weapons, including \nbinary weapons, and of their deployment in the \nter\u00acritory of other States.\n28.\tThe day before yesterday marked the \ntwenty- fifth anniversary of an outstanding \nevent\u2014the launch\u00acing by the Soviet Union of the \nworld's first spaceship, which ushered in the \nspace era. The world is entitled to take pride in \nthe successes over the years in the exploration \nand uses of outer space, whose vast expanses \nshould be used only as the arena of peace\u00acful \nco-operation among States. In this connection the \nmilitary space programmes which are being worked \nout and implemented by the United States must \ngive rise to serious concern. Such dangerous \ndevelopments call for the early conclusion of an \ninternational treaty on the prohibition of the \ndeployment of weapons of any type in outer space, \nas proposed by the Soviet Union.2\n29.\tThe limitation and reduction of \nconventional arms and armed forces is another \nimportant task. As a first step towards this an \nagreement should be reached not to increase armed \nforces or conventional arms, thus creating the \ngroundwork for talks on their subsequent \nreduction.\n30.\tThe Ukrainian SSR was among the first to \nratify the Convention on Prohibitions or \nRestrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional \nWeapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively \nInjurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects. We \nbelieve that an early entry into force of this \nConvention would be conducive to the solution of \nthe broader and more important problems in the \nfield of the imitation and reduction of \nconventional weapons.\n31.\tIn view of the current international \nsituation it is crucial to take specific steps to \nstrengthen inter\u00acnational security, eliminate \nhotbeds of tension and military conflicts, and \nhalt acts of aggression in various parts of the \nworld.\n32.\tIn recent months the situation in the \nMiddle East has undergone a tragic and dangerous \nchange. A military conflagration has once again \nReared up which has consumed many thousands of \nhuman lives. New setbacks have emerged to a just \nsettlement of the Middle East conflict. We have \nwitnessed monstrous and evil crimes, the \nresponsibility for which rests as an indelible \nstain on the hands of the ruling circles in \nIsrael, which unleashed a destructive war against \nLebanon. What has been done by the Israeli \nmilitary clique in that long-suffering country is \nnothing short of genocide, a planned and \ndeliberate extermination of the Palestinian \npeople. The tragedy of Beirut has brought back to \nthe memory of mankind the darkest scenes from the \npast\u2014the bloody crimes of the Nazis in the Second \nWorld War. It ranks with such evil deeds of the \nFascists as the massacre of the people of Babi \nYar, Kiev, where in 1941 many tens of thousands \nof people were murdered, mainly women, children \nand old men and where, incidentally, side by side \nwith Russians and Ukrainians many innocent Jews \nwere kitted.\n33.\tBlinded by military intoxication the \nruling circles in Israel have trampled into the \nmud not only the time- honoured international \nrules and concepts that were reaffirmed in the \nCharter and the will of the international \ncommunity expressed in numerous resolutions of \nthe General Assembly and of the Secu\u00acrity \nCouncil, but also their own human image. Such \nbrutal behavior by the aggressor would not have \nbeen possible without the political protection \nand extensive military and financial aid Israel \nhas been receiving from its influential American \nbenefactors. Their role in the Lebanese tragedy \nis one of infamy, for without their support \nIsrael would never have dared perpetrate this \naggression.\n34.\tIsrael's growing aggressiveness is a \ndirect con\u00acsequence of the Camp David conspiracy \nand of the so-called strategic consensus between \nWashington and Tel Aviv. It is absolutely clear \nto us that United States policy in the Middle \nEast is further to escalate tension there so as \nto expand and consolidate its military presence, \ncreating a spring-board for direct interference \nin the affairs of States of this and of adjacent \nregions.\n33. Today, more than ever, there is a need to \nmove in the most responsible manner towards a \ncomprehen\u00acsive and just settlement in the Middle \nEast. It is clear that such a settlement cannot \nbe achieved by means of hostile confrontation and \nseparate deals or attempts to remove the \nPalestinian problem by military or other means \ncontrary to the will of the Palestinian people. \nThe plan for a Middle East settlement proposed by \nthe President of the United States lacks the main \nelement\u2014recognition of the inalienable right of \nthe Palestinian people to a State of their own. \nMoreover, it openly proclaims that the United \nStates is opposed to the creation of such a State.\n36.\tA comprehensive political settlement of \nthe Middle East conflict should include \nwithdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab \nterritories occupied in 1967, the exercise of the \nlegitimate rights of the Arab people of \nPalestine, including their right to create their \nown State, and creation of the conditions for the \nsecure and independent development of all States \nin the Middle East. The modalities of a \ncomprehensive, really just and truly lasting \nsettlement in the Middle East are contained in a \nsuccinct form in a new major initiative by the \nhead of the Soviet State, Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev, \nmade public on 15 September.\n37.\tIt is our firm belief that a lasting \npeace in this region can only be achieved through \nthe collective efforts of all the parties \nconcerned, including the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization [PLO], the sole, legitimate \nrepresentative of the Palestinian people. A \nproposal by the Soviet Union and other socialist \ncountries to convene an international conference \non the subject is in keeping with this objective. \nWe are ready to co-operate along these lines with \nall those who cherish the ideals of peace and \nsecurity in the Middle East and in the world at \nlarge.\n38.\tDevelopments in the world depend to a \nlarge extent to the shape of relations among \nEuropean States belonging to different social \nsystems. Through\u00acout the past decade the peoples \nof Europe have really felt the advantages of the \npolicy of detente, which has had a favorable \neffect upon the political climate and has \npromoted the development and strengthening of \nmutually beneficial East-West co-operation in all \nfields. During this period the Euro\u00acpean peoples \nhave come to realize that the only reasonable \npath is to continue detente and extend it to the \nmilitary Held.\n39.\tFor the continent of Europe to become a \ncon\u00actinent of peace and genuine co-operation many \nartificial barriers put up lately must be removed \nand, as a matter of priority, the level of \nmilitary con\u00acfrontation in this region must be \nlowered.\n40.\tThe delegation of the Ukrainian SSR would \nlike to reaffirm its position of principle in \nsupport of the independence, sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. \nEfforts to secure a success\u00acful completion of the \nintercommunal talks held under United Nations \nauspices must continue, as well as with regard to \nthe settlement of existing outstanding issues in \nthe spirit of understanding and good will. \nDemilitarization of the island, providing for the \nwith\u00acdrawal of all foreign forces and the \nelimination of all foreign military bases, is an \nimportant condition for a credible settlement in \nCyprus.\n41.\tThe implementation of a proposal by the \nMon\u00acgolian People's Republic to conclude a \nconvention on non-aggression and non-use of force \nin relations among States of Asia and the Pacific \nwould make a considerable contribution to \nimproving the world climate in general, easing \ntension and strengthening security in Asia. A \nsuccessful restructuring of rela\u00actions in this \nvast region, on the basis of the prin\u00acciples of \nmutual respect for independence, sover-eignty, \nthe inviolability of borders, non-interference, \nthe non-use or threat of force and the settlement \nof disputes exclusively through peaceful means, \nwould be an historic breakthrough for future \ndevelopments in Asia. Mongolia's initiative has \nthe same thrust as proposals to makethe Indian \nOcean a zone of peace and other constructive \nideas of Asian States.\n42.\tWe reaffirm our position of principle on \nthe question of Korea, as well as our solidarity \nwith the struggle of the Democratic People's \nRepublic of Korea for a peaceful, democratic \nreunification of its home-land, free from outside \ninterference, and for the with\u00acdrawal of foreign \ntroops from South Korea.\n43.\tThe delegation of the Ukrainian SSR \nconsiders a complete cessation and the guaranteed \nnon resumption of aggressive acts against \nAfghanistan, as well as of other forms of \ninterference in its internal affairs, to be a \nmajor condition for normalizing the situation in \nAsia. To discuss the so-called Afghan question in \nthe General Assembly and to ram through \nresolu\u00actions devoid of political realism can only \nobstruct efforts aimed at settling the situation \naround Afghani\u00acstan. Concrete and constructive \nproposals for such a settlement have been put \nforward by the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.\n44.\tThe Ukrainian SSR also supports the \ninitiatives undertaken by the States of \nIndo-China with a view to strengthening peace in \nSouth-East Asia, con\u00acducting a constructive \ndialogue and promoting co-oper\u00acation with the \nStates members of the Association of South-East \nAsian Nations and, in parti\u00accular, the proposals \ncontained in a joint communique of 7 July issued \nby the Conference of Ministers for Foreign \nAffairs of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, \nthe Lao People's Democratic Republic and the \nPeople's Republic of Kampuchea. We are confident \nthat to make South-East Asia a zone of peace and \nstability is in the interests not only of the \npeoples of this region but also of world peace.\n45.\tThe aggressive policies of racist South \nAfrica, which enjoys the extensive support of the \nUnited States and some other Western countries, \npose a very grave threat to peace and \ninternational security. South Africa's subversion \nof and war actions against independent African \nStates, particularly against Angola, in practice \nhave not ceased. The Pretoria regime is \nflagrantly ignoring United Nations decisions on \nthe granting of independence to Namibia. The \ninhuman system of apartheid is entrenched in \nSouth Africa.\n46.\tThe Ukrainian SSR is resolutely in favor \nof adopting mandatory sanctions against South \nAfrica under Chapter VII of the Charter in order \nto compel the South African regime to put an end \nto the heinous practice of apartheid, to halt its \naggressive actions against neighbouring \nfront-line States and to grant independence to \nNamibia.\n47.\tOne of the tasks facing the General \nAssembly at the thirty-seventh session is \npromoting the solution of international economic \nproblems on an equitable and democratic basis. \nThis is an important and urgent task because in \nthat area we are witnessing many phenomena which \nare seriously impeding the realiza\u00action of the \nprogressive principles embodied in the \nDeclaration on the Establishment of a New \nInter\u00acnational Economic Order and in the Charter \nof Economic Rights and Duties of States.  The \nimperialist forces which in the past sabotaged \nthe elaboration and adoption of these fundamental \ninstruments today bear the principal \nresponsibility for the exacerbation of tension in \nall areas, including commerce and eco\u00acnomics. \nTheir policy continues to be the main obstacle to \nprogress in the normalization and democratization \nof international economic relations.\n48.\tThe Ukrainian SSR, together with other \nsocialist countries, supports and will \nconsistently support a policy of placing external \neconomic links of States at the service of \npeaceful construction, mutual advan\u00actage and the \nstrengthening of relations of friendship and \nco-operation among peoples. We are also \ncon\u00acvinced that the elimination of the threat of \nwar, the strengthening of peace and the cessation \nof the arms race, being the tasks of primary \nimportance that they are, serve as a reliable \nguarantee for progress in the field of social and \neconomic development and in over\u00accoming the \nbackwardness inherited from colonialism.\n49.\tThe debate at this session testifies to the growing awareness \namong Member States that today a parti\u00accularly \nurgent task for the United Nations is to mobilize \ncommon efforts in those fields which would most \neffectively promote the strengthening of peace \nand be better in keeping with the interests of \nall peoples.\n50.\tIt is quite clear that the attempts by \nimperialist circles to involve the United Nations \nin psychological warfare against countries of the \nsocialist community and a number of non-aligned \nStates, to misuse to intervene in their internal \naffairs, run counter to these efforts. Those \nattempts and even appeals for a crusade against \nthe USSR and the socialist countries are \nseriously hampering the development of \ninternational co-operation. We have more than \nonce heard all sorts of threats and have been \nsubjected to sanctions but the Soviet State has \ndeveloped and will continue to develop \nsuccessfully. The Soviet Union confidently \napproaches its sixtieth anniversary pursuing a \npeace\u00acful foreign policy and seeking to achieve a \nhigher material and spiritual state of well-being \nfor its working people.\n51.\tIn December 1922, for the first time in \nthe history of mankind, a State came into being \nwhere all rela\u00actions were based on fraternity and \nmutual aid between people of different national \nand racial origins. The strength of the Soviet \nUnion has been tested in the most severe trials, \nunder conditions of foreign inter\u00acvention, \npolitical and economic blockade and atrocious \nFascist invasions. The humanitarian nature of the \nprinciples which underlie the Union is constantly \nreaffirmed. The creation of the USSR strengthened \nour national statehood and showed that only in \ncon-ditions of equality, freedom and mutual \nrespect can people\u2019s fully realize their \nspiritual and creative potential. The Ukrainian \nSSR therefore takes pride in the fact that it was \namong the first to call for the creation of the \nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics 60 years ago. \nVladimir V. Shcherbitsky, member of the Politburo \nof the Central Committee of the Communist Party \nof the Soviet Union, First Secretary of the \nCentral Committee of the Communist Party of the \nUkraine, stressed during the celebration of the \none thousand five hundredth anniversary of their \ncity of Kiev: for The peoples of our country have \nteamed from their own experience that being \ntogether within one Union Sate multiplies their \nstrength and speeds up social, economic and \ncultural development. And we shall tirelessly \nsafeguard our sacred union and strengthen it in \nevery way .\n52.\tThe multinational Soviet State which was \nborn 60 years ago stands today as a powerful \nforce in the struggle for the strengthening of \nfriendship among all the peoples of the world and \nfor lasting peace on earth.\n53.\tThe Ukrainian SSR, together with other \nSkates Members of the United Nations, is prepared \nto con\u00actinue consistently, persistently and \nasolutely to multiply its efforts in the struggle \nfor peace, social progress, co-operation and \nunderstanding among peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of Paraguay I should like to congratulate \nMr. Hollai on his election to conduct the proceedings of the General \nAssembly, an honor that has been conferred upon him because of his \npersonal integrity and his well recognized diplomatic experience.\nWe extend to the Secretary General our best wishes for success in the \nimportant work before him. We do so not only because of the esteem in \nwhich we hold him but also because as South Americans we feel \ngratified at his election. We are pleased to see that every day he \ngives clear proof of his skills and his unquestionable dedication to \nhis work, as evidenced by his report on the work of the Organization, \na report that concisely sets forth many creative suggestions at a \ntime when, though there has been hesitant progress, efforts are being \nmade to achieve survival in peace and dignity.\nMy delegation fully shares the deep anxiety of the Secretary General, \nwho has urgently appealed to us for common sense and effective \naction. We note his hopes and offer him Paraguay's cooperation in his \nnoble efforts to implement the Organization's mandate under the \nCharter to avoid the untold sorrow that results from war, to reaffirm \nfaith in fundamental human rights and to establish conditions \nconducive to the general progress of all our peoples in a universal \natmosphere of coexistence based on mutual respect, justice and \nfreedom.\nPerhaps more than any other year in the life of the Organization, the \npast year has been characterized by continued violence in different \nparts of the world. As the Secretary General has pointed out, we are \napt to forget with suicidal single mindedness the six years of global \nagony and destruction that preceded the San Francisco Conference, and \nit is true that thus far we have not learned to operate sensibly the \nsystem of collective security that is the only instrument available \nto us to preserve our generation and succeeding generations from \ntotal disaster. We are haunted by far justified and healthy fear that \nalerts us and prompts us to understand the dangers that stalk us. \nWith all the defects inherent in human endeavor, the Charter remains \nthe only valid instrument Car the finding of solutions which, though \nprovisional, can defuse the critical situation that confronts us. The \ndifferent conferences on disarmament that have taken place since the \ndays of the frustrated League of Nations have not thus far offered \nthe Rope of a promising course of action. The so called major Powers \nand those that try to be major Powers bear the tremendous \nresponsibility of giving the world an example of wisdom and of real \nand effective respect for life, the most important human right. \nStatements on the principle of the sovereign equality of States are \nmeaningless if the destiny of mankind is linked to the interests of \nthose who wield atomic power, with all its horrors. Equally \nmeaningless are the intentions of promoting the overall well being of \npeoples if vast sums are earmarked to annihilate them, in a vicious \ncircle of dissuasion which can last only so long. Moreover, the \nterrorism which is exercised in the internal sphere and exported \nequally criminally beyond their own borders by some Governments is an \neloquent expression of a state of madness which can be compared only \nto the threat of an atomic holocaust. In spite of the inexplicable \ndifficulties involved in the consideration of this topic in the Sixth \nCommittee, my delegation would ask that the study of draft \ninternational instruments aimed at removing the apocalyptic scourge \nof terrorism, such as, for example, the draft Code of Offences \nAgainst the Peace and Security of Mankind and a draft international \nconvention against the recruitment, use, financing and training of \nmercenaries be accelerated. Those and other legal instruments with \nbinding force at the international level should, together with The \nHague, Montreal and Tokyo Conventions, which my country has already \nsigned, provide a body of provisions which can counteract that type \nof crime.\nA/37/PV.23\nParaguay has heroic experience of wars. My country has itself \nsuffered not only the incalculable loss of life of its sons and \ndaughters in devastating numbers but also the hardships of foreign \nmilitary occupation and the mutilation of its territorial heritage. \nThus we repudiate and forcefully condemn the Soviet Union's \nsubjugation of the sovereignty of Afghanistan, a country which is \nsteadfastly struggling to defend its independence; we repudiate with \nequal force Viet Nam's intervention in Kampuchea; and we cannot fail \nto condemn the brutal genocide carried out against defenseless \ncommunities in Lebanon. All these and similar events of transitory \nnotoriety seem to have the incredible purpose of lulling our \nconsciences and anaesthetizing our sensitivities. Faced with this \nnegative picture, which causes pessimism, my country welcomes the \ncertain positive signs of understanding which have emerged in the \ninternational political sphere. We express the fervent hope for \nsuccess in the efforts made by the Republic of Korea to bring about \nthe unification of the peninsula through direct negotiations with the \nPeople's Democratic Republic of Korea, and we trust that, under the \ncompetent guidance of the Secretary General, the efforts which began \nin 1979 will continue. Paraguay has for more than a quarter of a \ncentury now enjoyed a climate of political, social and economic \nstability based on a system of sound democracy, administered with \nconstant dedication to the higher interests of the Republic. In spite \nof the serious general deterioration which has dangerously affected \nthe economic and financial situation of the world, my country \nmaintains the conditions which make it possible for us to benefit \nfrom one of the highest growth rates on the continent, a very sound \nexternal public indebtedness record, a balanced administrative budget \nand a very low level of unemployment which is not in any way a social \nproblem. None the less we are fully aware of the need and the \nobligation of the developing counties to remedy, through common \naction, the unacceptable shortcomings of an economic structure which \naffects the prices of our commodities, stimulates disorder in the \nmonetary system and stultifies international trade. We have faith in \nthe creative capacity of our nation. As far as we Paraguayans are \nconcerned President Stroessner stated, at the beginning of his \noutstanding work of leadership that the people is the source of the \nspirit that has made Paraguay's Homeric record possible in the \nhistory of the nations of the world. The people is the substance that \nnourishes us, that gives us strength to react the summit without fail \nand to raise our flag as a lofty, lasting symbol of our national \ngrandeur. My Government, together with those of other nations of the \nAmericas, signed a request for the inclusion in the agenda for debate \nat the present session of the General Assembly of an item on the \nquestion of the Malvinas Islands. In doing so, Paraguay was merely \nendorsing the attitude it had already adopted at the two special \nsessions of the Assembly of the Organization of American States in \nMay and June of this year in order to consider the armed conflict \nwhich broke out in the South Atlantic. Aware of the extreme \nseriousness of the military confrontation, which was then approaching \nour continent, my country joined hi the united action of the nations \nof the Americas to try to avoid the crisis, even though the situation \nresulting from the events that had taken place and from the ongoing \nnegotiations aimed at reaching agreement, did not offer much hope of \na negotiated solution. Now, in the same spirit of friendship towards \nthe parties to the armed conflict over the Malvinas and with the same \nsense of responsibility regarding our duties towards the \ninternational community, the delegation of Paraguay is sponsoring, \ntogether with other nations of the Americas, a draft resolution to be \nsubmitted at this session of the General Assembly, with a view to \nachieving a just and honorable solution to the conflict between \nArgentina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \nIreland. It is our fervent hope that the disputes over territorial \ndelimitations between Argentina and Chile, Ecuador and Peru and \nGuyana and Venezuela will be resolved in a dignified and intelligent \nway. Throughout the difficult process of institutional consolidation, \nthe nations of the Americas without exception found it difficult to \ndelimit their respective territories. These difficulties stemmed \nmainly from the confusing administrative legacy received from the \nSpanish Crown in the political sphere in which the colonial Power \nexercised its authority. This is the reason for the armed conflicts \nthat have taken place among nations in our continent to resolve their \ndisputes. Paraguay, for example, has throughout its history as a \ncolonial political entity seen the shrinking of a territory which \noriginally included what is now the vast region of the Rio de la \nPlata in addition to a strip of land 200 leagues in extent on the \nPacific Ocean. Hence, in the sixteenth century my homeland was called \nthe Vast Province of the Indies and the ocean adjacent to the present \ncoast of Uruguay and Argentina was in the seventeenth century called \nthe Paraguayan Sea. I mention this merely to recall that the process \nof delimiting our American republics has in every case been the \nresult of an accumulation of circumstances, fortunate or otherwise, \nwhich, in the final analysis, have been accepted as the rule of \nhistory, In the light of this, it is difficult for us to imagine that \na breakdown in diplomatic negotiations aimed at resolving territorial \nconflicts between our countries should give way to the theory of \nClausewitz and that there should be recourse to armed force. My \ndelegation expresses the very fervent hope that the aforementioned \nterritorial disputes will be resolved in a strong Americanist spirit, \nwhich would do honor to the sincere and irreversible desire to build \ntogether an effective system guaranteeing the future and the well \nbeing of our peoples. Since I have just recalled the process of \ndelimiting the borders of our American countries, it is relevant to \npoint out that Paraguay has been reduced to a landlocked country and \nin this respect has every right to lay a claim to the legitimate \nmeans provided by the international community to countries that are \ndeprived of a coastline. There are agreements between my country and \nneighboring countries aimed at facilitating river and road \ntransportation for access to the sea. At the present time, the \nGovernment of Paraguay is considering, on the basis of an already \ndeveloped project, the construction of the facilities needed to join \nits national railway to that of Brazil, making available to us \nanother important channel of access to the ocean.\nPrecisely because it is a land locked country, Paraguay has expressed \nits great interest in overcoming the limitations that stem from that \ncondition. Thus, my country participated actively in the various \nconferences on the law of the sea held since 1958 and in the drafting \nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of Sea, which will be \nopen to signature countries in Jamaica next December. I should like \nto affirm my country's interest in obtaining through that Convention \nall the facilities for land locked countries provided for therein. In \naddition, situated as it is by geography in the Plata basin, my \ncountry is conducting a policy of genuine regional integration in \norder to exploit Ally the natural resources that we share with \nArgentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Uruguay. I am pleased to announce to \nthe Assembly that, because of this, on 5 November 1982, at the border \nof our countries, the President of Paraguay, General Alfredo \nStroessner and the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, \nGeneral Joao Baptista de Oliveira Figueiredo, will meet for the \nformal development of the Itaipu hydroelectric plant, the largest \nhydroelectric complex in the world, which will have an installed \ncapacity of 12,600 megawatts and will produce approximately 75 \nbillion kilowatt hours a year. I wished to conclude my statement with \nan affirmation of what peoples can do when they are inspired by genuine \ncooperation and understanding. President Stroessner has said: Peace \nis the basis of all that makes it possible for us to progress with a \ncalm vision of the future; this is reason enough to defend it from \nthose who make of war an instrument of domination and of democracy a \npretext for extinguishing freedom. For the sister nations of America \nand all the nations of our world we hope for days of constructive \npeace. We hope that the pain that has affected the fraternal \ncountries of our continent will come to an end. We hope that the \nAmericas will be a powerful and respected force in the international \nsphere, with a sense of life that does honor to the ideal of \nindependence and freedom, a flame kindled by Jose Gaspar Rodriguez de \nFrancia and Francisco Solano Lopez, Bolivar, Marti, Juarez, Jose \nBonifacio, San Martin and so many other eminent individuals who gave \nour nations a lasting example of human dignity.\n"

        "file_text": "The Thai delega\u00action takes pleasure in joining \nwith the preceding delegations in extending to \nthe President its sincere congratulations on his \nunanimous election to his office for the \nthirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. \nAt a time when the Organization is assuming ever \nincreasing responsibilities, not only in the \npreserva-tion of peace, but also for the security \nand well-being of peoples in all regions of the \nworld, we are gratified to have a person of his \ndemonstrable experience, skill and impartiality \nto preside over our deliberations. In the coming \nmonths, many issues vital to the general peace, \nprogress and prosperity of the international \ncommunity of which we are all a part will \ndoubtless be brought before the General Assembly. \nOn us will be focused much attention and of us \nmuch will and should be expected. For in the \nUnited Nations will be vested many of the hopes \nand aspirations of the world's peoples. My \ndelegation therefore pledges to the President and \nVice-Presidents of the Assembly, as well as to \nthe Secretary-General and his able staff, its \nfull co-operation in the discharge of the heavy \nresponsibilities that lie ahead.\n187.\tThe delegation of Thailand also has the \nhonor to convey its deep appreciation to Mr. \nKittani, Presi\u00acdent of the thirty-sixth session \nof the Assembly, for his distinguished services \non behalf of the Organi\u00aczation. His invaluable \ncontributions to the interna\u00actional community \nhave earned for himself and his country the high \nesteem of Governments and peoples around the \nworld.\n188.\tThe past year has been particularly \nmomentous. The seventh emergency special session \nof the General Assembly, on the question of \nPalestine, has been reconvened a few times \nrecently to consider the pressing situation in \nthe Middle East and, in particular, the tragedy \nthat has befallen Lebanon. The military \naggression committed by Israel against the \nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon, \nresulting in the terrible loss of innocent \ncivilian lives, including those of women and \nchildren, has undermined efforts on the part of \nthe international community to find a just and \nlasting settlement for the conflict in the Middle \nEast. Moreover, the world was deeply shocked by \nthe ruth\u00acless massacre in west Beirut following \nt.ie violation of the cease-fire agreements by \nIsraeli armed forces.\n189.\tMy delegation urges that a full and \nimpartial investigation be conducted by the \nUnited Nations, with the consent of the Lebanese \nGovernment and the co-operation of all parties \nconcerned, so that the facts may become known and \nthe culprits brought to justice as soon as \npossible. Meanwhile, Thailand wishes to join in \ncalling for the expeditious and total withdrawal \nof all foreign forces from Lebanon in accordance \nwith the relevant United Nations resolutions so \nthat the people of Lebanon can once again be the \nmasters of their own destiny.\n190.\tInterpretation of national security \ninterests by one party can never be permitted to \nbe so broad as to encompass the right to invade \nand occupy a sovereign and independent State, to \ndislodge people from their homelands or to \nsubjugate them in occupied territories. The \nGovernment of Thailand deplores the fact that the \nPalestinian people continue to be denied their \ninalien\u00acable rights. Every effort must continue \nwith urgency to enable them to attain and \nexercise their rights, including the right to \nself-determination without external interference, \nthe right to national indepen\u00acdence and \nsovereignty and the right to return to their \nhomes and properties.\n191.\tAt the same time as the legitimate rights \nof the Palestinian people are recognized, \nincluding the right to statehood, the legitimate \nrights of all States in the region to exist \nwithin secure and recognized borders must also be \nrecognized in the interest of peace. It is my \ndelegation's firm belief that the conflict in the \nMiddle East, with the question of Palestine as \nits core issue, must find a negotiated solution \nwith the par\u00acticipation of all concerned \nincluding the PLO, which represents the \nPalestinian people.\n192.\tThe Lebanese crisis has proved that there is \nno effective military solution to the Middle East \nconflict and that military might not crush the \nlegitimate aspirations of peoples. On the \ncontrary, such aspira\u00actions have gained greater \ninternational support and will be more fervently \nmanifested. The course of events in the Middle \nEast must be steered towards a peaceful political \nsettlement; otherwise it might take an ever \ndownward turn drawing all concerned into a spiral \nof increasing violence. My delegation therefore \nwel\u00accomes the recent pronouncements of the United \nStates Government as a positive development.\n193.\tHowever, while the State of Israel is a \nrecog\u00acnized reality, the legitimacy of \nPalestinian yearnings for statehood must also be \nrecognized. In this connec\u00action the Arab \ncountries have announced the Fez plan, which \nmarks a historic step and establishes a \nframe\u00acwork for further dialogues and negotiations \naccept\u00acable to the Palestinians and the key Arab \nStates. Provided that the plan takes due \ncognizance of Security Council resolution 242 \n(1967), prospects for widening the dialogue to \ninclude other interested parties seem more \npromising. It is the earnest hope of my \ndelega\u00action that these welcome new developments \nand the recent deplorable events in Lebanon will \nhelp to intensify efforts to find a just and \nlasting solution to the Middle East conflict that \nwill result in the attainment by the Palestinian \npeople of their rights and the enjoyment by ali \nStates, including Israel and Lebanon, of secure \nexistence within their recognized borders.\n194.\tOver 20 years after the Declaration on \nthe Granting of Independence to Colonial \nCountries and Peoples, it is regrettable to note \nthat peoples in many parts of the world are still \nstruggling for the dignity that only freedom and \nself-determination can bestow. The valiant \nstruggle of the Palestinian people finds worthy \nparallels in the situations in Namibia, \nAfghani\u00acstan and Kampuchea.\n193. My delegation is deeply concerned that the \npresence of South African occupation forces in \nNamibia continues to threaten peace not only in \nNamibia but also throughout southern Africa, in \nflagrant disregard of relevant United Nations \nresolu\u00actions. Indeed, the continuing instability \nin southern Africa poses a threat to \ninternational peace and security. The Government \nof Thailand reiterates its view that the illegal \noccupation of Namibia must be unconditionally and \nimmediately brought to an end to enable the \nNamibian people to achieve sovereignty and \nindependence in an integrated Namibia.\n196.\tIt is our just expectation that the \ncontact group will redouble its efforts to bring \nabout a compre\u00achensive settlement in Namibia that \nwill also end the aggressions committed by South \nAfrican forces against neighbouring front-line \nStates. Continued failure to arrive at a \npolitical settlement would only confirm the \njustified reaction of SWAPO that it must attain \nits legitimate goals of self-determination, \nfreedom and independence in a united Namibia by \nall possible means.\n197.\tIn Afghanistan the proud Afghan people \ncon\u00actinue to suffer under the yoke of foreign \noccupation. The Assembly has called for the \nimmediate, uncon\u00acditional and total withdrawal of \nforeign troops from Afghanistan. My Government \nfully supports the efforts of the Organization of \nthe Islamic Conference to seek a solution to the \ncrisis. Continued humanitarian assistance must be \naccorded to the hundreds of thousands of Afghan \nrefugees forced to flee from their country and \nthe ruthless suppression of Afghan patriots must \nbe brought to an end. We join in urging the \nAssembly once again to help rectify the \ninjustices perpetrated against the Afghan people. \nIt is the responsibility of the Security Council \nto preserve international peace and security, and \nthe permanent member concerned should recognize \nthat its actions in Afghanistan only destabilize \nthe precarious balance in that vital region of \nthe world, and that any prolonged instability \nthere will have serious repercussions beyond the \nAfghan borders to its own detriment.\n198.\tThe plight of the Palestinian, Namibian and \nAfghan peoples continues rightly, to be an \ninterna\u00actional issue of grave concern to the \nworld community. In South-East Asia, the people \nof Kampuchea also have been denied the right to \ndetermine their own destiny, because their nation \nhas been invaded and occupied by a more powerful \nneighbor. They have been forced to flee their \nhomes to seek food and shelter in neighbouring \ncountries. Moreover, they con\u00actinue to be denied \ntheir basic human rights by the occupation \nforces. Therefore, the situation in Kam\u00acpuchea \npresents a political and humanitarian challenge \nto the world community. The foreign invasion and \noccupation of Kampuchea have resulted in untold \nsuffering for the Kampuchean people and created \nsevere tension in South-East Asia. The present \nsituation has interrupted the process ot \nconstructive co-operation among countries of \nSouth-East Asia and brought about an \nintensification of big-Power rivalry in the \nregion. Thus the conflict in Kampuchea \nconsti\u00actutes a threat to international peace and \nsecurity.\n199.\tIn three successive years the General \nAssembly adopted three resolutions calling for \nthe withdrawal of all foreign forces, respect for \nthe sovereignty, inde\u00acpendence and territorial \nintegrity of Kampuchea and the free exercise of \nself-determination by the Kampu\u00acchean people. \nHowever, these resolutions remain unheeded by the \ninstigator of the conflict. My country, together \nwith the other members of ASEAN, has endeavoured, \nwithin the framework of the United Nations, to \nseek a peaceful comprehensive political se dement \nto the conflict in Kampuchea.\n200.\tLast year the International Conference on \nKampuchea was convened by the Secretary-General \nat United Nations Headquarters to consider ways \nand means of achieving a just and durable \nsolution of the Kampuchean problem. The \nDeclaration adopted by consensus at that \nConference^ reaffirmed that with\u00acdrawal of all \nforeign forces from Kampuchea, restora\u00action of \nthe independence, sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of Kampuchea and the free exercise of \nself- determination by the Kampuchean people were \nthe principal components of any just and lasting \nsolution to the Kampuchean problem. The \nConference also called for negotiations on a \ncease-fire and withdrawal of all foreign forces \nunder United Nations supervision and measures for \nthe maintenance of peace and order in Kampuchea \nand for the holding of free elections under \nUnited Nations supervision. Regrettably, these \ncalls by the overwhelming majority of the \ninternational community have been ignored by Viet \nNam, which maintains its military occupation of \nKampuchea.\n201.\tThe Ad Hoc Committee set up by the \nInterna\u00actional Conference on Kampuchea, under the \nchairman\u00acship of Mr. Sarre of Senegal, has \nundertaken several missions in pursuit of the \nobjectives of the Conference. My delegation would \nlike to express its deep apprecia\u00action to Mr. \nSarre and the Ad Hoc Committee for their efforts. \nWe strongly urge all parties concerned, in \nparticular Viet Nam and its allies, to join in \nthis peace process under the aegis of the United \nNations to effect a just and durable solution to \nthe Kampuchean problem.\n202.\tMy delegation would also like to express \nits sincere appreciation to Mr. Willibald Pahr, \nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Austria and \nPresident of the International Conference on \nKampuchea, for his constructive role. We should \nalso like to pay a warm tribute to the \nSecretary-General for this continuing concern \nwith regard to the Kampuchean problem. We call \nonce again on all States Members of the United \nNations to recognize the usefulness of these \nefforts and to accord their full co-operation.\n203.\tDespite the efforts made by the ASEAN \ncoun\u00actries in ongoing bilateral dialogues to \nfacilitate a negotiated settlement of the \nKampuchean conflict, we regret to report that no \nsubstantial progress has been made and that no \nsubstantive change in Viet Nam's position has \nbeen evident. Our hopes are constantly raised \nprior to every session of the General Assembly. \nAt such times, seemingly new proposals are made \nby Hanoi or at its instigation, as in the recent \nHo Chi Minh City communique and in the \ncommunication of the Minister for Foreign Affairs \nof the Lao People's Democratic Republic. However, \nupon closer examination, it is apparent that \nthese proposals do not offer a viable basis for a \njust and lasting settlement of the Kampu\u00acchean \nproblem.\n204.\tIn the Ho Chi Minh City communique issued \nin July, a partial withdrawal of Vietnamese \ntroops from Kampuchea was offered. Subsequently, \nthe Vietnamese authorities claimed that this \npartial with\u00acdrawal had been completed in \nmid-July. However, there are reports indicating \nthat there was merely a rotation of troops and \nnew units from Viet Nam have been arriving in \nKampuchea since the end of April. The relevant \nUnited Nations resolutions call for a complete \nand total withdrawal of foreign forces from \nKampuchea. Indeed, a genuine commitment to that \nend by the party concerned would be welcomed as a \npositive step in the right direction. The \nAssembly, therefore, needs to reiterate its call \nfor the total with\u00acdrawal of all foreign forces \nfrom Kampuchea.\n205.\tViet Nam has also proposed an \ninternational conference on South-East Asia with \nlimited participa\u00action. As I have already \nmentioned, the International Conference on \nKampuchea was convened in July last year, with \nthe participation of over 90 States and parties \nconcerned. Ad Hoc Committee was estab\u00aclished by \nthat Conference to undertake efforts towards a \npeaceful negotiated settlement of the Kampuchean \nconflict. We once again call on Viet Nam and its \nallies to participate in the United Nations peace \nprocess on Kampuchea. As a State Member of the \nUnited Nations, Viet Nam should have no \ndifficulty in participating in this United \nNations framework for a negotiated settlement of \nthe Kampuchean conflict.\n206.\tOn the one hand, Viet Nam appears to \nregard the situation in Kampuchea as an internal \nissue of concern only to the Heng Samrin puppet \nregime; on the other hand, Vietnamese authorities \nhave stressed their preoccupation with the \nChinese threat against the three Indo-Chinese \ncountries. Therefore, it must first be \nascertained that the Kampuchean problem to be \ndiscussed at an international conference would \nnot be the mere question of a so-called Chinese \nthreat against the puppet regime in Phnom Penh \nbut the exercise of the right to \nself-determination by the Kampuchean people, free \nfrom foreign occupation and alien domination. The \nother countries of Southeast Asia must be \nsatisfied that such proposals would not serve to \nlegitimize Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea and \nprolong the suffering of the Kampu\u00acchean people.\n207.\tViet Nam has also proposed that a \nso-called safety zone, or demilitarized zone, be \nestablished along the Thai-Kampuchean border. \nHowever, the armed conflict in Kampuchea is not \nbetween Thailand and Kampuchea, but between \nVietnamese forces and Kampuchean patriots. If a \ndemilitarized zone is to be established, it \nshould be along the Kampuchean- Vietnamese \nborder. It should be recalled that Kampu\u00acchean \nresistance forces are there because of the \nVietnamese occupation of their homeland. Only if \nand when such foreign occupation comes to an end \ncan the Kampuchean patriots legitimately be \nexpected to lay down their arms. To restore peace \nto Kampuchea and to reduce regional tension it is \nnecessary that the 200,000 Vietnamese troops be \ncompletely withdrawn from Kampuchea.\n208.\tDespite the presence of 200,000 \nVietnamese troops in Kampuchea and their \nfour-year onslaught against Kampuchean \nresistance, the latter has gained in strength and \nnumbers. The new Government of Democratic \nKampuchea under the presidency of Prince Norodom \nSihanouk is a natural and posi\u00active development \nthat reflects the firm resolve and relentless \ndetermination of the Kampuchean people to resist \nthe imposition of any form of alien domination. \nThe new leadership of Kampuchea also offers \nrenewed hopes for improving the prospects of \nachieving a comprehensive political settlement of \nthe Kampuchean problem in accordance with the \nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\n209.\tThe turmoil in Indo-China and in particular \nthe continued armed conflict in Kampuchea have \nresulted in large numbers of people fleeing to \nseek food and shelter in neighbouring countries. \nSince 1975 over 1 million people from Indo-China \nhave sought tem\u00acporary refuge in Thailand, a \ncountry of first refuge in South-East Asia. Many \nothers did not survive the perilous journey \noverland or by leaky boat on the high seas. \nAlthough the numbers have been reduced and many \nrefugees have been resettled in third countries, \nthe situation remains of grave humanitarian \nconcern to the international community. There are \nstill over 150,000 Vietnamese, Laotian and \nKampuchean refugees in Thai holding centers. \nFurthermore, with the fighting in Kampuchea there \nis every possibility that new waves of refugees \nand displaced persons \u2014now numbering some 200,000 \nto 300,000 along the Thai-Kampuchean border\u2014will \nsweep across the border into Thailand.\n210.\tThe Government of Thailand is therefore \nsadly disappointed at the recent sharp decline in \nthe resettlement rates in third countries of \nIndo-Chinese refugees in Thailand.\n\nThe need to expedite their resettlement as well \nas to increase resettlement opportunities in \nthird countries should be a matter of serious \nconcern, not only to Thailand but also to all \ncountries which uphold humanitarian principles. \nIt is mainly because of international \nhumanitarian assistance provided by donor \nGovernments, United Nations agencies and over 50 \nvoluntary agencies and Thailand's humane policy \nand co-operation that mass starvation inside \nKampuchea has been averted.\n211.\tMy delegation would like to express our \nprofound appreciation to the donor countries and \nto the Secretary-General and his Special \nRepresentative, as well as to the various United \nNations and voluntary agencies, for their \ndedicated efforts in this regard.\n212.\tThe needs of the Kampucheans remain real \nand manifest along the Thai-Kampuchean border as \nwell as in the Thai holding centers. The \nKampuchean influx and the Vietnamese incursions \nand cross-border shellings have also displaced \nclose to 100,000 innocent Thai villagers. We \ntherefore urge donor countries to continue to \nsupport the humanitarian programmes of the United \nNations along the Thai-Kampuchean border and in \nthe holding centers and to assist the Royal Thai \nGovernment in the relief and rehabilitation of \nthe affected Thai villagers.\n213.\tThe resources of Thailand, a developing \nthird- world nation, have been strained by the \nneed to assist in the care and shelter of the \nlarge numbers of displaced Indo-Chinese persons. \nWhile the Govern\u00acment of Thailand intends to \ncontinue to fulfill its humanitarian \nresponsibilities in accordance with its \ntraditions, the problem not only poses a heavy \neconomic burden for Thailand but also has \nimmediate and long-term political and security \nimplications. The most natural solution would be \nfor the refugees to return safely to their homes. \nThe Royal Thai Govern\u00acment, in co-operation with \nUNHCR, will continue to promote and assist in the \nprogram of voluntary repatriation by land, sea \nand air. Pending the full implementation of that \nprogram, safe relocation of the Kampuchean \ndisplaced persons in the border areas which are \naccessible to relief supplies seems to be a \nviable alternative.\n214.\tIt is worth noting that the humanitarian \naspect of the Kampuchean problem can find a \nlasting solu-tion only if there is a \ncomprehensive political settle\u00acment of the \nKampuchean problem as a whole. The international \ncommunity must therefore redouble its efforts to \nresolve the Kampuchean conflict once and for all \nin accordance with the relevant United Nations \nresolutions. To this end, Thailand and the member \ncountries of ASEAN have sought the assistance of \nthe international community in bringing about a \nnegotiated settlement of the problem. The efforts \nof ASEAN are undertaken with sincerity and in \ngood faith. We harbor no enmity towards any \ncountry, particularly those situated in our \nregion. But the armed conflict in Kampuchea \nstands in the way of closer co-operation among \nthe countries of South-Fust Asia and consti\u00actutes \na serious threat not only to regional but to \ninterna\u00actional peace and security. The peaceful \nsettlement of the conflict will pave the way \ntowards the establish\u00acment of a zone of peace, \nfreedom and neutrality in South-East Asia which \nwould provide for the orderly development of all \npeoples in the region, irrespective of \ndifferences in their political, economic or \nsocial systems.\n215.\tOne of the basic causes of international \nconflicts today is the economic discrepancy and \nexploitation among nations. In recognition of \nthis fact, the United Nations system has devoted \nthe greater part of its entire budget to the \ntasks of economic and social development. \nHowever, the fact remains that there are still \nnearly 1 billion people living in abject poverty \nin the world today, and by the end of the Third \nUnited Nations Development Decade their number \nwill have surpassed the 1 billion mark.\n216.\tIn view of the present crisis in the \nworld eco\u00acnomy, progress in the efforts to narrow \nthe gap between rich and poor nations has not \nbeen satisfactory. Thailand's current fifth \nfive-year plan is aimed at reducing the external \ntrade deficit and population growth rate, \nrestructuring its key productive sectors, \neradicating poverty in rural areas and \nmaintaining its annual growth rate of between 6 \nper cent and 7 per cent.\n217.\tHowever, our export earnings have been \nad\u00acversely affected by the protectionist policies \nof certain developed countries. In this \nconnection my delegation reiterates the hope \nexpressed by the ASEAN Foreign Ministers at their \nfifteenth ministerial meeting, in June 1982, that \nthe GATT ministerial meeting in November 1982 \nwill restore the basic task of GATT in ensuring \nthat the principles of free trade are \nconsistently practiced in the world market. We \nalso hope that the sixth session of UNCTAD, in \n1983, will successfully tackle such priority \nissues as pro\u00actectionism, structural adjustment \nand commodities.\n218.\tWe live in an increasingly interdependent \nworld. A global, integrated and comprehensive \napproach to world problems is essential if there \nis to be an agreed solution. For this reason, in \n1974, the General As-sembly adopted the Programme \nof Action on the Establishment of a New \nInternational Economic Order which would ensure \nthe full and active participation of the \ndeveloping countries in gobal decision-making and \nthe management of international economic \nco-operation for development.\n219.\tMy Government fully welcomed and endorsed \nthe decision taken at the sixth special session \nas well as the subsequent adoption of the \nInternational Development Strategy for the Third \nUnited Nations Development Decade and resolution \n34/138, calling for the launching of global and \nsustained negotiations on international economic \nco\u00acoperation for development. We are, however, \ndis\u00acappointed that, almost three years after \nresolution 34/138 was adopted by consensus, and \ndespite con\u00actinued endeavors and the flexibility \nshown by the Group of 77 and many of its \nindustrialized friends, some influential Members \ncontinue to procrastinate concerning the \nlaunching of global negotiations. We earnestly \nhope that the latter will, in the spirit of \nCancun, demonstrate the necessary will to \nproceed, as further postponement of the launching \nof global negotiations would not only aggravate \nthe already deteriorating relations between North \nand South but also, in the eyes of the South, \ndemonstrate a lack of good faith on the part of \nthe North, which could impede further efforts at \nco-operation.\n220.\tWhatever the outcome of the global \nnegotia\u00actions, my Government will continue to \ndevelop its economic co-operation with other \ndeveloping countries in all fields as set forth \nin the 1981 Caracas Programme of Action/ in \naccordance with the principles of self- reliance, \nself-help and North-South co-operation. Economic \nco-operation among developing countries is not a \nsubstitute for global or North-South \nco\u00acoperation, but it is an integral part of the \ncollective action of the Group of 77 for the \nrestructuring of international economic relations \nand the establish\u00acment of a new international \neconomic order. We therefore hope that, following \nthe first meeting of the Intergovernmental Follow \nup and Co-ordination Com\u00acmittee on economic \nco-operation a among developing countries, in \nManila last month, more concrete actions and \nvigorous implementation of the Caracas Pro\u00acgramme \nwill be pursued.\n221.\tMy delegation believes that the United \nNations system provides the most appropriate \nforum and a useful framework for identifying and \nfocusing world attention on major issues as well \nas for seeking peace\u00acful solutions to those \nissues. Therefore all countries, developed and \ndeveloping, are urged to co-operate within the \nUnited Nations system in achieving our worthy \ncommon goal of a restructured and equitable \neconomic order for the world community that will \nbenefit all mankind. My delegation therefore \npledges its best efforts to continue to play a \nconstructive role in this regard.\n222.\tThe just and equitable utilization of the \nearth's resources is seriously distorted by the \ncontinuing arms race. The second special session \nof the General As\u00acsembly devoted to disarmament \nwas convened at a time when the need to halt and \nreverse the arms race had become even more \nimperative than before. The recurrent crises and \nconflicts which have marked the international \nsituation have heightened the sense of insecurity \namong some States and spurred the pro\u00acduction, \nacquisition, and stockpiling of weapons of \ndestruction, including nuclear, conventional and \nchemical weapons, resulting not only in increased \ninsecurity for all States but also in the \nretardation of the developmental prospects of \nmost third-world countries. Efforts made both \nwithin and outside the framework of the United \nNations to reverse the arms race have not been \ncrowned with success.\n223.\tBut although the second special session \non disarmament fell short of expectations, the \nconvening of that session nevertheless served \nsome useful pur\u00acposes. Among other things, it \nproduced substantive advances in new ideas, \nsuggestions and proposals in various fields of \ndisarmament, many of which, if implemented, could \ncontribute significantly to the disarmament \nprocess. Agreement was reached on guidelines for \na World Disarmament Campaign which underline the \nuniversality of the program and allow all sectors \nof the public unimpeded access to a broad range \nof information and opinions on the questions of \narms limitation and disarmament and the dangers \nrelating to all aspects of the arms race and war, \nin par\u00acticular nuclear war. The launching of the \nCampaign thus represents a step forward in the \nefforts to attain meaningful measures of arms \nlimitation and dis\u00acarmament.\n224.\tThe second special session on disarmament \ngenerated an unprecedented degree of public \nattention and interest, highlighted by mass \ngatherings of the people of many nations in \nsupport of the cause of disarmament. This should \nserve as an impetus for all of us to continue our \nefforts and revitalize the mul\u00actilateral \nnegotiating process, which was kept in being at \nthe conclusion of the second special session on \ndisarmament.\n225.\tMy delegation urges that disarmament and \nthe reduction of the arms race in both nuclear \nand con-ventional weapons remain an issue of \npriority concern to the Assembly. The world has \nthus far been spared the horrors of nuclear war, \nbut we all realize the consequences that such a \nconflagration would have for the human race. The \nspecter and the reality of conventional wars, \nwith the terrible suffering in\u00acflicted through \nthe ever-increasing sophistication of weaponry, \nare still sadly with us. Wars have been fought \nbecause of the aggressive and expansionist \ntendencies of militarily powerful States, or have \nresulted from injustices inflicted and wrongs \nthat remain uncorrected.\n226.\tOur task must surely be to rededicate \nourselves to the principles enshrined in the \nCharter on the non- use of force, \nnon-interference in internal affairs and respect \nfor the territorial integrity of States, while \nseeking to resolve international issues by \npeaceful means.\n227.\tIn this connection my delegation urges that a dialogue \nbe agreed upon between North Korea and South \nKorea for the consideration of effective ways and \nmeans of reducing tension and strengthening peace \nin the Korean peninsula.\n228.\tInjustices against entire nations and \npeoples continue to be committed in the Middle \nEast, in Namibia, in Afghanistan and in \nKampuchea. These appear to be among the most \nintractable and critical issues to which the \nGeneral Assembly has addressed its attention over \nthe past several years, and they represent cases \nwhere, in the Secretary-General's words:\n\\\"Governments that believe they can win an \ninternational objective by force are often quite \nready to do so, and domestic opinion not \ninfrequently applauds such a course. The Security \nCouncil, the primary organ of the United Nations \nfor the main\u00actenance of international peace and \nsecurity, all too often finds itself unable to \ntake decisive action to resolve international \nconflicts and its resolutions are increasingly \ndefied or ignored by those that feel themselves \nstrong enough to do so.\\\"\n229.\tThis is indeed a very dangerous trend and \ncould eventually turn the Organization, which was \nintended to serve the cause of harmony and peace, \ninto a breeding ground for international \nconfrontation and anarchy.\n230.\tThe Thai delegation sincerely believes \nthat each and every Member State has the duty and \nresponsibility to reverse this trend, by \nrededicating ourselves to the principles and \npurposes of the Charter and by a renewed \ncommitment to use the machinery of the United \nNations more effectively. For only in this way \ncan the Organization truly become an instrument \nfor peaceful change and orderly progress for \nmankind.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour for me to convey to Mr. Hollai on \nbehalf of the Gabonese delegation and on my own \nbehalf, our warmest congratulations on his \nelection to the presidency of the thirty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. Aware as we are \nof his wealth of diplomatic experience and his \nbrilliant qualities, to which all previous \nspeakers have paid a tribute, I am convinced that \nunder his enlightened, fair and balanced \nguidance, our work will be conducted in an \natmosphere of calm and dignity and will yield \nuseful results, thus living up to our \nexpectations. I should therefore like to assure \nhim at that the Gabonese delegation will always \nbe ready to co-operate with him in any way he \nwishes, to assist in achieving his goals. To Mr. \nKittani, Deputy Foreign Minister of Iraq, \nPresident of the thirty-sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly, I wish to say how highly we \nesteem his judiciousness, effectiveness and sense \nof moderation which he demonstrated throughout a \ntenure of office during which he had to deal with \nmany difficult and delicate questions within the \nframework of a seriously declining international \nsituation. The Government of Gabon has already \nhad occasion to convey its official \ncongratulations to Mr. Perez de Cuellar, the new \nSecretary-General, on his election to the chief \noffice of the Organization. r wish here to repeat \nour profound satisfaction at his appointment, \nwhich is an honour not only to Peru but also to \nthe whole third world, and to assure him once \nagain that he can always count on the Gabonese \nGovernment for the necessary understanding and \nsupport in the accomplishment of his difficult \nand delicate task.\n\n130. There is now a well-established tradition \nthat we, the representatives of Member States, \nshould meet here each year to review the \ninternational situation. By evaluating the \naccomplishments since the last session and \nexchanging views on future prospects, we attempt \nto define together the objectives to be attained \nand the tasks to be performed for the coming \nperiod.\n\n131. The thirty-seventh session of the General \nAssembly has opened in a very dramatic climate, \nmarked by the tragic events in Lebanon, the \nfratricidal war between Iraq and the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, the aggression against Angola \nby South Africa, the presence of foreign \noccupation troops in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea \nnot to mention other sources of tension which \nimperil security and peace in other parts of the \nworld.\n132.\tThe peaceful settlement of conflicts \nthrough negotiation, the very basis of detente \nand inter-national co-operation, is increasingly \ngiving way to the use of naked and blind force, a \nphenomenon that is becoming more and more \nfrequent and indeed seems now to be the rule in \ndiplomatic practice.\n\n133.\tThe right of peoples to decide on their \nown destiny, although universally recognized, is \nfar from being accepted and applied by those \nPowers which hold sway over them.\n\n134. New forms of political and economic \ndomination are emerging and developing, \naggravating injustice and imbalances, a source of \ntension and conflict which imperil international \npeace and security.\n\n135.\tThere is no denying that international \nrelations are now going through a difficult \nperiod and the persistence of these tensions and \nconflicts is subjecting the Organization to a \nconsiderable ordeal and exposing the \ninternational community to new perils.\n\n136.\tIn the Middle East the recent invasion of \nLebanon by Israel with all its disastrous \nconsequences has even further complicated a \nsituation that was already explosive in that \nregion. The recent massacres committed in the \nPalestinian refugee camps in Beirut have filled \nus all with shock and horror. The international \ncommunity has unanimously condemned that odious \ncrime, which sounds the death knell of a certain \nmorality which hitherto had compelled respect for \nnon-combatants' right to life. Let us hope that \nthat criminal act will not open the way to a new \ncycle of blind and murderous violence, whose \nfirst victims are liable to be more innocent \npeople.\n\n137. The situation in the Middle East has now become \nso serious that the United Nations, with the \ntotal support of the great Powers permanent \nmembers of the Security Council, must more than \never before do everything in its power to halt \nwar and to look for a comprehensive, just and \ndurable solution that will restore peace to that \nsorely troubled region. Such a solution can never \nbe based on force and must there-fore be accepted \nby all, because it has become clear that there \ncan be no solution to the Middle East crisis if \nit fails to take account of the interests of all \nparties. This entails the restoration by Israel \nof the Arab territories occupied in 1967, the \nparticipation by Palestinians in the peace \nnegotiations, and, of course, all necessary \ninternational commitments guaranteeing to all the \nright to existence within secure and recognized \nborders.\n\n138.\tFurthermore, Gabon is profoundly \nconcerned over the bloody and prolonged conflict \nbetween Iraq and Iran which is jeopardizing peace \nand security in that so sensitive and vital part \nof the world.\n\n139.\tOn the strength of its close and friendly \nrelations with the two States in question, Gabon \nonce again appeals to the sense of responsibility \nand real-ism of their leaders to put an end to \nthat fratricidal war so that dialogue and \nnegotiation may commence, in accordance with the \nspirit of the Charter and the principles of \nnon-alignment to which both countries have \nsubscribed.\n\n140.\tThe situation has become even more \nexplosive in that part of the world through the \nexistence on the borders of Iran of another \nsource of tension: Afghanistan, a country rent by \na terrible internal war.\n\n141. The United Nations must continue its past \nactions and its efforts to secure the withdrawal \nof foreign troops fighting in that country. It is \nonly after that withdrawal that the peoples \nconcerned will be able freely to express \nthemselves and to determine the regime of their \nchoice, which alone can guarantee the sovereignty \nof Afghanistan and safeguard its non-alignment.\n\n142. The same applies to Kampuchea, where the \nlegal, internationally recognized regime is not \nable to exercise its authority throughout the \nterritory because of the presence of foreign \ntroops. We wish to encourage the initiatives \naimed at restoring legitimacy and democracy to \nKampuchea taken by the free political forces of \nthat country as well as by the independent States \nof the region.\n\n143. With regard to the Korean peninsula, the \ndivision of the country into two distinct \nantagonistic States because of differences in the \npolitical options of the present regimes is a \nsequel of the cold war of a bygone era, a time of \nconfrontation of the rival ambitions of East and \nWest. Faithful to its motto-dialogue, tolerance, \npeace-Gabon has always recommended that the two \nparties should sit down at a negotiating table \nand together, without foreign interference, seek \nways and means of permitting the reunification of \nthe country. This position was recently once \nagain reaffirmed by the Gabonese head of State, \nEl Hadj Omar Bongo, who stated:\n\n\\\"It is through dialogue and dialogue alone, in \nthe spirit of the joint communique issued on 4 \nJuly 1972 whereby the two Koreas announced to the \nworld their wish to work peacefully for \nunification, that the peninsula will achieve this \nend in the interest of peace and security, rot \nonly in Korea but also in the world at large.\n\n144. The violence of the conflicts which we have \njust described b    s its consequence, it would \nappear, that of polarizing and attracting the \nconcern of the international community, which \ngives the impression of being less attentive to \nwhat happens in Africa. Are we to believe that \nthe problems of Africa arouse only secondary \ninterest and that compassion and fraternal \nsolidarity are aroused only by what happens \noutside the black continent?\n\n145. Nevertheless, in Africa people are dying by \nthe thousands and continuing to die in the south \nof the continent-in Namibia, Angola and \nelsewhere-because of the aggressive acts of the \nSouth African racists dictated by their inhuman \npolicy of apartheid. In spite of the unanimous \ncensure of the inter-national community, in spite \nof the appeals and condemnations of the United \nNations, the racist Government of Pretoria \ncontinues imperturbably and I with impunity its \ndisgraceful policy of segregation and continues \nto subject the black community to terror and \nviolence. Expeditious methods of physical \nelimination have now become common practice. The \narsenal of unjust laws is constantly being \nstrengthened and ever more sophisticated in order \nbetter to neutralize and subjugate the black \npeople, whose sons, within the African National \nCongress and the Pan Africanist Congress, are \nbeing imprisoned, tortured, martyred and murdered \nevery day in their heroic resistance struggle.\n\n146. This heinous policy, which everyone has \nutterly censured and condemned, can be carried on \nonly thanks to the massive support of major \ninternational capital and the proved complicity \nof the Governments of countries which possess in \nSouth Africa powerful and varied interests. Once \nagain we call upon those Governments to cease all \nco-operation with the racist Government of \nPretoria, in accordance with United Nations \nresolutions, and to exert on that Government all \nappropriate pressure to prevail upon it to \nabandon its apartheid policy and to permit the \nblack majority finally to occupy in dignity and \nequality of rights and duties its proper place in \nnational life.\n\n147. With regard to Namibia, the South African \ngovernment does not appear to wish to give way \nand to comply with the will of the international \ncom-munity. The independence of Namibia, which \nshould have been achieved long ago, is constantly \nbeing postponed from year to year because of the \nrefusal by Pretoria to put an end to its illegal \noccupation of that country. The South African \narmy, which is meeting with heroic resistance \nfrom the valiant people of Namibia, is not only \nsowing terror and desolation among the innocent \ncivilian population but also attacking, now \nopenly, neighbouring countries, particularly \nAngola. It is inadmissible that the great Powers, \nwhich bear responsibility for peace in the world, \nshould countenance this arrogant policy of \naggression, which is a violation of international \nlaw and flouts international morality. The \nGovernments of the five Western States of the \ncontact group must impose on the Pretoria \nGovernment the settlement plan contained in \nSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978), which is \nthe only valid basis for negotiation.\n\n148. The manoeuvres of Pretoria to justify its \nillegal occupation of Namibia by the presence of \nits forces on the territory of Angola cannot \npossibly deceive anyone, and blackmail aimed at \nestablishing a link between the withdrawal of its \ntroops from Namibia and the presence of Cuban \ntroops in Angola is inadmissible and must be \nrejected. Indeed we are all aware that South \nAfrica is illegally occupying Namibia, an \ninternational Territory under the sovereignty of \nthe United Nations, while the Cuban troops are in \nAngola on entirely legal grounds, by virtue of \nagreements negotiated and concluded in full \nindependence and liberty by two sovereign States. \nConsequently, there can be no question of linking \nthe two facts, and the Governments of the five \nStates of the contact groups must make the South \nAfrican government see this. Africa-indeed the \nwhole international com-munity-demands that South \nAfrica withdraw from Namibia so that the people \nof that country, fighting so heroically, can \nexercise freely its right to self-determination \nand accede to national sovereignty with \nterritorial integrity.\n\n149. The United Nations will thus have succeeded \nin putting an end to an anachronistic colonial \nsituation that is unacceptable in the world \ntoday, where all men, all peoples, all countries \nmust be free, equal and sovereign.\n\n\n150. The violence, conflict and war which trouble \npeace and security in the world are all part of \nthe absurd logic of man's self-destruction, to \nwhich the folly of the arms race is inexorably \nleading-an arms race which is assuming a pace and \nproportions that are more and more alarming. The \ncontinuance of the manufacture and accumulation \nof increasingly sophisticated nuclear weapons and \nother weapons of mass destruction and the \ndevelopment of biological and chemical weapons \nwith terrifying effects are leading inexorably to \na wholesale conflagration.\n\n151. This real danger of a planetary catastrophe, \nalthough everyone is aware of it, is. \nUnfortunately, not sufficient to halt the arms \nrace in which the great Powers are engaged. It \nhas become commonplace to describe the vast sums \nspent on armaments, just as it has become \ncommonplace to denounce the wastage of all the \nresources spent in that way-resources which could \nhave been devoted to development needs-but, such \nis man's nature that, blind to the obvious, he \npursues his course imperturbably, even if it is a \npath that leads to the abyss.\n\n152.\tThe failure of the second special session \nof the General Assembly on disarmament, held here \nlast June, is a sad example of that blindness. At \nthat session representatives of the \nnon-nuclear-weapon States as at the first special \nsession on disarmament, vigorously denounced the \nmad arms race and the wastage of resources and \nurged the great Powers to put an end to the \npolicy of over-armament, to abolish weapons of \nmass destruction and to embark on a process \nleading to general and complete disarmament. We \nmust recognize, unfortunately. that that appeal \nfell on deaf ears and at that session the \nAssembly was unable to come up with any positive \nmeasure.\n\n153.\tNevertheless. Gabon believes that we \nshould not lose hope and that the efforts already \nbegun should be continued, to prevail upon the \ngreat Powers to adopt a more co-operative \nattitude towards the United Nations which must be \nin a position to play its full and proper role in \ndisarmament negotiations.\n\n154.\tGeneral and complete disarmament is a \nvital necessity. not only because it will put an \nend once and for all to the ever-growing risk of \na planetary conflict but also because it will \nfree the huge sums of money now being swallowed \nup in the arms race and enable them to be used \nfor reviving the world economy which. as we can \nsee is today in a state of general collapse.\n\n155.\tIndeed many studies undertaken recently \nboth by the World Bank and by UNCTAD present a \nvery gloomy picture of the economic situation in \nthe world. The slowing down of economic expansion \nhas spared no region no group of countries \nwhatever the level of development or economic \nstructure. This slowing down has been \nparticularly clear in the' developing countries \nwhere we have witnessed a sizeable increase in \nunemployment and a significant and constant \ndecline in national income.\n\n156.\tIt is unlikely that the international \neconomic situation will make possible any revival \nof growth in the developing countries in the next \nfew years. The export of these countries will \ncontinue to decline until there is a clear \nrevival of the economies of the industrialized \ncountries. Similarly. the decline in the terms of \ntrade, which is reflected in the increase\u2022 in the \nprices of capital goods and the decline in the \nprices of commodities, the malfunctioning of the \ninter-national monetary system engendered by the \nabandonment of fixed parities and the increase in \ninterest rates, which has now placed an \nintolerable burden on debt servicing, do not give \ngrounds for optimism; they are all reasons for \nthe general economic recession we can see in the \ndeveloping countries.\n\n157.\tThe industrialized countries do not seem \nto be concerned about this situation. On the \ncontrary, they are multiplying protectionist \nmeasures in the name of their national interests, \nin flagrant violation of the international norms, \nwhich are in any case unfavourable to the \ndeveloping countries.\n\n158.\tIt is to deal with this situation, \npending a restructuring of the world economy, \nthat we have found it necessary to call for an \nincrease in bilateral aid, particularly official \ndevelopment aid. Similarly, multilateral \ninstitutions should adopt more flexible methods \nin this regard. It would, for example. be \ndesirable that the share of the resources of the \nInter-national Monetary Fund [IMF] allocated for \nco-operation for developing countries be granted \non more favourable terms and for the World Bank \nto increase Hs loans to those countries, which of \ncourse presupposes a strengthening of its means \nof intervention.\n\n159. In my statement to the General Assembly at \nits thirty-sixth session [27th meeting]. I said \nthat I placed great hopes in the International \nMeeting\\\" on . Co-operation and Development at \nCancun, which was supposed to launch the process \nof global negotiations. Unfortunately. those \nnegotiations have not yet got under way. and \nmillions of people who are calling for the \nestablishment of a new international economic \norder fail to understand how this year again 'We \nhave been unable to reach an agreement that would \nmake it possible for the negotiations to begin. .\n\n160. It is in order to mitigate the effects of \nthis momentary failure in the North-South \ndialogue. a failure we all deplore, that the \ndeveloping countries have been trying to organize \nregionally and sub-regionally. In our own \nsub-region, for example, on the initiative of El \nHadj Omar Bongo, President of the Gabonese \nRepublic, 11 heads of State and Government met \nthis year in Libreville, Gabon, and, in keeping \nwith the spirit of the Lagos Plan of Action;5 \nlaid the foundations of an economic community -of \nCentral African States, an organization that \nshould provide us with structures to expand and \npromote trade and economic development among \nmember States and stimulate and. consolidate \nregional solidarity and co-operation.\n\n161. This need for solidarity and co-operation, \nnoted in the economic plan. has also been felt on \nthe cultural\u2022 level with just as much force. It \nis clearly a vital imperative in the fight for \ndevelopment, fulfilment and assertion of the \nidentities of the peoples of these States. which \nhave a profound awareness of their common \nidentity. That is why in the cultural field \n-again on the initiative of President Bongo-the \nrepresentatives of the States of the Bantu world, \nwhich embrace some ISO million persons,' met in \nGabon to attempt more closely to identify the \ncultural dimension of development and to examine \nthe possibility of creating an international \ncentre for Bantu civilizations, a project agreed \nupon by the UNESCO World Conference on Cultural \nPolicies, known as MONDIACULT, held last July in \nMexico City.\n\n162. In the face of all these problems, all these \ndifficulties both economic and political, one \nquestion naturally arises: how to create a more \nfavourable climate for international relations \nand hence how to propose solutions likely to \nsatisfy the aspirations of States and peoples.\n\n163. In the view of the Gabonese delegation, the \nUnited Nations must enjoy increased effective \nsupport from its Members if it is to become an \neffective instrument in the service of the \ncommunity of nations in the consolidation of the \nindependence and sovereignty of all States, the \nsafeguarding of international security and the \nstrengthening of world peace.\n"

        "file_text": "):  I take pleasure in congratulating you,  Sir, on your election as \nPresident of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your \neffective contribution to the work of the United Nations and your \nlong service to your country, the Hungarian People's Republic, have \nwon you the confidence of the delegations participating in this \nsession. We hope that your work will be crowned with the success to \nwhich we all look forward, so that the resolutions of this session \nmay reflect the aspirations of the inter-national community and deal \nwith the most important questions and issues on the international \nscene. I am pleased also to pay a tribute to your predeces-80r, Mr. \nKittani, for the constructive efforts he made and the ability and \ngreat skill with which he led the work of the last session and the \nspecial sessions of the General Assembly this year.\n\n72.\tI take pleasure also,  on  behalf of the  State of  Bahrain, \nin congratulating Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his election as \nSecretary-General. His election to this high international position \nis a recognition of his outstanding skill and experience in the work \nof the United Nations. I should like here also to commend him on the \nvaluable report he submitted to the General Assembly at this session. \nIt contains a useful analysis of current international relations and \nthe challenges confronting the Organization, and it will assist us in \ndealing with the questions and issues on the agenda.\n\n73.\tSince the last session the world has witnessed exceedingly \ndangerous developments in international relations, where methods of \nconflicts and confrontation have pre-empted those dialogue and \nnegotiation. Rivalry between the combatant groups has intensified, \nincreasing the number of wars and disputes and undermining \ninternational peace and security, as has happened in Asia, Africa, \nLatin America and the Middle East. Israel invaded Lebanon and \ndestroyed Beirut, the way in the Falkland Islands broke out, the \nIrano-Iraqi war continues and Afghanistan is still suffering from \nforeign military intervention. The situation in Kampuchea is still \nserious and no settlement of the question of Cyprus has been reached. \nWe live today in a world dominated by selfishness and force, the \nimposition of the will of the victor on the vanquished and the \nreaping by the aggressor of the fruits of his aggression. This \nsituation constitutes a serious change in international relations, \nwhich further intensifies disputes and regional and inter-national \ncrises.\n\n74.\tIn our review at the twenty-sixth session of international \nevents, we referred to the establishment of the Gulf Co-operation \nCouncil as a viable and constructive institution for collective \nregional co-operation to meet the aspirations and ambitions of the \npeople of the region. The six member States have agreed in the \nCharter of the Council to abide by their obligations under the \nCharter of the United Nations, to act together to preserve peace, \nsecurity and stability in the region without foreign intervention, \nand to develop political, economic, cultural and social relations \namong themselves and with other States in the world for their benefit \nand that of the world as a whole. As a result of the continuous \nefforts and work of the leaders of the Gulf Arab States, the Council \nhas been able, within the short period that has elapsed since its \nestablishment in May 1981, to co-ordinate the efforts and policies of \nthe States of the region in regard to international issues. The \nunified economic agreement which was concluded in November last year \nlaid down sound bases for economic self-sufficiency among these \nStates and for the co-ordination of their commercial and economic \npolicies with those of other States and other regional economic \ngroups. The establishment of the Council is a living example of \nconstructive regional co-operation and co-ordination based on the \ncommon interests of the people of the region, to provide them with \nsecurity, stability and prosperity.\n\n75. The Middle East region witnessed this 'year the recurrence of \nserious events which threaten to undermine world peace, as a result \nof the criminal Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which constitutes a \ndangerous precedent in international relations and takes humanity \nback to the law of the jungle. Lebanon is exposed now to the ugliest \nforms of aggression, occupation and destruction. The Palestinian \npeople face- the danger of physical liquidation and mass \nextermination by unprecedented means.\n\n76. Israel, which claims to be a small State surrounded by other \nStates which surpass ~t in number and resources claims that it wants \npeace with its neighbours. At the same time, it occupies Arab \nterritories one after the other, expelling and killing the legitimate \ninhabitants in order to annex such territories to its racist \nsettlements. It subjects the rest of the inhabitants of those \nterritories to the worst forms suppression, injustice and torture in \nan attempt to drive them out and replace them by Zionist settlers \ncoming from the four corners of the world. it builds settlements on \nthe West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights, in addition to \nannexing Arab Jerusalem and declaring it its permanent capital, \nannexing the Golan Heights and attacking the Iraqi nuclear reactor \ndesigned for peaceful purposes an attack contrary to the Charter of \nthe United Nations and many resolutions in this respect We ask the \nAssembly whether such a policy, based on aggression and expansion, \nimplies in fact a desire for peace?\n\n77. The tragedy of the Middle East arises from the denial of the \nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian question \nis the core of the Arab-Israeli dispute. A just and comprehensive \npeace in the Middle East region can be attained only by the \nwithdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories and the \nrecognition of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the \nPalestinian people, particularly their right to establish their \nindependent State on their national soil.\n\n78. The question of Palestine which has existed since the \nestablishment of the United Nations is no longer unknown to anybody \nin its dimensions and the tragedy of its people. It is the question \nof a people expelled from its home and land, and denied for more than \n34- years the exercise of its inalienable rights. That people, more \nthan any other people in history, is still suffering from \nhomelessnes3, deprivation and mass extermination at the hands of \nworld Zionism. In spite of the recognition by the United Nations of \nthe legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to \ntheir homeland, Israel denies them these rights and ignores all the \nUnited Nations resolutions which acknowledge even part of the \ninalienable and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n79. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon aimed at the complete subjugation \nof that peaceful country and the destruction of its independence and \nsovereignty and the integrity of its territory. We warned from the \nstart of the consequences that such aggression could have on Lebanon \nand the repercussions it would have on the situation in the Middle \nEast in general, and the Palestinian question in particular. To \ninform the world public of the dangers of such aggression, the Arab \nStates have contacted all States permanent members' of the Security \nCouncil urging them to contain this serious situation, put an end to \nit and expose its dangers and repercussions. They have asked them to \nshoulder their responsibilities under the provisions of the Charter \nfor the maintenance of peace and security, and to stop the massacre \nand acts of genocide perpetrated by the Israeli forces against the \nPalestinian and Lebanese people. They Have also asked for an \ninternational move to' put an end to such unprovoked aggression save \nthe independence of Lebanon and the integrity of its territory. \nimplement Security Council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 ,1982, \nwhich call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the \ninvading Israeli forces from all Lebanese territories, and support \nthe efforts of the Lebanese Government to exercise its legitimate \nauthority and complete sovereignty within the internationally recognized \nborders of Lebanon.\n\n\n80. Terrorism has become the overt policy of Israel. as confirmed by \nthe tragic events which have taken place recently in Lebanon. The \nworld public has expressed its deep anger and disgust at the \nappalling slaughter engaged in by Israel and its followers against \nthe unarmed civilians of west Beirut and the ugly massacres \nperpetrated against the inhabitants of the Shatila and Sabra camps, \ncausing the death of hundreds of Palestinian families, mostly \nchildren, old people and women. This brings back to our mind the \nmassacre carried out at Deir Yassin in Palestine in 1948 by the \nterrorist Irgun Gang. led by the present Prime Minister of Israel.\n\n81.\tIsrael, acting its violation of the agreement made with the \nLebanese government and the three States participating in the \nmultinational peace force in Lebanon, carried out these ugly \nmassacres after the departure of the Palestinian fighters from west \nBeirut.\n82.\t\tAt this crucial time, we appeal to the conscience of \nthe world, which is represented by the members here, to see to it \nthat the Organization moves from the stage of adopting resolutions of \ncondemnation to that of implementing those resolutions. We consider \nthat it is the duty of the General Assembly to request the Security \nCouncil to reconsider the relations of the United Nations with \nIsrael, which is not a peace-loving Member and is bent on aggression \nand expansionism, are shown by violations of international agreements \nand persistent breaches of the Charter and resolutions of the United \nNations.\n83.\tIsrael claims that peace and security are the reason for its \nmotivation of Lebanon, its annexation of the Golan Heights and its \ninhuman practices against the inhabitants of the occupied Arab \nterritories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, but it is in fact \nbent on more expansion, aggression and domination. No Member of the \nUnited Nations may invade and occupy the territory of another Member \non the pretext of strengthening and defending its borders, Israel has \nmade s security the excuse for perpetuating its expansionist policy \nin Arab territories.\n\n84. Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights, in spite of Security \nCouncil resolution 497 (1981), means that it has no intention of \nwithdrawing from the Arab territories occupied since 1967 but is \naiming at the Judaization of those territories to serve the ambitions \nand interests of zionism in the region.\n\n85. Israel's occupation of Arab territories does not confer on Israel \nany sovereignty over those territories however long that occupation \nmay last. Its attempt to legitimize its occupa6:m of those \nterritories i~ in clear breach of the principles of international \nlaw, particularly the Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilian \nPersons in Time of. War; of 12 August 1949.\n\n86. It is indeed regrettable that the world has witnessed the \naggressive and criminal practices of Israel in Lebanon, the West Bank \nand the Golan Heights without the Security Council having been able \nto carry out its responsibilities and deter Israel from pursuing its \naggression. because of the use of the veto by the United States of \nAmerica time and time again to prevent the Security Council from \nadopting deterrent measures under Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter.\n\n87.\tWe believe that it is necessary to impose sanctions on \nIsrael, to compel it to respond to the will of the international \ncommunity. We ardently hope that the General Assembly will urge the \nSecurity Council to carry out its duty of maintaining peace and \nsecurity in the Middle East by adopting the necessary measures under \nChapter VII of the Charter in order to compel Israel to stop its \naggression and end its occupation of Lebanon and other Arab \nterritories and its annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights. We al50 \nhope that the United States of America will take a stand in keeping \nwith its great responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security \nCounsil.\n\n88.\tWe support the international call for an investigation of the \natrocious crimes committed by Israel against the Lebanese and \nPalestinian peoples and callfor an international trial of Israel for \nthe mass killings and criminal acts it perpetrated by using \ninternationally banned shells and weapons and destroying buildings \nover the heads of their occupation in one of the harshest and ugliest \nacts of genocide, which .vas witnessed daily by the whole world \nthrough the mass media.\n89.\tThe Palestinian people have proved their fighting ability by \ntheir heroic stand against the Israeli invasion. They have prove to \nthe world that they are not merely a tiny group of terrorists, as \nIsrael claims but people struggling to retain their legitimate \nrights. The Palestinian people s heroic struggle, under the \nleadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization has enhanced the \nprestige of that organization as the sole and legitimate \nrepresentative of the Palestinian people and strengthened the loyalty \nof the Palestinian people to the PLO.\n90. Early last month, the leaders of the Arab States held the Twelfth \nArab Summit Conference at Fez. My country was one of those Arab \nStates that participated in the Conference. The Conference issued a \nunified Arab plan for the solution of the Palestinian question. This \nplan represents a genuine desire to find a durable solution of the \n'Palestinian question and the problem of the Middle East. It consists \nof eight points, which, in our view, are a good basis for the \nsolution of the problems relating to the situation in Palestine and \nthe Middle East. It is based on international legality as represented \nby the principles and relevant resolutions of the United Nations, \nstarting with General Assembly resolution 181 (11) on the partition \nof Palestine.\n91. The plan ensures respect for international resolutions and \nguarantees the Palestinian people the minimum of their rights as \nprescribed in United Nations resolutions, including their right to \nsovereignty, self-determination and the exercise of their inalienable \nnational rights on their national soil. It guarantees freedom of \nworship to all religions in the Holy Places.\n92. The plan consists of the following eight points. First, the \nwithdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied in 1967, \nincluding Arab Al Quds; secondly, the dismantling of settlements \nestablished by Israel on Arab territories after 1967; thirdly, the \nguarantee of freedom of worship and practice of religious rites for \nall religions in the holy shrines; fourthly, the reaffirmation of the \nPalestinian people's right to self- determination and the exercise of \nits imprescriptible and inalienable national rights, under the \nleadership of the PLO, its sole and legitimate representative, and \nthe identification of all those who do not desire to return; fifthly, \nthe placing of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under the control of \nthe United Nations for a transitory period not exceeding a few \nmonths; sixthly, the establishment of an independent Palestinian \nState with Al Quds as its capital; seventhly, the guaranteeing by the \nSecurity Council of peace among all States of the region, including \nthe independent Palestinian State; and eighthly, the guaranteeing by \nthe Security Council of respect for these principles.\n93. This plan is in keeping with United Nations resolutions on the \nquestion of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East. It \nstrengthens the role of the United Nations in establishing durable \npeace in the region. It is in line with the? call of the Secretary- \nGeneral in his report of the work of the Organization to establish a \nmore stable system in the world based on international collective \nsecurity and to encourage the use of the machinery of the Charter for \nthis purpose. We believe that-his plan provides a good opportunity \nfor \\\"the solution of a question which has proved difficult to solve \nduring the past three decades-a question which, if it remains \nunsolved, will threaten the whole world with grave dangers. \nTherefore, we appeal to all States to support this plan and work \ntowards its implementation, in order to maintain peace and security \nin that sensitive part 'of the world.\n\n95. The Iraqi-Iranian war has now entered its third year, since it \nbroke out in September 1:\u202280. This war has begun to take on new and \nmore dangerous dimensions threatening to create\u2022 an explosive \nsituation in the whole region. There is no doubt that if this war \ncontinues, it will spread and drive the whole region into the turmoil \nof an international conflict.\n\n96.\tWe have on more than one occasion expressed great concern and \ndeep sorrow at the continuation of the dispute between Iraq and Iran \nand called for a stop to this long and bloody conflict in order to \navert more bloodshed and rescue both countries from the ravages and \ndestruction of war.\n\n97.\tWe earnestly hope that these two neighbour States will be \nable to negotiate a just and durable solution to their dispute, \nparticularly after the withdrawal by Iraq of its forces from the \ninternational border and its declaration that it is ready to \nnegotiate with Iran and solve the differences existing between them \nby peaceful means. We also hope 'ha' the good offices of the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, the non-aligned countries and \nthe United Nations will succeed in securing a cease-fire between the \ntwo countries and finding a solution to their differences by peaceful \nmeans. We continue to welcome, as we did before, the response of the \nsister country of Iraq to the mediation efforts of the Good Offices \nCommittee, particularly its readiness to observe a cease- fire and \nwithdraw its forces to the international border. We hope that the \nIslamic Republic of Iran will also respond to the mediation efforts \nof that Committee in the same manner as Iraq has already done.\n\n98. The situation in the Horn of Africa is still a source of concern \nand instability. We hope that disputes and differences in that region \nwill be solved by peaceful means within the framework of the OAU so \nthat a peaceful settlement that will be just for all parties may be \nreached so that the people and States in that region of the world may \nbe enabled to Jive together in peace, security and amity.\n\n99.\tAs regards Western Sahara, we regret the failure of the \nefforts of the OAU to settle that question peacefully, and we hope \nthat collective efforts will be made to find a just solution to this \ndispute so that peace and stability may prevail in the region.\n\nlOO. We welcome the efforts for the independence of Namibia made by \nsome Western States in the contact group. We welcome the positive \nsteps taken to implement the United Nations plan for the \nindependence of that country pursuant to Security Council resolution \n435 (1978), which is the proper legal frame-work for the peaceful \nsettlement of the Namibian question. We should like to reaffirm \nBahrain's support for and solidarity with the just struggle of the \npeople of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO. We appeal to all \nStates Members of the United Nations to put pressure on the \nGovernment of Pretoria and to impose sanctions against it under \nChapter VII of the Charter in order to compel it to abandon the \ndetested policy of apartheid it practises against the black majority \nof the people of South Africa and to support the struggle of that \nmajority to regain its legitimate rights to freedom, equality and \nhuman dignity.\n\n101. Faithful to the principle of non-intervention in the domestic \naffairs of States, the State of Bahrain has called for an end to the \nSoviet intervention in Afghanistan. We have made clear before the \nAssembly our stand with regard to the settlement of the Afghan \nquestion. We are still convinced that there should be a political \nsolution to this question in accordance with the United Nations \nresolutions that ca)) for the withdrawal of foreign forces from \nAfghanistan, for respect for Its sovereignty, independence and \nnon-aligned status and for respect for the right of the people of \nAfghanistan freely to choose their political, economic and social \nsystem free from any foreign intervention in their domestic affairs.\n\n102. With regard to the Korean question, the State of Bahrain, \nrespecting the will of the Korean people, welcomes the efforts made \nto settle peacefully the dispute between North and South. We hope \nthese will lead to the establishment of peace and security under a \nunified State free from any foreign intervention.\n\n103.\tThe world economic situation is no better this year than it \nwas last year. The world economy still suffers from recession and \ninflation. The gross national product of some developing countries \nhas diminished because of the scarcity of national resources and the \ndecrease of financial aid and loans from developed to developing \ncountries, particularly to those of low income. The global \nnegotiations for the establishment of a new international economic \norder still face difficulties that are caused by the policies and \npositions of the developed countries. The hopes that were pinned on \nthe International Meeting on Economic Co-operation and Development, \nwhich was held at Cancun in 1981, to establish a just and fair new \ninternational economic order have been dashed. No tangible Progress \nhas been made in the global negotiations between the developed and \nthe developing countries in narrowing the gap between their policies, \nalthough both are equally convinced of the fact of the \ninter-dependence of interests in world economic relations. We cannot \nconceive of a just and fair international economic order that would \nsolve the problems and meet the needs of the world without changing \ncurrent international economic   relations   to   remove   the \ninjustice and. inequality that exist in the present international \neconomic order.\n\n104.. It is indeed regrettable that the second special session on \ndisarmament, held last June, ended without any appreciable results in \nthe efforts of the United Nation to adopt a comprehensive programme \nof disarmament valid to the end of this century. The failure to adopt \neffective measures at that session is the result, in our view, of the \ndeterioration of the international situation, regional conflicts and \nthe policy of confrontation in the relations between the great \nPowers, shrouded as they are in suspicion as well as rivalry, the \narms race and non adherence to the concept of collective security \nprescribed in  the Charter.\n105.\tIn this context, we applaud the report of the Independent \nCommission on Disarmament and Security Issues prepared under the \nchairmanship of Olof Palme and entitled \\\"Common Security-a program \nfor disarmament. That report stresses the Importance of survival, \nrather than the annihilation that threatens humanity, in objective, \nimpartial and independent way and points out the fatal dangers in the \nmanufacture and trade in arms. It emphasizes the need for confidence \namong States before an attempt is made to achieve international \ndisarmament.\n\n106. We hope that the General Assembly will consider the report with \nthe attention it deserves so that the huge amounts of money spent on \narmaments may be rechanneled to projects for economic and social \ndevelopment, for the maintenance of security and for affording \nprosperity to mankind.\n\n107. After nine sessions of negotiations and exhaustive discussions, \nthe Third United Nations Conference of the Law of the Sea was able to \nadopt a comprehensive convention which IS regarded as a great \nachievement by the United Nations in the field of the regulation and \ncodification of the rules of the law of the sea and the exploitation \nof the resources of the seas and oceans, which are the common \nheritage of mankind. We hope that all States participating in the \nConference will accept the Convention4 after it is signed at the \nfinal session of the Conference.\n\n108. In spite of the failure of the United Nations to accomplish many \nof the purposes and principles for which It was established, \nparticularly those having to do with international disputes and \ncrises, it has been able to do great and positive things in many \nfields--economic, cultural, humanitarian and others. This emphasizes \nthe importance of its existence and the need to support its \nprinciples and activities and to act for the implementation of its \nresolutions so as to strengthen its role in international life.\n\n109. My country's delegation hopes that at this session the General \nAssembly will adopt appropriate resolutions to strengthen confidence \namong Member States and to meet the aspirations of the people of the \nworld. I have the honour to state from this rostrum, on behalf of the \nGovernment and people of Bahrain, our complete readiness to act in \nthis direction, with the other peoples and States represented in this \ninternational forum, for the achievement of peace, justice and \nprosperity. Bahrain will continue to abide by its obligations to the \nUnited Nations and to be faithful to the Charter, for the \naccomplishment of the goals for which the Organization was \nestablished in 1945.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like first of all to express the \nheartfelt congratulations of the Senegalese \ndelegation to you, Sir, on your brilliant \nelection to the presidency of the Assembly. Your \nlong experience in the United Nations, your \nunanimously recognized competence, your solid \nintellectual and moral qualities is all a \nguarantee of the success of this important \nsession.\n84.\tIt is also a great pleasure for me to pay \na tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Kittani, for \nthe remarkable way in which he conducted the \ndebates at the thirty- sixth session. We express \nthese feelings to him, with pride and \nappreciation, convinced that the results attained \nat the many sessions that took place this year \nare due in large measure to the expertise and \nintelligent authority that he demonstrated in \naccomplishing his delicate task.\n85.\tI wish to pay a tribute also to the \nSecretary- General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, for his \ntireless efforts and to congratulate him warmly \nonce again on behalf of Mr. Abdou Diouf, \nPresident of the Republic of Senegal, and on \nbehalf of the Government and people of Senegal, \non his election as Secretary-General. For almost \na year now, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, through his \nrepeated initiatives and courageous actions, has \nbeen engaged in the promising beginning of work \nthat Will be remembered in history as \nparticularly positive for the peace and security \nof the world.\n86.\tThe thirty-seventh session of the General \nAssembly is opening at an especially disquieting \ntime in international affairs with an increase \nand intensification of hotbeds of tension and \nvarious conflicts as well as an ever-worsening \nimbalance in political and economic relations \namong nations. Thus relations between the major \nPowers are steadily deteriorating, the prospects \nfor effective disarmament seem to be receding and \nthroughout the world the problems dividing \npeoples are multiplying dangerously. Moreover, \nprogress in reorganizing the world economy on a \nmore just and agreed basis is perilously slow.\n87.\tWe must therefore determine how to use \nthe framework, structures and procedures provided \nus by the United Nations to improve, in peace and \nstability, the situation of the world.\n88.\tIn contributing to this debate, we should \nlike to express first of all, on behalf of Mr. \nAbdou Diouf, head of State, and of our country, \nSenegal, the fervent hope that at this session \nthe Assembly will not shy away from the need for \na lucid analysis of the problems confronting the \ninternational community nor from the courageous \nand persistent search for the most appropriate \nsolutions, so that mankind may at last come to \nexperience an era of peace, security and \nprosperity in the very spirit of the Charter of \nthe United Nations.\n89.\tIndeed, the situation facing the \ncommunity of nations is but a sign that the \ninternational order which was established after \nthe Second World War has run its course. Among \nthe anomalies in this international order, \ncolonialism and apartheid have shown exceptional \nlongevity. Outlawed by the international \ncommunity for many years now for its odious \nsystem of government, South Africa, supported \nmaterially, financially and militarily by certain \nindustrialized States, still arrogantly ignores \nthe resolutions and recommendations of the \nOrganization. Today, four and a half years after \nthe adoption of the settlement plan which was to \nhave led Namibia to independence, the Pretoria \nracist regime is still trying, through \nunspeakable maneuvers, to promote the \nestablishment of a so-called internal \nSettlement\u00f3as though the edifying example of \nZimbabwe had not demonstrated the fate that \nhistory unfailingly reserves for that type of \nundertaking. Not satisfied with trampling \nunderfoot the resolutions and decisions of the \nUnited Nations, the Government of South Africa \npersists in its use of violence and repression \nagainst Namibian patriots while perpetrating ever \nmore acts of aggression against neighbouring \nStates in general, and in particular, against \nAngola, part of whose territory remains occupied \nillegally by Pretoria's troops.\n90.\tIt is none the less a fact that the mobilization \nof South Africa's political and military \napparatus can in no way affect the outcome of the \nfreedom fight waged by our brothers of the South \nWest Africa People's Organization.\n91.\tA year ago, during the eighth special \nsession of the General Assembly, devoted to the \nquestion of Namibia, a good number of us still \nharbored the hope that 1982 would be the year of \nindependence for Namibia. Those hopes were \ndashed, basically because of the delaying tactics \nof the Pretoria leaders. In fact, in response to \nthe responsible and courageous attitude taken by \nSWAPO in the negotiations initiated by the \ncontact group of the five Western countries, \nSouth Africa, running out of pretexts, is today \nattempting to give an East-West dimension to a \nstrictly colonial-type problem by making new \ndemands of certain sovereign States in the region \nat every stage.\n92.\tMy delegation wishes once again to appeal \nto the group of Western countries that initiated \nthe settlement plan to bring more pressure to \nbear on the Pretoria regime to induce it, in the \nnegotiations under way, to comply with the \nprovisions of Security Council resolution 435 \n(1978), the only valid framework in which a \nsolution in accordance with the legitimate \naspirations of the Namibian people can be founds\n93.\tIn this respect, it is fitting to \nunderscore the efforts undertaken, in sometimes \ndifficult conditions, by the five countries of \nthe contact group. May they find in our words \nrenewed encouragement to continue these efforts, \nbecause a solution to the Namibian problem will \nbe an important stage towards peace and stability \nin that part of the world?\n94.\tWe say \\\"stage\\\" because genuine peace \ncannot be established in southern Africa so long \nas the racist minority continues to deny the \nmajority in South Africa itself the fundamental \nright to a life of dignity and freedom. The \ncondemned system of apartheid, which has created \na dangerous and explosive situation throughout \nsouthern Africa, calls for active solidarity on \nthe part of all of us with the oppressed majority \nof South Africa. I take this opportunity to \nreaffirm here, on behalf of my country, the \ndetermination of the Government and the people of \nSenegal to continue to provide aid and support \nto our brothers in South Africa organized in the \nAfrican National Congress and the Pan Africanist\nCongress.\n95.\tAt the other end of the continent, \nWestern Sahara is today the basis for problems \nwhich Africa couM and should have been able to \navoid. We in Senegal continue to hope that a \ndynamic African-style compromise will be found \nsoon in order to extract the continental \norganization from the present dangerous impasse.\n96.\tAs for the Comorian island of Mayotte, we \nshall continue to encourage the parties concerned \nto engage in constant dialogue and we reiterate \nour readiness to do everything within our means \nto help them to do that.\n97.\tIt often happens that on the eve of a \nsession an important event moves to front stage \non the international scene. This applies today \nto the Middle East crisis. The deterioration of \nthe situation in that part of the world has now \nreached alarming proportions. The problem before \nus in that region is all the mote alarming \nbecause the Security Council has still not \nmanaged to obtain the implementation of the \nmeasures it has adopted to achieve the \nrestoration of a just peace in that area through \nrespect for the immutable principles of \ninternational law.\n98.\tSince the last three sessions of the \nGeneral Assembly, the Israeli leaders have not \nconfined themselves to making further claims on \nthe occupied Arab territories: they have again \nmoved into action with the annexation of the \neastern part of the city of Jerusalem in June \n1980, action which the international community \ncondemned in the most categorical terms and which \nmy country, Senegal, continues to oppose within \nthe Al Quds Committee of the Organization of the \nIslamic Conference.\n100. Thus, after having annexed the Syrian Golan \nHeights last December, the Tel Aviv authorities, \ndeaf to the repeated appeals of the international \ncommunity, seem today to have decided to \naccelerate the process of annexing the occupied \nterritories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, \nwhile the occupation of part of the Lebanese \nterritory continues. The criminal massacre just \na few days ago of innocent Palestinian \ncivilians\u00f3women, children and the \nelderly\u00f3unfortunate once again demonstrates a \npolicy which is immoral and categorically \ncondemned by international law. By that new act \nof blind violence, Israel has once become an \noutlaw in our communally, which has M down its \nrules for peaceful and sound coexistence based on \nphilosophical and political principles that have \nconstituted and still constitute the positive \nextension of all that is lofty and great in the \nhistory of human endeavor.\n101.\tNeed we recall the bloody premeditated \ninvasion of Lebanon by Israel in June 1982, with \nthe avowed purpose of drowning the resistance of \nPalestinian patriots in blood? The military \nliquidation of the PLO, in Israeli logic, was \ndesigned to allow the Tel Aviv authorities to \nimpose on the inhabitants of the occupied \nterritories an ' autonomous\\\" status which would \nonly facilitate the final annexation of the \nterritories occupied by force since 1967. The \nblind massacre of Lebanese id Palestinian \ncivilians therefore compounded the most serious \nchallenge that has ever been posed to the \nauthority of the Organization.\n102.\tThus defying with impunity the authority \nof the United Nations, Israel continues to demand \nthat the legitimate rights of the peoples of the \nregion be sacrificed to the imperatives of its \nso-called security. It is clear that the United \nNations could not and cannot accept the dangerous \nprospect of such a situation.\n103.\tThe Palestinian nation exists; it is \nbuilt on suffering and frustration and seasoned \nby years of struggle for freedom and \nindependence. As it hails the courage and \ndetermination with which the valiant Palestinian \npatriots continue to resist the repeated assaults \nof the Israeli aggressor, my country, Senegal, \nwishes solemnly to reaffirm here its constant and \nunswerving support of the Palestinian cause, \nunder the guidance of its authentic and \nlegitimate representative, the PLO, courageously \nled by Yasser Arafat, to whom I wish here, on \nbehalf of my country, to pay a heartfelt tribute \nfor the admirable and victorious way in which for \nseveral weeks he organized the heroic Palestinian \nresistance in west Beirut. To that I add the \nsupport of the Senegalese people for the brother \npeople of Lebanon which, through its dignity and \nspirit of self-sacrifice, is providing the world \na living example of its genius and capacity for \nsurvival.\n104.\tThe Committee on the Exercise of the \nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, \nover which my country has the honor to preside, \nlong ago outlined the framework for a just and \ncomprehensive solution of the Middle East \nquestion. In the past as today, our basic \nobjective must be to implement the \nrecommendations of that Committee, as well as \nthose of the\nSecurity Council, so that the Palestinian people \nwill not lose hope in the triumph of \ninternational law, for, if it did, that would \nonly pointlessly prolong a tragedy whose outcome \nin the short or long run is perfectly clear: \nnothing can be imposed on a people which refuses \nto submit.\n105.\tThe stakes are high. At issue is the \ncredibility of the United Nations in small \ncountries and with oppressed peoples, which, like \nthe Palestinian people, are only claiming their \nright to freedom and independence.\n106.\tIt makes our countries very bitter to \nnote that the indifference to the appeals of the \ncommunity of nations has become almost deafness \ntoday when problems directly affecting the \nfreedom and dignity of third-world peoples are \ninvolved. Like the peoples of South Africa, \nNamibia and Palestine, the peoples of Kampuchea \nand Afghanistan remain subject to laws imposed \nupon them by foreign Borders in defiance of the \nprinciples of the Charter, in all those cases the \nNations has repeatedly demanded the withdrawal of \nthe occupying troops and the restoration the \nsovereignty of those States by the formation of legitimately \nchosen government. My country, Senegal with \ncontinue to support law and justice, which are on \nthe side of those who are subjected by force to \nintolerable situation, as is the case today of \nKampuchea and Afghanistan.\n107.\tWith respect more particular to the \nproblem of Kampuchea, the Net/ Committee Mel's \nwas created by the International Conference \nconvened on the question in July 1981\u00f3a Committee \never which my country presides\u00f3is continuing it?, \nefforts to formulate concrete proposals so Chat \nnegotiations may at last take place, to the \nbenefit of the Kampuchean people, which has \nsuffered so much from this tragedy. True, a \nsolution is certainly not yet in sight, but there \nis reason for hope, as attested to by the \nformation last June of coalition government \ncomposed of the various components of the heroic \nresistance of the people of Kampuchea.\n108.\tWith regard to Afghanistan, my country \nhas been following with sustained interest the \nefforts made by the Secretary-General to achieve \nan acceptable solution to this problem in the \ntrue interest of this sorely tried brother \npeople. We remain ready, in the name of \nsolidarity among nations and the principles \ncontained in the Charter, to contribute to these \npeace efforts within the limits of our modest \npossibilities, convinced as we are that a \nstubborn desire to find a solution by force will \nsimply pointlessly prolong the tragedy of the \npeople of Afghanistan and serve only to increase \ntension among the States of the region.\n109.\tAs for the distressing Iraq-Iran \nconflict, the international community should show \ngreater tenacity by increasing and strengthening \nthe efforts already undertaken under various \nauspices to induce the two belligerents to settle \ntheir dispute by peaceful means, within the \nframework of a comprehensive, just and honorable \nsolution. The Islamic Peace Committee, \nestablished in January 1981 at Taif, the \nmediation committee of the movement of \nnon-aligned countries, and the United Nations \nhave made praiseworthy efforts in this \nconnection; the international community should \nencourage pursuit of those efforts in order to \nput an end to a conflict with many repercussions \nfor international security.\n110.\tWe should also give our attention to the \nquestion of Korea. The principle of \nreunification, which has been accepted by both \ncountries, should be encouraged by the \nOrganization.\n111.\tPeace through law, the basis for 4he \nfoundation of the United Nations, has not yet \nbeen established as a guarantee of international \nsecurity. Quite the contrary, peace through \nterror seems to have replaced the rule of law in \na world now more than ever before dominated by \nclashes between the interests of Powers and \nideologies.\n112.\tWhile many decisions of the Organization \nremain unimplemented, 3th race for destructive \npower continues inexorably, posing an increasing \nthreat to the pea e and security of our planet.\n113.\tThe difficulty of changing this \nsituation, which is so dangerous for the future \nof mankind, has just been demonstrated once again \nby the failure of the second special session of \nthe General Assembly devoted to disarmament, \nwhich had inspired legitimate hope in all those, \nlike us, for whom halting the arms race is one of \nthe major concerns of our time. It is \ndisquieting, to say the least, the sum \ninternational situation which is constantly \ndeteriorating, at that session it was not \npossible to achieve some minimal results; this \npoints to a lack of genuine political will to \nachieve progress. But the fact that that session \ndid not lead to concrete results only strengthens \nour attachment to the historic validity of the \nFinal Document of the Tenth Special Session of \nthe General Assembly and to the comprehensive \nprogram of disarmament prescribed therein, which \nhas become more imperative than ever. That \nfailure, however regrettable it may be, must not \nwin out over our determination to redouble our \nefforts to succeed in the task of disarmament, \nwhich remains one of the essential keys to \ninternational peace and security.\n114.\tImportant items on the agenda of that session \u00f3for \nexample, those concerning studies, the \nimprove-ment of the effectiveness of \ninstitutional machinery for disarmament and new \ninitiatives\u00f3were not considered substantively. \nAlong with other delegations present here, we \nhope that this thirty-seventh session will \nprovide us with the opportunity to go more deeply \ninto these matters in our debates; they have the \nhighest priority of any, for on them depends the \nsecurity of the world.\n115.\tWhile current political events are a \nsource of preoccupation for the international \ncommunity, the economic situation, too, points to \nthe need to mobilize all possible political will \nto make genuine progress. Indeed, if there are \nanomalies in international political relations, \nthese exist also\u00f3and certainly to a greater \nextent\u00f3in economic relations among nations. It is \ngood that everyone has realized this and that \nthere is unanimous agreement that one of the \ngreat problems of our day is the revision of \neconomic relations, particular between the rich \ncountries and the poor countries.\n116.\tThat problem is all the more crucial \nbecause the disparities in the world economy, \nespecially between North and South\u00f3and their \nconsequences for international co-operation for \ndevelopment\u00f3foster a practically chronic \ninstability in world political relations.\n117. Within nations, revolutions have always \nresulted from injustice, abuses and social \ninequalities But this time the shock-waves could \naffect the international order itself, for we are \nheartened by a vast worldwide confrontation \nwhich could bring the rich of the world into \ndangerous collision with the poor.\nH8. Unfortunately, this year, like past years, \nhas provided a significant illustration of the \ninadequacy of the efforts made by the developed \ncountries on behalf of the developing countries.\n119.\tThere is, of course, some cause for \nsatisfaction, such as the successful outcome of \nthe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of \nthe Sea. But the various summits of the countries \nof the North have not lived up with the \nexpectations of the countries of the South. They \nhave not resulted in the necessary decisions, \nwhich would have been such as to lead to a \nresumption of the North-South dialogue.\n120.\tIn our view, the thirty-seventh session \nof the General Assembly is all the more important \nbecause of the solutions it must strive to find \nfor the many imbalances at present facing the \ninternational economy. In that connection, this \nsession should promote the launching of global \nnegotiations, which will provide a long-term \nframework for changing the present irrational and \nunjust system of international economic relations.\n121.\tThe head of State of Senegal, President \nAbdou Diouf, has constantly emphasized the \nspecial im-portance attached by my country to the \nlaunching of global negotiations in order to \npromote the international co-operation they are \nbound to foster. For three years the General \nAssembly has been adopting by consensus \nresolutions concerning the global round of \nnegotiations. It is urgent; we feel that the \nnecessary political will will finally emerge in \norder to bring about the consensus needed to open \nthe negotiations on an acceptable and just basis.\n122.\tI now come to a question to which my \nGovernment attaches very great importance. I \nrefer to the drafting by the Organization of an \ninternational convention against the \nrecruitment, use, financing and training of \nmercenaries.\n123.\tThe Government of Senegal, indeed, has \nalways defended here and elsewhere, on every \noccasion, the principles recognized by the United \nNations, including those regarding the \nindependence, national sovereignty and equality \nin law of States, non-interference in their \ninternal affairs, and the non-use of force in \nrelations between States. There is no need to \nstress that respect for those principles is an \nimportant condition for the establishment of \ninternational peace and security.\n124.\tIn that spirit, my Government believes \nthat no consideration of any kind can justify the \nrecruitment, use, financing and training of \nmercenaries, or armed support for the actions of \ncertain groups which rise up in rebellion against \nthe legal Governments of sovereign States.\n125.\tIt will be recalled that my country was a \nsponsor of the text adopted as resolution 35/48 \nand played an active part in its adoption by the \nAssembly. That resolution established the Ad hoc \nCommittee on the Drafting if an International \nConvention against the Recruitment, Use, \nFinancing and Training of Mercenaries. We played \nthat role because Senegal believes that an \ninternational convention on the subject would \nmake a contribution to the elimination of a major \ncause of disturbances and destabilization in \nrelations between States.\n126.\tThe threat posed by the activities of \nmercenaries in the third world in general, and \nin Africa in particular, has been growing. \nUnfortunately, despite the impressive number of \nresolutions adopted by the Security Council and \nthe General Assembly, as well as by the \nOrganization of African Unity [OAU] condemning \nthe activities of mercenaries, it can easily be \nstated that the recruitment and use of \nmercenaries, with orders to take destabilizing \naction in independent African countries, has not, \nit seems to us, noticeably diminished.\n127.\tIn the face of that situation, the \nAfrican countries, through the OAU, have adopted \na convention on the elimination of mercenarism in \nAfrica. But that legal instrument is of only \nregional scope and cannot solve the problem \nthroughout the world. To do that, there must be a \ncontribution by all the States members of the \ncommunity of nations, for most of those \nmercenaries come from non-African countries. \nThus, only rational international co-operation \ncan rid the African continent and the rest of the \nthird world of the constant grave threat posed by \nthat danger.\n128.\tIt is therefore the responsibility of the \nOrganization, and more specifically the General \nAssembly, to draw up and adopt as swiftly as \npossible the text of an international convention \nagainst the recruitment, use, training and \nfinancing of mercenaries in order to respond \nadequately to the hopes the international \ncommunity has placed and continues to place in \nthe Organization.\n129.\tIn this connection we should like to \nwelcome the draft convention that has been \nintroduced by Nigeria. We would venture to hope \nthat the Ad Hoc Committee will continue to give \nthis document all the attention its urgency and \nimportance merit. Furthermore, it is to be hoped \nthat the Ad Hoc Committee will not fail in its \nmandate and that, after the recent adoption by \nthe General Assembly of the International \nConvention against the Taking of Hostages, a \nconvention on mercenaries will complement the \nrange of legal instruments adopted by the United \nNations in order to provide effective protection \nof human rights and the rights of peoples \nthroughout the world.\n130.\tThe confidence which we place in the \nUnited Nations has prompted us at this session to \nreaffirm with all sincerity our earnest \ncommitment to seeking a permanent solution to the \nburning issues of the present day. If relations \namong nations are to be based on genuine peaceful \ncoexistence, it is essential that conciliation \nrather than conflict, co-operation rather than \nconfrontation, be the general rule in these \nrelations. Only thus can our ultimate goal\u00f3to \nbring about world peace on a total basis and in \nperpetuity, together with prosperity and \njustice\u00f3be achieved. To that end, a restructuring \nof the Organization is more necessary than ever.\n131.\tIn the state of restless change that is \nthe fundamental law of our present-day world\u00f3and \nnever has change been as swift as it is today\u00f3it \nis essential that peoples and institutions adapt \nto new conditions. The United Nations, our \nOrganization, can be no exception.\n132.\tThe revision or, rather, the adaptation \nof the Charter to the present international \nsituation is essential if we are to enhance the \neffectiveness of the United Nations in settling \nproblems relating to peace and security \nthroughout the world. In this connection the \ndelegation of Senegal, in accordance with \ninstructions received from its Government, would \nlike to reiterate its support for and confidence \nin the Special Committee on the Charter of the \nUnited Nations and on the Strengthening of the \nRole of the Organization and would encourage it \nto pursue its work actively so as to conclude its \nmandate as expeditiously as possible.\n133.\tIt should not be forgotten that, by \nvirtue of the role it has played and continues to \nplay in the major turning-points in the history \nof mankind, the United Nations remains the \nsupport and hope, the refuge and benchmark for \nnations in their ceaseless quest for peace and \nhappiness. It is for that reason that Senegal \nSupports it and pledges its co-operation in its \nhistoric, noble and inspiring work for the \nsurvival of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the people and Government of the \nFederal Republic of Nigeria, I extend to Mr. \nHollai our warmest congratulations on his \nelection to and assumption of the office of \nPresident of the thirty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly. His election is eloquent \ntestimony to his admirable personal qualities as \nwell as an honour to the Hungarian People's \nRepublic, with which, happily, my country, \nNigeria, enjoys very cordial relations. I am \nquite confident that under his able and wise \nguidance, our deliberations at this session will \nbe resoundingly successful. I assure him of the \nfull co-operation of my delegation in the \ndischarge of the heavy responsibilities of his \noffice. May I also pay a tribute to his \npredecessor in office, Mr. Kittani of Iraq, who \npresided over the thirty-sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly with great dedication and \ndistinction. The able manner in which he guided \nthe proceedings of the thirty-sixth session when \ngrave issues of war and peace were at stake is a \ncredit to him and to his country, Iraq. I also \nwish to congratulate Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his \nwell-deserved election to the exalted post of \nSecretary-General. His election is thoroughly \ndeserved. It is not only a personal achievement \nfor him and for his country, but one in which we \nof the third world can collectively take \njustifiable pride. In the short time he has been \nin office, Mr. Perez de Cuellar has already shown \ngreat courage and a strong commitment to the \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. \nWe are indeed fortunate to have the services of \nsuch a distinguished and accomplished \ninternational statesman. He has assumed office at \na most difficult period in the life of the United \nNations, when confrontation has replaced detente \nin relations between the super-Powers, when the \nworld economy is sinking into depression and when \nnaked aggression rather than peaceful coexistence \nand respect for sovereignty has become the order \nof the day in international relations. I pledge \nto him the full support of my delegation in the \nexecution of the onerous task placed on his \nshoulders.\nThe rapid and seemingly inexorable deterioration \nin international relations is of great concern to \nmy delegation. Many of the global issues that \nhave plagued the Organization for many years have \npersisted in the unwholesome atmosphere of \nconfrontation and repeated aggression. There is \nno doubt that the great majority of nations are \ndedicated to peace. Nevertheless, one is left \nwith the sad feeling that all our efforts are an \nexercise in futility since none of the major \nissues of our time appears to have been resolved. \nThe litany of political and economic crises which \nnow plague the world is formidable and spans \nevery region of the world.\nDetente between the super-Powers has suffered a \nsevere setback. There has been a resurgence of \ncold war attitudes\u00f3a situation which has been \nfurther aggravated by the virtual state of \ncollapse of the international economic system. \nThe spirit of internationalism and the \ninterdependence of nations of the world have been \ngravely impaired. Nations, particularly the big \nPowers, are now resorting increasingly to the use \nor threat of use of force in defense of what they \nperceive to be their national interests. The \nprovisions of the Charter on the settlement of \ninternational disputes and on the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security are being \nbrushed aside and ignored by the big Powers in \npursuit of their narrow interests.\nIn this present climate of uncertainty, the \nSecretary-General, in his report on the work of \nthe Organization, called Car measures to \nstrengthen the peace-keeping machinery of the \nUnited Nations system and to develop the United \nNations as a more effective and viable instrument \nfor resolving disputes among States. He has \ncalled our attention to the propensity of the big \nPowers to bypass the United Nations whenever it \nsuits them and to the necessity to return to the \nUnited Nations as the primary international \nnegotiating forum. His warnings are timely and \nshould be heeded by all Member States.\nWe are gravely concerned in particular about the \nareas of tension which continue to exist in \nAfrica. We attach the utmost importance to peace \nand stability in Africa, without which our \nefforts to develop our countries will continue to \nbe frustrated. We are concerned about the \ncontinued intervention in African affairs of the \nbig Powers and their attempt to turn Africa into \na cold-war theatre. Africa's efforts to solve its \nproblems in Western Sahara and the Horn of Africa \ncontinue to be undermined by the intervention of \nthe big Powers. We deplore and view with \nresentment these unwarranted interventions in our \ninternal affairs and the consequent \nintensification of intra-African disputes. \nWhenever it has seemed we are close to a peaceful \nsettlement of disputes among African States, the \nprocess of peace has been gravely weakened and \nundermined by the intervention of extra-African \nPowers. Weapons of mass destruction continue to \nfind their way into our continent in the guise of \nforeign military assistance. In order to maintain \ntheir hegemony in Africa, the big Powers have \nresorted to so- called military assistance, which \nhas increased sharply over all other forms of aid \nin recent years. In addition, there has been an \ninsidious attempt by external forces to weaken \nand destroy our continental organization, the \nOAU, which they regard as inimical to their \ndominant influence in our continent. The fact is \nthe OAU, now facing a serious assault by our \ndetractors, has contributed immensely to the \nmaintenance of peace and stability in the region. \nBy bringing Africa together and forging bonds of \nunity within the continent, the OAU has \ncontributed to the fulfilment of provisions of \nthe Charter of the United Nations on the role of \nregional organizations in resolving regional \ndisputes.\nLet me assure our detractors now plotting daily \nthe demise of our organization that we will \nemerge from our present crisis stronger than \never. In the past our continental organization \nhas demonstrated its resilience and capacity by \nwithstanding several serious internal crises. \nAfrica remains committed to the maintenance and \ncontinued stability of its continental \norganization, and collectively we are determined \nto repair the damage and the setback which it has \nrecently suffered.\nMy delegation is extremely disturbed and \ndistressed by the stalemate in the negotiations \non the independence of Namibia. I believe that we \nhave shown the utmost restraint and understanding \nin the negotiations with the contact group. It is \nnot necessary to go over the ground covered in \nthose negotiations. However, it is necessary to \nremind the Assembly that apartheid, South \nAfrica's Mandate over Namibia, has been \nterminated by the United Nations and the \ninternational Court of Justice. South Africa's \ncontinued occupation of Namibia is illegal and in \ndefiance of the unanimous decision of the \nAssembly, which gives protection to all nations.\nThe greatest threat to the survival of the United \nNations is the absolute disregard of its \ndecisions by a few recalcitrant nations. The \nsaddest aspect of the tragedy being played out in \nthe southern African region is that the apartheid \nregime draws comfort, solace and support from the \nsame countries as arrogate to themselves the role \nof defender of democratic freedoms. How can those \nWestern countries explain to the world why, in \nspite of resolution 435 (1978), sponsored by the \ncontact group, adopted by the Security Council \nand unanimously endorsed by the General Assembly, \neffective pressure cannot be brought to bear on \nSouth Africa to withdraw from Namibia as a \nprelude to the implementation of the United \nNations peace plan for Namibia?\nLast year the impression was created that the \nNamibia issue was very near solution. It is now \ncrystal clear to all that a peaceful solution of \nthe Namibian problem is as far away as ever. It \nis now obvious to us that the strategy is to wear \nus down to a point where we shall throw up our \nhands and say: \\\"We have tried. Let Namibia fend \nfor itself.\\\" This strategy fails to take account \nof the tide of history, of our resolve to rid our \ncontinent of the last lingering vestiges of \ncolonialism and oppression, and of our rendezvous \nwith destiny.\nA tenuous effort is being made to predicate the \nindependence of Namibia on the withdrawal of \nCuban troops from Angola. This is unfortunate, \nand we reject this unwarranted and arrogant \ndemand; it has nothing to do with the legitimate \nright of Namibia to self-determination. Right now \nSouth Africa is occupying by force a portion of \nthe territory of the independent State of Angola, \nwhich the foreign forces are there to protect. \nBut for the decision which Angola took, in the \nexercise of its sovereignty, to invite the \nforeign forces,\tSouth Africa would have \nrecolonized it. We call upon the Western Powers \nto support the principle of self-determination \nfor Namibia as a demonstration of their \nsincerity. We maintain that South Africa's \noccupation of Namibia is illegal, as well as \ncontemptuous of the United Nations. We believe \nthat the people of Namibia, under the leadership \nof SWAPO, are entitled to their freedom and the \npursuit of happiness. We shall persist in this \nbelief and we shall continue to fight for this \nbelief until our brothers in Namibia are free.\nInside South Africa the racist regime has \nintensified its reign of terror against the \nblacks of that country, who are still being \ndenied their basic freedoms. Repression and \nsuppression of the blacks have continued with \nunabated rigour. We have warned often enough that \nthe racist policies of the apartheid regime \nrepresent a grave danger to peace and stability, \nnot only in Africa but throughout the world; for \npeace and freedom are indivisible. The world \ncannot be truly free and peaceful when parts of \nit remain in bondage. Africa is committed to the \neradication of racism in South Africa. Nor will \nit be deterred by the attempts of the racist \nregime to destabilize and undermine the \nindependence of its neighbours. We call on the \nAssembly to redouble its efforts and bring the \nnecessary pressure to bear on the apartheid \nregime by imposing economic sanctions on it. Each \ntime we call for economic sanctions against South \nAfrica certain Western countries demur on the \nground that sanctions do not work. When, however, \nthe vital interests of the West are at stake \nsanctions are invoked, as they have been over \nAfghanistan, Poland and the Falkland Islands.\nThe present parlous state of the world economy is \na vindication of the warning that many developing \ncountries have issued for many years from this \nrostrum. Today, in every country of the world, \nthe term \\\"depression\\\" is very well understood. At \nthis time last year we were describing the \neconomic phenomenon that we were experiencing as \nrecession. This year we call it depression. Very \nfew countries have registered any appreciable \ngrowth in their economic activities during the \npast year; as a matter of fact, the economies of \nmost countries have been badly ravaged. The \nconsequences of this decline in economic activity \nare massive unemployment, incredibly high levels \nof global inflation, high debt-servicing ratio \nfor many developing countries, sharp falls in \ncommodity prices, unstable exchange rates and \nprotectionism in international trade. The \nslow-down in economic activity is global. The \npresent state of the world economy provides ample \nproof that our economies are interdependent.\nAgriculture has all but collapsed in many parts \nof Africa, due in part to drought and, of course, \nto the unreasonably low commodity prices, \nincluding the high cost of agricultural \nmachinery. The fact is that many countries in \nAfrica spend a significant portion of their \nmeagre foreign exchange earnings on massive food \nimportations to stave off hunger. Very few \ndeveloping countries can afford, after paying for \nfood imports, to buy capital goods for \nindustries. The net result is that developed \ncountries are able to market only a small \nproportion of their manufactured goods in these \ncountries, and so the vicious economic circle \npersists.\nThe reluctance of the developed countries to \nembrace the new international economic order so \nnecessary for combatting the global economic \ncrisis is deeply regrettable.\nWe are convinced that the present negative trends \nin the world economy can be reversed. Since they \naffect all countries, action should be taken \ncollectively to resolve them. It is therefore a \nmatter of deep regret that the prevailing mood in \nthe developed economies today is a negative one, \nas illustrated by declines in the flow of \nofficial development assistance, a clearly \nexpressed preference for bilateralism over \nmultilateralism which has seriously undermined \nthe integrity of the multilateral institutions of \nthe United Nations and, of course, the lack of \nencouraging progress in negotiations on various \nquestions relating to international economic \nco-operation for development. These trends \nundermine the development process of developing \ncountries, but events have also shown that the \nshort-sighted and unilateral policies pursued by \ncertain developed countries are self-defeating \neven for those countries.\nWithout losing sight of the need for a \nfundamental restructuring of the world economy, \nmy delegation would like to join in the call \nalready made for reviving the waning spirit of \ninternational economic co-operation in the \ninterest of steady global development and in \nparticular the accelerated development of \ndeveloping countries. My delegation is of the \nview that opportunities for further enhancing \ninternational economic relations still exist. It \nis auspicious that two international meetings on \ntrade and development are scheduled to take place \nwithin the next few months, namely, the GATT \nMinisterial Meeting next November and the sixth \nsession of UNCTAD in mid- 1983. My delegation \nbelieves that these meetings can contribute \nimmensely to the reactivation of international \ntrade and improved trading prospects for \ndeveloping countries, if the countries of the \nNorth will show a more positive attitude \nregarding the evident need to make the necessary \nstructural adjustments.\nSimilarly, the present structure of international \nmonetary and financial institutions leaves much \nto be desired and calls for urgent reforms. My \ndelegation does not underestimate the \ncontribution being, made by international \nfinancial institutions, such as the World Bank \ngroup, to the development of developing \ncountries; but there are also many areas \nrequiring a better response by these institutions \nto the special needs of developing countries. The \nvery stiff conditionally of International \nMonetary Fund lending, for instance, is resented \nby developing countries. While we are not \nsuggesting that the principles of sound financial \nmanagement should be compromised, we can see no \nadvantage in the application of medicine which \nleaves the patient either worse off than before \nor dead.\nWith the present credit squeeze unlikely to ease \nimmediately, the need for expanding the capital \nbase of the World Bank has become more urgent. It \nis also timely to underline the inadequacy of \npresent development aid, as the performance of \ndonor countries has not gone beyond one half of \nthe target of 0.7 per cent of gross national \nproduct solemnly agreed to in the International \nDevelopment Strategy for the Third United Nations \nDevelopment Decade. We urge them, therefore, not \nonly to step up official assistance to the poorer \nnations but also to ensure that an increasing \nproportion of that assistance flows through the \ndevelopment organizations of the United Nations \nsystem, which are currently experiencing critical \nresources problems.\nThe development problems which confront the \ninternational community today call for prompt and \nequitable solutions. Important initiatives need \nto be taken with a view to alleviating the \ncritical food shortages in several developing \ncountries, the slow pace of their \nindustrialization, and the low level of \ntechnological attainment, for which the speedy \nconclusion of negotiations for the international \ncode of conduct on the transfer of technology and \nthe establishment of long-term arrangements of \nthe United Nations financing system for science \nand technology for development acquire special \nsignificance.\nA feeling of despair and despondency must be \navoided, despite the present mood. We should not, \nin fact, overlook the bright spots in \ninternational cooperation which, happily, have \nresulted from certain efforts by the developing \ncountries.\nLast year, much was said about the epoch- making \nevent of establishing a systematic framework for \nthe promotion of economic co-operation among \ndeveloping countries, through the adoption of the \nCaracas Programme of Action. My delegation is \ngratified to note that that initiative has been \nfurther consolidated over the past few months, \nthrough concrete action aimed at the mutual \neconomic advancement of States members of the \nGroup of 77. We believe that this process will \ncontribute to the strengthening of the individual \nand collective self-reliance of developing \ncountries.\nAll countries, developed and developing, must \nshow a positive determination to grapple with the \npresent economic problems in a global and \nconcerted manner. In this connection my \ndelegation recognizes the need for ongoing \nnegotiations in various international forums to \nproceed unhindered and with the requisite good \nwill and understanding, particularly by the \nindustrialized countries. We hope it will be \npossible to launch global negotiations at this \nsession of the General Assembly, especially as \nmuch precious time has been lost over peripheral \nissues, apparently to gain certain advantages, \nwhen what is needed is for every party to go to \nthe negotiating table with an open mind. Now, my \ndelegation hopes that with the flexibility and \nspirit of compromise shown by the Group of 77 \nthrough the proposal submitted last June, our \npartners will be more forthcoming on the question \nof launching the global negotiations without \nfurther delay. Three years after the adoption of \nGeneral Assembly resolution 34/138, it is surely \ntime the international community took that \nlong-awaited step for laying the basis for a more \njust system of international economic relations, \ncapable of supporting the steady growth of the \nworld economy and particularly the accelerated \nand self-reliant development of developing \ncountries.\nIn June this year Nigeria participated in the \ndeliberations of the second special session of \nthe General Assembly devoted to disarmament, in \nthe hope that ways and means could be found to \nhalt and reverse the extremely costly and \ndangerous arms race. After five weeks of \nintensive negotiations we discovered to our utter \ndisappointment that the nuclear-weapon States, in \nparticular, were neither willing nor ready to \nlisten to the voice of reason and sanity. We \nrecall the massive demonstration last June in New \nYork against the immense danger which nuclear \nweapons pose to human survival. We listened to \nrepresentatives of innumerable non-governmental \norganizations voicing their fears that the \ncurrent trend of the arms race might result in \nnuclear war by accident, miscalculation or even \ndesign. We should not be insensitive to those \njustified fears of humanity.\nYet what did we achieve after five weeks of \ndebate and negotiations? We have neither halted \nthe arms race nor set in motion a single \ndisarmament measure. It is true that at the \nsecond special session devoted to disarmament the \nGeneral Assembly launched the World Disarmament \nCampaign and increased the United Nations \nFellowship Programme on Disarmament from 20 \nannual awards to 25. Those modest achievements \nscarcely touched the heart of the matter. Year \nafter year, we helplessly watch the world's \nmilitary budget leap to higher and higher levels. \nIt is now of the order of $US 650 billion \nannually. Not one nuclear Power believes that its \nnuclear and conventional stockpile of arms has \nattained the optimum level necessary to guarantee \nits security. It is obvious that the more \nsophisticated and enormous the quantum of \narmaments at the disposal of each State, the less \nsecure the State possessing such arms feels. What \npurpose is there in pursuing at such colossal \ncost an unattainable mirage? The world feels more \ninsecure today than at any other time in the past.\nThe increasing reliance of nations on force rather than on negotiations \nand the good offices of the United Nations for \nthe peaceful settlement of disputes is the root \ncause of our feelings of insecurity, coupled with \nthe economic disaster, which has afflicted all \nnations. While the world spends more than $US 650 \nbillion yearly on armaments, mass unemployment, \nhunger, disease and ignorance take a heavy toll \non two thirds of the world's population. It is a \ngreat indictment of our sense of social justice \nthat our fellow human beings in the third world \nshould die of hunger and of disease that we could \nwipe out at minimal cost, just because our \nmisplaced sense of security compels us to spend \nbillions of dollars on armaments which breed more \nfear and insecurity.\nIf those vast sums of money currently ploughed \ninto the unproductive arms race were channelled \ninto the economic and social sectors, their \nmultiplier effect would result in vast social and \neconomic activities that would provide millions \nof jobs, demolish protectionism in trade, expand \ndemand and bring back prosperity to all parts of \nthe world.\nIs it not grossly immoral for the nuclear Powers \nto destroy us in a war intended to expand their \nspheres of influence? Our greatest desire is for \npeace in the world, especially on the part of \npeace-loving peoples who have no expansionist \nambitions or designs. As we are firmly convinced \nthat it is impossible to limit a nuclear war or \nto win it, we affirm that the only realistic \noption is to prevent it. That is why we have \nrepeatedly advocated a nuclear freeze as a first \nstep towards significant nuclear disarmament. We \nare motivated by the desire to halt the dangerous \narms race that is inexorably dragging the world \ntowards self-extinction. We are inclined to \nbelieve that a measure of parity has been \nachieved in the destructive power of the two \nblocs and that neither side, fully aware of the \nfact that it cannot win a nuclear war, will be so \npropelled by a death-wish as to launch a nuclear \nattack. My delegation therefore calls upon the \nsuper-Powers to agree to a freeze, followed by a \nverifiable comprehensive test ban leading to \ntalks on arms reduction. With good will and faith \nneither side will find this process detrimental \nto its national interests.\nWhile we were busy deliberating on the great \nthreat to our survival posed by the rapid buildup \nof lethal weapons, the devastating war machine of \nIsrael was reducing large areas of Lebanon to \nrubble with disastrous consequences for the lives \nof innocent human beings unfortunate enough to \nreside in that region of the Middle East. The \nIsraelis, in an arrogant display of power, \ncallously ignored the pleas of the Organization \nfor a halt to that butchery. For four long \nmonths, the Israelis laid waste the sovereign \nState of Lebanon in utter contempt of the \nresolutions of the Security Council calling for a \ncease-fire. In historical perspective, that \nbarbaric act of Israel's is reminiscent of the \nNazi \\\"final solution of the Jewish question\\\". The \nexpansionist propensity of Israel and its \npenchant for settling disputes by force are \ninconsistent with the letter and spirit of the \nCharter of the United Nations. The horror of the \nmassacre at Sabra and Shatila sends chills down \nthe spine. For a people that has gone through the \nhorrible crucible of a genocide to be associated, \neven in a distant way, with the pogrom of Sabra \nand Shatila is a sad irony of history.\nWe believe that the Israelis are entitled to \nsecure borders within the State of Israel. \nHowever, Israel's persistent refusal to realize \nthat it cannot continue to enjoy legitimacy and \nrights based on the Organization's Partition Plan \nfor Palestine and, at the same time, deny \ncorresponding legitimacy and rights of nationhood \nunder the same plan to the Palestinians is the \ngreatest obstacle to any lasting peace in the \nMiddle East. The Palestinian Arabs must and \nshould be enabled to have their own independent \nsovereign State. Nigeria firmly supports the \nlegitimate right of the Palestinians to a \nhomeland of their own.\nIt is a matter tor regret that the fratricidal \nand unnecessary war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic \nof Iran, two non-aligned States, still lingers on \nin spite of the efforts of the United Nations and \nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference to put \nan end to it. We once again call upon our friends \nin Iran and Iraq to throw aside the weapons of \nwar and strive to settle their differences by \npeaceful means. . We are also gravely concerned \nover the intensification of other local and \nregional conflicts in Latin America and Asia and \nthe immense suffering imposed on the peoples of \nthose regions by the conflicts. As a non-aligned \ncountry, Nigeria condemns all foreign \nintervention in the internal affairs of the \nStates in those regions. We support fully the \nefforts of the countries of Latin America and the \nCaribbean to consolidate their national \nsovereignty and to develop their political and \neconomic systems, without undue foreign \nintervention or pressure on them.\nIn conclusion, let us resolve to adhere to the \nprovisions of the Charter by faithfully abiding \nby the decisions of all organs of the United \nNations. Let us resolve to eschew force in the \nsettlement of our disputes. Let us strive to be \nopen and candid in our bilateral and multilateral \nrelations, so as to create an atmosphere of trust \nin which peace will reign supreme and the \nOrganization will blossom.\n"

        "file_text": "It is, Sir, a pleasure to express to you on \nbehalf of the delegation of the Republic of Iraq \nand on my own behalf warmest congratulations on \nyour election as President of the thirty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. I am sure that \nyou will conduct the proceedings of this session \nwith all the wisdom and knowledge you are known \nfor, and I wish you success in discharging the \nduties of your high post. May I also express our \nappreciation for the Great Spirit of co-operation \nwhich the General Assem\u00acbly showed Mr. Kittani, \nPresident of the thirty-sixth session. We are \nsatisfied that he enjoyed the confidence and \nappreciation of this esteemed body, which made it \npossible for him to perform his functions most \nefficiently at the last session. I would also \ntake this opportunity to express whole-hearted \ncongratulations and best wishes for success to \nMr. Perez de Cuellar on his election as \nSecretary-General. I am confident that he will be \nable to fulfill the functions of his \ndistinguished post and to deal with momentous \ninternational events requiring him to exercise \nall the virtues of knowledge, patience and wisdom \nfor which he is known.\n67.\tThe world is going through a delicate and \nfright\u00acening era unprecedented since the Second \nWorld War. Undoubtedly the tense world situation, \nwith all the grave consequences that could flow \nfrom such a state of affairs, is being steadily \nexacerbated because of the intensifying rivalry \namong the great Powers, which jeopardizes world \nsecurity and peace and disturbs the confidence of \npeoples and their aspira\u00actions to achieve detente \nand peaceful coexistence. This hazardous \nphenomenon engulfs the third world coun\u00actries, \nparticularly the non-aligned ones. It presents \nthem with the dangers of confrontation and the \ndevastating effects of tensions, and it threatens \nto expand the centers of polarization by luring \nthird world nations and bringing pressure to bear \nupon them in a bid to exhaust material and human \nresources that otherwise would be used to achieve \nsecurity, stability and development for those \nnations.\n68.\tWhat the great Powers and colonial States \nare reluctant to accept is the fact that the non- \naligned nations, which forced their way to \nfreedom and sovereignty through decades of \nstruggle and a deter\u00acmination to achieve full \nindependence and to exer\u00accise their free will, \nare determined not to form part of military blocs \nthat are engaged in global conflict and to steer \nclear of the currents generated by the centers of \npolarization. No wonder, then, that conflict \npersists between the non-aligned movement on the \none side and colonialism, including Zionism, on \nthe other.\n69.\tIraq, being a non-aligned State, backs \nthe policy of independence which any State might \npursue. It maintains that all States should \nmanage their affairs on the basis of the \nfundamental principles of the United Nations and \nin accordance with their legitimate national \ninterests that are compatible with those \nprinciples, regardless of the requirements of \nbloc policies and cold war. That would serve the \ncause of maintaining world peace and encouraging \nthe trend towards progress and freedom, as well \nas political and economic independence, and the \ncause of extending the principles of justice and \nequality to all nations, regardless of size, \naffiliation and of any power con\u00acsiderations.\n70.\tIraq abides by the principles of \nnon-alignment and wishes to advance the \nnon-aligned movement, to maintain a sound \nrelationship among its members and to promote its \neffective role in international relations. Iraq \nis also determined to implement those principles \nin order to ensure security, justice and economic \nwell-being. Thus, over 10 years ago, Iraq offered \nto host the Seventh Conference of Heads of State \nor Government of Non-Aligned Countries at \nBaghdad. Indeed, it was those very principles \nwhich prompted Iraq not to insist that the \nConference be held at the scheduled time and \nplace, despite the elaborate preparations made \nfor it, including the drafting of relevant \ndeclarations and documents, and despite the fact \nthat all the administrativeand technical \nrequirements had been met. Iraq had earlier sent \nout invitations to all heads of State or \nGovernment of countries of the movement and, in \nfact, had received answers accepting the \ninvitation from the great major\u00acity of them. \nThus, Iraq honored all its obligations towards \nthe movement and the Seventh Conference.\n71.\tWhat should, however, be emphasized in \nthis regard is that Iraq did not, from the \noutset, present its bid to host that non-aligned \nconference in order to gain publicity or as a \nnational objective. Rather, Iraq's initiative \ncame to underscore its international good name, \nnot to create one by so doing. Iraq viewed the \nmatter with a sense of responsibility and concern \nfor the well-being of the movement, both at \npresent and in the future, for non aligned \nprinciples constitutes a major component of our \nforeign policy and we believe that the strength \nand dignity of Iraq are identi\u00accal to the \nstrength and dignity of the movement.\n72.\tBeing proud of our commitment to the \nmovement and anxious about its future and the \ndevelopment of its capability to face world \nevents and in order to avoid possible division in \nthe ranks of the movement's members, we declared \nour intention not to insist on holding the \nSeventh Conference in Iraq, as we recog\u00acnized \nthat some circles within the movement took \nseriously, either in good faith or otherwise, the \nblack\u00acmail and attempts at obfuscation carried \nout by Iran. There is no doubt that Iran's \nbehavior simply demonstrates the \nshort-sightedness of the rulers of Iran and their \nignorance concerning the importance of the \nnon-aligned movement and their lack of belief in \nft. One cannot rule out the possibility that \nIran's objective is to undermine and weaken the \nmovement and to diminish its role as an effective \nPower in inter\u00acnational relations by resorting to \nblackmail and threats as well as by encouraging \nthe enemies of the movement to belittle it.\n73.\tThe non-aligned movement considers the \nques\u00action of Palestine to be its problem and is \ncommitted to supporting the struggle of the \nPalestinian people to realize their inalienable \nnational rights. It empha\u00acsizes that that \nstruggle is one of the responsibilities of the \nnon-aligned countries. Obviously, the question o? \nPalestine is at the core of the Middle East \nproblem and represents the essence of the \nArab-Zionist con\u00acflict. Unless a just, \ncomprehensive and lasting solu-tion is found that \nis acceptable to the Palestinian people and \nsatisfies their national aspirations, peace \ncannot be established in the area and a state of \ncon\u00actinuous conflict will persist, with all its \ncontinuing implications for world peace and \nsecurity. Meanwhile, lot it be known that might \nno matter how over\u00acwhelming, will not dampen the \nzeal of patriotism and will not suppress the \nrevolutionary urge of the people. Therefore, to \nachieve genuine peace in the area, the Zionist \nentity must withdraw unconditionally from all \noccupied Arab territories and the estab\u00aclished \ninalienable national rights of the Palestinian \npeople, including the right to return to their \nhomeland, Palestine, should be restored as should \ntheir properties, their right to exercise \nself-determination and their right to establish \ntheir own independent, fully sover\u00aceign State. \nMoreover, Jerusalem must be recognized as part of \noccupied Palestinian territory and the Zionist \nentity must withdraw from it. There should also \nbe recognition of the PLO, the sole legitimate \nrepresentative of the Palestinian people, and it \nshould be enabled to exercise its right to \nparticipate in all conferences and activities \nrelating to the question of Palestine on an equal \nfooting and standing with all parties concerned. \nFurther, existing Zionist settle\u00acments on Arab \nterritories must be removed, and the policy of \nestablishing new ones there must be \ndiscon\u00actinued. In addition, confiscation of Arab \nland must cease.\n74.\tThe latest form of brutal aggression by \nthe military forces of the Zionist entity was the \nwar of mass annihilation against the PLO and the \nhelpless, homeless refugees in camps in various \nparts of Leba\u00acnon. That war was launched in the \nfirst week of last June and continued through the \nlast week of August. There then took place a \nmassacre such as has never been witnessed in \nmodem times. Those racist mali\u00accious forces \nbrought destruction to all the towns and villages \nof southern Lebanon and slaughtered tens of \nthousands of innocent Palestinians and Lebanese, \nwho were buried under debris in mass graves. \nThose forces wrought devastation and havoc in \nthat part of Lebanon, which is an independent \nneutral State, a founding member of both the \nUnited Nations and of the non-aligned movement. \nThe forces of the Zionist enemy unleashed the \nburning fire of its military machine from land, \nair and sea at Palestinian refugee camps, killing \nunarmed children, women and the elderly, \ndestroying plantations and reducing buildings and \nhouses to rubble. Those forces pursued their \ncrimes in west Beirut and its suburbs, exposing \ntheir latent hatred to the extent of cutting off \nwater, medi\u00accine, food and electricity from the \nresidents while bombarding the city with heavy \nartillery and con\u00actinuing air and sea attacks for \nmany hours daily for several weeks. Many shells \nand rockets were fired indiscriminately at \nresidential communities and civilian \ninstallations, causing the loss of thousands of \nhuman lives; it will not be possible to assess \nthe amount of property destroyed for a long time.\n75.\tThe barbaric invading forces did not stop \nat genocide and brutal acts committed throughout \nLebanon. They also organized a massacre in Beirut \non 16 September 1982. Over 3,000 unarmed \nPalestinians were annihilated for no reason \nexcept that they were Palestinians. This racist \nmassacre outraged the entire world, including \neven the traditional friends of the perpetrators. \nThe damage at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps \nis a disgraceful stain on the history of mankind \nthat will never be forgotten. The inter\u00acnational \ncommunity is called upon to take, through the \ninternational organs of the United Nations, the \nappropriate deterrent measures, to condemn \ncate\u00acgorically the actions and policies of the \nZionist entity, to impose sanctions that are \nproportionate to its horrifying acts, and to \nconsider seriously disqualifying it as a Member \nof the Organization, for its presence here \nconstitutes a challenge to the Charter as well as \nto all human norms and conduct.\n76.\tThe Foreign Minister of the Zionist \nentity declared on 6 September 1982 that the \ncondition which his Government set for withdrawal \nof its forces from southern Lebanon and the \ntermination of its military occupation of the \narea was agreement by Lebanon to sign a peace \ntreaty with the Zionist entity. He also said that \ncertain agreements needed to be introduced \nregarding southern Lebanon, to ensure the \nsecurity of the State of Israel. At the same \ntime, the Zionist Minister of Defense declared \nthat the invading forces would remain deployed in \nsouthern Lebanon for at least 15 years. In our \nview, such a condition and determination \nillustrates the intention of the Zionist entity \nto proceed with its expansionist plan of annexing \nparts of southern Lebanon, including control of \nthe Litani River and other water resources, as \none further step towards the realization of \nZionist ambitions for the establishment of \nGreater Israel.\n77.\tHence, in view of this grave situation, \nwe believe that the United Nations should live up \nto its respon\u00acsibilities and stand firmly by the \nside of Lebanon as a free, independent and fully \nsovereign State and a founding Member of the \nUnited Nations, and should ensure the immediate \nand unconditional withdrawal of the Zionist \nentity behind the Lebanese borders. Also, the \nSecurity Council, in particular, should take \nappropriate action to eliminate aggression \nagainst Lebanon should the Zionist entity refuse \nto withdraw immediately and unconditionally from \nLebanese territory. In our view, the appropriate \naction which the Security Council should take is \nthe imposition of deterrent sanctions against the \nZionist entity. Fore\u00acmost among such sanctions \nshould be the suspension of its membership in the \nOrganization and the imposition of a \ncomprehensive embargo against it. This would, of \ncourse, require a show of will by the United \nStates to act seriously in the exercise of its \nresponsibilities as a great Power claiming to \nhave an interest in the question of security and \npeace and alleging concern for the good name of \nthe United Nations. It is indeed high time for \nthe American Administration to recognize- that \nits policy towards the Arab Zionist conflict are \nnot serve the interests of the American people \nand is in contradiction with their renowned \ntraditions. Thus it is incumbent upon the United \nStates Government to uphold justice and equity \nand to display courage and political will, free \nfrom the pressure of the Zionist minority.\n78.\tThe danger of the Zionist entity in the \nMiddle East is not limited to aggression \ncommitted at such time and place as it might deem \nproper in order to achieve its colonial \nexpansionist goals, thus jeopar\u00acdizing peace in \nthe area and impeding the development programmes \nrequired for the resurgence of the Arab nation \nand its economic and social progress. In fact it \ngoes beyond all that to threaten to continue its \nintensive effort in developing the Zionist \nnuclear program for military purposes and using \nit against the Arab countries. It is no longer a \nsecret that the Zionist entity has now acquired a \nnumber of nuclear bombs and weapons, with the \nrelevant systems to direct and deliver them \nagainst any part of the Arab world. It is indeed \nregrettable that no great Power has paid serious \nattention to this imminent danger which threatens \nmore than the Middle East. The great Powers cared \nneither about the non-accession by the Zionist \nentity to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons nor about its non\u00accompliance with \nthe Treaty safeguards. Furthermore, the Zionist \nentity refused to allow IAEA to carry out \ninspection measures in regard to the Zionist \nnuclear reactors and programmes. Thus the \nZionists were encouraged by this to escalate and \nintensify their aggression against the Arab \nnation, as they had learned from repeated \nexperience that any aggres\u00acsion committed by them \nwould pass without serious attention being paid \nto it by the great Powers, espe\u00accially the United \nStates of America, and would not result in any \nsanctions or other practical action, regardless \nof the dimensions of the aggression and even if \nit involved human loss.\n79.\tThe clearest evidence proving the \ndeliberate cover-up of the repeated Zionist acts \nof aggression by some great Powers and their \nfailure to shoulder their responsibilities was \nthe raid by Zionist planes of American \nmanufacture on 7 June 1981 on the Iraqi nuclear \ninstallations, despite the fact that those \ninstal\u00aclations, as certified by IAEA, were meant \nfor strictly peaceful purposes and were subject \nto regular inter\u00acnational inspection.\n80.\tIraq firmly adheres to the principles of \nthe Charter which call for the policy of the \ncharter which use of force, settlement of \ninternational dispute by peaceful means and \nnon-interference in the domestic affairs of other \ncountries. Although Iraq strove to establish good \nrelations with Iran after the fall of the Shah's \nregime, all cur endeavors were in vain in \npersuading rulers of Iran to cease their acts of \nprovocation, aggression ant3 interference in our \ninternal affairs, as well as to fulfill their \ninternational obligations towards Iraq.\n81.\tThat remained our approach in dealing \nwith Iran even after it started its armed \naggression against Iraq on 4 September 1980. \nSince that day, the Presi\u00acdent of the Republic of \nIraq. Mr. Saddam Hussein, has stressed the fact \nthat we look forward to enjoying relations of \ngood-neighborliness with the countries of the \nregion, including in particular Iran, and that \nIraq has neither any territorial ambitions in \nIran nor any intention of waging war against it, \nnor does Iraq intend to expand the scope of the \nconflict with Iran beyond the defense of its \nrights and sovereignty. But the armed Iranian \naggression against us has continued at an intense \nlevel to this very day, while the Iranian regimehas \ndeclined to respond in a spirit of constructive \nco-operation to any of the international \nendeavors to settle the dispute and has turned \ndown all the peaceful initiatives put forward by \nIraq to reach a just and honorable solution. The \nrulers of Iran favor the continuance of \naggression, and that can only be interpreted as \nevidence of their desire for expansion at the \nexpense of our country; as at first stage, to be \nfollowed by Iran's overrunning the Arab countries \nof the Gulf region, including Saudi Arabia, for \nthe purpose of colonial expansion and the \ncon\u00acsolidation of a reactionary regime and in \norder even\u00actually to force our region back into \nthe Dark Ages, in which racism and religious \nintolerance would reign supreme.\n82.\tOur peace initiatives with Iran were \nsubmitted at a meeting of the Security Council on \n12 July of this year, at which meeting the \nCouncil adopted resolution 3 64 (1982). Iraq \nwelcomed that resolution, whereas Iran rejected \nit. It is well known that between the eve of the \nadoption of that resolution and 30 July the \nIranian regime launched a series of massive \nmilitary acts of aggression against Iraqi \nterritory to the east of Basra, an account of \nwhich is contained in docu\u00acment A/37/428. It \nshould be recalled here that the Arab countries \ntook a unified position in support of Iraq at the \nTwelfth Arab Summit Conference held in Fez early \nthis September, after the expansionist intentions \nof the Iranian regime had become crystal\u00aclized in \na tangible fashion. The Arab Summit Con\u00acference \nadopted a clear and firm decision expressing the \nArab countries' support for and solidarity with \nIraq and their willingness to implement the \nCommon Defense Pact of the members of the League \nof Arab States. The entire region would be in a \nnew and dangerous situation were the Iranian \nregime to proceed further with its plan. We \nshould like to draw the attention of the world \npublic to th s development, which is obviously \nfraught with potential dangers. The full \nresponsibility for the consequences of a possible \nconfrontation between Iran and the Arab States as \na whole would therefore be Iran's alone.\n83.\tAt a time when efforts to settle the \ndispute and stop the fighting are being made by \nthe United Nations, which is a source of hope in \nall peace-loving nations, the Iranian regime is \ncarrying out a further act of aggression against \nthe central sector of Iraq. By the morning of 1 \nOctober 1982 Iran had made four large- scale \nattacks. The Security Council discussed this \nmatter on 4 October and unanimously adopted \nresolution 322 (1982), in which the Council \nrecalled its two earlier resolutions and urged \nIran once again to act in accordance with the \nprinciples of the United Nations by settling the \ndispute by peaceful means and emulating Iraq's \nco-operative attitude to the Council.\n84.\tMy delegation will explain to the General \nAssem\u00acbly in detail the peace initiatives Iraq \nhas taken in order to reach a just and honorable \nsettlement of the dispute with Iran when the \nAssembly debates agenda item 134, entitled \nConsequences of the prolongation of the armed \nconflict between Iran and Iraq . At this \njuncture, I should like to say that Iraq has \ngiven adequate proof of its good intentions and \nof its. Sincere desire to see peace and security \nestab-lished m our region, which is of \nsignificant importance to international peace and \nsecurity. The rejection by the rulers of Iran of \nall peace initiatives indicates that they lack a \nsense of responsibility for security and \nstability in the area, and this could exacerbate \nthe disturbances and tension there, lead to an \nescalation of the conflict and jeopardize \ninternational peace and security. I would also \nlike to stress that should Iran continue its \nintransigence and its rejection of the call for \npeace and persist in its aggression, Iraq would \ninevitably have to resist that aggression by all \nthe means available to it in the exercise of its \nlegitimate right to self-defense. In the mean \ntime, we believe that the Iraq-Iran dispute \nwarrants the General Assembly's maximum attention \nand care, since it represents a test of its will \nand of the strength of the Charter. By the same \ntoken, any success in this endeavor will enhance \nthe chances of peace and will prevent further \ndeterioration of the situation in that sensitive \nand dangerous part of the world.\n85. Racial crimes, including the policies of \nZionism and political doctrines based on racial \ndiscrimination are still being committed in many \nparts of the world, in spite of the fact that \nsuch crimes violate the Charter, the principles \nof non-alignment and the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights. Although the Decade to Combat \nRacism and Racial Discrimination is now drawing \ntowards its end, and although it has produced \nsome positive results, certain regimes\u2014especially \nthe Zionist entity and the racist minority regime \nin South Africa\u2014still refuse to accede to the \nInternational Convention on the Suppression and \nPunishment of the Crime of In this regard, a more \nserious position against them should be adopted, \nwith stronger condemnation, in order that the \npeoples of South Africa and Namibia, along with \nall the liberation movements in Africa and Latin \nAmerica, may achieve their aspirations to \nfreedom, inde\u00acpendence and self-determination.\n36. It is important to recall that the \nreactionary racist regime in South Africa \nviolates all values, and that it was owing to its \nantagonistic stand that the most recent meeting, \nheld at Geneva, on the imple\u00acmentation of the \nUnited Nations plan for the inde\u00acpendence of \nNamibia proved abortive. We must also mention the \nconclusions of the International Conference on \nSanctions against South Africa, which was held in \nParis in 1981, and commend the declara\u00actions it \nadopted/ which, in keeping with the Charter, \nreject racist concepts.\n87.\tFurthermore, we should like to draw \nattention to the fact that a number of Western \ncountries, and the Zionist entity, boycotted that \nhumanitarian con\u00acference. While the great \nmajority of the States Mem\u00acbers of the United \nNations supported General Assem\u00acbly resolution \n36/172, which calls for comprehensive mandatory \nsanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter \nagainst the racist regime in Pretoria, the same \ngroup of Western countries and the Zionist entity \ncontinue to take negative positions. That \nconfirms their collusion with the racist regime \nin South Africa and their deal\u00acings with it in \nthe economic, trade, diplomatic and military \nareas, as well as the development and \nco-ordination of joint action with that regime in \nthe nuclear field, including the production of \nenriched uranium. Obviously, such behaviour on \nthe part of Western countries and the Zionist \nentity constitutes a flagrant violation of \nSecurity Council resolution 418 (1977) and of the \nrelevant General Assembly resolu\u00actions, and \nencourages the racialist regime in Pretoria to \npursue its policy of aggression against the \npeoples of Namibia and South Africa, and to \ndisregard any action, even if adopted by the \noverwhelming majority of Members of the United \nNations.\n88.\tThe practices of the racial minority \nregime in Pretoria are not limited only to the \npeoples of Namibia and South Africa, but also \ninclude the artificial creation of crises and \nother conditions, as well as the recruit\u00acment of \nmercenaries to commit military aggression against \nmany independent peaceful African States, \nespecially Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, \nSwaziland and Seychelles. Apart from violating \nthe security and sovereignty of the countries of \nthe region,\nsuch acts of aggression always result in the \nkilling of large numbers of unarmed civilians and \npoor peasants and in the destruction of their \nhomes and farms.\n89.\tWe therefore appeal to the international \ncommu\u00acnity, and especially to the Western \ncountries which are permanent members of the \nSecurity Councill, not to block the efforts made \nto put an end to the aggres\u00acsion by the racial \nminority in South Africa, through the imposition \nof legitimate sanctions against that regime under \nChapter VII of the Charter.\n90.\tThe world economy is passing through a \nvery serious stage, in which a heavy burden is \nbeing placed on the developing countries in \nparticular. The dimen\u00acsions of the situation are \nreflected in: receding eco\u00acnomic activity and \ngrowth; increasing balance-of- payments deficits \nin the developing countries and a decline in the \nprices of their export commodities; rising \nunemployment figures; monetary inflation; the \nadverse effects of high rates of interest in the \nworld markets on foreign loans to the developing \ncoun\u00actries; a weakening of the flow of \nmultilateral assist\u00acance on favorable conditions; \ndwindling supplies of foodstuffs; increasing \nprotectionism exercised by the industrial \ncountries against exports of the developing \ncountries; harsh and unfavorable conditions for \nthe transfer of technology to the developing \nworld; deliberate control of raw material prices \nwith adverse effects on the terms of trade of the \ndeveloping countries; and the recurrent \napplication of irrespon\u00acsible concepts, such as \ngradualism, selectivity and discrimination, which \nare being introduced by the industrial nations in \ntheir trade transactions with the developing \nworld. AH those factors impede the efforts made \nby the developing countries to secure their \neconomic growth, to continue interest payments on \ntheir foreign debts and to meet their basic needs \nfor imported goods.\n91.\tThe developing countries sought seriously \nand sincerely to maintain a constructive dialogue \nwith the industrialized countries in a bid to \nrestructure the world economy on just and \nbalanced terms. But the industrial nations were \nnot responsive to such endeavors and initiatives. \nOn the contrary, some of them even opposed any \ninternational action to improve the world \neconomic situation. Among the vital issues raised \nby the developing countries was the initiation of \nglobal economic talks within the frame\u00acwork of \nthe United Nations. Ever since the eleventh \nspecial session of the General Assembly, held in \n1980, obstacles have remained in the way of \ninitiating those important and essential \nnegotiations. There\u00acfore, Iraq and all other \ndeveloping countries support the call for \nstarting those talks as early as possible, and we \nurge all States that oppose them to reconsider \ntheir positions in the interests of us all.\n92.\tThe Group of 77 this year submitted \nconstructive and moderate proposals to resolve \nthe question of starting such negotiations, but \nthose proposals did not suit some industrial \nnations.\n93.\tThe problems of debts and cash liquidity \nwhich face the developing countries have become \nso dan\u00acgerous and pressing as to require an \noverall solution. In our judgment, the industrial \ncountries bear great responsibility in this \nconnection. At their recent annual meeting the \nWorld Bank and IMF recommended some measures to \nalleviate the financial burden weigh\u00acing on the \ndeveloping countries. Those measures, however, do \nnot go far in addressing the essence of the \nproblem, a problem which is due basically to the \nfailure of the existing world monetary system to \ndevelop along with the changes that have been \ntaking place since the Second World War. \nMoreover, those measures constituted a mere \nreaction to the crisis, which is assuming \nintolerable dimensions, and there fore cannot be \nconsidered as remedial measures in the true sense \nof the word.\n94.\tIraq was among the first countries to \ndiagnose the nature of the economic problems that \nare plaguing the world. That is why the President \nof the Republic of Iraq has proposed the \nestablishment of a world fund for long-term \nassistance to developing countries. The proposed \nfund would help them to cope both with the \neffects of inflation passed on to them by the \nindustrial countries, and with the increasing \nbill for their oil imports. This vital plan, \nwhich was wel\u00accomed at the Sixth Conference of \nHeads of State or Government of Non-Aligned \nCountries, held at Havana in 1979, was the \nsubject of extensive discussion by experts of the \nGroup of 77 at a meeting they held at Baghdad in \nMarch 1982. An outline of the fund was drawn up \nand later approved by the co-ordination and \nfollow-up Committee of the Group of 77, which met \nat Manila in August this year. That Committee \ndecided to recommend the inclusion of the Iraqi \nproposal in the list of items to be discussed in \nthe global negotiations. We now trust that the \nindustrial\u00acized countries will seriously consider \nthis plan, which we hope will eventually be \ntranslated into action.\n95.\tEconomic co-operation among the \ndeveloping countries has undoubtedly become more \nimportant in recent years. Iraq, as a developing \ncountry, views this matter as a major component \nof its foreign policy, and it contributes to many \nregional and international funds. We also try to \nhelp to enhance and promote such co-operation \nthrough bilateral agreements. I should like to \nrecall in this regard that the High- Level \nConference on Economic Co-operation among \nDeveloping Countries held in Caracas in 1981 \napproved an overall program for such co-operation \nand that the developing countries are in the \nprocess of implementing it.\n96.\tWe catll upon all the industrial nations \nand the international institutions to take all \npossible action to ensure a constant and \nincreasing flow of assistance to the developing \nworld to help to maintain that co-operation. At \nthis point we must emphasize, however, that the \nexpansion of economic co-operation among the \ndeveloping countries does not relieve the \nindustrial countries of their responsibilities \ntowards the devel\u00acoping nations.\n"

We also compliment Mr. Kittani of Iraq on his \nrecord-breaking performance last year.\nOur presence in the Assembly is a token of our collective commitment \nto the processes of peace in inter-State relations which the United \nNations offers in opposition to the processes of violence and \naggression which have marred human history for unsold ages. Yet, in \nspite of this commitment, we are all aware of the reality that once \nagain the methods of violence and conflict are on the increase in \nintercourse among nations. In Asia we are disturbed by the events in \nKampuchea and Afghanistan, in Africa by the continuing aggression and \ninhumanity of South Africa, in Latin America by the recently \nconcluded conflict in the Falklands. In the Middle East we have still \nnot recovered from the shock of the appalling events in Lebanon, \nwhich form a tragic climax to the escalating policy of illegality and \noutrage perpetrated by Israel in its relentless aggression against \nthe Palestinian people, its annexation of occupied territories, its \nattack on Iraqi nuclear installations and its persistent flouting of \nGeneral Assembly and Security Council resolutions.\nThe post-war world order based on the Yalta repartition of spheres of \ninfluence, with its ensuing system of armed alliances, is no longer \nable to maintain even its initial precarious stability. The erosion \nof the nuclear superiority by one super-Power, leading to nuclear \nparity, ushered in a state of strategic uncertainty. Together with \nthe challenges by the emergent nations to rigid polarization around \nsuper-Power spheres of influence, this led to an increasing resort to \nthe use of force by dominant Powers. Therefore we cannot but agree \nwith the frank analysis of the Secretary-General, in which he points \nout the reforms which are still required to transform the United \nNations into a world body which effectively unites nations in the \npursuit of their security on the basis of peace, co-operation and \nmutual respect.\nIn the absence of all-encompassing co-operation on security at the \nglobal level, nations have increasingly resorted to concrete \ninitiatives at the regional level.\nIn the Mediterranean, regional States have traditionally approached \ntheir security concerns in different ways. However, while most of the \nStates of the North appear to have chosen the road of complete \nintegration in the armed alliances and all the States of the South \nare active members of the non- aligned movement, the apparent \ndivision is not so rigid. There are evidently different levels of \nintegration in the alliances by the members in the North, while \nStates of the South have established their own links with members of \nthe alliances-links which are based on economic, technological, \ncultural and historical realities.\nWhat constitutes the most pervasive destabilizing element in the \nMediterranean at the present time is in fact the massive and \nincreasing super-Power presence in the region. Detente, far from \nbeing a global phenomenon, was restricted to central Europe. In \nHelsinki, at the start of the process begun with the Conference on \nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe, Malta had striven for the \nacceptance of the need to extend detente to the Mediterranean, on the \nbasis of the principle that security in the Mediterranean is an \nintegral element in European security. The super-Power, however, paid \nonly lip-service to the Mediterranean document of the Helsinki Final \nAct. Eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation is the reality in the \nMediterranean today, a reality which is even more threatening to \nregional and European peace and security because it creates a \nconfrontation more direct than it has ever been in central Europe, \nwhere the military forces of the super-Power are buffered from each \nother by the presence of their allies.\nBecause of the vacuum which exists at the global level through the \nabsence of an elective role by the United Nations, super-Power \ninfluence in matters relating directly to security and co-operation \nin the Mediterranean has today assumed excessive proportions. All \nStates in the region must be concerned by the extent of this \ninfluence. Many have already come to the conclusion that the only \nfeasible alternative is for Mediterranean countries to forge together \ntheir own arrangements for regional security, which would then enable \nthem to work out with the super-Power an agreed programme of \nprogressive armaments reductions, phased in such way as to ensure \nthat at no stage would either super-Power consider that its \nlegitimate strategic interests were being put in jeopardy.\nSuch an approach entails two fundamental objectives: first, that the \nMediterranean should not be used as a major arena of global \nconfrontation; secondly, that regional States should be more directly \nin control of security and co-operation questions in their own \nregion. Although we cannot have any illusion as to the continuing \nimpact of bloc politics on our region, we also sense an underlying \nappreciation of the potential validity of an indigenous regional \nsecurity system, leading to the ultimate withdrawal of super-Power \nforces from the region.\nMalta's experience in its own struggle for freedom, a struggle which \nis rooted in a strategy for regional co-operation, corroborates this \nassessment. The Socialist Government which came to power in 1971 \nafter 13 years in opposition was firmly committed to a policy aimed \nat the elimination of all foreign military bases on the island. The \nphased and bloodless withdrawal of the forces of Britain and the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization from the island commenced in 1972 \nand was completed by March 1979. My party was returned to power in \n1976 it was pledged to entrench the process of the elimination of all \nforeign military presence in Malta by the assumption for the island \nof a status of neutrality, based strictly on the principles of \nnon-alignment. We started discussions with our Mediterranean \nneighbours on the status we were to adopt after 1979. By 1979 those \ndiscussions were already bearing fruit. We found early encouragement \nand support both from our southern neighbours, in particular the \nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya and Algeria, and from our northern neighbours, \nincluding Italy and France. In the unfolding of events, our choice of \na neutral status received broad recognition from Mediterranean and \nnon- Mediterranean States alike. In different forms and under \ndifferent circumstances, such broad recognition came from Qatar, \nYugoslavia, Italy, Bulgaria and the European Economic Community in \n1980; from Saudi Arabia, Morocco, the United States of America, the \nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics, France, Senegal, Iraq, the \nnon-aligned movement and the Commonwealth in 1981; and from Algeria, \nTunisia, Greece, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China and \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran so far this year.\nIn May 1980 the Maltese Parliament formally enshrined our neutral \nstatus in a proclamation. By virtue of that proclamation, Malta \nundertakes not to allow any foreign military bases on its territory, \nnot to allow any military facilities to foreign forces, not to allow \nany facilities to be used in Malta in such a manner or to such an \nextent as will constitute a virtual presence of foreign forces, nor \nthat any foreign military personnel be allowed in Malta, and that the \nshipyards of Malta will be used for civil commercial purposes and \nwill be denied to the military vessels of the super-Power. Soon after \nthe formal adoption of our status, in September 1980 Italy entered \ninto a bilateral agreement with us in which it welcomed, recognized \nand supported our neutrality and engaged itself both to avoid any \naction that would jeopardize that status and to come to our \nassistance in case of any attack on Malta. That formal commitment by \na country belonging to NATO to commit itself actively in safeguarding \nMalta's neutrality was paralleled a few months later by an analogous \nundertaking by the Soviet Union in which recognition and support of \nour status was also accompanied by an undertaking not to do anything \nthat would put it in jeopardy. Both agreements have been duly \nregistered with the United Nations under Article 102 of the Charter.\nFollowing its third consecutive return to power in 1981, the \nsocialist Government pledged to utilize Malta's new-found freedom and \nneutral status to promote a genuine process for peace in the \nMediterranean. Several countries have not only formally recognized \nour neutral status, but have also explicitly acknowledged its \nsignificance for the process of peace in the Mediterranean-these \ninclude France and Greece from within the NATO alliance and the \nnon-aligned Mediterranean States of Yugoslavia and Tunisia.\nIn addition to its choice of neutrality, Malta had already taken \nother important initiatives for peace in the Mediterranean. The most \ncomprehensive of those initiatives has been our endeavours in the \nConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to obtain \nrecognition of the linkage between security in the Mediterranean and \nsecurity in Europe, and participation by Mediterranean States in all \nmatters relating to Mediterranean security and co-operation.\nBy 1975 all European States, and the two super-Powers, had accepted \nnon-participating Mediterranean States in the process of that \nConference. By 1979 the Conference had launched a concrete initiative \nfor functional co-operation in the Mediterranean. Meeting in Malta in \nFebruary of that year, participants in the Conference and \nnon-participating Mediterranean States drew up recommendations \nconcerning the exchange of statistical data, environmental \nco-operation, tourism, energy resources, transport networks, \ntelecommunications research, migrant labour, scientific and technical \nproblems, eradication of Mediterranean diseases, gerontology, \nseismology, preservation of cultural heritage and a number of other \nsubjects. In the ongoing review Session of the Conference, taking \nplace in Madrid, our objective is now to bring about a thorough \nconsideration of the security aspects of the Helsinki Mediterranean \nchapter, in particular the recommendations regarding the reduction of \narmed forces in the region.\nWe have also taken initiatives outside the established bodies. As \nearly as 1972, on the initiative of Malta's Prime Minister, Dom \nMintoff, who has identified himself most intimately with the \nobjective of enhancing Mediterranean co-operation, a process of \nquadripartite collaboration at the ministerial and technical levels \nwas initiated between Italy, Libya, Malta and Tunisia. That \ninitiative has led to the recognition of a common interest in \ncommunications, tourism, fisheries, agriculture and the preservation \nand protection of the environment.\nA more recent initiative has been the setting up of Radio \nMediterranean, which Malta pioneered in 1978 under the auspices of \nUNESCO and which is now starting to assume its intended role as the \ncollective and authentic voice of Mediterranean peoples. The keen \ninterest which that initiative is awakening has recently been \ndemonstrated by Algeria's participation and by the various approaches \nmade by other Mediterranean States.\nAt the multilateral level in 1975 UNEP launched a Mediterranean \nAction Plan, which, under the objective of environmental protection, \nhas given scope to the emergence of a number of concrete projects of \na technical and practical nature. Malta is participating in various \naspects of that Action Plan, in particular through the setting up of \na Regional Oil-Combating Centre on the island which is intended to \ncoordinate regional action against hazards of oil pollution.\nHere at the United Nations since 1976 the resolutions on the \nimplementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of \nInternational Security have included a call, sponsored by Malta and \nother Mediterranean States, for the transformation of the \nMediterranean into a zone of peace. The growing support for that \ncall, which now also includes members of the NATO alliance, is also \nmanifested in the encouraging number, and substantive content, of the \nvarious replies sent to the questionnaire on the strengthening of \nsecurity in the Mediterranean called for under resolution 36/102. It \nis clear from some of those replies, in particular the one from \nYugoslavia, that Mediterranean countries are giving very serious \nconsideration to the question of how they can themselves best take \ncharge of security matters in their own region. We also find great \nsignificance in the fact that in its reply France has indicated that \nit considers its formal recognition and support of Malta's status of \nneutrality as a direct contribution to the process of strengthening \nsecurity and co-operation in the Mediterranean. Similar interest has \nemerged in the various statements made during the current general \ndebate, in particular by Italy and Algeria. It is our intention this \nyear, in collaboration with our partners, to seek to add to the \ngrowing consensus on the question and to identify pragmatic ways of \ndeveloping the initiative further. One important consideration \nconcerns the need to keep all Member States, and especially those in \nthe Security Council, fully informed of relevant developments in our \nregion.\nVarious initiatives are converging to lend further strength and \ncredibility to the formation of a Mediterranean built upon the \nawareness of a commonality of interests which bind the regional \nStates together in a process of peace and co-operation. Malta's \nuphill task in the mid-1970s to form a consensus for bringing \ntogether northern and southern Mediterranean States in the framework \nof the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has in turn \nopened up prospects for other initiatives. Thus, Malta and other \nMediterranean States, the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or \nGovernment of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Havana in 1979, engaged \nthe explicit support of the non-aligned movement for the proposal \nthat non-aligned Mediterranean States meet in Malta in 1980 with \naligned Mediterranean States, participants in the European \nConference, to discuss specific projects of co-operation and to \nco-ordinate positions for further action even in the European \nConference itself.\nThat convergence is most evident in the case of Malta's neutrality. \nThe widespread recognition and support for Malta's status of \nneutrality is proving of seminal value for initiatives aimed at \ninstalling a system of regional security in the Mediterranean in \nwhich the concerns of super-Power confrontation are neither exclusive \nnor dominant.\nThrough their unilateral rejection of foreign military bases on their \nterritories, a number of Mediterranean States have set in motion a \nprocess of disarmament in the region. With the closing of foreign \nmilitary bases, Malta, too, has contributed to that formation of \nembryo zones of peace. But this unilateral approach is not enough. In \nseeking support for its status of neutrality, Malta has introduced a \nreciprocity of commitments. At the regional level it has undertaken \nthe commitment that its territory would never be used for armed \noffensives against neighbouring States, and in return obtained \nassurances from them that they would not threaten or violate its \nneutrality; at the broader level, the super-Power have accepted \nMalta's assurances that its territory would not be available to \neither of them for military purposes and in return they have assured \nMalta of their undertaking to respect its neutrality. If the \nMediterranean is to enjoy the benefits of a system of regional \nsecurity, an extension of this type of reciprocal commitment is \nindispensable. Only in this way would there start a process of easing \nof tension, reduction of polarization and limitation of armaments \ndeployment.\nWe are, of course, very much aware that military deployment by the \nsuper-Power in the Mediterranean is not simply a function of regional \nconcerns, but is integrated in global strategic planning. We are \nequally aware that the options being taken today by some of the \nStates in our region are supportive of the global dimension of the \nsuper-Power military presence in the Mediterranean. The current \ndeteriorating situation is not especially propitious. Yet, we have \nsensed in the developments which took place in the 1970s that the \npotential exists for an affirmation of the collective role of \nMediterranean States in the security of their own region. Our \npersistence at the present time arises both from the concern that any \nrelaxation would jeopardize the progress which has already been made; \nas well as from the conviction that in pursuing our objectives for \npeace we are directly contributing to the overcoming of the current \nnegative trend.\nAlthough conditions in the Mediterranean are ripe for progress in the \npursuit of regional security and co-operation, current negative \ntrends elsewhere are adversely affecting this region too. The \nMediterranean thus challenges the super-Power with a crucial test of \ntheir willingness and capacity to respond by favouring the processes \nof peace as opposed to the processes of confrontation. In the light \nof the remarkable achievements for the Mediterranean over the past \ndecade, a reversal here would have ominous consequences for other \nquarters of the globe, where stability, peace and security are \nprecarious and threatened. Progress here, on the other hand, would \ngive the cue for analogous initiatives to be undertaken in other \nregions so that peace becomes indivisible and stable. In other words, \nthe crucial test for peace is whether Mediterranean countries and the \nsuper-Power agree on reciprocal assurances as have already been \nimplemented in respect of a neutral Malta. The Mediterranean is ready.\nFor Malta, the struggle against such high odds to bring about a halt \nto the process of confrontation in our region is in line with the \nhistoric linkage which has existed between events in our country and \nin the region at large. Poised in the heart of the Mediterranean, \nless than 200 miles from the mainlands of Europe and of Africa, Malta \nhas for centuries been right on the dividing line between opposing \nand contending forces.\nStarting with the Roman-Carthaginian confrontation of the \npre-Christian era, and running through to the regional super-Power \nconfrontation of our day, Malta's position has always imposed \ncritical choices of alignment and commitment. In the past, these \nchoices were always made by the dominant Power in possession of the \nisland. They were inevitably choices for aggression and military \ndomination of Malta's neighbours. During this century alone, Malta \nhas served as a forward base for major military offensives in Italy, \nGreece and North Africa; it served as a strategically vital position \nin the two world conflicts and as an important focal point of \noperations in the Suez crisis in the late 1950s.\nWithout any choice of its own, Malta has therefore consistently been \ncommitted on one or another of the sides in the many conflicts and \nconfrontations taking place in the Mediterranean region. Whenever \narmed aggression took place, Maltese territory fell directly under \nattack. The nature and extent of our defences were as much at the \ndiscretion of the foreigner as were the strategic decisions leading \nto the opening of hostilities and the actions and considerations \nleading to their resolution. The experience of the last World War, \nwhen the Maltese people in their overwhelming majority joined \nenthusiastically in the struggle against fascism and nazism and \nrejoiced in their eventual overthrow, brought with it the dear \nrealization that in always fighting other people's wars, Malta had \nnever yet had the opportunity to struggle for its own freedom and for \npeace.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the time came for Malta, in common with other \noppressed nations of the world, to achieve its independence. The \nopportunity thereby created for the island to define its role for \npeace in the region was, however, obstructed by British and NATO \ncollusion that Malta should and, indeed, would continue to pursue \neconomic, strategic, political and cultural choices strictly \nintegrated into the Western alliance, even if that involved actions \nand policies divergent from the national or regional interests of a small \nindependent island State in the heart of a troubled region.\nFor a few years the local interests which had thrived on the colonial \nstructures and mentality managed to retain sufficient control over \nthe island to ensure the pursuit of a policy in strict conformity \nwith NATO strategies. The inappropriate economic infrastructure \nclosely supportive of a NATO role, which had been inherited from \ncolonial times, was cosmetically restructured only to the extent that \nit would not interfere with that role. Control of key factors-ports, \nairports, telecommunications, media, banking and currency, for \nexample-was retained, sometimes through indirect means, by the \nBritish.\nThis continuing control served British interests in two ways. On the \none hand, by reinforcing the dominance of an elite which had a weak \nbase of local support, it ensured the continuing loyalty of that \nelite to the British and NATO objectives. This in turn permitted \nBritain to convince its NATO allies that in order to ensure that \nMalta remained firmly entrenched in the Western bloc, it was in their \ninterests not to take any action to improve, at least to Western \nEuropean standards, the social and economic plight of the Maltese. \nThe Maltese people soon realized that the policies under which they \nwere being led constituted a negation of their freedom, were inimical \nto their national interests and thwarted their natural vocation to \nserve as a focal point of peace and co-operation in the \nMediterranean. Those who were claiming to maintain the island as a \nbulwark of democracy by aligning it irrevocably with one bloc were at \nthe same time led into taking measures which, in their disrespect for \nthe basic rights of the individual, constituted a serious denial of \ndemocracy.\nThe process of Malta's struggle for freedom came to a critical point \nin the early 1970s when the people of the island, in anger and \nfrustration, took a dramatic decision to halt the centuries-old \nmilitary role of their own homeland. Over the last 12 years, Malta \nhas pursued a policy in which the struggle for personal liberty, \nnational freedom and regional peace and co-operation are intimately \nintertwined. We have, restructured our economic infrastructure to \nmake it serve simultaneously the purposes of national development and \nregional co-operation. We have opened our economic, cultural, \ntechnological and political relations to all countries, rejecting any \nideological bias in our contacts.\nThis policy both defines and lends credibility to the status of \nneutrality we have assumed, not out of any escapist desire to steer \nan uncommitted course between the contending antagonisms in our \nregion and beyond, but out of the fundamental awareness that the \nfuture of our nation is intimately linked with developments in our \nregion.\nThis policy has enabled us to demonstrate a forceful integrity in the \npursuit and defence of peace. Last week's endorsement of Malta's \ncandidacy for the Security Council in the ministerial declaration of \nthe non-aligned movement encourages us to persevere in our policy. \nWhenever the occasion has required it, we have not shirked from \ntaking the necessary frank and forthright action. It was the forceful \nintegrity of our policies which enabled us to persevere when alone in \nthe European forums, in the Conference on Security and Co-operation \nin Europe, and in the European capitals we put forward such views as \nthe call for a Mediterranean involvement in questions of European \nsecurity and the equally pressing call for a Middle East solution \nbased on recognition of the Palestinians' right to an independent \nState of their own. Today, when these views are finding increased \nsupport, we can look back on our earlier efforts with a dense of \npride, satisfaction and encouragement for the future.\nThis same spirit motivated us in the early 1970s to be equally firm \nin our negotiations with Britain over the arrangements to phase out \ntheir military presence on our territory. We then faced a massed \nopposition based on prejudice, misconception and vested interests \nboth from within and beyond our shores. Gradually, however, we \npersuaded our opponents of the integrity and peaceful nature of our \nobjectives.\nYet following the final departure of British troops from the island, \nwe again had to face the arrogant attitudes of our erstwhile colonial \nruler in connection with the question of the clearing from areas \naround Malta of war remnants left over from the colonial period which \nare seriously obstructing some of our major development projects.\nOne particular case, concerning the removal of war remnants, is \ncausing serious problems to our development programme. My \nGovernment's development plan calls for the setting up in Malta of a \nmajor coal and grain trans-shipment centre in the Mediterranean. A \nprerequisite for the success of this project is a sufficient draught \nto enable ships requiring an under-keel clearance of over 14 metres \nto enter and navigate in the Grand Harbour of Valletta without any \nproblem. Nature has blessed Valletta Harbour with a sufficiently \nlarge draught to handle such ships, but the presence of war wrecks in \nvarious parts of the harbour and, in particular, at its entrance, has \nreduced the clearance to 12.6 metres, so that the trans-shipment \nproject cannot materialize unless those wrecks are removed.\nFor the past several years my Government has been trying to reach an \namicable solution with Britain on this subject but, in spite of the \nuniversally accepted principle that the removal of remnants of war is \nthe responsibility of the country that implanted them, Britain has \nconsistently refused to accept any legal or moral responsibility. \nIndeed, Britain is making its repeated disclaimer of any legal or \nmoral responsibility whatsoever a pre-condition of any talks with my \nGovernment. From this rostrum I repeat the offer which my Government \nhas already made to the British Government of talks without \npre-conditions. A satisfactory solution would also obviate the need \nfor us to raise this issue in all appropriate international \nforums-something which we are otherwise determined to persist in.\nOur experience teaches that the struggle by a people to achieve \ndignity and freedom is itself part of the process in the endeavor for \nregional and global peace and security. For the Palestinian people \nthe road to dignity and freedom is proving particularly tragic, as \nthe recent events in Lebanon have shown. These events have not broken \nthe spirit of the Palestinian people in continuing their struggle but \nthe opportunities for a peaceful solution, which under the leadership \nof the PLO were genuinely being sought, have been dealt a severe \nblow. The Israeli actions have deliberately placed a policy of \naggression right in the path of the road to peace; in the process \nthey have inflicted unbelievable suffering, and they have torn a \ncountry apart.\nThe threat to the peace and stability of the Middle East and the \nMediterranean which arises out of the Palestinian and. Lebanese \ntragedies constitutes a direct threat to peace and stability even \noutside the region. European nations should play a major role to help \nbring about a solution which both respects the inalienable rights of \nthe Palestinians and at the same time safeguards other legitimate \ninterests in the region. Malta is proud of the role it has played in \nsupporting the Palestinian cause and pledges to continue steadfastly \nin this course.\nThe actions of South Africa, its internal policies of racism and \noppression and its external policies of aggression and domination \nconstitute yet another threat to international peace and stability. \nThe cry of anger, frustration and suffering emerging from southern \nAfrica is urgent and persuasive. It calls for urgent and effective \nremedies.\nThe aspiration of the people of Korea to the peaceful unification of \ntheir country continues to be frustrated. The presence of foreign \ntroops in South Korea and the size and strategic objectives of this \npresence run directly counter to the already expressed desire of all \nKorean people to seek a peaceful road to the reunification of their \ncountry.\nSimilarly, in Cyprus the illegal presence of foreign troops stands in the \nway of an already defined basis for a peaceful solution which would \nensure the sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and independence \nof that island.\nThe people of Afghanistan and Kampuchea also find the internal \nevolution of their societies interfered with and distorted by the \ninterplay of outside interests. The departure of foreign troops from \nthese countries remains a necessary pre-condition of the recovery by \ntheir peoples of their sovereignty and independence.\nFor over two years now the imperatives of peace have not prevailed \nbetween the Iranian and Iraqi peoples. We continue to believe that \nthe possibilities exist for a peaceful solution to their problems and \nthat no means whatsoever should be spared to achieve this end.\nIn the Falkland Islands the resort to force was a tragic outcome of \nthe failure to use the processes of consultation and negotiation \nrecommended by the United Nations. We hope to see wiser counsels \nprevail in the future.\nIn these and other instances, policies of aggression and force \nclearly continue to play their dominant role in the relations among \nnations. The yearning for peace, so urgent and pervasive in the \nhearts and minds of peoples throughout the world, has not yet been \ntranslated into the actions and policies of nations. And yet the \nmechanisms for peace exist, here at the United Nations, through \nregional concertation and through national initiatives. We need to \nmuster the courage and tenacity to make a thrust for peace before the \nincreasing resort to force overwhelms us completely and leads us to \nan irreversible catastrophe. Malta remains deeply committed to this \nendeavour.\n"

We confirm to him that we \nare overjoyed to see him in that important post and we wish him full \nsuccess in his tasks, which involve onerous responsibilities. We are \nsure that the work of this session will be crowned with success \nthanks to his expertise and acknowledged statesmanship. For our part, \nwe shall spare no effort in cooperating with him in carrying out his \ngreat responsibilities in ensuring that the session does the work \nrequired of it at this crucial phase through which our world is now \npassing. We wish, through you, Sir, to put on record our well \ndeserved appreciation and admiration for Mr. Ismat Kittani, who \nconducted the proceedings of the thirty sixty session in a brilliant \nand exemplary manner, which was characterized by objectivity and \neffectiveness. We wish him success in his future tasks. My delegation \nwishes also to pay a tribute to the Secretary General for the \nconstructive efforts he has made and the commendable he has done in \nthe short period since his assumption of the post and for the way he \nhas fulfilled the responsibilities which the nature of his sensitive \ntask involves. I wish also to convey the greetings of the Yemeni \npeople to all the peace loving people of the world represented at \nthis annual and respected gathering.\nWe all know that the United Nations came into being as a result of \nthe strong desire and determination of the peoples of the world to \navert the tragedies of further world wars. This resolve reflects the \nsincere and profound conviction that it is necessary that peace and \nsecurity prevail throughout the world and that we end, once and for \nall, all violence, aggression, military threats, hegemony, \nintervention and colonialism in any form. Therefore, in the minds of \nall, the United Nations is linked with noble concepts and superior \nvalues, because it is the crucible of all sincere efforts to achieve \npeace and the supremacy of justice in all dimensions, and the \nstarting point for efforts that will lead to understanding and \nsolidarity among nations, instead of division and wars.\nFor this reason, my country has reaffirmed more than once its \ncommitment and adherence to the principles of the Charter and its \nnoble purposes in all fields, for this is the proper way to establish \nnormal and peaceful relations among all nations and solid guarantees \nof the achievement of international peace and security. Therefore all \nMember States should support the Organization in its constructive \nrole and should abide by its resolutions more loyally than ever \nbefore. We should combine our efforts to ensure that the basic \nprinciples of the sovereignty, equality and independence of all \nnations, regardless of size, position, military strength, or social, \neconomic or political system, will prevail.\nWe in the Yemen Arab Republic, too, support the right to self \ndetermination and full and effective independence of all peoples that \nsuffer under the yoke of imperialism and racial domination and that \nstruggle to achieve the noble goal to which we aspire. At the same \ntime we affirm our unshakable belief in the need to ensure the unity \nand territorial integrity of all nations and non intervention in \ntheir internal affairs. We also affirm the right of all nations to \nself determination, and, above all, the right of the Palestinian \npeople to self determination, to return to its homeland and to \nestablish an independent State on its own soil.\nWe view with a sense of gratification the efforts exerted by the \nUnited Nations to preserve international solidarity, support \nliberation causes and to ensure well being and economic and social \ndevelopment everywhere. However, we look forward to further \nachievements, because the Organization can achieve more than it has \nalready. It can redouble its efforts towards international peace and \nsecurity, the assurance of justice for all the peoples that long for \nit in Palestine, in Lebanon, and in Namibia, and the greatest good of \nthe whole world by providing norms and safeguards that guarantee \nrespect for and compliance with the resolutions of the Organization.\nProceeding from this premise, we support every detail of the report \nof the Secretary General on the work of the Organization and on \nincreasing its efficiency and overcoming the difficulties that stand \nin its way. These difficulties represent a real challenge that should \nbe faced by all Member States if we want the Organization to be a \nreal instrument for the consolidation of peace, which we all so \ndeeply desire, and of justice, to which we all aspire.\nThe Yemen Arab Republic reaffirms its belief in fundamental human \nrights, the dignity of the individual and the promotion of \ninternational peace and security, and calls for continuous dialogue \nand permanent understanding among nations and peoples. It calls for \nresistance to dominating influences, no matter by whom, and seeks to \nwiden the scope of cooperation among brother and friendly countries. \nIt deplores more deeply than ever before the fact that these \nprinciples in which the international community came to believe after \npainstaking and agonizing experiences are not being effectively \nimplemented in international relations, which causes us to look to \nthe future with deep pessimism and concern.\nWe do not have to look very far to confirm this prognosis. It is \nsufficient to consider the development of the international situation \nsince the last regular session of the General Assembly. Many of the \ninternational conflicts have worsened and become more complex and \nserious. Many of the problems raised during the thirty sixth session \nand even before that, at previous sessions, remain unresolved; they \nhave become more complicated and it will be more difficult to solve \nthem in the near future.\nWhat shall we say to the deprived, the persecuted, those that yearn \nfor justice for freedom and for the support of the international \ncommunity? What shall we tell the displaced, the wounded, the maimed \nand murdered Lebanese and Palestinians who have appealed to the \nOrganization and the conscience of the world, because their rights \nhave been usurped and they have been the victims of aggressors in \ntheir own home and in the refugee camps? Shall we tell them that the \nSecurity Council, the organ responsible for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, has been convened more than once in \norder to consider the abominable aggression by Israel against Lebanon \nand that each time the representative of a super Power, the United \nStates of America, used its right of veto in order to obstruct the \ncessation of the massacres in Lebanon whose victims were men, women \nand children, and to obstruct the imposition of sanctions upon Israel \nin accordance with the Charter?\nWhat is the responsibility of the United States concerning the issues \nof international peace and security in the world after all that? For \nsome time past Lebanon has been persistently complaining of the \nviolation by Israel of the cease fire agreement through repeated \nIsraeli aggression against southern Lebanon and through the violation \nof the independence and national sovereignty of the country and the \nsupport extended to the rebels against Lebanese authority.\nToday we face a new situation after the barbaric invasion of Lebanon \nby land, by sea and from the air. Towns and villages were destroyed, \nincluding the capital, Beirut. Houses were pulled down over their \noccupants and the most sophisticated internationally prohibited means \nof destruction were used. Despite all that Israel is still there, \nengaged in occupying, usurping, murdering and destroying with \nimpunity, ' assured of the military, political and economic support \nof the United States without which it could not have continued its \naggression. It is really surprising and at the same time revolting \nthat the United States and some other Western countries did not use \ntheir influence early and still have not done so to compel Israel to \nwithdraw from Lebanon and to stop the bloodshed and the daily \nmassacres that Israel has committed on Lebanese territory, it is \nterrible that the United States should claim to preserve \ninternational peace when it supports Israel, which currently \nrepresents the greatest and the gravest threat to international peace \nand security. This claim, which clearly involves a contradiction, has \npractically disclosed the role of the United States in supporting the \nIsraeli aggression against Lebanon and in focusing American diplomacy \non the ousting of the Palestine Liberation Organization from Lebanon, \nwithout linking it to the recognition of the inalienable rights of \nthe Palestinian people, including their right to self  determination \nand to establish their own independent State on their soil.\nWe wonder how the United States can reconcile its international \nresponsibilities concerning international peace and security and its \nstrategic cooperation with the State of Israel which today represents \nthe most dangerous regional military Power seeking expansion and \nhegemony over the Middle East region. We consider this cooperation \nand this alliance to be the factor that encourages Israel to persist \nin its aggression against Lebanon and that it has an adverse effect \non all efforts aimed at reaching a just solution to the conflict in \nthe Middle East.\nThe Yemen Arab Republic has heard more than enough words of \ncondemnation and denunciation they will not return rights to those \nwho have been deprived of them and will not restore life to an \ninnocent child killed by the American war machine and Zionist hands. \nWords of denunciation have become unacceptable from those who could \nhave influenced events, especially those who knew in advance what was \nto happen in Lebanon and could have prevented it. We firmly believe \nthat the new Zionist arrogance and Israeli terrorism, immune to \ninternational resolutions, its arrogance with regard to all norms and \nlegal instruments, and the constant acts of aggression, have proved \nmore than ever before that Israel is not a peace loving State and \nthat it should not have a voice in the Organization, which is made up \nof all the peace loving nations. All the Members of the Organization \nshould adopt practical measures against Israel and punish it for the \ncrimes it has perpetrated and for its breach of international peace \nand security and should compel it to implement Security Council and \nGeneral Assembly resolutions concerning the inalienable rights of the \nPalestinian people to self  determination and to the establishment of \ntheir State on their soil and concerning an immediate withdrawal from \nLebanon and from every bit of occupied Arab territory. It should be \ncompelled to pay compensation for all the material losses it has \ncaused and the leaders of the new Fascist Zionist terrorism should be \nprosecuted for their inhuman unprecedented massacres, devoid of all \nhuman feelings. Israel has become the true and indisputable \nrepresentative of neo Nazism at its worst.\nIsrael thinks that if it destroys Lebanon it could put an end to the \nPalestinian presence and to the Lebanese national movement and get \nrid of the PLO, thus achieving the security and stability it seeks, \nthrough force and through starting wars from time to time and \ndevising ways to increase its aggression, expansion and colonial \nsettlement. This sick concept led Israel to wage wars against the \nArab countries, beginning in 1948, then again in 1956, in 1967, in \n1973 and finally in Lebanon in 1982. In each war Israel emerged with \na piece of land taken from a neighboring Arab country after having \nusurped all Palestinian soil bit by bit. But it has not achieved \nsecurity and stability in accordance with its military concept in \nspite of all that and will not achieve them; rather the contrary \nholds true Israel has been a continuous source of tension and \njeopardy to international peace and security since its inception. It \nis time now that Israel and its friends and allies, particularly in \nthe United States, should realize that security and peace in the area \ncan only be achieved through the recognition of the inalienable national \nrights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self \ndetermination and to the establishment of their own independent State \non their soil, under the leadership of their sole, legitimate \nrepresentative, the PLO. Without that peace and security will not be \nachieved, for Israeli concepts are based on an illusion founded on \nexpansion and aggression.\nIt is now imperative for the United States to consider its unjust \nbiased attitude in favor of Israel if it wants to make any positive \nand constructive contributions to the solution of the Palestinian \nquestion and the Middle East crisis. It should cooperate with the \ninternational community to compel Israel to implement General \nAssembly and Security Council resolutions in the interest of \ninternational peace and security, which have become jeopardized and \nare about to collapse as a result of the wanton acts and constant \ndefiance of the Organization, including the flouting of its \nresolutions, whether those concerning the return of Arab territories \noccupied after the 1967 aggression or those concerning the right of \nthe Palestinian people to return home and to establish their \nindependent State on their soil, Palestine.\nThose who advocate right, justice and peace are those who support the \nrights of the Palestinian people, which are inalienable and \nhistorical rights. Those who support Israel are aligning themselves, \nthrough such support, with the new Israeli fascism. It would be more \nappropriate to speak of peace in the Middle East if the efforts of \nall those who love peace were directed towards the adoption of \npractical measures to ensure the halting of Israeli arrogance and its \ncontinual flouting of international resolutions, and to compel Israel \nfinally to withdraw from all the Arab countries it occupied after the \naggression of 1967, as well as to halt the judaization measures being \ntaken in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, to recognize the PLO as \nthe sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, who \nhave been displaced, and to involve the PLO in all the efforts that \nare being made to maintain peace in this sensitive area of the world \nby peaceful means, since it is a main party to a conflict that has \nlasted too long. That conflict has resulted in many tragedies and \nmany victims, so many that it is now no longer a military and \npolitical conflict alone but a problem that is a daily torment to the \nliving conscience of mankind, which is agonizing over the massacres \nperpetrated by Israel against the Arab people of Palestine and \nLebanon.\nThe international community is today called on to impose deterrent \nsanctions against the war criminals and neo Nazis who now head the \nIsraeli State, and who have no hesitation, in using the most heinous \nmethods of destruction, and weapons which are prohibited \ninternationally, against the peoples of the area. We are facing a new \nsituation, which we must consider in order to draw the proper \nconclusion from it. Terrorism now has a State that protects it and \nexercises it, for the first time in contemporary history. Yet this \nState is a Member of the United Nations, while at the same time it \nrejects United Nations resolutions, and carries out acts of \naggression, murder and repression whenever and wherever it wishes.\nIt is easy to understand the effect this must have on the future of \npeace and security in the area, and even in the world at large. Even \nmore incomprehensible than all this is the insistence of the United \nStates of America on giving military and political encouragement to \nthat terrorism, continuing to support it in international forums, and \nstanding by it politically in its aggressive stances by the abuse of \nthe veto in the Security Council every time that the international \ncommunity tries to impose practical sanctions against Israeli \narrogance and evil practices that defy the reason and the \nimagination, particularly those hideous massacres of Palestinian \nwomen, children and old people in Beirut.\nThose who could have prevented the aggression and could have \ncompelled Israel to refrain from entering Beirut or the Palestinianrefugee \ncamps will stand before mankind as responsible for the inhuman and \ncriminal massacres in the camps of Sabra and Shatila. The United \nStates of America cannot escape its responsibility for those \ngenocidal crimes, committed in violation of the ethics and honor of \nmankind, because it undertook responsibility for the process of \nnegotiation and for the supervision of the evacuation of the \nPalestinian fighters from Beirut, providing all necessary political \nguarantees to protect those who remained behind. But it appears that \nthe credibility of United States policy and ethics completely \ncollapses whenever Israel is concerned. That fact should be noted by \neveryone.\nWe deeply deplore this situation, and we doubt the integrity of the \nrole played by the United States of America in the area, after the \nlast farce of American diplomacy in Beirut. We call on the \nOrganization to stand firmly against Israeli Nazism, which has today \nbecome the major challenge to all peace loving nations. We also \nbelieve that the international prosecution of all the criminals and \nmurderers responsible for the Beirut massacres is an essential \nrequirement for mankind, after the commission of such crimes amid the \nshocked silence of the international community, to ensure that no \nsuch hideous massacres are repeated by those in Israel who thirst for \nmore blood and would not hesitate to commit such murders again in the \nnear future. Those who were responsible yesterday for the massacres \nof Deir Yassin and Qafr Qasim are responsible today for the massacres \nand hideous murders in west Beirut. Unless the international \ncommunity hastens to shoulder its full responsibilities, inexorable \ntragedy will be inflicted on the Palestinian and Lebanese people, and \non the peoples of the whole area.\nMy country has more than once expressed its profound concern over the \nterrorism and piracy in the area, and the acts of oppression, \nrepression and torture that Israel is committing against the Arab \npopulation in the occupied territories, a population living under and \nunjust rule and inhuman laws while their territories are occupied and \nsettlements are being built on areas taken from the neighboring Arab \ncountries by coercion and aggression. My delegation calls on all \nnations and peoples firmly to denounce and condemn such Israeli acts \nbased on aggression, oppression and expansionism, and it calls for \nthe imposition of all possible stringent political and economic \nsanctions against Israel, to compel it to act in compliance with the \nwill of the international community, withdraw from the occupied \nterritories and restore to the Palestinian people their legitimate \nrights.\nWe attach great importance to the work of the current session. We \ncall on it to meet its responsibilities of working for peace, \nrekindling the hopes that have become dimmed and restoring confidence \nto all those who have become so disillusioned through seeing the \nrepeated acts of aggression carried out by the racist Pretoria \nregime, which is committing crimes of murder, torture and oppression \nagainst the majority of the people of South Africa, as well as \ncommitting with impunity repeated acts of aggression against the \npeople of Namibia and the peace loving front line States.\nThe present collaboration between the two racist entities in Tel Aviv \nand Pretoria has resulted in acts of murder, oppression, torture and \nApartheid surpassing anything known previously. In recent years those \ntwo entities have begun to exchange information on nuclear research \nand the production of nuclear weapons with a view to the imposition \nof terrorism and imperialism in the area.\nMy country firmly and unconditionally believes in and supports the \nliberation movements in the world, foremost among which are the PLO \nand the South West Africa People's Organization, and reaffirms that \nthe Namibian problem will never be solved and the occupation of \nNamibia can never be ended unless the Organization continues its \nefforts, upon which the people of Namibia pin all their hopes of \nfreedom and independence. We believe that the implementation of \nUnited Nations resolutions, particularly Security Council resolution \n435 (1978), represents the practical basis for solving that problem, \nwhich has been complicated and burdened with further ramifications as \na result of the defiance of South Africa and at its rejection of the \nUnited Nations resolutions designed to end its illegitimate \noccupation of Namibia.\nThe United Nations indeed the whole world has condemned South Africa \nfor its shameful racist policy which is exercised by force against \nthe black majority and for its inhuman torture, persecution and exile \nof the black people in South Africa. The Pretoria regime even boasts \nof committing these crimes and is competing with its permanent ally, \nthe Zionist regime, in finding new means of repression and \nhumiliation and establishing settlements.\nThe Namibian issue must emerge from its situation of stagnation, \nespecially since the United Nations devoted a special session of the \nGeneral Assembly to discussing the Namibian question in all its \naspects. It must not remain a source of tension and trouble in Africa \nand continue to threaten world peace and security. The world M living \ntoday in a state of economic imbalance. The rich of this world are \nbecoming increasingly rich and the poor increasingly poor. As a \nresult of this grave division, which rests on inequality, the gap is \nincreasing day by day and a sense of responsibility and enthusiasm in \nregard to setting of the new economic system based on justice and \nequality and building new world economic and monetary structures is \ntoday more urgent than ever before. But enthusiasm alone is not \nsufficient: it is necessary to crystallize the strong political will \nthat can redress the frightening imbalance and redistribute wealth \ninstead of confining it to certain Powers. We must constantly bear in \nmind the interest of all parties.\nThe emergence of negative phenomena in world economic life, such as \nthe increasing protectionist trend in the markets of the \nindustrialized countries, the fluctuations of the exchange rate and \nthe skyrocketing of interest rates on food commodities, consumer \ngoods and capital goods have led to the deterioration of world trade \nconditions and the enormous deficits in the balance of payments of \ndeveloping countries.\nThe increasing indebtedness of these countries year after year, added \nto the deterioration of the economic and social growth rate therein, \nresults in these developing countries alone paying the price and \nsacrificing their development in the interest of the rich, \nindustrialized countries. Hence, the General Assembly is called on to \ngive this subject increased attention and study in order to correct \nthe imbalance in international economic relations and to take action \nto achieve more progress in the negotiations concerning this \nquestion, having regard to its importance to the international \ncommunity in general and to the interests of developing countries in \nparticular.\nThe peoples of the third world cannot remain forever a source and \nexporter of raw materials and a market place for manufactured goods. \nIt is not in the interest of the international community these States \nremain in a condition of economic impotence, unable to cope with \ntheir financial obligations towards others. Consequently, it is \nnecessary to achieve constant development and progress in these \ncountries. But the modernization and development process is linked in \nits tum to science and technology and the method of the transfer of \nsuch science and technology to developing countries, with the help of \nthose who are more advanced in those areas, in order to promote their \nscientific capability and their administrative and technological know \nhow. That must be done if we really want to avoid more crises and \ndeterioration in the world economy,\nWe can all achieve prosperity and happiness for mankind at large if \nwe work with a common approach and if the developed countries pledge \nthemselves to a courageous monetary reform, to revise their present \neconomic policies and increase their development investments in the \ndeveloping countries in order to alleviatethe suffering and \ndeprivation of the people of those countries and restore some balance \nand harmony to the troubled world economy. There is no doubt but that \nthe promotion of the specialized world financial institutions in the \nUnited Nations system in the field of economic and social development \nconstitutes a direct contribution to the achievement of the well \nbeing of mankind. Mutual respect, non interference in the internal \naffairs of States and the settlement of disputes by peaceful means, \nthe freedom of each State to decide on its own its economic and \nsocial structures in accordance with its national and political \noptions constitute a sure guarantee of cooperation and peaceful and \nconstructive coexistence and represent the appropriate process for \npromoting the policy of international detente. The Arab Republic of \nYemen, which has founded its policy on respect for nation sovereignty \nand the exchange of interests and economic benefits with others in \naccordance with the principle of equality, rejects totally the policy \nof hegemony and military force in international relations, as it \nrejects also, absolutely, the principle of setting up military pacts, \nbases and facilities. It is greatly concerned over the emergence of \nsigns of tension and cold war between the Western and Eastern World \nand the pursuit of aggressive practices by some States and the \nnegative impact that this has on international relations, in addition \nto endangering the independence, sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of the States of the world to danger.\nSigns of deterioration in international relations have become more \ntangible today than ever before as a result of the use of military \nforce in solving international disputes and of interference in the \ninternal affairs of States and the persistence of the frightful arms \nrace, especially in the nuclear field. This constitutes a threat to \nmankind that could have the gravest results. Consequently, all States \nmust take the necessary measures to improve international relations, \npromote the policy of detente and peaceful coexistence, affirm \ninternational legitimacy and define means of making the concept of \ndisarmament a tangible fact ensuring security to the human community \nand happiness to mankind. The super Powers, the United States and the \nSoviet Union, must renew their Talks for limiting nuclear weapons and \nto eliminate all obstacles that are impeding the pursuit of these \nnegotiations. Complete disarmament and the cessation of the nuclear \narms race have become two vital prerequisites for all the peoples of \nthe world that are looking forward to the day when this feverish race \ntowards destructive arms will come to an end so that mankind may feel \nsecure about its existence and future so that the efforts and money \nwasted on the manufacture, purchase, and stockpiling of weapons can \nbe diverted to solving the crushing economic crisis from which many \npeoples of the world are suffering, and to meeting the material and \nspiritual needs of men. The second special session devoted to \ndisarmament was a golden opportunity to hear all the opinions and \nconcepts on which future negotiations should be based.\nFor us, peace is an essential and noble objective. We must exert \nmaximum efforts to promote peace everywhere in the world, for there \nis nothing more precious and more important to all the peoples than \npeace. But we feel disappointed and suffer when we see that hatred \nand war have replaced love and understanding among States and \npeoples. Peace has been shattered today in some parts of the world, \nsuch as the Arab Gulf, the Horn of Africa and the Falkland Islands. \nArbitration, mediation and peaceful and diplomatic solutions are much \nbetter than recourse to force, which in most cases leads to a dead \nend, perpetuates grudges between peoples and obstructs the process of \ncooperation and peaceful coexistence among nations.\nThe war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran has continued \nfor more than two years despite the ties of a common creed and \nproximity and despite the mediation efforts exerted by the non \naligned countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, as \nwell as by the United Nations. Now Iraq has responded to those \nmediation efforts and withdrawn its forces to its borders. It would \nthus have put an end to hostilities but for the pretexts invoked by \nIran to continue the war and to postpone the settlement if the \nconflict by negotiations and peaceful means between the two Moslem \nneighbor countries. We call on Iran to seize this opportunity and \nrespond to the peace proposals; to cease its aggression against the \nterritory of Iraq and not to abandon hope of a reconciliation with \nthat neighboring Moslem country.\nWe appeal to the Organization to redouble its efforts to bring those \ndestructive hostilities to an end and we call on the two conciliation \ncommittees, of the non aligned movement and the Islamic Conference, \nto continue to use their good offices to bring about an end to the \nwar and the restoration of rights, in order that peace may once again \nprevail in the lands of Iraq and Iran.\nMy country, which firmly believes in regional cooperation between \nneighboring countries, is also interested in the maintenance of \nsecurity and stability in the region. Therefore it views with \nprofound concern the continuing state of tension in the Horn of \nAfrica and calls for the solution of the border problems and of the \nhistorical and political problems between the nations of the area \nthrough negotiations and peaceful means, for the sake of the peoples \nof those countries and to prevent any foreign intervention in their \ninternal affairs under the pretext of providing aid and support to \none party or the other.\nMy country rejects any military presence or bases in the Indian Ocean \nor the Arab Gulf. It reaffirms that the security of the Gulf and the \nArab peninsula is the responsibility of the countries of the region \nand their peoples. It calls for support for the need to consider the \nIndian Ocean, the Arab Sea and the Red Sea areas that should be free \nfrom any fleets or military bases. We support the efforts made in the \nCommittee on the Indian Ocean and the necessity of convening the \nConference on the Indian Ocean during 1983, in accordance with \nGeneral Assembly resolution 36/90. We look forward to the day when \nsigns of tension will disappear one e and for all from, that \nsensitive part of the world. It is extremely dangerous to let the \nhotbeds of tension and conflict increase every day.\nAs regards Afghanistan, we reaffirm the right of the Afghan people to \nself determination, free from foreign intervention of any form and \nfrom any source. We believe that it is high time to find a peaceful \nsolution to that conflict, in accordance with the resolutions of the \nUnited Nations.\nOn Korea, we affirm the necessity of putting an end to the dispute \nbetween the two parts of the peninsula and of reaching a peaceful \nsolution of the problem, on a democratic basis, acceptable to both \nparties. An encouraging environment should be provided for Korean \nunity through the withdrawal of foreign forces from the area and the \nseas around it.\nAs regards the Cypriot conflict, it is the firm position of my \ncountry that there should be an agreed solution between the Greek \nCypriots and the Turkish Cypriots aimed at the reunification of the \nisland on a democratic basis which will ensure freedom of religion \nand expression and civil rights for all Cypriots. The Organization \nwould be fulfilling its responsibility for the preservation of peace \nand ending the anomalous situation in which the island finds itself \nnow by applying all the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly \nand the Security Council and considering them a basis for settling \nthe Cypriot conflict.\nOne of the positive achievements of which we are proud in the Yemen \nArab Republic is our success in keeping our country free from \ninternational polarization and the rivalry between the super Powers. \nMy country adheres firmly to the policy of non alignment and positive \nneutrality. We are proud of belonging to the Organization of the \nIslamic Conference and to the League of Arab States and we believe \nthat the continuing cooperation between the United Nations and those \norganizations will undoubtedly be a crucial factor in the \nimplementation of many social and economic plans and will contribute \nto the solution of many international political problems.\nWe also feel that all our endeavors should be aimed at developing our \ncountry and raising the standard of living of our people so that we \nmay keep pace with other countries of the world. This is the concern \nof our political leadership, under President Ali Abdulla Saleh, who \nconsiders the issue of reunifying the two parts of Yemen to be of \nextreme importance in its endeavors to achieve progress and dignity. \nThere have been many achievements socially, economically and \npolitically as regards reunifying the two parts of Yemen on a \ndemocratic basis. We have reached the stage of periodic meetings \nbetween the Presidents of the two parts of Yemen to consider \nprogrammes of integration and reunification at all levels.\nMy country has devoted all its efforts since the revolution to \nserious and pressing efforts to promote the welfare of Yemeni \ncitizens and provide a proper climate for the establishment of \ndemocracy, justice and political freedom, and on this basis to \ninitiate a process of setting constructive goals at a high level. My \ncountry is anxious to ensure the success of all plans beneficial to \nit. It has so far been able to fulfil the essential needs of all \ncitizens and to set up the major infrastructures, which we consider \nto be the cornerstone of production, despite the fact that the \nrevolution took place only a short time ago. We have the patience and \nfaith to continue our march and to work for reconstruction, \ndevelopment and fruitful cooperation with all countries of the world \non a basis of equality, good neighborliness, mutual respect and non \nintervention in the internal affairs of others, settling ail our \nconflicts peacefully, so that everyone can enjoy peace and security \nand we can help each other in an atmosphere of sincerity conducive to \nthe happiness of mankind as a whole.\nFinally, I wish to thank the President and express my appreciation \nand commendation of all his sincere efforts in the interest of \nachieving international peace, justice and freedom.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to extend, on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, \nwarm congratulations to Mr. Hollai on his well-deserved election as \nPresident of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. His \naccession to this high office is a tribute to his personal qualities \nand wide knowledge and experience of international affairs. I assure \nhim of my delegation's co-operation in the months ahead. I should \nalso like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Kittani on the \nwisdom and competence he displayed in guiding the debates of the \nthirty-sixth session, and to express our gratitude for his devoted \nservice to the work of the General Assembly. It is a pleasure for me \nto pay a tribute also to the Secretary-General, whose first year in \noffice has been particularly difficult. He has faced the challenges \nof his office with courage, realism and persistence. By his efforts \non behalf of world peace and the authority of the United Nations, Mr. \nPerez de Cuellar has shown himself to be worthy of the great \nresponsibility upon his shoulders.\n\n219. As the General Assembly takes stock once again of the world \nsituation, there can be little cause for satisfaction over the state \nof international\\\" affairs. Whether we consider the proliferation of \ndangerous regional conflicts or the inability of the United Nations \nto maintain peace and security through collective action, the outlook \nis not encouraging.\n\n220. In the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, southern Africa, \nAfghanistan and South-East Asia and in the recent Falkland (Malvinas) \nIslands dispute, the United Nations has not been able to fulfil its \nmost fundamental purposes of peace-making and peace-keeper. In many \ncases when people suffering from injustice, oppression and foreign \ndomination turn to the United Nations for redress, basing their hopes \non the provisions of the\n\n221. After nearly four decades of experience in using the Charter as \nthe legal standard governing inter-national relations, the wisdom and \nvalidity of its principles remain incontestable. However, its wide, \nglobal objectives continue to be subordinated to narrowly conceived \nnational interests. In our view, this is the cause of the current \nbreakdown in inter-national law and order. Unless Member States \naddress themselves seriously and sincerely to this dilemma, they \ncannot hope to achieve workable solutions to\n\n222.\tIn the Middle East Israel's denial of Palestinian rights is \nthe driving force behind its lawless and barbarous devastation of \nLebanon. International anarchy is nowhere so rampant as in this area, \nwhere Israel has shown that there are no limits to its con-tempt for \ninternational law and its callous inhumanity. Not content with \ndenying Palestinian rights, the Israelis are seeking to exterminate \nthe Palestinians themselves. In pursuit of their final solution to \nthe problem they have launched a criminal aggression against a \nsovereign State, and they have had no qualms about the destruction of \ncities through saturation bombing and the killing and maiming of \nthousands of civilians, including women and children, by the use of \nvicious phosphorous and anti-personnel cluster bombs.\n\n223.\tThe recent massacres in the Shatila and Sabra camps in west \nBeirut have confronted us with horrors similar to those of the \nholocaust of the Second World War. Israel cannot escape \nresponsibility for aiding  and abetting the perpetration of the \ncrimes against the defenceless civilians of those camp-rimes which \nhave been strongly condemned by the entire world community. Israel \nhas in the past claimed in inter-national forums that its actions \nstem from a special religious and moral authority. Are we now asked \nto believe that the wanton destruction of life and property in \nLebanon was carried out at the dictate of a just Creator, or that \ntragedies of the past which have no bearing on the Middle East \njustify Israel's expansionist greed and genocidal policies?\n\n224. My Government hopes that the General Assembly will be \nuncompromising in its condemnation of Israel for the carnage in \nLebanon and will also be vigilant in opposing any Israeli attempts at \nimposing new faits accomplis with regard to Lebanese territory. It \nmust demand Israel's 'immediate, complete and unconditional \nwithdrawal from Lebanon.\n\n225.\tThe General Assembly must also keep inter-national public \nopinion focused on Israel's arrogant annexations of Arab territories, \nincluding the Holy City of Jerusalem. It must be reaffirmed that the \nstatus of the city, which is sacred to Moslems and Christians as well \nas to Jews, cannot be unilaterally determined. The increased level of \npersecution in the West Bank and Gaza and the defiant escalation of \nthe illegal settlement policy must also continue to be strongly \ncondemned. .\n\n226.\tThe failure of the Security Council in the past to take \neffective measures against Israel for its violations of international \nlaw certainly encouraged the Israeli Government to believe that it \ncould flout any international convention, commit any act of \naggression or carry out any atrocity with impunity. It is more than \ntime for it to be disabused of this belief. Israel has undoubtedly \nbreached the peace of the Middle East and threatened world peace and \nsecurity. Its outright rejection of all proposals which could serve \nas a basis for negotiations shows that it has turned its back on \npeace and that it plans to continue with is expansionism at any cost. \nIn our view, if the Security Council is to maintain any credibility \nand authority in world affairs it must be prepared to take \nsignificant action, including the imposition of sanctions, in order \nto check Israel's dangerous and irresponsible course.\n\n227. The tragic conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of \nIran is another unfortunate reflection of our troubled times. My \nGovernment sincerely I hopes that the ongoing mediation efforts will \nsucceed in the difficult and sensitive task of bringing an end to \nthis conflict which has destabilized the Gulf area. Somalia adds its \nvoice to the appeals of other Member States for the immediate \ncessation of hostilities and the start of negotiations which would \nensure a return to peace and amity in the region.\n\n228. The problems of southern Africa have always involved the \nfundamental principles of the Charter and over the years have \nincreasingly threatened regional and international peace and \nsecurity. These problems remain acute in spite of the fact that the \nstruggle against South Africa's racist and colonial policies is in \nits final stages. .\n\n229.\tUnfortunately, the Pretoria regime is encouraged by the \ncontinued political, economic and military support of its main \ntrading partners to intensify its racist oppression in South Africa, \nto remain illegally in Namibia and to attempt to dominate the \nsouthern African region through military aggression, political \npressure and economic subversion. Clearly, the General Assembly must \nreiterate its call for unremitting efforts by the world community to \neliminate apartheid and to enable the United Nations to carry out its \nlegal responsibility for leading Namibia to independence.\n\n230.\tWithin South Africa the racist policies of the apartheid \nsystem are being applied with ever- increasing severity as the \nliberation struggle gains in effectiveness and strength. The \nlegitimacy of that struggle cannot be over-emphasized. In the long \nhistory of the uprising of peoples against tyrannical and colonial \nforms of oppression, revolutionary wars have been fought for much \nless pressing reasons than the degrading inhumanity of apartheid.\n\n231.\tThe liberation movements within and outside South Africa \ndeserve the strongest moral, material and political support for their \nefforts to regain the human dignity and fundamental right of the \nmajority of the population. As for South Africa's ruling minority, it \nshould be ostracized and isolated until it is prepared to take steps \nto establish a just society.\n\n232.\tIn the case of Namibia the salient factor is the illegality \nof South Africa's presence in the Territory, a status determined by \nthe International Court of Justice and Security Council resolution \n435 (1978), which remains the only valid basis for a settlement. It \nis now four years since South Africa began its machinations aimed at \nobstructing Namibia's independence. No longer can the international \ncommunity tolerate South Africa's bad faith, its oppressive \ndomination of the Namibian people and its brutal war against their \nliberation movement under the leadership of SWAPO.\n\n233. My Government sincerely hopes that the current optimism over the \nprospect of a Namibian settlement is justified. However, in view of \nSouth Africa's past performance we believe that the General Assembly \nmust not fail to remind the five Western States of their commitment \nto independence for Namibia as speedily as possible. In our view, \nthere will be little progress on Namibia or on other southern African \nissues unless South Africa is made to understand General \nAssembly-Thirty-seventh Session-Plenary Meetings that it will \ncertainly face comprehensive economic sanctions if it continues its \nintransigent, aggressive and inhuman policies.\n\n234. The growing use of brute force as an instrument of foreign \npolicy is disturbingly evident in the Soviet Union's continued \noccupation of Afghanistan, a small non-aligned State, and in its \nattempt to crush the resistance of the proud and courageous Afghan \npeople. The same super-Power which invokes in the United Nations the \ndoctrine of the non-use of force in international relations is \nresponsible for the loss of thousands of innocent lives at the hands \nof its invading forces, for the devastation of Afghanistan's economy \nand for the creation of one of the world's largest refugee \npopulations.\n235. The ruthless nature of this war is further illustrated by the \nuse of Afghanistan as a testing ground for forms of chemical warfare \nlong condemned as barbarous by the international community. The \nGeneral assembly must continue to keep the plight of Afghanistan \nbefore the attention of the world and to stand firmly by its \nresolutions and those of the Security Council which call for the \nunconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country.\n236. The presence of foreign troops in Democratic Kampuchea is \nanother example of the subversion of national independence through \nforeign domination. Here again military aggression and alien rule \nhave given rise to a tragic refugee situation and to chronic tension \nand conflict. My Government hopes that the efforts of the members of \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other States to ensure \nthe restoration of legitimacy and national independence in Democratic \nKampuchea will be successful and that the constructive proposals made \nat the recent International Conference on Kampuchea will be fruitful. \nA political settlement would undoubtedly have far-reaching effects on \nthe peace and stability of the whole South-East Asian region.\n237. Since the adoption of General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI) on \nthe Indian Ocean, serious obstacles have been placed in the way of \nimplementing the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace \nby Soviet military intervention in the affairs of the countries of \nthe region and in their local conflicts. Moreover, with the military \nand naval forces of the  Soviet Union firmly entrenched in bases \nprovided to it by certain regional States, there has been a steady \ndeterioration in the stability and security of the countries of the \nregion. These dangerous developments have set the stage for the \nescalation of super-Power confrontation and military rivalry in the \nIndian Ocean. It is, therefore, more important than ever for Member \nStates to reaffirm their commitment to the principles enshrined in \nresolution 2832 (XXVI) and to the provisions of the Final Document of \nthe Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean.\n238. In supporting these principles and provisions my delegation \nplaces particular emphasis on the dismantling of all foreign bases \nand the withdrawal of all foreign forces, including surrogate troops, \nfrom the regional and on the obligation of the regional States to \nsettle disputes with one another by peaceful means, on the basis of \nthe principles of the United Nations Charter.\n239. The Horn of Africa, my own area, continues to be affected by \ntension and conflict, not because of territorial or boundary \ndisputes, as Ethiopian propaganda would have the international \ncommunity believe, but because of the denial of the right to \nself-determination by the colonial regime of Ethiopia to its subject \npeoples of Western Somalia and of Eretria.. The importance of this \nright is emphasized in Chapter I, Article 2, of the Charter, which \ndirects the United-Nations to develop friendly relations among States \nbased on respect for the principle of equal rights and the right to \nself-determination of peoples.\n240. The grave regional and international repercussions of the denial \nof those rights continue to trouble the Horn of Africa. The exodus of \nthe hundreds of thousands who fled from persecutions and oppression \nto take refuge in Somalia and other neighbouring countries involved \ngreat human suffering, placed intolerable burdens on host countries \nand continues today to be a disaster situation calling for \nhumanitarian assistance from the international community.\n241. My Government's overriding concern in its approach to the \nproblems of Ethiopian colonialism is that the peoples of Western \nSomalia and Eritrea be allowed to exercise the rights guaranteed \nunder General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV). \nCertainly, if the European colonial Powers had opposed the freedom \nstruggle in Africa with the same arguments which Ethiopia continues \nto advance today to explain its continued occupation of Western \nSomalia, very few colonial peoples would have been able to take \nadvantage of the provisions of resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV).\n242. It is important for the world community to understand that until \nthe 1890s when the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik joined the European \nPowers in their scramble for Africa, the people of Western Somalia \nenjoyed an independent existence and controlled their own affairs. It \nwas in the course of MeneJik's presumptuous attempt to extend the \nEthiopian Empire from Khartoum to Lake Nyanza that the Ogaden was \nbrutally seized.\n243. Unfortunately, it served the interests of the colonial Powers to \nsupport Menelik's territorial ambitions, and in typical imperialist \nfashion illegal treaties purporting to transfer Somali territory to \nthe Ethiopian Empire were concluded-without the knowledge of the \npeople of Western Somalia. It was particularly ironic that the \nsupposed authority for transferring Somali territory was the series \nof treaties between the colonial Powers and Somali chiefs which \nguaranteed that the Somali people would be protected by those same \nPowers and that their territory would not be ceded to any other Power.\n244. It should be noted that Ethiopia was unable to exercise \nsovereignty over an area which was clearly outside its normal \npolitical, cultural and ethnic influence until after the Second World \nWar, and in some instances as recently as 1955. During the Halo \nAbyssinian war of 1935-1936 Western Somalia was occupied by Italy. \nShortly afterwards the British conquered former Italian Somaliland \nand Western Somalia\nand, together with Somali territories already under British \ncolonialism, virtually all of Somaliland was united under a single \ncolonial Power. In \\\"1942 Britain restored Ethiopian sovereignty in \nEthiopia proper which it had captured from Italy during the war, but \nit retained the administration of Western Somalia. Unfortunately, the \ninhabitants of the territory were once again betrayed by the British \nGovernment and transferred against their will to Ethiopian rule in \n1948 and 1955.\n245.\tI take the liberty of recounting these historical facts not \nonly to refresh the memory of representatives present in the Assembly \nbut also to underscore the fact that the Territory of Western Somalia \nis no different from other Territories which have since the Second \nWorld War benefited from the process of decolonization in recognition \nof the universal principle of the right of peoples to \nself-determination and national independence, as enshrined in the \nCharter. It is the denial ofthat right by the Empire State of \nEthiopia which is at the root of the conflict in the Horn of Africa.\n\n246.\tAs I have already stated, Ethiopian colonial repression has \ngenerated refugees numbering millions. In Somalia alone there are \n700,000 persons in camps and a similar number are living among the \npopulation all over the country. Unless the problem of Western \nSomalia is resolved on the basis of the exercise of \nself-determination by the people of Western Somalia, the refugees \nwill not be able to return to their homes in safety and honour, and \nthere is every likelihood that their presence in Somalia and other \ncountries of the Horn of Africa besides constituting a grave danger \nfor the peace and security of the region will also take on a \npermanent character necessitating continued relief aid and assistance \nby the international community. The dangerous situation already \nexisting in the Horn of Africa, owing to colonialist Ethiopia's \npolicies of repression and genocide at its denial of the right to \nself-determination to the people of Western Somalia-and, indeed, to \nthe other subject peoples within the Empire State of Ethiopia such as \nEritrea, Oromia and Tigray-has been further aggravated by that \ncountry's wanton invasion of the territory of the Somali Democratic \nRepublic since 1 July of this year.\n\n247. As representatives are no doubt aware, my Government has \naddressed several communications to States Members of the United \nNations regarding this invasion and has given details of the nature \nand extent of the unprovoked aggression, in which tanks and armoured \npersonnel carriers, long-range artillery and fighter bombers, \nsupplied to Ethiopia in massive quantities by a super-Power have been \ndeployed. Heavily armed Ethiopian infantry brigades. supported by \nforeign forces, have managed to cross the de facto border-at one \npoint as deep as 32 kilometers in an effort to cut the important \narterial road which links the southern and northern parts of the \nSomali Democratic Republic in order to disrupt a major lifeline of \nour country. The town of Galdogob and the village of Blambal1e have \nbeen captured and Galcayo, the regional capital of Mudug, has been \nsubjected to several aerial attacks by MIG-23s.\n\n248. Somalia has opposed this invasion of its sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity in conformity with its right to self-defence \nunder Article 51 of the Charter and has so far repelled further \nincursions into its territory. Unfortunately, both sides have \nstuttered heavy casualties and considerable damage has been caused to \nproperty in those areas of my country which have been attacked.\n\n249. Ethiopia has attempted to spread the fiction that its forces are \nnot responsible for this naked act of aggression against Somali \nterritory. However, the recorded statements of deserters and \nprisoners, along with captured documents in Russian and Amharic, \nsubstantiate beyond any shadow of doubt that it is the Ethiopian army \nwhich has undertaken the large-scale aggression mounted against my \ncountry.\n\n250. The use of T-55 tanks, MIG-23s, armoured personnel carriers and \nheavy artillery, much of them new and complete with Soviet operation \nmanuals dated 1982 and bearing Ethiopian military insignia is \nindisputable evidence  of Ethiopia's direct responsibility for its \ninvasion.\n\n251. It is ironic that the major Ethiopian air base at Gode in \noccupied Ogaden. from which Ethiopian planes make their murderous \nattacks on the Somali population, is the same airport which the \nEthiopian regime requested the United Nations, through a report of \nthe Secretary-General of 12 September 1980,8 to finance and \nreconstruct, supposedly as a centre for humanitarian missions in the \narea.\n\n252. The international community has strongly condemned Ethiopia for \nits invasion of my country -its shameless denials notwithstanding. By \nway of example, the 69th Inter-Parliamentary Conference. which was \nheld in Rome in September. strongly condemned Ethiopia's invasion and \ncalled for, among other things, the immediate, total and \nunconditional withdrawal of all foreign forces from the territoryof \nthe Somali Democratic Republic Similarly, the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference held at Fez in September, also strongly condemned Ethiopia \nfor its invasion and called for the strict observance of Somalia's \nsovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n253. The Somali people are united in their determination to stand \nfirm against Ethiopian aggression, and the Somali armed forces will \ncontinue to repel the attacks against our country. However, it is not \nmy Government's wish that the Horn of Africa should become a \npermanent trouble spot threatening regional and international peace \nand security. Colonialist Ethiopia must therefore be forced by the \ninternational community to evacuate its forces from Somali territory \nand to desist from committing further aggression against our soil. \nFor our part we remain ready to co-operate in the search for \neffective political solutions to the problems of the area. What is \ncertain is that these problems will not be solved by oppressive \nmeasures and premeditated aggression. Peace and stability can be \nachieved only if historical wrongs are redressed and legitimate \nnational aspirations are recognized and respected.\n\n254. My Government is deeply disappointed by the failure of the \nsecond special session on disarmament to draw up a comprehensive \nprogramme of disarmament. We deplore also the continued spiralling of \nthe arms race in nuclear weapons, the setback to negotiations for a \ntest-ban treaty and the stalemate on the establishment of a \nconvention prohibiting the use of chemical weapons.\n\n\n255.\tIt is clear therefore that there must be redoubled efforts on \nthe part of the nuclear Powers and militarily significant States to \ntranslate the goals of the tenth special session into practical terms.\n\n256.\tBold new initiatives and higher levels of statesmanship will \nbe required if the nuclear Powers are to break out of the vicious \ncircle of mutual suspicion in which they are caught and if they are \nto remove the threat of nuclear annihilation that hangs over the \nworld. In this regard the start of talks between the United States \nand the Soviet Union on the reduction of strategic weapons and the \nhigh level of public interest and involvement in disarmament issues \nare grounds for some optimism.\n\n257. It has been repeated so often that the nuclear-arms race and the \nsearch for new weapons of mass destruction endanger mankind's \nsurvival, that this very real threat is unfortunately in danger of \nlosing its persuasive power to bring about progress towards nuclear \ndisarmament. One pressing reality which cannot be denied or ignored \nis that the astronomical sums spent each year on nuclear and \nsophisticated conventional weapons fuel world inflation and obstruct \nthe establishment of amore just international economic order.\n\n258. World inflation of course affects all States but its effects on \ndeveloping countries have been particularly cruel. Where in developed \ncountries inflation means the curtailment of luxuries, in the least \ndeveloped it often t leans deprivation of the necessities of life. \nFor the (\u00efeast developed, many of which, like Somalia, suffer from \nnatural and man-made disasters, the enormous debt problems caused by \ninflation, the worsened conditions of trade and the drop in \ndevelopment assistance have been catastrophic.\n\n259. It is no doubt true that, except in the case of a few relatively \nprosperous developed countries, the development goals to which the \nUnited Nations membership is committed have never been so far from \nachievement as at the present time, when we have already entered the \nThird United Nations Development Decade.\n\n260. My Government joins in calling on the developed countries to \nco-operate in the launching of global negotiations-an initiative \nwhich could give new impetus to the implementing of established \ndevelopment goals. The steadily increasing gap between rich and poor \ncountries cannot be in the interest of peace with progress. We hope \nit win be understood that the economic arrangement of the past cannot \njustly serve the needs of an interdependent world, that the peace and \nstability so desperately need\\ d today go hand in hand with economic \ngrowth and, finality that it will be for the benefit of all if the \npoorer countries are helped to develop their resources to the point \nwhere they in turn can contribute to a prosperous world economy.\n\n261. In conclusion 1 should like to observe that, while there is \nundoubted cause for deep concern over the inability of the United \nNations to solve inter-national political problems, it is important \nthat the blame for this situation be ascribed not to the Organization \nand the Charter but to those who treat the obligations of membership \nwith indifference, neglect or contempt and who are prepared to \nsu1pport the world body only when its decisions conform to their \ninterest. As the Secretary-General points out in his report, in the \ncontext of the peaceful settlement of disputes, we site lack a \nbinding sense of international community believe, however, that a \nsense of inter-national community has developed through the \nwide-ranging achievements of the United Nations in social, economic \nand humanitarian fields.\n\n262.\tAs the agenda shows, the responsibilities under-taken by the \ninternational community under the aegis of the United Nations range \nfrom the sea-bed to outer space. The nexus of relationships and \nresponsibilities established in less political fields will not easily \nbe broken. In the last resort the United Nations remains an \nunparalleled centre for international diplomacy and mankind's best \nhope for peace.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to begin by extending sincere congratulations to you, \nSir, on your election to the presidency of this session of the \nGeneral Assembly. I feel certain that the experience and knowledge \nyou have acquired in the course of a brilliant career will enable you \nto guide the proceedings of the Assembly with all the skill required \nin these troubled times. I should also like to express our sincere \ngratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Kittani, who deserves our praise \nfor the dedication and skill with which he carried out his duties \nover the past year, which was a particularly challenging time for the \nUnited Nations. This is the first opportunity I have had publicly to \ncongratulate Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his appointment as Secretary \nGeneral. In his first year in office he has made an impressive \nbeginning which gives encouragement and hope that during his tenure \nthe United Nations will make greater strides towards the full \nattainment of its purposes and objectives. The current session of the \nGeneral Assembly is being held against the background of an alarming \ndeterioration of the international situation, characterized by global \nconfrontation, military intervention, foreign occupation, a spiraling \nof the arms race, and the frequent resort to the use or threat of the \nuse of force against the sovereignty, political independence and \nterritorial integrity of States all of this in the midst of a deep \nglobal economic recession. A review of the agenda for this the thirty \nseventh session of the General Assembly points to a growing number of \nitems dealing with unresolved crises, and an alarming increase in the \noutbreaks of fresh hostilities. It is not without ironic significance \nthat it is precisely the smaller, underdeveloped and economically \nmore vulnerable countries of the third world, currently being \nbuffeted by the effects of global economic recession, which art At \nthe same time the focal points of tension and conflict, particularly \nin the Middle East, southern Africa, Asia, as well as Latin America \nand the Caribbean. For the most part these conflicts have been \nintensified and made worse by the intrusion of super Power \nconfrontation, and as a consequence of flagrant disregard the \nprinciples of the Charter and the by passing of the United Nations as \nthe proper forum within which to seek a peaceful settlement of \ndisputes. Recent events in the Middle East, culminating in the \nabominable massacre in the Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut, have \nshattered some long held illusions. But the military prowess of the \nIsraelis has not destroyed the basic fact. That basic fact is that no \nlasting peace and stability is possible unless the fundamental right \nof the Palestinian people to statehood is satisfied. Jamaica holds \nfirmly to that view. Equally, we believe that all States in the area \nare entitled to exist within their internationally recognized \nboundaries. We note that important initiatives have been taken by the \nTwelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez, and by the President of the \nUnited States, Ronald Reagan, to try to give a new impetus for a \nsettlement of the Middle East problems. It is clear that there are \nmany obstacles ahead, but it is noteworthy that there is now at least \na common factor, and that common factor is a recognition that the \nPalestinian people have rights which have to be satisfied. Jamaica \nrecognizes that the forthcoming United Nations Conference on \nPalestine could have an important bearing on the settlement of the \nproblems of the region. The Conference output to be substantially \nmore than an exchange of views. It should try to make specific and \nrealistic recommendations which would be helpful in the peace making \nprocess. In fact, we are tempted to suggest that the issues with \nwhich it is dealing and the international climate are such that the \nConference ought to be held earlier. It is clear that the \ncircumstances which gave rise to the need for a conference, and the \nassumptions on which its convening was based, have been largely \novertaken by events. Its importance and its usefulness, therefore, \nwill depend upon itsability to seize the propitious signs. The United \nNations must not cease in its efforts to find a formula for cessation \nof hostilities in various parts of the world. We wish to draw \nparticular attention to the war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic \nof Iran which has been going on for two years now and which has \nalready taken thousands of lives, and left thousands more wounded, \nand we join in the pleas to both parties to end the conflict. \nSimilarly the pivotal roles of the non aligned movement and the OAU \nin the anti colonial struggle and in the quest for peace, detente and \ndisarmament must continue. The events in the Middle East and other \nareas demonstrate the failure to enable the peace keeping mechanisms \nof the United Nations to function as intended. They also underscore \nthe need for more systematic and imaginative use of the Security \nCouncil to monitor areas of potentially dangerous conflict. Over the \nyears the practice of the permanent members has inexorably expanded \nthe range of their interest and has brought so many minor areas of \ntension under the umbrella of their perceived interest that the \ncollective security system has broken down. It has to be noted that \ntoo often the permanent members of the Security Council resort to use \nof the veto with scant regard for the overall interests of the \ninternational community, and in disregard of their own obligation to \nmaintain international peace and security. The institutional marriage \nof the nineteenth century concept of the Concert of Europe with the \nconcept of collective security implicit in the Security Council, has \nnot worked in the interests of the international community. Something \nhas to be done to remedy this situation; I congratulate the Secretary \nGeneral on his departure from recent practice by presenting to the \nmembers of the Assembly a brief, easily read, and challenging \ninvitation that they should pause and consider the state of the \nOrganization and decide to do something about its shortcomings. The \nSecretary General's report on the work of the Organization [/37/V] is \na direct challenge of the most profound kind addressed to every \nmember of this body. To the Security Council as a whole, it is a \nchallenge to recognize how far we have departed in practice from \nstandards which were contemplated and set for us by its founders. The \nreport is equally a challenge to every Member. State to think again \nabout the readiness with which we have been prepared to accept that \nthe whole United Nations must remain flouted, ignored and powerless, \nif the Security Council, whose main responsibility is the \npreservation of international peace and security, is unable to act. \nJamaica maintains that the entire United Nations collective security \nsystem should not remain hamstrung and powerless because the Security \nCouncil is deadlocked. In the name of my Government, I renew \nJamaica's commitment to the provisions of the Charter. Jamaica \nendorses the suggestion that a workable system of collective security \nshould be reintroduced. We solemnly commit ourselves to the search \nfor such a process and to the effective implementation of any useful \nmeasures which may be found so as to restore to the Security Council \nan effective capacity to discharge its responsibility for the \nmaintenance of peace. We urge that a meeting of the Council should be \ncalled before the end of this session of the Assembly, which should \nbe attended at the very highest levels, and which will deal with the \neffectiveness of the Security Council in discharging its \nresponsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity. We further urge that the General Assembly should assign the \nsubject of the Secretary General's report on the work of the \nOrganization to a Main Committee at this session, in which the Member \nStates would actively consider the implication of the Secretary \nGeneral's report, and the action they might take when the Security \nCouncil is unable to act. Another subject of urgent concern is that \nof Namibia. The movement towards independence for Namibia continues \nto be slow, notwithstanding the hints from the contact group that \nprogress has been made. South Africa continues to block effective \naction. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) must be fully \nimplemented. Jamaica does not share the view that the independence of \nNamibia should be linked to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from \nAngola. The two are separate issues and must be dealt with \nseparately. We condemn South Africa's continued military aggression \nand campaigns of destabilization against Angola and the other front \nline States. In South Africa Itself, the policy of continues to be \nmore deeply entrenched every day. All the internal institutional \nchanges point in the direction of a further entrenchment of this \nabhorrent system. Yet we are told that sanctions are inappropriate in \nthis case, while there are exhortations to apply them elsewhere; \nalleged forced labour is decried elsewhere, while the brutal \ntreatment of the entire black population of South Africa is glossed \nover or excused. The criteria used to assess the problems of black \npeople are always different, and a failure to apply the same \nstandards is always clothed in specious excuses and sophistry. We \ncannot allow this degrading situation to continue. Jamaica deeply \nregrets that the recent second special session of the General \nAssembly devoted to disarmament failed to achieve any significant \nresults, particularly as regards a comprehensive programme of \ndisarmament. This is a major disappointment. The world community had \nexpected much from this special session, particularly at a time when \nmany States are embarking on dangerous rearmament programmes which \nthey mistakenly believe will enhance their security. They must be \nmade to realize that this absurd and perilous escalation of the arms \nrace in both the nuclear and the conventional field consumes valuable \nresources which could more profitably be spent on economic and social \ndevelopment, particularly in developing countries, to correct the \nneglected problems which are the root cause of the struggles in the \nvarious regions. It is estimated that some $500 billion are being \nspent annually on armaments, whereas at the same time, according to \nthe statistics compiled by the Organization, 450 million people \nsuffer from hunger or malnutrition; there is an annual infant \nmortality rate of 12 million babies who die before their first \nbirthday; 42 million people are blind, or nearly so; 2 billion people \ndo not have water that is safe to drink; 250 million people live in \nurban slums or shanty towns; 870 million adults cannot read or write; \n500 million people have no jobs or are less than fully employed; and \n130 million children are unable to attend primary schools. These \nstatistics frighten us. This is the nature of some of the global \nsocial problems and these are what we want addressed when we say that \nmoney now spent on armaments could be better used for development. \nJamaica hopes that Member States will now take increasing account of \nthe concern manifested by the masses of people for effective \ndisarmament measures, and that this will encourage a renewed \ncommitment to general and complete disarmament. The World Disarmament \nCampaign which was approved by the special session, will certainly \ncontribute to that end. Furthermore, the pledge by two nuclear weapon \nStates on the non first use of nuclear weapons is also a welcome step \nin the right direction, and Jamaica hopes that the remaining nuclear \nweapon States will make similar commitments in this regard. In the \nmidst of all these problems, we cannot ignore that singularly \nimportant achievement of the United Nations, the adoption of the \nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on 30 April 1982. \nJamaica is among the developing and developed countries that welcome \nthis event. The Convention has codified and progressively developed \ninternational law in several important areas, but I cite the \nfollowing as its most significant achievements. First, the \nproclamation that the area beyond national jurisdiction is the common \nheritage of mankind is a significant landmark in the history of \ninternational relations. We believe that the regime which it \nestablishes for the exploration and exploitation of the natural \nresources of the deep sea bed is just and equitable, and will operate \nto the mutual advantage of developed and developing countries. \nSecondly, the Convention has solved the age old question of the \nbreadth of the territorial sea by the establishment of an economic \nzone of 200 miles, including a territorial sea of 12 miles. It is the \nfirm view of my Government that the Convention contains a body of \nrules on the rights and duties of States which is the law that \ngoverns the uses of the sea. A major achievement of the Conference \nwhich we wish to highlight is the exemplary use in its proceedings of \nthe device of consensus as a system of decision making. It is indeed \nremarkable and commendable that in a Conference in which as many as \n150 countries participated and which extended over eight years, the \nnegotiations were almost entirely conducted and concluded without a \nvote being taken. Jamaica has a great sense of pride at having been \nselected as the site of the International Sea Bed Authority, of the \nPreparatory Commission for the International Sea Bed Authority and \nfor the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, and of the \nceremony for the signing of the Convention from 6 to 10 December \n1982. I want to assure you that Jamaica is sensitive to the \nobligations which go with the conferment of those honours. As you are \naware, the Preparatory Commission comes into being on the signing of \nthe Convention by 50 States and will commence its work within 90 days \nthereafter. It is obviously essential that, consistent with the \nprogramme and objectives of the Preparatory Commission, adequate \nprovision be made for its effective functioning. That is a \nrecommendation of the Group of 77 which we fully endorse. We exhort \nall States to sign and ratify the Convention as quickly as possible \nso that it will enter into force in the shortest possible time. An \nearly entry into force of the Convention can only operate to the \nadvantage of all countries, developed and developing, particularly \nwhere it deals with the regime for the exploration and exploitation \nof the deep seabed. We would not wish anyone to be left in doubt as \nto our view that activities in the international seabed area can take \nplace lawfully only within the framework established by the \nConvention on the Law of the Sea. We hope that no country or group of \ncountries will engage in actions or adopt measures whose effect will \nbe to undermine the Convention. We are not only beset by political \nturbulence and insecurity; we are confronted once again with a dismal \npicture of the world economic situation. The indicators are \ndiscouraging. They demonstrate the further entrenchment of world \nrecession and stagnation. In 1981 the international economy recorded \na growth of only 1.2 per cent, that is, one third of the rate \nachieved in the recession prone decade of the 1970s. For the \ndeveloping countries, growth in 1981 was 0.6 per cent, representing a \nfall in per capita gross domestic product, which was a novel \nexperience in the developing world in the post independence period. \nMy own region, Latin America and the Caribbean traditionally an area \nof relatively high growth, has been severely affected. Gross national \nproduct in the region actually declined by 0.4 per cent and per \ncapita gross national product declined by 2.7 per cent. World trade, \nitself a powerful determinant of the pace of economic growth, also \npresents a grim picture. Last year, for the first time in nearly two \ndecades, world trade showed virtually no growth, after a minimal \ngrowth of 1.5 per cent in 1980. The situation is compounded by the \nalarming decline of 22.5 per cent in the prices of primary \ncommodities between January 1981 and June of this year. Developing \ncountries, notwithstanding the decline in their earnings as a result \nof this, are constrained to increase their imports in order to \nprovide the basic necessities for their populations. The downturn in \nglobal economic activity, as evidenced in the growth and trade \nindicators, has caused a worsening in the debt situation and the \nprospects for many developing countries. For 1981 the total external \ndebt for capital importing developing countries was in the area of \n$500 billion, an almost threefold increase since the latter half of \nthe 1970s. The gravity of the debt situation is revealed by a \ncomparison of certain features in international financing between the \nbeginning of the 1970s and the present. During that period, the \naverage debt service ratio of the oil importing developing countries \nincreased from 8 per cent to 19 per cent. Average maturities on loans \ncontracted by developing countries fell from 20 to 12.7 years, and \nthe interest burden on developing countries, measured in relation to \ntheir gross national product, increased four times. This brief \nanalysis of the global economy is intended to highlight the need for \nimmediate action if we are to avert the collapse of the international \nsystem. We are all agreed on the necessity to achieve a rate of \neconomic growth consistent with the aspirations of our peoples and \nthe requirements for achieving international peace and security. In \nseeking to fulfil those objectives, we must make a special appeal to \nthe developed countries to desist from the application of \nprotectionist trade policies. The experience of the 1930s has shown \nthat measures by developed countries to protect sectors in their \neconomies that have lost their competitive edge in the international \nmarketplace are self defeating. They serve only to contract \ninternational purchasing power and to generate unemployment in their \nown economies as well as in the economies of the developing world \nthat provide markets for their exports. Jamaica is firm in the view \nthat the marketplace and work place of the developing world hold the \nbest solution for reflation without inflation. The unsatisfied and \ngrowing demands of the consumer market and the unsatisfied and \ngrowing capabilities of the work forces of a growing number of \ndeveloping countries need only the catalyst of expanded credit \nresources to fuel an expansion of trade through export  led growth. \nJamaica commends for the consideration of the Assembly the essential \nfeatures of our Prime Minister's presentation on this subject at the \njoint World Bank and International Monetary Fund meeting in Toronto \nin September. There Jamaica emphasized the urgency of introducing \nemergency measures which would be immediately implemented to assist \nthose member countries which are on the brink of collapse and \nreinvigorate international trade and investment. Jamaica considers \nthat the Fund's Eighth general Review of Quotas provides a good \nopportunity to create credit as a means of trade expansion. \nAccordingly we support the early conclusion of the review of quotas \nin 1983 as called for by both the Intergovernmental Group of 24 on \nInternational Monetary Affairs and the Interim Committee of the Board \nof Governors on the International Monetary System. We fully support \nalso the need for selective allocations and a substantial increase of \nquotas\u00f3an increase which in our view should not be less than 50 per \ncent. Jamaica is of the view that increased liquidity for trade \nexpansion could also be accomplished by the expansion of trade \ncredits, utilizing excess liquidity in the commercial banking system \naccumulated through the increased savings resulting from current anti \ninflationary strategies. As practice has developed, these savings are \nlikely to be available only for short  term financing. The concern of \ncommercial banks about current levels of credit exposure to \ndeveloping countries indicates that an intermediary to trigger a \nmeaningful flow of these under utilized resources may be necessary. \nOne such intermediary mechanism already exists in the Bank's lending \nprogramme, through an export development fund for export trade \ncredit. With appropriate modifications this mechanism could fulfil \nthe purpose of a ready and available instrument to mobilize ready and \navailable resources to be utilized by ready and available productive \ncapacities, to expand trade, growth and employment on a basis \nconsistent with the objectives of the adjustment process. The \nfinancial dislocations brought about by the global energy situation \ncontinue to inhibit the search fbr economic stability within the oil \nimporting developing countries. The development of non conventional \nsources of energy must therefore remain a priority. Jamaica looks \nforward to the report on the progress made by the Interim Committee \non New and Renewable Sources of Energy on the implementation of the \nNairobi Programme of Action fbr the Development of New and Renewable \nSources of Energy. Jamaica is concerned that the effectiveness of the \nWorld Bank in the development process could be eroded, as evidenced \nin the obstacles being placed in the way of establishing an energy \naffiliate to support an expanded programme for energy investment. I \nhave focused on a few of the elements inhibiting the economic growth \nof developing countries and hence of the global economy. It should \nnow be obvious to all that the issues are so closely interrelated as \nto necessitate a coherent and integrated approach to deal with them. \nNo one should at this stage find it useful to argue in favour of \nseparating the concerns of the North from those of the South. The \ncrisis in the international economy and the measure of collective \nfears are reflected in the concerns which all countries, including \nthose with surpluses, have regarding the world wide balance of \npayments situation. The concern of the Assembly must, however, go \nbeyond simple accounting indices. We must be aware of the \nimplications of such indices for the quality of life of those we have \nthe honour to represent. The global economic recession's net effect \non them is increasing unemployment brought about by the weakening in \nthe world demand for goods and services. High levels of unemployment \nnow threaten the social and political order in both the North and the \nSouth. In the developing world, unemployment levels of up to 30 per \ncent are not unusual. Vast sectors of young and courageous \npopulations have never had the chance to secure gainful employment. \nThe employed live daily under the threat of loss of jobs because of \nthe decline in the prices of primary products, because of \nbankruptcies and closure of factories and other productive \noperations. These are brought about by the effects of economic \nrecession transmitted through the network of international economic \nlinkages. We have throughout the years debated priorities from the \nperspectives of the North and the South and accommodation of what we \nhave perceived as our just aspirations. I submit that we must now \nface up to the global priority. We must bring to bear our \nintellectual capacity and our political authority to halt the global \neconomic recession and correspondingly to induce growth and \ndevelopment internationally. This calls fbr all of us, rich and poor, \nto recognize the basic reality of the 1980s, and that basic reality \nis the force of global interdependence. A few years ago the concept \nof interdependence was the basis fbr interesting but largely semantic \ndebates. Today interdependence is an inescapable reality. The \nproposed global round of negotiations, which has been under \nconsideration for the past three years, must now be recognized as \noffering the best prospect of bringing about the changes required to \nestablish an economic system which can fulfil the aspirations of our \ntime. Jamaica hopes that the sense of realism which has been shown by \nthe developing countries on this issue will be reciprocated by the \nNorth in order to facilitate the commencement of global negotiations \nin early 1983. The establishment of the necessary framework must be \nconcluded by this thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. Our \nobligations to each other derive from our interdependence. We simply \ncannot live without one another. The recognition of that fact must \nconstantly mould our actions so as to bring about a peaceful, just \nand prosperous world. That is Jamaica's objective.\n"

        "file_text": " My delegation is pleased and gratified to see you presiding over the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly, especially since my country is linked to yours by bonds of close friendship. In the name of my delegation, I extend to you our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the Assembly. We are confident that your experience and wisdom will contribute to the successful outcome of this session, which is held in extremely delicate and complex international circumstances, and will enable it to arrive at conclusions that will she international peace and security. I cannot fail to pay a tribute to the efforts and the competence of your predecessor, Mr. Ismat Kittani, in guiding the proceedings of the last session and of the special and emergency special sessions held under his presidency. I take this opportunity also to express my appreciation \nof the role played by the Secretary-General in consolidating the purposes and principles of the Charter.\n30.\tThe current session is being held against a background of extremely grave international developments. International imperialism, led by the United States of America, has escalated its efforts to perpetuate its hegemony and increase its influence by harnessing its political, economic and communications capabilities to serve its aggressive policy, reinforcing its military bases, establishing rapid deployment forces, expanding its military machine and military capability, establishing alliances and military and political blocs, subverting secure and stable States in order to undermine their progressive regimes and their national liberation movements, creating hotbeds of tension and sowing seeds of dissension and division among Member States.\n31.\tLebanon has recently suffered the full force of the imperialist-Zionist conspiracy against the Palestinian Arab people and the Lebanese national movement aimed at the definitive elimination of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, led by the PLO, its sole legitimate representative. The aim of that conspiracy is to alter conditions in Lebanon to bring them into line with the Camp David agreement, which is unilateral in character, and to impose capitulation and dependence on the whole of the Arab area. The American Government has provided Zionism with all the military and political capability to persist in a policy of expansion and aggression.\n32.\tIsrael has occupied Lebanon, violating its independence and territorial integrity. It has unleashed a war of unprecedented barbarism against the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples in violation of all international instruments and the purposes and principles of the United Nations. At the height of its brutal action Israel did not hesitate to use the deadliest weapons, including internationally prohibited weapons, against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples. In the middle of last month Israel carried out a massacre that claimed the lives of defenseless Palestinian refugees  the elderly, children and women in an attempt to displace the Palestinian people and halt its revolutionary march. But the steadfastness and valor shown in Beirut and the struggle of the Palestinian freedom fighters proved incontestably that the Palestinian people, led by the PLO, will not be dissuaded by massacres, terrorism or coercion from persisting in demanding its right to return to its homeland, to self- determination and to establish its own independent national State.\n33.\tWhile the direct aim of Israel's aggressive war is the liquidation of Palestinian resistance and of the Lebanese national movement, the Zionist dream of expansion in Lebanon and of usurping its waters are in essence the aims declared by the leaders of international Zionism, as well as the leaders of Israel, a long time ago. Furthermore, the recent Israeli invasion of Lebanon is but a further link in the chain of Zionist aggression and terrorism.\n34.\tIsrael has usurped the entire land of Palestine and annexed the whole of the Golan Heights and the City of Jerusalem. It is also establishing settlements and colonies in the occupied land and practicing oppression and racial discrimination of all kinds\nagainst the Palestinian people; it is confiscating its territory and its water, and trying to displace it and to change its identity and culture and the historical features of its land.\n35.\tIsrael would not have been able to invade Lebanon, wage a war of annihilation against the Lebanese and the Palestinian peoples, or occupy an Arab capital that is, Beirut without the support and unlimited encouragement which it has received ever since its inception from the imperialist States. By virtue of American military, political and economic support, in particular, Israel has been able to wage repeated wars against the Arab countries, usurp Palestine, occupy the West Bank and Gaza and annex the Golan Heights and Jerusalem. There is amazing irony in the fact that the American Government plays the role of mediator for the maintenance of peace in the Middle East while it does not hesitate to provide Israel with all possible sophisticated military devices.\n36.\tThe United States is the only State that has used the right of veto in the Security Council against draft resolutions aimed at stopping aggression and bringing about Israeli withdrawal. It concluded a strategic alliance with the State of terrorism and aggression. It sides with the aggressor and protects it in its expansionist greed. Is there still any doubt about American collusion with Israel, as well as about cooperation between Washington and Tel Aviv, and coordination of their efforts, against the Arab peoples?\n37.\tPartial and unilateral solutions have proved to be sterile and a failure. Peace is indivisible. Justice is not confined to one people, to the exclusion of all others. The Palestinian question is at the heart of the conflict in the Middle East. A just, comprehensive and permanent peace is possible only with complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories, including Jerusalem, as well as the realization of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people. Those rights include its right to return to its homeland, to have self-determination, and to establish its national, independent State on its own soil, under the leadership of the PLO, its sole legitimate representative.\n38.\tThe international community has condemned Israel, which it regards as a State that is not peace- loving and respects neither the principles nor the Charter of the United Nations. It is high time to impose sanctions against it, in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter or, better yet, to expel it from the United Nations.\n39.\tAs it celebrates the fifteenth anniversary of its independence, which it won after a long, bitter struggle, Democratic Yemen can say that from its modest experience it has learned self-reliance, in co-operation with all peace-loving and justice-loving nations. We are working under the Yemeni Socialist Party to establish a new society that guarantees proper living conditions for our people and raises its material and spiritual standards. In our attempt to achieve that we have encountered certain obstacles. In the past two years we have suffered unprecedented torrential rains and floods which have harmed our overall development plans. Agricultural lands were ravaged, dams, roads and houses were destroyed, and thousands of citizens were displaced. However, we have every reason to face\nthe future with confidence. I should like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to all those States and international organizations that provided our country with help to overcome the harmfiil effects of the rains and floods.\n40.\tTogether with our brethren in the northern part of our homeland, we are seeking to create favorable conditions for the peaceful and democratic reunification of the Yemeni people and territory. Positive steps have been taken towards the co-ordination of these efforts.\n41.\tMy country has opted for the policy of non- alignment. It is opposed to imperialism, colonialism and Zionism. It supports efforts to consolidate peace and stability in the world, as well as the struggle of the peoples that aspire to freedom, justice and social progress. Its policy towards its neighbors is founded on good-neighborliness, respect for national sovereignty and non-intervention in their internal affairs, as well as peaceful coexistence between the various social systems.\n42.\tBecause of the neighborly and historic links between us and the countries of the Horn of Africa, we have a stake in the maintenance of peace and security in that area. We seek to establish the best possible relations between the countries of the area, for the common good, in order that they may use their potential for the well-being and prosperity of their peoples. We are taking all necessary steps for the common good of the area, in conformity with the Charter of the Organization of Africa Unity [OAU].\n43.\tWe follow with concern the war that is raging between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran, a war that does not serve the interests of the people of either country, since it drains their resources. Moreover, it prejudices peace and security in the area. The war has led to an increase of the imperialist military presence in the Arabian Sea and the Arabian Gulf. We look forward tr an end to the hostilities between the two countries, so that they may direct their resources to the best interests of their people, as well as the security of the area.\n44.\tAs a littoral State of the Indian Ocean, my country wishes to express its concern about the dangers to which the area of the Indian Ocean has been subjected. The American Government is reinforcing and expanding its military bases, especially in Diego Garcia. It sends aggressive fleets and conducts provocative maneuvers in the Arabian Sea, the Arabian Gulf and the Red Sea. All these actions jeopardize the peace and security of the States of the area. The intention is to prejudice their independence and international peace and security and to return the world to a policy of cold war.\n45.\tWe reaffirm the need to make the region of the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. I also emphasize the importance of holding the Conference on the Indian Ocean in the first part of next year.\n46.\tBecause of the importance we attach to peace in our area, a question that is vital to the progress and growth of our peoples, our President, Ali Nasser Mohammed, initiated a proposal in January in 1981 to open the Conference to participants from the Gulf States, the Arab Peninsula and the Horn of Africa to\n \nconsider, in the presence of the other interested parties, the complete elimination from that area of all foreign military bases. We also support the Soviet proposals to make the Arab Gulf and the Indian Ocean into an area free from any foreign military presence as well as foreign bases.\n47.\tWe must express our concern and disappointment over the failure of the second special session of the Assembly devoted to disarmament to achieve a comprehensive program of disarmament, as a result of the obstacles placed in its way by the United States Government and its allies. We appreciate the constructive proposal put forward by the socialist countries and first and foremost by the Soviet Union aimed at achieving disarmament and maintaining the policy of detente, and creating an atmosphere of peaceful coexistence leading to world peace, with due regard for all the interests of all the peoples. We call for an end to the procrastination of the imperialist Powers in their desire not to enter into serious negotiations for disarmament, their insistence on increasing their military expenditure in the arms race, particularly on nuclear weapons, and their attempts to negotiate from a position of power so as to achieve military superiority.\n48.\tWe insist that the United States and its allies demonstrate the political will necessary to achieve the goals of disarmament, to lessen international tension, to end their resistance to multilateral negotiations on disarmament and to prohibit all nuclear tests and the production, stockpiling, deployment and use of neutron nuclear weapons and rescind the refusal to give guarantees to non-nuclear States that they will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against those States.\n49.\tWe also call for the necessary steps to be taken to prevent the United States Government from persisting in its efforts to produce harmful chemical weapons, and call on it to work towards a comprehensive treaty on the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new weapons of mass destruction, and to halt the arms race in outer space. We consider it essential that an international conference on disarmament, with the participation of all nations, be held as soon as possible.\n50.\tThe escalation of the arms race and the military buildup is consuming much of the vast resources needed by mankind and obstructing economic and social development efforts in the developing countries. Disarmament should be designed to promote economic development for all nations, particularly for the developing countries, and the establishment of a new international economic order, so that the impoverished millions of the world can overcome the problems of hunger, malnutrition, illiteracy and disease.\n51.\tMany areas of Asia, Africa and Latin America remain the subject of imperialist threats and intervention, and suffer from the remnants of imperialism and every form of persecution, oppression and racial discrimination. Democratic Yemen condemns the policy of apartheid, detention, torture and assassination carried out by the racial regime in South Africa against those in the indigenous population of South\nAfrica who resist racial discrimination, as well as against the liberation movements.\n52.\tMy country also condemns the way in which the United States and other Western countries are violating the arms embargo against the racist regime in Pretoria, and it condemns the nuclear collaboration between the two racist regimes in Pretoria and Tel Aviv. We call for the imposition of comprehensive sanctions against the racist regime in Pretoria, including that of an oil embargo.\n53.\tWe reaffirm our support for the struggle of the people of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO, its sole legitimate representative, to bring about the full independence of Namibia. We also call for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We oppose all imperialist and racialist attempts to obstruct the independence of Namibia by linking it to the withdrawal of the Cuban troops from Angola, because that is a matter of arrangements between two independent States, Angola and Cuba, arrangements that are governed by their bilateral relations in that respect. We also condemn all the aggressive and provocative acts committed by the racist regime in South Africa against the front-line States of Africa, and especially against Angola and Mozambique. We likewise condemn the attack by mercenaries against Seychelles.\n54.\tMy country confirms its support for the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic in its efforts to achieve stability and to consolidate its sovereignty in Western Sahara. It also supports the efforts of the three countries of Indo-China, Viet Nam, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Kampuchea, and the positive proposals made to eliminate the causes of tension and enable the peoples of South-East Asia to settle their differences in such a way as to guarantee the stability of the area.\n55.\tMy country also supports the efforts of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and its proposals for establishing security and stability in South-West Asia without any intervention in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. We support direct negotiations between Afghanistan and its neighbors to put an end to the current hostilities.\n56.\tWe confirm that it s important to respect the independence and sovereignty of Cyprus, together with its territorial integrity and its non-aligned status, as well as to ensure the withdrawal of foreign troops from Cypriot territory.\n57.\tWe demand the withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea and support the proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of Korea. We see in its proposal a proper and reasonable approach to the reunification of that country.\n58.\tDemocratic Yemen condemns the policy of aggression and intervention, as well as the imperialist and colonial pressures used by the United States Government against the peoples of Cuba, Nicaragua and Grenada, in an attempt to destabilize those States. We also condemn the oppressive United States practices against the peoples of El Salvador, Puerto Rico and other countries of that area. We underline our support for Argentina in its efforts to exercise its\nsovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, in accordance with the resolutions of the non-aligned movement and the principles of the United Nations.\n59.\tAt the basis of the political situation of which we are speaking is the worsening international economic crisis, which in fact affects most of the developing countries, especially the least developed. That crisis is the result of inequitable international relations and the fact that certain hegemonistic countries want to maintain their narrow, selfish interests.\n60.\tDespite certain limited positive steps here and there, there is a stalemate in the international negotiations aimed at establishing the new international economic order. Despite the flexible position of the developing countries represented in the Group of 77, global negotiations have not yet been launched and have not been able to remove the old traditions which need radical change. All the indications are and they are supported by facts and figures that the standard of living in most of the developing countries is deteriorating. That exposes these developing countries to increasing economic problems, which hamper the implementation of their plans for economic and social development. Moreover, their foreign indebtedness is constantly increasing and the export earnings of the countries involved are decreasing as a result of inflation factors and adverse foreign trade terms.\n61.\tThus, these countries find themselves in a vicious circle in which they are subjected to more backwardness and dependence, while the capitalistic developed countries see only their own interests and those of their transnational corporations, and create obstacles and set forth restrictions, both of form and of substance, to proposals designed to resolve this intractable issue. We must stress the necessity of developing a genuine' political will for change. Serious and responsible stands must be taken on these issues, in order to provide the proper climate to launch global negotiations without delay.\n62.\tWith the potential and capabilities which all the developing countries have, they can overcome the many obstacles placed in their path by the capitalistic countries. They can do this by exercising collective self-reliance and increasing their economic and technical co-operation; in this regard I am thinking especially of the least developed countries. But this requires a practical consecration of their resolutions, as well as concrete programs both for the short and the long term.\n63.\tThe grave deterioration in international relations calls for action to strengthen the role of the United Nations in promoting international peace and security. We welcome the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization, which advocates the strengthening of United Nations organs, especially the Security Council, which must shoulder its responsibility under the Charter. At the same time, we wish to stress the important role the United Nations must play in finding solutions to the problems facing the world. In that way the hopes placed by our peoples in the Organization could be strengthened. To that end, we assure the Assembly that our country will spare no effort in co-operating with all States that sincerely desire international peace and security to be maintained. \n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is a pleasure, Sir, to see you on the podium \nconducting the affairs of the thirty-seventh \nsession, whose agenda includes the most important \nissues, issues directly related to the security, \npeace, stability and future of mankind; We have \ngreat confidence that your vast knowledge and \nexperience, and the active role played by your \nfriendly country in international relations, wi!! \nhelp us, and you, realize our expecta\u00actions of \nthis session. In the name of the Amir, the\nGovernment and the people of Kuwait, please \naccept our congratulations on your election.\n166.\tThe thirty-sixth session was fortunate in \nhaving been presided over by a colleague who is \ndear to you and to us, Mr. Ismat Kittani; he \nplayed a distinguished role and one deserving of \nour appreciation and our gratitude.\n167.\tSince this is the first time I have \naddressed the general  Assembly since the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar \ntook office, I take this opportunity to say again \nthat my country welcomes his accession to that \nhigh position; we wish him good luck and all \nsuccess.\n168.\tFurthermore, I must not let this \nopportunity pass without expressing to the former \nSecretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our thanks \nand appre\u00acciation for his constructive and \ndedicated efforts to help establish world \nsecurity and stability during his term of office. \nWe extend to him, too, our best wishes in the \ncoming years.\n169.\tThe world situation has entered on a new \nera of complication and confusion, which have \nleft their mark on the noble values that mankind \nhas accepted as its constitution, values such as \nthose of sovereignty, independence, justice, \nnon-interference in internal affairs, peaceful \ncoexistence among nations, and the elimination of \nthe pains and evils inherent in blocs and in \ncompeting selfish interests.\n170.\tThe political rivalry between the two \ncompeting camps has led to dialogue and being \nreplaced by confrontation and estrangement, and \nthus has put an end to what was left of the \npolicy of detente, with its favorable impact on \ninternational relations.\n171.\tThe increasing complications of \ninternational relations and conflicts among \nvarious interests have increasingly involved \nsmaller nations in the spheres of influence of \nthe super-Powers, to an extent that actually \njeopardizes even the unity, solidarity and \neffectiveness of the regional organizations which \nhave been playing an important role in furthering \nthe secu\u00acrity and prosperity of the countries and \npeoples of the respective regions.\n172.\tThe confusion arising from the ambiguity \nof the international situation has had an obvious \nimpact on the ability and effectiveness of the \nUnited Nations and its various organs, \nparticularly the Security Council. In his report \non the work of the Organiza\u00action, the \nSecretary-General was honest with him, and \naccurately described a fact which can no longer \nbe denied when he talked candidly about the \nweakening of the effectiveness and credibility of \nthe United Nations as an instrument for achieving \npeace and preventing war. We realize that the \nUnited Nations has, unfortunately, not been able, \nexcept in a few rare occasions, to act \neffectively to maintain peace in the world. \nInstead, we note that it has become a stage which \nthe competing Powers use flagrantly as an \ninstrument for defending their own interests by \nevery possible means, to the extent that the \nSecurity Council has been unable to fulfil its \nprimary responsibility\u2014not because of remoteness \nfrom the scene of events or any reluctance to \nexert efforts, but because of the abuse by some \nof its members of their right of veto.\nThose members, upon whose shoulders rests a \nspecial responsibility for maintaining \ninternational peace and security, have in \naddition used their power in the Council to \nprevent any collective measures from being \nadopted by the international community whenever \nsuch measures would affect any part of their \nspheres of influence.\n173.\tThere is now a very wide gap between \ncom\u00acmitment to the principles and provisions of \nthe Charter and the actual behavior of nations in \ntheir inter\u00acnational relations. Resorting to the \nforce of arms and military supremacy as \ninstruments to solve problems rather than on the \nforce of truth, justice and interna\u00actional values \nhas impaired the prestige of the United Nations, \nwhich once embodied the hopes of mankind in a \nsociety where security, prosperity, justice and \nbrotherhood prevailed.\n174.\tThe State of Kuwait believes that this \ndangerous situation makes it imperative urgently \nto consider responsible and serious action by all \nthe members of the international community to \nrekindle the commit\u00acment to the principles of the \nOrganization.\n175.\tSince the beginning of this year the \nGeneral Assembly has had to convene several \nspecial sessions to discuss the dangerous \ndevelopments relating to the question of \nPalestine and the situation in the Middle East. \nThe Security Council has also met several times \nduring the same period for the same purpose. \nThose two bodies have adopted resolutions, under \nthe pro\u00acvisions of the Charter, to deal with the \nflagrant aggres\u00acsion perpetrated by Israel \nagainst an independent and sovereign Member \nState\u2014Lebanon\u2014and against the displaced \nPalestinian people. That people's loss of its \nland and legitimate rights and its dispersal and \nthe suffering inflicted upon it for more than 35 \nyears have been caused primarily by the creation \nof Israel itself.\n176.\tAs recorded by all the Western news \nmedia, Israel's actions in Lebanon were more \nbrutal and inhuman than anything ever witnessed \nby the world before\u2014a human holocaust which did \nnot discriminate between men, women and children, \nthe total destruc\u00action of everything on the land, \nunder the pretext of security safeguards, a \npretext universally acknowl\u00acedged to be \nfallacious.\n177.\tWe wonder what would be the fate of the \nworld if all nations tried to solve their \nsecurity problems in this manner.\n178.\tThe horrible massacre which shocked \nevery\u00acone's conscience throughout the world has \nonce again confirmed the dimensions of the blind \nfanaticism and the racist Zionist hatred of the \nIsraeli regime directed against the defenseless, \ninnocent people in the Palestinian camps, which \nhad been evacuated by the Palestinian fighters \nwhen they left west Beirut under guarantees from \nthe United States of America \u2014which is precisely \nwhy that country bears a moral as well as a legal \nresponsibility for what happened there.\n179.\tHence the international community is \ncalled upon to do more than express condemnation \nor shed tears, because evil forces do net react \nto moral prin\u00acciples or human feelings. It is \ntherefore necessary to restrain them by means \nthat are not beyond the capabilities of the \ninternational community. As usual, Israel has not \nrespected any agreements, pledges or charters. \nIts behavior is not governed by any values or \nprinciples. This is clearly shown by the extent \nof its disregard for United Nations \nresolutions\u2014which is precisely what has led us to \ncall upon Member States, after all that has \nhappened, to suspend Israel's membership of the \nUnited Nations as a first step as well as a \ndeterrent to force it to obey the will of the \ninternational community.\n180.\tThe Arab land, the cradle of divine \nrevelations which participated in bringing the \nprinciples of peace, justice and brotherhood to \nthe peoples of the world, is victim today to the \nZionist arrogance of power, with all its American \narms of destruction\u2014an arro\u00acgance of power that \nhas caused such frustration among the people of \nPalestine and the other peoples of the region \nthat the resultant explosion threatens tc add a \nnew element to the present conflict of power and \narms, with the emergence of bitter anger and \nmutual hatred.\n181.\tWhile drawing the attention of the \ninternational community to this dangerous abyss \ntowards which our region is heading and which \nreminds us of the tragic human conflicts of the \nages, we appeal to it firmly to resist this \nimminent danger. It is possible to disarm the \nhand, but difficult to defuse hatred in the heart.\n182.\tAfter what happened in Lebanon, Kuwait is \nconvinced that the independence, security, \nterritorial integrity and safety of the brotherly \npeople of that country cannot be a subject for \ndebate. It follows that the necessary measures \nmust be taken to compel Israel to abide by \nSecurity Council resolutions 308 (1982) and 509 \n(1982) calling for its immediate and \nunconditional withdrawal from Lebanese territory.\n183.\tThe Palestinian people, under the \nleadership of the PLO, have emerged from the \nlatest tragic events much stronger and more \nunited and cohesive. Through its conduct \npolitically in negotiations and militarily on the \nbattlefield, the PLO has proved that it is the \nlegitimate spokesman of the Palestinian people \nand that it is deeply committed to international \nresponsi\u00acbility and its role in the preservation \nof peace and security in the Middle East.\n184.\tIt has become obvious from a whole series \nof Israeli violations, such as the annexation of \nJerusalem and the Syrian Golan Heights to the \nraid on the Iraqi nuclear installation and the \nbarbaric invasion of Lebanon, that Israel's \nultimate intention is to achieve one particular \nobjective which it does not even bother to \nconceal\u2014namely, the establishment of Greater \nIsrael\u2014and its strategy to achieve that objective \nhas become crystal clear\u2014namely, to use the \nflimsy pretext of security as a means of \nachieving ' its expansionist designs.\n185.\tIn their constant search for a peaceful, \njust and honorable solution to the Palestinian \nquestion, the Arab countries were able to \nmanifest once again, at the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference, held in Fez, the Arab nation's \ncapability of living up to the situation by \nadopting a series of general principles as an \naccepted basis for a peaceful and durable \nsolution to the Palestinian question which would \nsafeguard the legitimate rights of the people of \nPalestine. Elements of the proposed settlement \nwere inspired by the Arab countries' sense of \ninternational and historical responsibility and \nthe principles and bases of interna\u00actional \ncharters, as well as of United Nations \nreso-lutions, such as the inadmissibility of the \nacquisition of territories by force, the right of \nall peoples to full self-determination, free of \nany narrow or biased interpretation, the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes and the Security Council's \nresponsibility for maintaining international \npeace and security.\n186.\tThe unanimity shown by Arab heads of \nState in adopting the principles of the Fez \nConference offers the international community a \nunique opportunity to move ahead on the road to a \nnew era based on this initiative, which is \nrightly considered an important turning point \nwhose meaning should not be lost on anyone and \nwhich expresses the genuine and firm desire of \nthe Arab countries to end the conflict and \npreserve peace in the area.\n187.\tIt was not surprising to see that Israel \nrejected those Arab principles, for that \nrejection reflects the Israeli strategy in the \nMiddle East\u2014a strategy based on the consolidation \nof the\tand the impo\u00acsition of new on the \ninternational community.\n188.\tIn our view, the international community \nmust consider those Arab principles as the \ngreatest oppor-tunity ever offered to settle the \nMiddle East crisis and the Palestine question on \na concrete and realistic basis.\n189.\tIt is the view of Kuwait that the United \nStates, in particular, should seriously consider \nthis Arab ini-tiative, should understand its \nmeaning and should respond to it positively so \nthat it will become an accepted fact which will \nestablish truth, security and justice in a region \nwhere the clouds of injustice and aggression have \nbeen and still are looming. On the other hand, \nthe group of European countries which had for a \nlong time sought to participate in any \ncon\u00acstructive approach to settling this thorny \nissue should seriously consider those principles \nand should not let the dream of peace in the \nMiddle East be dashed by the misleading and \ndeceptive policy of Israel. It is within our \nreach to hold on to the ray of hope\u2014to preserve \nit and strengthen it so that it will eventually \nturn into an impregnable bulwark protecting the \nrights of the just and preserving peace.\n190.\tI should now like to refer to what I said at \nthe 18th meeting of the thirty-sixth session \nabout the establishment of the Gulf Co-operation \nCouncil, which has now become a fact and which \nhas proved to be the right and successful \ninstrument for developing co\u00acoperation among \nmember States, improving their rela\u00actions, and \nachieving co-ordination, integration and \ninterdependence among their peoples in all \nfields, thereby serving their mutual interests \nand strength\u00acening their capability of \nparticipating in the preserva\u00action of peace and \nsecurity in that vital area of the world. It has \nalso stressed another important fact: namely, \nthat security and stability in the Arabian Gulf \narea are the responsibility of its peoples and \ncountries, which reject foreign interference from \nany source and under any pretext and that the \nmember States alone have the right to defend \ntheir security and maintain their independence. \nThe Council has also emerged in the field of Arab \nrelations as a tributary of Arab unity and \nsolidarity.\n191.\tKuwait views with great concern the \nongoing war between two Moslem neighbors, Iraq \nand Iran, which has exhausted, over a period of \nmore than two years, the great potential of their \nhuman and economic resources and has exposed the \narea more than ever before to the possibility of \nintervention by foreign Powers attempting to \nimpost their hege\u00acmony and their influence and to \ninternational areas and internal affairs.\n192.\tKuwait commends the positive initiative \nof fraternal Iraq concerning the withdrawal of \nits forces to the international borders and the \ncessation of hostilities. It views this as an \nhonest and genuine contribution on the part of \nIraq to put a quick end to the war. We are still \nhopeful that neighbouring Moslem Iran will soon \nfollow Iraq's example in this respect.\n193.\tKuwait fully appreciates all the honest \nefforts exerted by all parties concerned to find \nan honorable and just solution to the dispute\u2014one \nwhich would safeguard the rights and dignity of \nboth parties. But in spite of the fact that those \nefforts have, unfor\u00actunately, not been successful \nso far, we still believe in the necessity of \ncontinuing them and even inten\u00acsifying them. We \nalso hope that the supreme interest of \nmaintaining peace and security in the area will \nprevail over all other considerations. We are \ncon\u00acvinced that the immediate cessation of \nhostilities would create the right climate for \nthe solution of all problems, in accordance, \nabove all, with the spirit and ideals of Islamic \nbrotherhood and with interna\u00actional law.\n194.\tThe situation on our Asian continent is \nstill replete with explosive crises that threaten \nour peace and security. Foreign troops are still \non Afghan soil, and all the efforts exerted by \nthe United Nations to reach a peaceful and just \nsolution to that crisis on the basis of the \nvarious resolutions adopted by the As\u00acsembly are \nfoundering. While we appreciate the \npar\u00acticipation of the parties to the dispute in \nthe meeting recently held at Geneva under the \naegis of the United Nations, we call for an \nintensification of efforts at subsequent meetings \nin order to arrive at a solution that will \nsafeguard the rights of the people of Afghanistan \nto self-determination and to establish the \npolitical system they deem suitable, free from \nany foreign intervention. We also affirm the \nright of the Afghan refugees to return to their \nhomeland. Kuwait is con\u00acvinced that none of these \ngoals can be secured without the withdrawal of \nforeign troops from Afghanistan and \nnon-intervention in its internal affairs.\n195.\tWe regret the failure of the efforts made \nso far to convene an international conference to \ndiscuss the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a \nZone of Peace. Kuwait has been stressing the need \nto convene such a conference because of its \nconviction that the peace and security of the \nIndian Ocean and the withdrawal of foreign bases \nfrom that area are vital and closely linked to \ninternational peace and security. Kuwait also \nreit\u00acerates its advocacy of the declaration of \nthe Middle East as a nuclear-weapon-free zone in \norder to enable the countries of that region to concentrate \non solving their development problems and \ncarrying out their economic development \nprogrammes.\n196.\tLike the Middle East, the African \ncontinent continues to be an arena of strife and \nconflict that threaten its political stability \nand impede its economic progress. The Middle East \nis plagued by an aggressive and racist Zionist \nregime, while the African continent is plagued by \na similar racist regime that is still being \nimposed on the people of South Africa and Namibia \ndespite all the international attempts to find a \njust and honorable solution to their problems.\n197.\tKuwait reiterates its support for and \nsolidarity with the people of Namibia in their \njust struggle and with the black majority in \nSouth Africa as it struggles against the policies \nof discrimination and apartheid being pursued by \nthe white minority in that country . We salute \nand support the front-line States and SWAPO for \ntheir political perseverance in attempting to \nfind a peaceful settlement to the problem of \nNamibia. We also condemn the perverted methods \nused by the racist regime in South Africa in its \nattempts to obstruct a peaceful settlement to \nthat problem. Kuwait would also urge the Western \nnations to exert the utmost pressure on South \nAfrica in order to force it to respond positively \nto international efforts to achieve a \ncomprehensive and just settlement to the \nsituation in southern Africa.\n198.\tKuwait is also watching the development \nof the situation in Eritrea and hopes that a just \nsolution that will guarantee that the people of \nEritrea attain their national aspirations can be \nfound.\n199.\tIn a few months the Seventh Conference of \nHeads of State or Government of Non-Aligned \nCoun\u00actries will convene in the Indian capital. \nThe movement non-aligned is still? 20 years after \nits creation, facing tremendous challenges; it \nrequires from its members an increased adherence \nto its principles and ideology. By taking the \ninitiative of not acting as host to the Seventh \nConference, Iraq has proved its earnest desire to \nmaintain the unity and effectiveness of the \nmovement. Kuwait believes that States members of \nthe movement should avoid being drawn into the \nconflict between the great Powers, which seek to \npolarize those States towards one camp or the \nother. Kuwait also feels a special interest in \nthe forthcoming Conference in India and hopes \nthat its results will reflect the aspirations of \nthe third world.\n200.\tWe cannot fail to note the sense of \ndisillusion\u00acment felt by the international \ncommunity at the failure of the second special \nsession on disarmament. The continuing \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruc\u00action, the \ncontinued conducting of nuclear tests and the \ncontinued stockpiling of huge quantities of \nweapons has exposed the lack of political will on \nthe part of the Powers involved to create a \nfavorable climate for disarmament.\n201.\tKuwait believes that the economic \nproblems facing today's world are for the most \npart caused by the tremendous costs of the arms \nrace. We therefore call upon the United Nations \nto refuse to allow itself to be impeded by the \ntemporary set-back of the failure of the second \nspecial session and to continue its attempts to \nachieve the cherished aspirations and dreams of \nmankind.\n202.\tThrough its long experience in \ncontributing to the development of third-world \ncountries, Kuwait realizes that the achievement \nof development in the developing countries is \nprimarily the responsibility of those countries. \nThat responsibility, however, does not release \nthe advanced countries from their commitments to \nthe developing nations and, conse\u00acquently, a \nformula should be worked out to co-ordinate, \nfollow up and implement the activities of \neconomic co-operation among the developing \nnations them\u00acselves, on the one hand, and between \nthem and the developed and advanced nations on \nthe other. While Kuwait fully appreciates the \nefforts that were made during the past year to \nlaunch global negotiations to achieve economic \nco-operation, it expresses its disap\u00acpointment at \nthe many obstacles being placed in the way of \nsuch negotiations by the developed nations, which \ncontinue to look upon this vital matter from the \nviewpoint of their selfish interests.\n203.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on \nthe Law of the Sea made important specific \nprogress when it adopted the draft Convention \nwhich the Conference had been debating for more \nthan 10 years. Kuwait, aware of its international \nresponsibility, appeals to all nations which have \nnot yet approved this Con\u00acvention to join the \nrest of the international community in its common \nconception of the organization and utilization of \nall the important and vital aspects of the \nConvention in the best interests and for the \nprosperity of mankind. Kuwait hopes that this \nCon\u00acvention will be ratified as soon as possible.\n204.\tThe delegation of Kuwait, while sharing \nthe concern of the international community over \nthe current international political and economic \nsituation, is convinced that it is imperative to \ncontinue the dialogue and intensify the bilateral \nand multilateral contacts among all nations. This \nconcern for interna\u00actional peace and security, as \nexpressed by all Mem\u00acber States, makes us fully \nconfident that, given honest intentions and \nexplicit goals, it will be possible to realize \nour hopes in the establishment of co-operation \namong peoples and to avoid the evils of wars and \ndisputes. Progress and prosperity will thus come \ncloser and be more significant.\n"

        "file_text": "I quote from the Holy Koran: \\\"We verily sent our messengers with \nclear proofs and revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance \nthat mankind may observe equality and justice.\\\" I wish to extend by \ncongratulations to yon, Sir, on your election as President of the \nthirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your abilities and \nmerit, as well as your experience in various international fields \nwill no doubt contribute greatly to the solution of important \ndifficulties and problems with which the General Assembly is faced at \nthe present session. I wish success to you and to representatives \nattending this session-although there exist many signs that can \ncreate doubts about the success of this session of the Assembly, \nbecause in our tormented world-in which at any moment the \ndisappointing news of the aggressive, expansionist spirit, the \nviolation of rights, oppression and tyranny may be heard from \neverywhere-there remains little room for hope for this session's \nsuccess.\nThe outlook for the days ahead and for the international situation is \nbleak. World tensions are increasing and the arms race, despite the \nrepetition of slogans, is mounting rapidly. Basic and fundamental \nprinciples of the Charter are openly being trampled, having been \ndisregarded by certain aggressive and expansionist countries. Poverty \nand starvation prevail in the oppressed third world countries while \nthe deepening gap between rich and poor countries is widening and the \noppressive and unjust relations between the countries providing raw \nmaterials and the industrial world are each day worsening. Six \nhundred million people in the world are suffering from hunger and \nfamine, and each year millions of people die of various diseases.\nIn such conditions, the arms race, which is extended to the other \ncountries of the world by the super-Powers, has destructive effects \non the developing and backward countries, which are the main victims \nof the prevalence of terror in the world; it thus brings those \ncountries to the brink of disaster and annihilation, and leads to the \nrapid depletion of their natural and human resources. Consequently, \nsuch countries, instead of remedying the deprivation of their \nenslaved masses and providing for their physical and mental welfare, \nhave put all their wealth and resources at the disposal of the \navarice and ambitions of the super-Powers.\nWhat is more important is that, apart from material and economic \npoverty, our world today is suffering from cultural poverty, which is \nfar more regrettable than the other difficulties and problems. Lofty \nhuman values have been deformed by the greed and avarice of the \nworld-devourers and have fallen victim to false and hollow \nmaterialistic criteria. How regrettable it is when we, from our \nhistorical experience, come to see that values like freedom, social \njustice and democracy are being misused, that crimes are being \ncommitted in the name of liberty and human rights, that concepts like \nsocial liberty and justice have become means of suppression, \noppression and tyranny, and that nothing is said about spirituality \nand religion., which can and should provide a sole basis of social \nrelations and pave the way for the growth of human society. In fact, \napart from all racial, national, linguistic and geographical \ndifferences, human beings share a common nature which, if developed, \ncan lead to the attainment of true unity among all the people of the \nworld.\nFour years ago a revolution took place in Iran which, if I wished to \ndefine it in one sentence, I should describe as a development \nexperienced as a result of which the people of Iran were brought back \nto their God-seeking nature and their own inner selves. Our \nRevolution is cultural in its nature and qualities and now Islamic \nculture, which is the same as the revolutionary culture, prevails \neverywhere in all its dimensions. The Islamic Revolution of Iran, as \na movement which has created fundamental changes in our society, laid \nnew foundations in contemporary Iran, the dimensions of the foreign \npolicy of which are resistance to oppression and tyranny, support forthe \noppressed nations and the tyrannized masses in the developing \ncountries, non-reliance on foreign Powers, rejection of all forms of \ndomination and being dominated, respect for other countries' \nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and \nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, on a \nbasis of reciprocity.\nOne of the most important slogans of our Islamic Revolution, \\\"Neither \nEast nor West\\\", which is in fact the application on the international \nscene of the sacred and fundamental words \\\"There is no God but \nAllah\\\", guides our foreign policy and draws its main lines of action. \nBy depending on that slogan we not only rated ourselves from the \ndomination of world- devouring America but also kept ourselves, \ndespite all the difficulties and hardships created for us, from \nfalling into the lap of the other super-Power. We therefore value \nhighly our sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and \nallow no country to interfere in our internal affairs.\nOur revolution considers man's prosperity in the whole of human \nsociety and the establishment of peace and justice, the supreme \nobjective in relations among nations, to be its ideal, and \nindependence, liberty and justice to be every man's right. It also \nbelieves that the breaking of the bonds of the international \nexploiter's domination is attainable only through the firm \ndetermination of the deprived masses and their unity.\nThe struggle against world imperialism and Zionism is a long, hard \nand complicated one which is not limited to political, economic and \nmilitary dimensions; the cultural dimension of this struggle is \nequally important. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \nwill use all its capabilities in this struggle, relying on the lofty \nteachings of the school of Islam, which fosters man's development.\nNow, as we speak of the importance of struggling against world \nimperialism and Zionism, we have in mind the most recent crime \nagainst humanity of American imperialism and occupier Zionism \ncommitted in the Islamic world, while other Powers remain silent. \nThousands of children and innocent, defenseless old women and men \nhave been drenched in blood in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra \nand Shatila in west Beirut by a group of dishonorable Zionist \nterrorists, who attacked Moslems in the most terrible manner. This is \nnot the first crime committed by Israel nor will it be the last.\nThe whole world remembers that the Zionist regime since its \nillegitimate inception, which was the outcome of the imperialist \nPowers' compromise, and the open usurpation of the Palestinian lands, \nhas never ceased to commit brutal crimes against the Moslem \nPalestinians being subjected to tyranny. The tragic massacre in the \nDeir Yassin and Kafr Qasim villages, in which the Irgun terrorist \ngroups killed even the animals, is not yet forgotten. Today we are \nwitnesses to the fact that a person who has committed the most cruel \ncrimes against the people of Palestine has once again, as Prime \nMinister of the Zionist regime, committed one of the most terrible \ncrimes in human history and, with the full support of American \nimperialism, revealed to the entire world his wicked nature. Thus the \ntragedy of the tyrannically treated and deprived people of Palestine \nand Lebanon entered a new stage, in the midst of a conspiracy of \nsilence by the big Powers and reactionary countries-or possibly amid \nastonishment caused by so much atrocity and cruelty.\n136. In the meantime the Zionists and the imperialists, without \npaying the least attention to the feelings and opinions of the \npeace-loving peoples of the world, have outdone each other in making \nimpudent comments. While the Zionists are openly justifying their \nmassacre of the tyrannically treated people of Palestine and Lebanon \nand the total eradication of those nations, and their American \nmasters are expressing satisfaction over the efficiency of their \nmodem weapons in the massacre of the innocent people of Palestine and \nLebanon and the destruction of west Beirut, their reactionary \nmercenaries in the region, following the agreements reached at the \nTwelfth Arab Summit Conference, at Fez, have endorsed the existence \nof Israel and recognized it.\nThe treason and the compromise of certain unpopular dependent regimes \nhave ensured the success of imperialism and Zionism in expelling the \nPalestinian combatants from Beirut and scattering them throughout \nvarious countries.\nThe massacre of the deprived people of Palestine and the Moslems of \nwest Beirut after the expulsion of the PLO combatants proved the \nlegitimacy of the position we have taken against the expulsion \nconspiracy. The bitter experience of humanity in 35 years of Zionist \nusurpation and domination in Palestine has shown that aggression is \nthe innate quality of Israel, and compromise with such an element is \ndisastrous. As we have frequently stated, we can be sure that the \nIsraeli criminals will not content themselves with the massacre of \ninnocent people but will consider that as only a prelude to their \ngreat plot to threaten and eliminate the Palestinian cause and \nestablish the influence of world-devouring America over the whole \nregion. Their objective is to convince the countries of the region \nthat plans of the Camp David type and the support of America are the \nonly way to settle the Middle East crisis and that those who do not \naccept such a solution are doomed to annihilation.\nWe believe that the expulsion of the Palestinian combatants from \nLebanon not only is not the end of the affair but will be the \nbeginning of a new phase of the long struggle of the Arab and Moslem \nnations. Although the existence of hypocritical, reactionary and \nxenophile rulers in certain countries of the region creates \ndifficulties for the Moslems in the attainment of their sacred \nobjectives, and although these unpopular rulers, with their shameless \ncompromise with America and its illegitimate child, Israel, are a \ndisgrace to Moslems, the forces of the people will rise up and \nfinally demand of their rulers why they remained silent in the face \nof the cruel massacre of the people of Lebanon and Palestine and did \nnot fulfill their duties in this connection.\nIf the large quantities of arms that have been bought with the riches \nbelonging to the deprived peoples are not to be used today, when \nMoslems are suffering from such disasters, when should they be used? \nThe Moslem people of such countries have the right to ask why Moslem \nriches should be used for the purchase of airborne warning and \ncontrol systems and scores of other types of sophisticated weapons \nwhich not only are not used for the protection of Moslem interests \nbut also lead to ever further consolidation of the domination of \nAmerican imperialism.\nWhen will the countries of the Middle East region wake up and come to \nfeel the threat that is menacing the basis of their existence, their \nindependence and their Islamic cultural identity? The Lebanese \ntragedy is only one example of the destructive qualities of America \nwhich have made the political system of that country the greatest \nthreat to human survival.\nThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, on the basis of its \nanti-oppression and anti-imperialist qualities and nature and its \npolicy of support for the oppressed nations, which are derived from \nthe lofty teachings of the Koran, once again declares that it \nstrongly supports, within all its possibilities, the rightful and \nlegitimate struggle of the Moslem people of Palestine to return to \noccupied Palestine and expel and annihilate the usurpers of that land \nand destroy the basis and foundation of the Israeli regime, which is \nZionist racism. Despite our two-year-long involvement in a war \nimposed on us, we have never failed to fulfil our Islamic and \nhumanitarian duties as regards Palestine and the Middle East issue. \nOur consistent position in the face of the Zionist regime's \naggression against the peoples of Lebanon and Palestine has been to \nsupport the oppressed against the oppressor and against oppression. \nTo show our sincerity, suffice it to mention that we entered on the \nscene of the war against the savage attack by Israel on Lebanon and \non Palestinian, Syrian andLebanese combatants and dispatched our \nforces to the scene of battle against Zionism, despite our serious \nneed for them in the war which had been imposed on us. We took this \nmeasure as an Islamic and religious duty. We were the only \nnon-front-line country that embarked on such action against the \nZionist regime.\nWe believe that the root solution to the Palestine problem and to the \nwhole Middle East crisis can be found only by placing emphasis on the \nfact that the problem is an Islamic one and through an endeavor to \ncreate a unity of views among Moslem forces. For that reason, the \nIslamic Republic of Iran has always tried to emphasize the Islamic \ndimension of the problem, and the proposal made by Iran for the \nformation of a united Islamic front against Zionism and imperialism \nis in fact nothing but a way of emphasizing the Islamic nature of the \nPalestine issue.\nJust as the Palestinian revolution and the people of Lebanon have \nbeen the target of the destructive conspiracies of American \nimperialism and its agent, the usurper Israel, so the people of Iran, \ntoo, have had the experience of plots designed for them by the \ncriminal America. With the victory of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, \nthe interests of world imperialism were seriously endangered and \nthreatened with annihilation, and the political equations and \nmilitary calculations were totally upset in that part of the world. \nTherefore it was predictable that the newly established regime of the \nIslamic Republic of Iran would be attacked from all sides. The \naggression by the Iraqi regime against our Islamic homeland, which \nbegan in September 198C, was the most important link in the chain of \nthe imperialist conspiracies against our country, the main objective \nof which was to topple the regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It \nwas in fact an effort made by imperialism to protect its interests \nand ambitions and to prevent the spread of the Islamic revolution in \nthat part of the world.\n From the very first days of the victory of the Islamic Revolution, \nthe Iraqi regime, with a view of paving the way for the \nimplementation of its own evil intentions and the achievement of the \nimperialist and Zionist objectives, embarked on a course of \ncommitting all sorts of crimes and provocations, including sabotage. \nThe expulsion of tens of thousands of the oppressed people of Iraq to \nIran; the creation of disturbances against and restrictions on Moslem \nclergy; attacks on Iranian schools and the imprisonment of teachers, \nof whose fate nothing is known; the granting of asylum to Iranian \nanti-revolutionaries; broadcasts of radio programmes in various \nlanguages with a view to waging a propaganda war against the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran and, especially, provoking our Arab-speaking fellow \ncountrymen living in the Khuzistan Province into separating that \nProvince from the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran; the \nassigning of invented Arabic names to Iranian cities; the publication \nof geographical maps in which parts of Iranian territory were removed \nand then included in other countries, such as Iraq itself; the \ndispatch of saboteurs; the strengthening of secessionists and the \nblowing up of oil pipelines-all those are only a few examples of such \nactions.\nThe Iraqi regime, which derived no advantage from such crimes, \ncommitted with a view to weakening and toppling the Islamic Republic \nof Iran, started its vast surprise attack on the territory of Iran \nwith the intention of attaining, in addition to that goal, its other \ngoals-namely, the occupation of fertile border lands, and especially \nthe productive Khuzistan Province, obtaining control over the rich \noil resources of that Province and gaining sovereignty over the whole \nArvand Roud.\nDuring the first weeks of the war, the Iraqi regime succeeded, owing \nto our special internal situation and post-revolutionary conditions, \nin occupying parts of Iranian territory, but the unyielding \nresistance of our combatants at the battlefronts very soon made \nSaddam's regime understand that its calculations had been all wrong. \nAmerica, with its hopes of toppling the Islamic Government through \nSaddam's invasion dashed, has now embarked on a more dirty course: \nthe planting of bombs in populous quarters of Tehran, as the result \nof which hundreds of our innocent fellow-countrymen have been wounded \nor martyred.\nThe recent explosion in central Tehran, which was similar to previous \ncrimes committed by world imperialism's agents, aroused no reaction \non the part of the so-called human rights groups and organizations \nand once again showed the entire world that such persons and \norganizations that defend human rights start thinking of their \nhumanitarian duties only when one of the perpetrators of such crimes \nis punished. Touching confessions made by some of the so- called \nPeople's Mujahiddin terrorists and perpetrators of recent explosions \nin Tehran show that within one month 33 assassinations were committed \nby one of them and 19 assassinations by another. But the groups and \nindividuals that defend the rights of such persons, when horrible \ncrimes have been committed by these terrorists, forget that the \nvictims of these crimes are also human beings and also have rights.\n From this rostrum we extend an invitation to all free human beings, \nto all those who want to discover the truth, to pay a visit to Iran \nto see for themselves on the spot the enormity of the crimes \ncommitted by the agents of American imperialism and bear witness to \nthe wrath and hatred of the masses in their millions.\nThe Iraqi regime, in the course of this war, has not hesitated to \ncommit the full gamut of crimes against the defenseless people, the \ninnocent civilians, of the occupied regions; there is nothing \ncomparable except the crimes committed by the Israeli aggressors in \nwest Beirut. Violation of the women and children of the occupied \nregions; repeated bombardment of hospitals, schools and government \noffices; pounding with missiles of the residential areas of large and \npopulous border cities; torture and killing of revolutionary guards, \nas proved by documents which undeniably exist: those are only a few \nexamples of these innumerable crimes. AH these acts openly violate \nthe Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time \nof War, of 12 August 1949, its two Protocols of 1977 and the Charter \nof the United Nations. It is indeed strange that that regime, \nclaiming that the measures taken by the Government of the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran to defend itself violate the principles of the \nCharter and threaten international peace and security, has now, on \nthe basis of that pretext, requested the inclusion of a new item in \nthe agenda of this session of the General Assembly.\n171 The Iraqi regime's proposal for a cease-fire and its claims to \nhave withdrawn from Iranian territory are not motivated by that \nregime's goodwill or the desire to bring the war to an end. Rather, \nthey are an attempt to save itself from the perilous situation it has \ncreated in trying to overthrow the regime of the Islamic Republic of \nIran. The Iraqi claim concerning the unilateral establishment of a \ncease-fire and the cessation of military operations apparently means \ntransferring Iraqi forces to the strategic zones belonging to Iran \nand pounding the residential areas of Iran from the air and the \nground. Here mention should be made of the fact that the ending of \nthe war depends on the fulfilment of all the conditions announced by \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran and the total elimination of Iraqi \naggression and its results. If that is not done, Iraq will be \nresponsible for the consequences of the continuation of the war and \nthe Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran will be obliged to \ncontinue the war until the complete realization of the rights of the \nIranian people; it will never give in to the logic of  on military \ntreaties have led to unhealthy and destructive consequences in the \ncourse 8f the 37 years since the inception of the United Nations and \nhave constantly kept the entire world on the brink of the abyss of \nwar. During that time, we can think of hardly any period free from \nregional wars, threats and tension. We therefore believe that the attempts \nat domination by the super-Powers should be brought to an end by \ncollective action on the part of the dominated countries.\nWe believe that the strengthening of the non- aligned movement, with \nemphasis on the principles of non-alignment, will pave the way for \nthe liberation of the tyrannized nations from the domination of the \nsuper-Powers. We also believe that this movement, as an important \npolitical force, can play a constructive role in dealing with the \ngreat problems and difficulties facing the world at this juncture.\nThat is precisely why the super-Powers want to weaken, distort and \nannihilate the movement. Hence, we should struggle with all our \nmight, on the basis of respect for the principles of the movement and \ninspired by its ideals, against the imperialism of the East and of \nthe West and assist the oppressed and deprived nations to establish a \nnew economic order in the world.\nIn the present circumstances, with the world in a critical and \ndifficult period and the United Nations practically paralyzed and \ndisabled as a result of the attempts at domination by the \nsuper-Powers and the existence of the unjust right of veto in the \nOrganization's decision-making process, the role of the non- aligned \nmovement in confronting world crises and tension can be more \neffective and significant than ever. Under such conditions, member \nStates should place great value on the ideals and principles of the \nmovement and should work towards consolidating it with a view to \nmaintaining its dynamism and vitality as well as its true substance.\nThe sense of responsibility shown by the members of the non-aligned \nmovement as regards the movement's destiny and future in connection \nwith the changing of the venue of the Seventh Conference of Heads of \nState or Government of Non-Aligned Countries from Baghdad made us \nmore hopeful than ever about the future of the movement. We believe \nthat that development made the non-aligned movement successful in its \nhistorical ordeal and made it better prepared to fulfil its future \nresponsibilities.\nThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, following the \nprinciples of its ideology concerning support for the justice-seeking \nstruggles of the oppressed nations against the oppressors, severed \nails its political and economic relations with the racist regime of \nSouth Africa from the very first days of the victory of the \nrevolution. We have always condemned and denounced in international \ncircles the policies of the minority racist Government, which hurt \nthe common conscience of human society. The current year has been \ndeclared by the United Nations as International Year of Mobilization \nfor Sanctions against South Africa. We hope that firm and collective \nmeasures are taken to solve this difficult problem.\n\nWhile supporting the legitimate rights of the tyrannized people of \nNamibia, we call for the withdrawal of the occupying forces of the \nracist Government of South Africa from Namibia and demand that all \nAfrican revolutionary countries and institutions that have taken part \nin efforts relating to this problem increase their efforts. Besides, \nby condemning the suppression of the oppressed black majority of \nSouth Africa, who are the principal owners of that land, we declare \nour all-encompassing support for those freedom fighters. We \nvehemently condemn the United States and other Western imperialist \ncountries that, in contravention of the United Nations Charter and \nresolutions, extend military, economic and political support to the \nracist regime of Pretoria. We support the front-line countries, such \nas Angola and Mozambique, in their struggle against South Africa.\n From our standpoint, the conspiracy of world imperialism against the \ndeprived people of the African continent, especially the plot to \nboycott the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and \nGovernment of the OAU at Tripoli in August, is one of the links in \nthe chain of th3 imperialist plot designed to dominate Moslem and \noppressed countries of the world.\nIn connection with the Afghanistan issue, the Government of the \nIslamic Republic of Iran believes that the military invasion of \nAfghanistan by the Soviet Union and the imposition of an unwanted \nregime on the people of that cautery should not be viewed only from \nthe standpoint of the violation of the independence and territorial \nintegrity of the Moslem people of Afghanistan. This aggression has \ntrampled underfoot human honor and the traditions, customs and \nculture and, most important of all, the faith and religious beliefs \nof that nation. The Islamic Republic of Iran, as a result of the \ncommon culture, language, traditions, history and, most important, \nthe religion it shares with the tyrannized people of Afghanistan, \ncannot remain silent in the face of this aggression. That was why \nIran was the first country to condemn the Soviet invasion of \nAfghanistan. We consider necessary the complete, unconditional and \nimmediate withdrawal of the occupying forces from Afghanistan, \nnon-intervention by other forces in the internal affairs of that \ncountry, the return of the Afghan combatants to their homeland and \nthe restoration to the people of Afghanistan of their right to \ndetermine their destiny; without these, there can be no settlement of \nthe Afghanistan issue. In this connection, we reject any negotiation \nconducted in the absence of the true representatives of the Afghan \npeople.\nWe consistently support the struggles and efforts of the \nfreedom-seeking countries of South and Central America, especially \nthe revolutionary people of Nicaragua, against the interference, \nconspiracy and attempts at domination by America. We also support the \nlegitimate struggles of revolutionary forces in El Salvador and other \ncountries of the region against the tyranny and oppression of \ndespotic regimes.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran condemns the British military attacks on \nthe Malvinas Islands and the co-operation of America and Britain in \nthat connection, and considers them as an example of imperialist, \ndominance-seeking policies of colonizers in that part of the world.\nWe support the wish of the Korean people for the reunification of the \ntwo Koreas and believe that the presence of American forces in the \nKorean peninsula is an obastacle to that unity. We call for the \nwithdrawal of imperialist agents from the region.\nHere, we once again declare our full support for the Sahraoui and \nMoro liberation movements, as well as other anti-imperialist and \nliberation movements.\nThe tensions existing between East and West and the rivalry of those \ntwo blocs in exploiting the people and resources of third world \ncountries are the cause of many of the present difficulties in the \nworld. The tensions can be eased through disarmament and a freeze on \nthe arms race. But, unfortunately, neither of the super-Powers is \nprepared to give up its arrogance in the interest of humanity. For \nthis reason international efforts for disarmament and a freeze of the \narms race have been deadlocked. As a result, a great part of the \nmanpower and financial capacity of the countries of the world is \nstill being used for the arms race. At a time when millions of people \nof the third world are suffering from poverty, hunger and disease, \neach year $650 billion are used for arms manufactured solely for the \nannihilation of humanity. This is done at a time when, by allocating \nthe budget of several strategic bombers to fighting certain diseases \nthat each year take hundreds of victims from among the deprived \npeoples, those diseases could be eradicated.\nThe second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament, in \nwhich much hope had been placed, proved unsuccessful. The failure of \nthat session should be considered not only as a warning for world \npeace and security but also as a disaster that shows the seriousness \nof the international situation caused by the aggressive nature and \nexpansionist ambitions of the super-Powers for the maintenance of \ntheir domination and influence over other countries of the world. The \nsuper-Powers still continue to increase their production of arms and \nescalate the arms race, and thus brought the last session of the \nCommittee on Disarmament, held at Geneva, to failure.\nIntensification of the arms race consumes the resources of third \nworld countries that should be used for their prosperity and to end \ntheir deprivation. Instead, the profits go to the super-Powers, which \nsubstitute confrontation and conflict for amity and understanding in \ninternational relations. Therefore it lies with third world \ncountries, thanks to all the experience they have gained from various \nimperialist strategies, to put an end to the differences created by \nimperialist forces and, by making use of their financial resources \nfor their national well-being, take the first step for the \neradication of this unjust order that has cast its shadow over the \nworld.\nThe serious crisis that dominates the world economy is a deep and \nstructural one. The increased deficit in the balance of payments, the \nnegative changes in the terms of trade, the lack of financial capital \nfor long-term, infrastructural and productive investments, the lack \nof access to global markets for offers of goods and services, the \nlack of transfer of technology and, finally, the brain drain only \nsome of the difficulties that third world countries encounter owing \nto the world economic crisis.\nThe main cause of this crisis is rooted in the unjust capitalist \neconomic order and exploitative policies that world imperialism is \nimplementing for the sake of preserving its material interests and \npolitical and cultural hegemony at the international level. The \neconomic and political policies of the Western industrialized \ncountries, particularly those of the United States, are so \nshortsighted and narrow-minded that they reject the slightest \nlegitimate wish of third world countries even for the smallest change \nin the oppressive world economic order. Among the measures adopted \nagainst third world countries are the negative reactions to the call \nfor negotiations to establish a new international economic order, the \ncreation of a variety of obstacles to the fruitful conclusion of the \nnegotiations for establishing a financial system for the transfer of \nscience and technology to third world countries, postponement of \ntalks and exertion of pressure on other industrialized societies \naimed at undermining the talks and causing a deadlock.\nOn the other hand, Western industrialized societies, especially \nAmerica, by taking advantage of their dominant economic situation, by \nadopting and implementing oppressive policies, by imposing economic \nrestrictions and sanctions, as well as by employing harsh commercial \nprotective strategies against developing countries, endeavor to \nprevent the latter's economic, political and social development. By \nexerting control over international organizations, such as the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and by opposing just \nand basic changes in the management of those organizations, the \nUnited States and other Western industrialized countries have \npersistently tried to impose on third world countries monetary and \nfinancial economic policies which protect imperialist interests, \nwithout any concern for the existing social and economic conditions \nand needs in developing countries.\nBy imposing divisive measures and vicious political and economic \nmaneuvers on third world countries, American imperialism, along with \nother Western industrialized countries, makes every effort to divide \nthird world countries and preserve the oppressive, exploitative \neconomic order. Efforts made to impede multilateral negotiations and \ncollective action are blatant examples of such divisive strategies.\nWe are of the opinion that as long as inhuman and merely \nmaterialistic viewpoints dominate the world economic order or the \neconomies of countries and human beings, and organizations and \nGovernments, particularly in Western industrialized countries, are \nlimited to satisfying materialistic and consumer needs, the world \neconomic and political crisis will not only fail to improve but will \nactually deteriorate. Along with the cancerous increase in \nconsumption and development of the economies of the Western \nindustrialized countries, we shall witness the poverty and economic \nparalysis of the majority of the peoples of the world. The poverty \nand economic weakness of third world countries are directly related \nto the unsound development of the economies of the Western \nindustrialized countries and their wasteful and dissipated use of \neconomic resources. Therefore, we believe that global changes in \nproduction, trade and consumption should take place so as to change \npresent world economic relations and order for which man's dignity \nand honor in relation to the new order should basically be taken into \nconsideration.\nIn the consultative seminar of the South, held in New Delhi, we said \nthat the third world countries should form a united front to \nco-ordinate their economic policies against the countries of the \nNorth. To achieve that objective, the creation of a permanent \nsecretariat to review the difficulties and present proper solutions \nis vital. We believe that it is only through unity and collective \npressure that deprived and economically backward countries can open \nthe way to the initiation of international negotiations, totally and \nbasically to change the world economic relations and order without \nbeing influenced by any pressure from the super-Powers. Enough has \nbeen said and heard in this connection, and now it is high time to \ntake practical measures.\nConsidering the influence of the super-Powers in the United Nations, \nthe Organization has become a means to exert political pressure on \nthose countries that are struggling against the 'imperialism of the \nEast and West and Zionism. This colossal machine is put in motion \nonly when the interests of one of the big Powers necessitates it. And \nif a solution is not found, the world will not be far away from \ninternational anarchy and chaos. In this connection, many examples \ncan be cited.\nIn September 1980 the Iraqi regime attacked Iran and drowned \nthousands of innocent civilians in blood, displaced millions of our \nfellow countrymen and razed the cities located in the part of our \nterritory that had been under its occupation for 22 months. It seems \nas if in the course of those two years the colossal machine of the \nUnited Nations was in a deep sleep and no one was thinking about the \nestablishment of a just and honorable peace, the peaceful settlement \nof disputes and the maintenance of international security, as \nstipulated in the Charter. But as soon as our combatants were able by \ntheir devotion and selflessness and the sacrifice of thousands of \nmen, to expel the aggressive enemy from most of their soil, they \nembarked on the course of administering justice and ensuring the \nsecurity of the borders. And then, all of a sudden, the mission of \nthe super-Powers for the maintenance and consolidation of \ninternational peace and security was propounded. It is not known \nwhere these awakened consciences and missions were during the two \nyears that had passed since the beginning of the war and the \noppression and tyranny to which the people of Iran were subjected. Is \nit not the case that now that the interests of the superpowers, which \nsupported the Iraqi regime with their money and weapons, are \nthreatened, the members of the Security Council have started to think \nabout adopting a resolution, commiserating about peace and including \nan item in this connection in the agenda of the General Assembly?\nI shall give a better example. On 18 September 1982 one of the most \nshocking crimes in human history was committed in Beirut before the \nvery eyes of the world and the United Nations. Israeli criminals, \nassisted by mercenary phalangists, having committed crimes in \nsouthern Lebanon for several months and despite their false promises \nthat they would not occupy west Beirut, attacked that area and \nslaughtered hundreds of defenseless and unarmed Palestinian and \nLebanese men, women and children. If the United Nations and its \nMembers firmly believed in the mission stipulated in the Charter for \nthe maintenance of international peace and security, they would have \nhad to take measures-if only because of the wounded international \nconscience-to punish that seed of evil- doing, insecurity, \nwarmongering and aggression, within the context of Chapter VII of the \nCharter. Perhaps it is forgotten that Articles 41 and 42 of the \nCharter even exist. Is it not one of the conditions for membership in \nthe Organization that a Member must be peace-loving? Did not the \nGeneral Assembly in its resolution ES-7/4 of 30 April 1982 recognize \nIsrael to be non-peace-loving? The provisions of Article 6 of the \nCharter suffice to expel Israel from the United Nations. Then why is \nwarmongering Israel still a Member of the United Nations? If proper \naction is not taken in this case or in similar cases, the concept of \ncollective action for the maintenance of peace and security, \ncontained in the Charter, will not be applied. And if serious \nmeasures are not taken in this case for the elimination of the unjust \nprivilege of veto, the confidence that the deprived and tyrannized \nnations of the world should have in the Organization will not be \ncreated and the shortcomings to which the Secretary- General has \nreferred in his report will not be eliminated. We should not forget \nthat the Charter and its monopolistic privileges are the outcome of \nthe post-Second-World-War situation, much of which no longer \npertains, and the international atmosphere and the United Nations \nstructure have changed too. Nor can international law, on the basis \nof the principle of unilateral and unequitable privileges that have \nproved to be destructive. We hope for the day when Member States, \nwith realism and understanding of this fundamental development, will \nbestow upon the United Nations the role that benefits it.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I first associate myself with \nthe congratulations extended to you on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly.\n92.\tI am very pleased to have the honour once \nagain of addressing the General Assembly after an \ninterval of seven years. In an international \nperspective, seven years is not a long time. Yet \nin that interval, profound changes have imposed \nthemselves on the world community\u2014changes that \nhave distanced us from the relatively optimistic \ndays of the mid-1970s.\n93.\tSimply stated, the world at present is \nfacing acute economic and political crises. World \neconomic conditions have deteriorated sharply, \nwith devastating consequences on the aspirations \nof all nations, rich and poor alike. Political \nupheaval has driven the interna\u00actional community \ntowards recurrent instability. And these forces \nare closely linked. Political crises generate \neconomic consequences and economic dislocations \nbreed political instability.\n94.\tHow can we chart a course for our \ninstitutions that will bring us through this \nperiod of grave economic dislocation and \ndangerous political tension and serve the \ninterests of all members of the General Assembly?\n93. When our present institutions, such as the \nUnited Nations, IMF, the World Bank and GATT, \nfirst took shape, there was hope of maintaining a \nnetwork of relationships which would match the \ncomplexity of post-war interdependence and help \nus to stabilize it. Today, the need to manage \ninterdependence is even more pressing. But in the \npresent crisis there is a disturbing tendency to \ndiscount and discredit multi\u00aclateral \ninstitutions. Because the maze of international \nproblems has become more resistant to \nconventional solutions, attacks are being made on \nthe institutions through which solutions are \nbeing approached. The United Nations, in \nparticular, has been the object of much criticism.\n\n96.\tWe cannot fail to realize that \ninterdependence is a reality that we must accept, \nfor better or for worse, and that no nation can \nhope to resolve its problems on its own. \nMultilateralism, whatever its specific form, is \nour primary hope for counteracting on a world \nscale political and economic aggression which can \nonly too easily result from a long period of \nuncertainty and fear.\n97.\tHowever, let us have no illusions: the \ncredibility and the effectiveness of the \nmultilateral institutions depend on the political \nwill of nations and of their leaders, and on the \nwill to find a collective response to serious \nnational and international problems.\n\n98.\tMost countries, developed and developing, \nare now grappling with high rates of inflation. \nSlow or stagnant growth and international \npayments imbal\u00acances compound already serious \ndebt problems. Record high unemployment in many \ncountries threatens the social and political \nfabric of our societies and feeds protectionist \nsentiment. At the international level, the \neconomic crisis is having a devastating effect on \ngrowth prospects and on development assistance. \nDebt-servicing problems have reached proportions \nthat impose considerable strain on the \ninternational financial system.\n99.\tThe consequence has been an increasing \nten\u00acdency towards economic parochialism. \nPressures for short-term relief put at risk the \nmultilateral system and narrow the longer-term \nprospects for all of us. These pressures must be \nresisted.\n100.\tThe collective response to the current \neconomic situation was extensively discussed at \nthe annual meeting of IMF and the World Bank held \nrecently in Toronto. I was encouraged by the \ndetermination of participants at that meeting to \ntreat economic problems as matters of common \nconcern requiring common action.\n101.\tI should like to underline two important \nthemes. First, the magnitude of the financial \ndifficulties many of our countries face makes it \nimperative that IMF should have adequate \nresources to ensure that it can continue to play \nits vital role in promoting adjustment in member \ncountries. That is why Canada supports a \nsubstantial increase in quotas during the Eighth \nGeneral Review.\n102.\tSecondly, the current economic situation has meant that \ndevelopment assistance has become even more \nessential for a number of developing countries \nand it is important that bilateral and \nmultilateral flows continue. We welcomed the \nagreement reached at Toronto to ensure an \nadequate level of funding through the life of the \nSixth Replenishment of the International \nDevelopment Association (IDAVI).\n103.\tThe tendency to turn inward economically \nis also exerting strain on the multilateral \ntrading system. Protectionist sentiment arising \nfrom economic disloca\u00action is difficult for all \nGovernments to deal with, my own included. But it \nis absolutely essential that we manage these \npressures collectively to avoid under\u00acmining \nGATT. That organization has been enormously \nbeneficial in promoting world economic growth in \ndeveloped and developing countries. Any serious \nweakening of GATT through beggar-thy-neighbour \npolicies would have the ultimate effect of making \nbeggars of us all. GATT can and should be \nstrengthened.\n104.\tCanada will chair the 1982 annual session \nof the GATT Contracting Parties, which will be \nheld at the ministerial level in November. We \nregard this session as a significant test of our \ncollective determination to manage an \ninterdependent system.\n105.\tIntense preoccupation with domestic \neconomic concerns also confounds our attempts to \npersevere with development assistance programmes. \nWhat should be our response to the inescapability \nof shrinking resources? How do we face the \ndifficulties in generating increased development \nassistance flows?\n106.\tWe should all\u2014national donors and \nmultilateral agencies alike\u2014rationalize \ndeployment of available resources for maximum \npossible effect. The best results can be obtained \nfrom this process of com\u00acpulsory selectivity only \nif donors focus on areas of special national \nexpertise and resources. Canada has chosen to \nconcentrate its efforts in three particular areas \nwhich draw upon considerable national experience. \nThese are the food and agricultural area, energy, \nspecifically petroleum exploration, and human \nresources.\n\n107.\tAnother response to shrinking resources \nshould be to make full and timely use of every \nopportunity for enhanced co operation. In this \nconnection, I am disappointed with the lack of \nprogress made on global negotiations since the \nVersailles Economic Summit in June. Canada \nbelieves that the text of a compromise resolution \nworked out at Versailles represented a \nsignificant step in the effort to find a formula \nfor launching global negotiations. I regret that \nit has not been possible to find a basis for real \nnegotiations.\n108.\tEconomic problems are all the more vexing \nand potentially dangerous because they are bound \nup with serious political instability. Political \ninstability pro\u00acduces consequences extending far \nbeyond the imme\u00acdiate region in which conflict \nhas erupted. In a shrinking world local \nvulnerabilities and tragedies become the common \nconcern of us all.\n109.\tWe have witnessed the long agony of \nLebanon and, but 10 days ago, the horror of the \nmassacre of Palestinians. These terrible events \nshow us in stark fashion the price that must be \npaid when one strives to resolve political \nproblems by military means, when disputes among \nnations and peoples and political factions \nreplace negotiations, when one misuses or \ndisregards the instruments that the international \ncom\u00acmunity has established to settle disputes and \nprevent human suffering.\n110.\tI should like to stress that Canada \nstaunchly supports the sovereignty, independence \nand territorial integrity of Lebanon, and that it \nendorses the Security Council resolutions which \ncall for Israel's withdrawal from west Beirut and \nthe whole of Lebanon. No foreign force should \nremain in that country without the full consent \nof the Lebanese Government; otherwise that \nravaged country will never know stability again.\n111.\tEqually important, efforts must be \nintensified now to grapple with the problems at \nthe heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict. More than \never the tragic events of the last few months \nillustrate the need for a just and permanent \nsolution which assures the legitimate rights of \nthe Palestinian people, including their right to \na homeland in the West Bank and Gaza, and the \nright of Israel to exist in security and peace. \nImportant proposals for such a solution have \nrecently been made. The United States proposals \nof 1 Sep\u00actember in particular offer opportunities \nfor progress which should vigorously be pursued.\n112.\tOther arenas of conflict continue to \ncontribute to the generally high level of \ninternational tension. Events in Poland remain an \nobject of our particular attention, not only \nbecause of concern for the basic rights and \nfreedoms of the Polish people but also because of \nserious implications for stability in the heart \nof Europe.\n113.\tIn Afghanistan and Cambodia we witness \nagonizing, protracted and deplorable military \noccupa\u00actions which are in sharp contradiction \nwith the aims and ideals of the Organization and \nthe Charter. The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan \nand the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia \ncontinue to violate the sovereignty of their \nvictims and to ignore resolutions adopted by the \nGeneral Assembly. Once again this year draft \nresolutions are before the Assembly on \nAfghanistan and Cambodia. I urge all Member \nStates to support these draft resolutions.\n114.\tThe Korean peninsula has long been an \narea of tension and concern. We are encouraged \nhowever by the proposals made in January this \nyear by the President of the Republic of Korea \nseeking dialogue and reconciliation, without \nconditions, and we hope for the greater \nintegration of the peninsula into the \ninter\u00acnational community.\n115.\tThe extent to which local or regional \nconflicts draw their energy from mutually \nantagonistic ideo\u00aclogical systems is also cause \nfor considerable concern. In recent years the \nbreakdown of detente and an increasing anxiety \nover the unpredictability of events have fuelled \npublic fears of nuclear war. Our peoples fear \nthat everything is at risk: the economic and \ntechnological systems which sustain us, the \npolitical and social systems which underpin them \nand the very biosphere which permits the \nexistence of life itself.\n116.\tThe world had high hopes for the second \nspecial session of the General Assembly on \ndisarmament. When the session ended and no final \nagreement on a comprehensive programme of \ndisarmament had been reached, there was much \ndisappointment and frustra\u00action. However, a \ndisservice is done to the special session and to \nthe United Nations as an institution if it is \nsimply dismissed as a failure. Of course the \nresults were disappointing, but then the \nexpectations of many were probably \nunrealistically high given the prevailing \ninternational climate. Moreover, in this climate \nit is essential that the campaign for nuclear \ndisarmament be waged at the negotiating table. My \ncountry strongly supports the present \nnegotiations in Geneva to limit and reduce the \nlevel of nuclear arms.\n117.\tCanada has chosen to contribute to the \narms control and disarmament process by \nconcentrating on the vital issue of verification. \nWe are doing this through participating in the \ninternational seismic data exchange and by \nsubstantially increasing research in \nverification. I would appeal to other Member \nStates to consider how their particular \ncircumstances and resources might be drawn upon \nto contribute to the arms control process. It is \nbasically the same question as with development: \ngiven the need for selectivity, what can you \ncontribute?\n118.\tI have evoked today a set of perplexing \nand interrelated economic and political problems. \nWhat is the United Nations capacity to respond to \nthese? The question is an urgent one, because the \nUnited Nations and the specialized agencies \naddress virtually the entire range of human \nconcerns.\n119.\tWithin the United Nations, crisis \nmanagement capacity has been called seriously \ninto question by divisions within the Security \nCouncil, by erosion of the constitutional \ndivision of authority between the Security \nCouncil and the General Assembly and by a cycle \nof ineffectual resolutions. We have seen an \nincreasing tendency to introduce extraneous \npolemical issues in the specialized agencies, \nwith adiminution of their effectiveness and \ncredibility. Official spokes\u00acmen of key States \nMembers of the United Nations have expressed \nscepticism regarding the Organization. To counter \nattacks on the United Nations from within and \nwithout we must more closely bind our policies \nand our behaviour to the principles expressed in \nthe Charter. We must also vigorously reaffirm the \nsingular contribution that the United Nations has \nmade to the development of international law. As \nthe Secretary-General explained at length and \nwith eloquence in a statement delivered last \nmonth in Montreal, the United Nations plays a \nunique and absolutely essential role in the \npromotion of the rule of law. It is only the \nUnited Nations, with its virtually global scope, \nwhich has the capacity to play that role.\n120.\tThis year the Third United Nations \nConference on the Law of the Sea succeeded in \nproducing a profound achievement: a comprehensive \nconstitution for the oceans of the world. The \nConference could not have produced such a \ncomprehensive convention without the active \nsupport and participation of all nations during \nthe long years of negotiation. We deeply regret \nthat the Conference was not able to adopt the \ntext of the Convention by consensus. No State can \nremain aloof from the regime, and we must not be \nswayed by any attempt to undermine it.\n121.\tThe United Nations has succeeded in \nmaking human rights violations a legitimate \nsubject of interna\u00actional scrutiny and it is \nsignificant that the Secretary- General has \nidentified human rights promotion as a priority \narea. Canada will support the Secretary- General \nin these efforts. Effective procedures must be \nworked out to deal with flagrant violations of \nhuman rights.\n122.\tA role of critical importance for the \nUnited Nations is the peaceful resolution of \ndisputes. How\u00acever maligned the Organization may \nbe concerning its efforts to resolve disputes, it \ncan achieve notable successes. In Namibia, the \nUnited Nations has worked cut a balanced \nsettlement plan which should bring Namibia to \nindependence peacefully, and has obtained for \nthat plan general acceptance. The substantial \nprogress that has been made must be attributed in \npart to the dedication and constructive approach \nof the front-line States and the South West \nAfrica People's Organization [SW/1PO]. We hope \nthat remaining problems will be quickly resolved.\n123.\tThe appointment of a new \nSecretary-General has come at a time when the \nUnited Nations is facing unprecedented problems \nand when the need for insti\u00actutional reform has \nbecome obvious. In his first report on the work \nof the Organization, the Secretary- General has \naddressed this need in direct and specific terms. \nHe has put forward several innovative \nsugges\u00actions, in particular directed at a more \neffective Security Council. He has himself \nundertaken to play a more direct role in bringing \nurgent matters before the Council. These specific \nproposals and the Secre\u00actary-General's commitment \nto administrative stream\u00aclining are very welcome \nand should be encouraged. Pragmatic reforms must \nbe made or the United Nations will lose its \nvalidity as a forum for interna\u00actional \nnegotiations, not only for the promotion of peace \nand security but also for the shaping of our, \neconomic future.\n124.\tThe aims of the institutions we have \ninvented are under considerable and potentially \ncrippling strain. We must rededicate these \ninstitutions and the driving force of our \ndetermination must be a sense of shared \nvulnerability.\n125.\tThe present crisis demands intelligence \nand will. Intelligence must lead us to a more \nprofound\nUnderstanding of political and economic forces; \nour will must reside in commitment to those \nnational con\u00accessions dictated by our mutual \ndependency. We cannot, must not, allow mutual \nantagonisms or self- absorption to divert our \nattention from the full range of difficulties \nwhich we face, and which we must face together.\n"

I should like to avail myself of this \nopportunity to extend my cordial congratulations \nto Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his election as \nSecretary-General. I am sure that his \nconsiderable experience in international affairs \nand the respect and confidence he enjoys among \nthe world community qualify him to work \ncreatively and positively in the defence of \ninternational peace and ensure the triumph of the \npurposes and principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. I wish also to congratulate his \npredecessor, Mr. Waldheim, on his action and \nefforts at a time characterized by tension and \ndanger.\n\n\n112. It is traditional in this Hall at the \nbeginning of each session of the General Assembly \nfor our common hopes and aspirations for the \nstrengthening of peace and understanding, the \ntriumph of justice and right and the emergence of \nan era of prosperity and well-being for mankind \nto be expressed. It is regrettable to note at the \nbeginning of this debate that hotbeds of tension \nare still giving rise to serious threats to \ninternational peace and security and that the \ninternational situation is deteriorating because \nof the new obstacles which have recently almost \nshattered our hope of establishing genuine and \ncomprehensive detente.\n\n113. This state of affairs will persist as long \nas there are those who wilfully violate the \nprinciples of the Charter and flout international \nlaw, infringing the dignity of man and his b8sic \nrights; as long as colonialism, racial \ndiscrimination and the deterioration of the \ninternational economic situation, which results \nin increasing impoverishment of the world \npopulation, continue. In addition to this, the \narms race and its attendant dangers threaten the \nachievements of mankind.\n\n114.\tBecause it is a member of the Arab world, \nthe Islamic group and the African continent, and \nbecause of its geographical situation at the \ncrossroads of three civilizations, Morocco \nattributes great importance to what happens in \nall these areas.\n\n115.\tThe question of the Middle East, and \nespecially the Palestinian question, occupies a \nplace of the highest priority among the concerns \nof my country. For more than 30 years the \nPalestinian people have suffered exile and \ndeprivation and have been the victim of war and \ndestruction. In spite of the voices raised every \nyear from this rostrum condemning I3raeli \npractices and demanding that the Palestinian \npeople regain their inalienable rights, despite \nthe resolutions adopted by the Assembly and the \nSecurity Council in support of the rights of that \nmilitant people, Israel is persisting in its \nexpansionist and repressive acts with all the \nmeans at its disposal, including the use of \ninternationally banned weapons, in order to \ncontinue to occupy the Arab territories and \nannihilate the Palestinian people, in an attempt \nto eliminate them, suppress them and liquidate \ntheir leaders in the form of the PLO.\n\n116. Although the United Nations archives are \nfiled with reports on massacres and \nassassinations carried out by Israel against the \nPalestinian people for more than 30 years, the \ntragedy and suffering resulting from the Israeli \ninvasion of Lebanon and t:-'e massacres of the \nPalestinian and Lebanese peoples are beyond all \nbounds and beyond imagination.\n\n117. The abominable massacre planned by the \nIsraeli army of occupation in the camps of Sabra \nand Shatila claimed more than 4,000 victims among \ninnocent Palestinians, including women, children \nand old people. It reminds us of a similar \nmassacre carried out by Meacham Begin in the \nPalestinian village of Deir Yassin in 1947, and \nit transcends in atrocity and the manner in which \nit was committed the deeds of the Nazis during \nthe Second World War.\n\n113. This butchery shows beyond doubt that the \nreal aim of Israel is not security, as it claims, \nbut the total physical elimination of the \nmilitant Palestinian people and expansion at the \nexpense of the Arab nation. Morocco pays its \ntribute to the memory of the martyred victims of \nIsraeli terrorism and expresses its gratitude and \nappreciation to those that have condemned and \ndenounced this atrocious massacre and taken the \nside of right and justice. All the States of the \nworld have expressed their individual \ncondemnation of that massacre and the \ninternational community has denounced it \ncollectively. The General Assembly, at its \nseventh emergency special session, adopted \nresolution ES-7/9 on 24 September 1982 condemning \nthe criminal massacre and reaffirming Security \nCouncil resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982) \ndemanding that Israel with-draw all its military \nforces to the internationally recognized \nboundaries of Lebanon.\n\n119. In the face of this human tragedy it is more \nnecessary than ever for the General Assembly to \ntake all the measures called for, including the \nimposition of sanctions, to compel Israel to put \nan end to its aggression against the Palestinian \npeople, to withdraw forthwith and unconditionally \nfrom the territory of Lebanon and to comply with \nthe resolutions of the Security Council.\n\n120. Morocco, a sister State of Lebanon, takes \nthis opportunity to reaffirm its full solidarity \nwith Lebanon in its time of trial and to assure \nthe Lebanese Government of its support for the \nmeasures necessary to guarantee the unity, \nindependence and sovereignty of Lebanon.\n\n121. The two parts of the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference were held in Fez, Morocco, under the \nleadership of His Majesty King Hassan 11. My \ncountry thus had the honour of acting as host to \nthis historic conference which restored unity to \nthe Arab ranks and placed Arab solidarity on firm \nfoundations.\n\n122. The Arab Summit Conference was convened in \nextremely delicate circumstances for the causes \nof Palestine and the Middle East, and the Arab \nheads of State shouldered their historic \nresponsibility and agreed to the plan designed to \nenable the Arabs to regain their rights. They did \nso because of their conviction that the Arab \nnation can achieve its aims and overcome the \nconsequences of the Israeli aggression.\n\n123. The Arab nations, out of their concern to \nuse all ways and means at their disposal to \nre-establish in the Middle East peace based on \njustice and to contribute to the efforts exerted \nby all the .peace:. loving forces in the world, \nin the vanguard of which is the United Nations, \nand on the basis of international law, the Arab \npeace plan, with the following elements: first, \nIsrael's withdrawal from all the territories it \nhas occupied since 1%7, including Jerusalem; \nsecondly, the right of the Palestinian people to \nself-determination, to the exercise of its \ninalienable rights under the leadership of the \nPLO, its sole legitimate representative, and to \nthe establishment of an independent State on its \nland; thirdly, the establishment by the Security \nCouncil of guarantees for peace among the States \nof the region.\n\n124. A study of those principles should convince \nthe Assembly and the world public that the Arab \nnation desires peace based on justice and a \nsolution to the Middle East problem that \nguarantees to the Palestinian people its right to \nself-determination and to establish its own \nindependent State and that makes it possible for \nall the States of the region to live in peace, \nwith Security Council guarantees.\n\n125. Morocco, who\u00eds Sovereign. His Majesty King \nHassan 11, presided over the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference, calls upon all peace-loving States, \nandespecially the great Powers, permanent members \nof the Security Council, to support right and \njustice, to study the Arab peace plan carefully \nand to adopt the principles contained in that \nplan as the basis for the solution of the Middle \nEast and Palestine problems. We hope that there \nwill be a favourable reaction t9 this Arab \ninitiative and that it will usher in a new era \n.that will restore peace and stability to the \nMiddle East region and bring to an end the state \nof war which has afflicted the people of the \nregion for so long.\n\n126. The favourable reaction and the broad \nsupport with which the Arab peace plan has met on \nthe inter-national scene is encouraging. We hope \nthat all States especially the great Powers \npermanent members of the Security Council, will \nsupport the plan and that the high-level \ncommittee set up by the summit conference will be \nable to establish contacts with the permanent \nmembers of the Security Council and to achieve \npositive results.\n\n127.\tWe should like to note also that Mr. \nReagan\u00eds plan for peace in the Middle East gives \ncause for optimism. Morocco regards this plan as \na measure that opens new prospects for a solution \nto the Middle East problem, and that places on \nrecord the commitment of the President of the \nUnited States of America to the principle of the \nrestoration to Arab sovereignty of the Arab \nterritories occupied by Israel in 1%7. At the \nsame time, we note that this plan omits basic \npoints essential to the process for the \nestablishment of peace in the Middle East. We \nhope that during the forthcoming contacts between \nthe Arab countries and the United States of \nAmerica these gaps will be filled so that a just \nand lasting peace can be achieved in the Middle \nEast and that region may once again be the cradle \nof constructive coexistence and a centre for the \ndissemination of creative thought.\n\n128.\tIn north-west Africa there is still \nartificial tension resulting from a policy which \nruns counter to the noble principles established \nby the international community, which is based on \ndesperate attempts to undermine international law \nand which resorts to hegemony as a means of \nachieving selfish interests. The so-called \nproblem of Western Sahara serves as a pretext and \nan instrument to that end. Morocco has always \nmade it clear that its desire to regain its \nSaharan territory is based on solid historical \nrights and legal ties, as well as international \nlaw. After the Moroccan liberation army had \nengaged in a heroic struggle against the \ncolonizers in Saharan territory, Morocco called \nfor the restoration of the land usurped at the \nbeginning of the colonial era of this century. \nBecause of the colonial authorities' \nprocrastination in returning this land to the \nmother country, Morocco had recourse to juridical \nbodies. It submitted the question to the United \nNations and to the International Court of \nJustice. That resulted finally in the conclusion \nof the Madrid Agreement, confirmed by the General \nAssembly in 1975.\n\n129.\tMorocco has clearly set forth here on \nseveral occasions the political and historical \ncircumstances in which Moroccan territory had \nbeen divided into various regions and subjected \nto various colonial systems. It has also clearly \nindicated that the restoration of the amputated \nparts of its country was also -by the very nature \nof things-carried out in various stages.\n\n130.\tBecause of Morocco's faithfulness to \ninter-national legality, and because of its \ndesire to give that legality a new form that \nwould bode well for the future, His Majesty King \nHassan n, at the eighteenth ordinary session of \nthe Assembly of Heads of State and Government of \nthe OAU, which was held at Nairobi in June 1981, \nstated that Morocco was prepared 10 hold a \nreferendum in the region of Western Sahara, \nthereby opening the door to a final, peaceful \nsolution to this conflict. Morocco put forward \nthat initiative because it was convinced of its \ninalienable right to the Territory and of the \nfact that its children in the region of the \nSahara had chosen to remain forever an integral \npart of the mother country.\n\n131. His Majesty King Hassan's initiative was in \npart. in response to the wishes of Morocco's \nfriends and also was intended clearly to show the \nworld public and to assure jt that the \ninhabitants of the Sahara region wished to belong \nto the mother country and, through a referendum, \nto confirm what they had expressed on many \noccasions and in many different ways: their \nMoroccan identity, to which they are very \nattached.\n\n132. The whole world welcomed this initiative, \nfinding in it the ideal means for ending the \nlong-standing tension in that part of north-west \nAfrica. Morocco made every effort to give this \ninitiative the chance to bring about peace, and \nto have it acted upon. Morocco, represented by \nits sovereign, thus made an important \ncontribution to a settlement of the problem of \nWestern Sahara at Nairobi, in August 1981. The \nAfrican leaders laid the foundations for such a \nsettlement by establishing the OAU's \nImplementation Committee 9 which was to concern \nitself with the cease-fire and the referendum. \nMorocco-thus made an effective contribution to \nthe success of that African meeting, whose goal \nwas to move the peace process forward to its \ndesired end. The Implementation Committee \ncontinued working effectively to bring about the \nimplementation of the resolutions of the OAU \nAssembly. especially since the adoption by the \nGeneral Assembly of its decision 36/406, the text \nof which had been sponsored by Kenya, then \nChairman of the OAU Assembly, calling on the \nUnited Nations to extend technical and financial \nassistance in this field to the OAU.\n\n133. The Implementation Committee met again on 8 \nand 9 February 1982, to decide on a time-frame \nfor the cease-fire and referendum. In \nco-operation with African leaders, Morocco worked \nwith sincerity to put the final touches on this \nAfrican effort, which would have ended one of the \ndisputes which have been the concern of the OAU \nover the past years. Good will dictated that all \nefforts made by the African leaders should be \ngiven a chance to bear fruit, but there are those \nwho do not wish to find a solution to this \nproblem, and that fact led to the cancellation of \nthe initiative. When it became dear that there \nwas a serious turn of events which would lead to \nthe derailment of failure of hegemonies expansion \nplans and confirm the inalienable rights of \nMorocco through free consultation under United \nNations and OAU auspices, attempts were made to \nabort that process and to undermine the \nresolutions adopted at the OAU Assembly at \nNairobi. The well known plot thus took place at \nAddis Ababa which immobilized the work of the OAU \nand its activities halted when certain countries. \nin secret collaboration with the OAU \nadministrative Secretary-General, tried to impose \na group of mercenaries as participants in the \nthirty-eighth 'ordinary session of the Council of \nMinisters of .the OAU. That wanton act was in \nflagrant violation of the QAD Charter, which \nstipulates in more than one place that membership \nis confined to independent sovereign States. That \nact was furthermore, a conspiracy to undermine \nall the practical measures adopted by Africa to \nsolve the Saharan problem in a peaceful manner.\n\n134. The leaders of the African nations \nrepresented by the \\\"wise men\\\" the founders of the \nOAU, opposed that conspiracy against legality, \nand 19, delegations withdrew from the session of \nthe OAU Council of Ministers held at Addis Ababa \nin February 1982, which is where the conspiracy \nwas acted out. That session was therefore illegal \nbecause there was no quorum as required in the \nOAU Charter.\n\n135.\tTo overcome this crisis, the African \ncontinent was the scene of intense political \nactivity aimed at saving the OAU from collapse. \nSome African leaders called for a special session \nof the OAU Assembly to solve the problem; Morocco \nwas among the first to take such an initiative. \nHis Majesty King Hassan ,11 sent a letter to the \nPresident of Kenya, Mr. Daniel Arap Moi, in \nFebruary this year, requesting that, ~ special \nsession be held to consider the existing' crisis \nbefore it worsened. But the forces fighting \nagainst legitimacy worked to preventthat meeting.\n\n136.\tOnce more, we see that enlightened \nAfrica, which has opted for legitimacy, has shown \nitself to be above submitting to the policy of \nfait accompli. It refused to attend the OAU \nAssembly scheduled to be held at Tripoli unless \nAfrican legitimacy, in accordance with the OAU \ncharter, was restored to the OAU. The frustration \nand failure of the session of the OAU Assembly at \nTripoli is a testimony to legitimacy and justice \nand the failure of attempts to violate the \nAfrican Charter.\n\n137.\tThat failure caused the immobilization of \nthe work of the OAU at all levels-political, \neconomic, social, as well as in the field of \ninformation; but we are convinced t.hat the \nOAU-which is backed and supported by every \nsincere African-will once. more play its \nconstructive role:, thanks to the efforts made by \nthe sincere sons of Africa, who value legitimacy \nand higher African interests above all other \nconsiderations and narrow selfish interests.\n\n138. Morocco-which has played a pioneering role \nin crystallizing the idea of African unity \nthrough the African Charter, adopted in \nCasablanca in '1961, and which is one of the \nfounders of the OAU-would very much like that \norganization to continue. Morocco will thus do \nits utmost to maintain and support the CAU so \nthat it may continue to play its vital and \neffective role as an instrument of common African \naction. Morocco is extremely concerned that \nlegitimacy be restored to the OAU and that the \norganization's administrative bodies should \nconcern themselves with the implementation of \nAfrican resolution with integrity and neutrality, \nfree of any bias and without 'be'-coming involved \nin current disputes among \\\"certain member \ncountries.\n\n139. The United Nations followed closely the \nAfrican meetings held last year to discuss the \nquestion of Sahara. Its representatives gave to \nthe African leaders, useful help by describing \nthe experience of the United Nations in the \nholding of referendums. They know the 'stages \nthat must be gone through In arriving at a \ncease-fire and holding a referendum.\n\n140. Morocco which has always proclaimed its \nadherence to international legitimacy reaffirms \nits commitment to the resolutions of the \neighteenth session of the OAU Assembly concerning \nSahara which were supported last year by the \nGeneral Assembly. It sees the way chosen by \nAfrica as the best means of ending the artificial \ntensions in north-west Africa. Proceeding from \nthat .premise, Morocco appeals to all States to \nwork for the success of that African solution and \nto frustrate an attempts to block and obstruct \nit, so that the conflict can be ended and peace \nand stability can be restored to this area.\n\n141. Morocco, as a part of the African continent, \nattaches special importance to the events that \ntake place there. It works in co-operation with \nits African brothers to support the independence \nof the countries of the continent and ensure the \nprogress and development of their peoples, so \nthat the whole continent may enjoy well-being and \nprosperity and play its role in building a world \nsociety founded upon justice and peace.\n\n142.\tIn the southern part of this continent, \nthe brother people of Namibia is still suffering \nunder the yoke of an unjust racist regime and \nwaging a valiant war of liberation to restore its \nusurped liberty, independence and territorial \nintegrity. Morocco, which has always supported \nthe just struggle of the Namibian people, hopes \nthat the day when independence is restored to \nthat people will soon be here. On this occasion, \nwe appeal to the contact group to redouble its \nefforts and negotiations so that a final \nsettlement of the Namibian problem may be reached \nin accordance with Security Council resolution \n435 (1978).\n\n143.\tThe people of southern Africa are still \nsuffering from the tragedy of the regime of \nracial discrimination imposed by the Government \nof Pretoria, despite the many resolutions \n1:ondemning that regime and denouncing apartheid \nas a \\\"crime against humanity\\\" .\n\n144~ Morocco reaffirms its support for the people \nof South Africa, which must regain its dignity \nand free-dom. It calls on those countries which \nhave relations with Pretoria to break off their \neconomic and military collaboration with it in \norder to induce it to end that regime, which is a \nchallenge to the most basic legal and ethical \nprinciples.\n\n145. Morocco, which is pledged to defend all \nstruggles for liberation, reaffirms its \ndetermination to defend all struggles for \nliberation in Africa, in the south, the Horn of \nAfrica, Eritrea or elsewhere in the continent.\n146. For more than two years a destructive war \nhas been raging between two neighbouring Islamic \ncountries, Iraq and the Islamic Republic .of \nIran. Those two countries were the cradles of \nancient civilizations that helped to develop the \nthinking, science and progress of humanity. If is \nregrettable that the war between those two \ncountries should still be going on despite all \nthe untiring efforts to bring it to an end. We \nhope that it will soon be possible to reach a \nsettlement that win effect a cease-fire, \nsafe-guard the inalienable rights of the two \nStates, and restore stability and security to the \narea, within the framework of Security Council \nresolutions 514 (1982) of 12 July 1982 and 522 \n(1982) of 4 October 1982.\n\n147. The initiative taken by our sister nation of \nIraq recently, which took the form of withdrawing \nits army to the borders it had held before the \nhostilities, is, we believe, a positive step \ntowards the restoration of peace and the \nconsolidation of relations of \ngood-neighbourliness. Iraq's response to all \nmediation efforts to end this conflict deserves \nour encouragement and praise. We also pin great \nhopes to the efforts of the Peace Committee of \nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference, \npresided over by Mr. Ahmed SekouToure, President \nof Guinea, efforts directed to restoring peace \nand security to that important part of the world.\n\n148. In Afghanistan the people is still suffering \nfrom the injustices of the invasion of that land \nthree years ago. It is still fighting to preserve \nits Islamic faith and its identity as a Moslem \nand non-aligned nation. Morocco, which is linked \nwith the Moslem people of Afghanistan by ties of \nreligion, culture and civilization, calls for the \nwithdrawal of an foreign forces from Afghan \nterritory, enabling the people to choose the \npolitical system it desires in full freedom.\n\n149. In Democratic Kampuchea, we note that the \nVietnamese army has not responded to the call of \nthe international community to withdraw from that \ncountry so that its people can freely choose its \nown political system. We still believe that the \nDeclaration and resolution adopted by the \nInternational Conference on Kampuchea6 constitute \nthe basis for the best solution of this problem.\n\n150. As for relations between the two parts of \nKorea, we hope that (ne Governments of the North \nand the South will resume a positive and \nconstructive dialogue with a view to bringing \nabout gradually the peaceful reunification of \nKorea.\n\n151. Morocco has always maintained good relations \nwith the States of the Mediterranean Basin, and \nis striving to create favourable conditions for \nthat region to be transformed into a zone of \npeace and co-operation, in accordance with \nGeneral Assembly resolution.36/l02. On that \nbasis, and within the frame-work of the efforts \nof the Conference on Security and Co-operation in \nEurope, Morocco has supported and still supports \nthe efforts made to strengthen peace and security \nand ensure co-operation in the region.\n\n152.\tIt is a recognized fact that \ninternational detente is linked to disarmament \nand that the arms race is a serious threat to the \nexistence and the survival of man. It is the two \nblocs that motivate the arms race, but it is the \ndeveloping countries that are the principal \nvictims, because it prejudices their economic and \nsocial progress, increases their debt burden and \nlessens their security.\n\n153.\tIt is regrettable that the international \nefforts to change the situation have so far \nproduced no positive results. This is especially \ntrue of the second special session of the General \nAssembly devoted to disarmament, which failed to \nachieve any concrete progress in this respect.\n\n154.\tMorocco, associating itself with those \nwho work for disarmament at the regional or the \ninternational level, appeals to the super-Powers, \nwhich bear a\nspecial responsibility for the maintenance of \npeace, to redouble their efforts to reach \nagreement on a comprehensive programme of \ndisarmament, with a carefully prepared timetable, \nso that disarmament does not become a mere theory \nwhich cannot be put into practice.\n\n155. The utmost attention must be paid to \ntackling the chronic injustice of the world \neconomic system particularly since the developing \ncountries are the most affected by this. \nInternational economic institutions in all fields \nand areas of competence recognize the urgent need \nfor a radical change in the world economic \nsystem, especially following the sixth and \nseventh special sessions of the General Assembly, \nwhich stressed the inevitability of such change. \nCertain achievements benefiting the third world \nsuch as the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties \nof States, the generalized system of preferences \nand the Integrated Commodities Programme and \ncertain such concepts as the common economic \nself-sufficiency of the developing countries and \nthe new international economic order, must have \npositive effects on North-South relations. In \n-order to make the establishment of the new \neconomic order possible, the third world States \nhave called for the beginning of a series of \nnegotiations on all aspects of international \nco-operation for development, in accordance with \nthe programmes of action approved by the General \nAssembly or recommended by various international \nbodies, in particular UNCTAD, with a view to the \nattainment of the objectives of the Third United \nNations Development Decade.\n\n156.\tExperience has shown that partial \neconomic solutions in the narrow national context \nand negotia-tions limited to specified sectors \nare only palliatives. The real solution is to be \nfound in global negotiations leading to \ncollective solutions to world economic problems.\n\n157.\tIt is regrettable that the developed \ncountries remain deaf to the appeals of the \ncountries of the third world and that they have \nstrengthened their protectionist tariff and \nnon-tariff measures and reduced the level of \ntheir external aid, which half had a serious \neffect on the terms of trade, the balance of \npayments and the employment situation. The \ndeterioration in the terms of trade and the \nincrease in indebtedness have shattered any hope \nof achieving economic and social development in \nthe developing countries, in particular the least \ndeveloped countries.\n\n158. The latest annual report of the World Bank \nshowed the weakness of the third world economies \nand drew attention to the dangers facing the poor \ncountries, particularly as regards agricultural \nproduction and food deficits. The rich countries \nmust therefore abandon their selfishness and \ntheir narrow national interests and recognize the \ninterdependence of the economic progress of the \nNorth and the need to speed up the economic, \nsocial and technical development of the South, \nbecause their common interests impose on all the \nparties the joint responsibility for establishing \na new international economic order and building a \nbetter world for all mankind.\n\n159. The entire international community should \nrejoice at the adoption of the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea by the majority \nof States Members. That Convention, which will be \nsigned officially in Jamaica in the first two \nweeks of December, is the culmination df \ntremendous efforts. We hope that certain Member \nStates will prove to be more flexible regarding \ntheir objections so that \\\"his Convention may come \ninto force after its signature and ratification. \nThis would make possible the establishment of a \nnew era of fruitful co-operation.\n\n160.\tThe Organization is a haven of peace and \nsecurity in a world swept by fierce winds of \nconflict, war and violence, and in which there is \nmuch under-development, poverty and injustice. It \nis a source' of hope for the alleviation and \nelimination of the evils of fear and underdevelopment. \nSince its inception in 1945 the Organization has \nmade possible profound changes in the political \nmap of the world. It has supported weak, \nconquered nations and helped them to achieve \nindependence; it has devoted its efforts to \nconciliation and the settlement of conflicts. It \nhas also opened up new perspectives in the field \nof international economic, scientific and \ncultural co-operation.\n\n161.\tDespite all this, an enormous task lies \nahead and demands our full support so that the \nnoble mission assigned to the United Nations \nunder the Charter may be fulfilled-that of \ncontributing to the prosperity and the well-being \nof mankind as a whole and of spreading peace and \nsecurity throughout the world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great pleasure to extend congratulations, \non behalf of the delegation of the Islamic \nRepublic of Mauritania, to the President on his \nunanimous election to guide this thirty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. This honour is \nundoubtedly due to his personal qualities as a \nstatesman and diplomat, and is also a tribute to \nhis country, Hungary. In discharging these high \nfunctions he may be assured of the availability \nof our delegation and its constant desire to \nco-operate with him. I should also like to thank \nhis predecessor, Mr. Kittani, for the exemplary \nway, displaying constant tact and objectivity, in \nwhich he conducted the thirty-sixth session of \nthe General Assembly and the subsequent special \nsessions.\nTo the Secretary-General the Mauritanian \ndelegation and I personally would like to extend \nthe sincere expression of our esteem. The report \non the work of the Organization which he has \nsubmitted bears witness to his great qualities of \ncourage, frankness and far-sightedness.\nThe picture of our universe today is a terrifying \none. It is not worthy of mankind which has come \nof age and should therefore be united and be \nresponsible. What is our verdict? Admittedly, \nthere has been agreement on the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea, but with the \nabstention of the majority of the developed \ncountries, in defiance of our ideology; it has \nproved impossible to make even a timid first step \ntowards the global negotiations; there has been a \ngeneral reduction in aid and development; the \nspecial session on disarmament ended in a notable \nfailure which may have sinister consequences; the \nconflicts in Palestine and the Middle East, in \nsouthern Africa and Western Sahara; have \ndeveloped in a most dangerous way; localized \nconflicts have continued in the Gulf, in \nAfghanistan and in Kampuchea, and other centres \nof tension have emerged.\nIn several respects the international situation \nbefore us is even more gloomy and alarming than \nwhat we faced just a year ago. We are all too \nfamiliar with the disastrous effects of the \ncrisis which for some years has been \ncharacteristic of international economic \nrelations for the developing countries. They \ninclude imported inflation, a sharp rise in \ninterest rates, with a disastrous effect on the \ndebt burden, an unprecedented fall in commodity \nprices, and increasingly restricted access to \ncapital markets.\nThe conclusions in the World Economy clearly show \nthat the recession in the industrialized \ncountries, far from receding has broadened and \nextended to all groups of countries. That study \nalso concluded that the decline in general \neconomic growth was more widespread in 1981 than \nat any other time since the Second World War. \nThus world trade has remained in a state of \nstagnation for the second consecutive year. In \nthe field of aid for development we have seen a \nconsiderable decrease in the share of this aid \nallocated through multilateral channels.\nThe practical measures which were drawn up at the \nUnited Nations Conference on Science and \nTechnology for Development, held at Vienna in \n1979, and the United Nations Conference on New \nand Renewable Sources of Energy, held at Nairobi \nin 1981, have remained a dead letter through the \nlack of funds. In a word, the development process \nin the world has come to a halt, as the Committee \nfor Development. Planning pointed out in its most \nrecent report.\nEverything indicates that the implementation of \nthe aims of the International Development \nStrategy for the Third United Nations Development \nDecade it is in a state of disarray. Such a \nfinding makes even clearer the urgent need to \nseek just and equitable global solutions for the \nserious problems which threaten all parts of the \ninternational community.\nThe proposal by the Sixth Conference of Heads of \nState or Government of Non-Aligned Countries for \nthe launching of global negotiations on \nco-operation and development, which has been \nbefore us Car three years now, is, in our \nopinion, both methodologically speaking, and \nbecause of its context, the only effective way to \nbring about such solutions. While welcoming the \npositive attitude of most of the developed \ncountries towards the most recent proposals made \nby the Group of 77, we cannot disguise our \ndisappointment at seeing that these proposals \nhave encountered stubborn resistance from those \nwho, for good or bad reasons, still refuse to \nrecognize the wisdom, the moderation, the \npractical and pragmatic nature of the formula \nproposed.\nThe interdependence of national economies, and \nthe repercussions of policies of a particular \ncountry or region on the world economy, no longer \nneed to be demonstrated. Fully aware of this \nreality, and in view of the fact that the \nNorth-South dialogue seems to be more and more \nbogged down in the meanderings of procedure, the \ndeveloping countries have conceived and \nimplemented an outline for multifarious \ncooperation among themselves. In this connection, \nwe are very pleased that the application of the \ngreat Caracas Plan of Action seems to be along \nthe right lines. Economic co-operation among the \ndeveloping countries, however, should in no case \nbe regarded as an alternative to North-South \nco-operation. Nor should it serve as a pretext \nfor the developed countries to shirk their \nresponsibilities.\n10.\tAfter a decade of hard work, negotiations \non the law of the sea have finally been completed \nand have resulted in the conclusion of the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea,' which \nwas adopted here this year. Major hopes are now \nplaced in this Convention which, because of the \npatience which has been shown and the mutual \nconcessions which have been made during its \ndrafting, is an encouraging example of what \nglobal negotiations can be, if the self-same \ndetermination to succeed and the necessary \npolitical will were to motivate the great Powers \nconcerned.\n11.\tThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania \nattaches particular interest to the action of the \nUnited Nations and the specialized agencies in \nthe fields of food and agriculture. This interest \narises from the predominance in our economy of \nactivities linked with the rural sector, which \nemploys approximately 80 per cent of our \npopulation, and which therefore is given absolute \npriority, and is absorbing an ever-growing share \nof the financial resources of the country. \nFaithful to the spirit of the Lagos Plan which \nmade food self-sufficiency for any viable \ndevelopment, my country has drawn up, and is \ntrying to implement, with the help of friendly \ncountries and international institutions, a \nnational policy based essentially on an increase \nin production.\nThe relative improvement which has been observed \nthis year in the world food situation, because of \nthe abundant harvests in certain developed \ncountries, should not blind us to another reality \nwhich is even more grievous, and that is that in \na number of developing countries food production \nhas increased much more slowly than the demand \nfor these products. Similarly, we favour the \nproposal which was put forward at the last \nsession of the World Food Council that a food \nreserve stock should be set up belonging to the \ndeveloping countries, with the aim of stabilizing \nthe grain market. Finally, in this connection I \nshould like to recall that the Permanent \nInter-State Committee on Drought Control in the \nSahel, of which my country is a member, has just \ndrawn up a programme, in co-operation with FAO, \ndesigned to set up a cereal reserve for the \nSahelian region.\nIn my diagnosis I have referred to the causes of \nthe deterioration in the international economic \nsituation and the considerable decline in aid for \ndevelopment which is chanelled through \nmultilateral institutions. No institution has \nsuffered more from the general lack of support \nfor the multilateral system of financing than the \nInternational Development Association and UNDP. \nThe attitude of the donor countries is \nparticularly regrettable, since it is precisely \nthe action of these two bodies which is most in \nharmony with and best adapted to the development \nefforts of the third world.\nThe reconstitution of the International \nDevelopment Association resources at previously \nagreed levels is therefore an immediate and \nimperativeneed. The financial situation of UNDP \nis all the more disquieting, since this is the \nmost important multilateral programme of the \nUnited Nations system. The stagnation of UNDP \nresources in 1980 and their decline in 1981 will, \naccording to all projections, have a disastrous \nimpact on the economies of developing countries, \nwhere the programme plays a vital financing and \ntechnical assistance role. However, we have no \ndoubt that, aware of the extreme seriousness of \nthe consequences of such a situation not only for \nthe developing countries but also for the \ninternational community as a whole, those who are \nfinancially able to do so will spare no effort or \nmeasure to bring UNDP out of this crisis. In this \nconnection the forthcoming pledging conference \nfor operational activities will undoubtedly \nprovide a test of political will.\n15.\tI do not wish to conclude my country's \nstatement on economic problems without referring \nbriefly to the disturbing aspect of the \nphenomenon of desertification in our national \nterritory and our efforts to try to limit its \ncatastrophic effects. In my country, after many \nyears of drought, encroachment of the desert is \ntaking on increasingly alarming proportions. \nThus, the fertile areas of our national territory \nhave been reduced considerably because of the \ndisastrous results of a persisting drought. \nConsequently, grain production has decreased from \n100,000 to 26,000 tons. Of the 108 million \nhectares which comprise our territory 15 million \nhad been classified as non-desert territory, of \nwhich 93 per cent have now been desertification \nin the course of the last 20 years. In order to \nface up to such a situation, the Mauritanian \nauthorities have adopted severe regulations for \nprotecting the fauna and flora and, in 1981 set \nup a National Committee to combat desertification \nand declared a National Arbor Day.\n16.\tOf course, in the Islamic Republic of \nMauritania, we are relying first and foremost on \nthe sense of sacrifice of our people and its \nwillingness to pursue faithfully the goals we \nhave set for ourselves. Nevertheless, the \nfinancial and technical means required for \nachieving this national programme satisfactorily \nare well beyond our own possibilities.\n17.\tIn this connection we have benefited from \nthe valued assistance of friendly countries and \ncertain international organizations. I avail \nmyself of this opportunity to express our \ngratitude to these friends \u2014too numerous to be \nmentioned by name here\u2014who have demonstrated to \nus their constant readiness to provide valuable \nassistance. Our appreciation also goes to the \nUnited Nations Sudano-Sahelian Office, which has \nin our country played a primary role in our \nnational mobilization for the struggle against \nthe phenomenon of desertification and other \nnatural disasters.\n18.\tAt a time when all hopes for optimism \nhave been dashed by international economic \nrelations that are characterized by the growing \ngap between the rich and poor countries and by \nthe obvious lack of political will to establish \nthe new international economic order in the near \nfuture, the special session of the General \nAssembly devoted to disarmament, held from 7 June \nto 9 July this year, further heightened our \ndisappointment and frustration in this field \nwhich is so vital for the security, if not the \nsurvival, of our species. The fact that the \nsession proved unsuccessful should not, however, \ndeflect us from the objectives pursued by our \npeoples for genuine and progressive disarmament \nboth in the nuclear field and in conventional \nweapons. This vital objective would not only \nensure preservation of mankind's many gains but \nalso make available for the economic and social \nprogress of all peoples the enormous financial \nresources at present devoted to the machinery of \ndeath and destruction which is linked to the \nindustrial infrastructure and the environment.\n19.\tStill in this area, the Islamic Republic \nof Mauritania would like to see the creation of \ndenuclearized zones in Africa and the Middle \nEast. We should particularly like to draw \nattention to the policies of nuclear armament of \nIsrael and South Africa and the growing \nco-operation between these two racist entities.\n20.\tOur country supports the demands of the \ncoastal countries of the Mediterranean and the \nIndian Ocean for these two regions to be \ntransformed into zones of peace.\n21.\tIn 1981 we stated in this Hall that as \nfar as the Zionist entity was concerned the whole \nworld was wrong and Israel alone was right. \nDespite our long experience of the practices, \nfalsifications and bad faith of the Zionist \nusurper, we did not think that we would be so \naccurate. Israel's suicidal folly, its arrogance, \nits contempt for international legality and the \nimpunity it continues to enjoy have strengthened \nits regime in the little heed it pays to \ninternational public opinion, particularly the \nUnited Nations, which is the conscience and \nrepository of the values of mankind and its \naspirations for peace and justice.\n22.\tWe shall not review the tragic events \nwhich were visited upon our Lebanese and \nPalestinian brothers in Lebanon. Nor shall we go \ninto the details of the long suffering of \ninnocent populations, witnessed by all mankind \nthat remained powerless but whose indignation was \naroused, and which ended with the indescribable \nmassacres of our brothers in Shatila and Sabra.\n23.\tWe should simply like to recall the facts \nwhich confirm the striking resemblance between \nthe methods of the Nazi murderers and those of an \nentity which claims to be the successor of the \nvictims of the holocausts and pogroms. Indeed, in \nthe Middle East, the Zionist entity is emulating \nthe Fascist regimes of days gone by and applying, \nin all their horror, the universally condemned \npractices of nazism in the form of so-called \npreventive wars of aggression; the crossing of \ninternational boundaries under the pretext of \ndefence; the methodical destruction and the siege \nof the capital of a sovereign country and the \nindiscriminate blockade imposed on civilian \npopulations through collective punishment; the \nblind massacre of civilian populations by the \nthousands and the bringing about of general \ninsecurity in the name of security for its own \ncitizens; and the genocide of an entire people \nboth on its usurped land in all its havens of \nrefuge.\n24.\tThis is an occasion to pay a tribute to \nthe courage of the fighters of the Palestine \nLiberation Organization and to bow our heads in \nmemory of all the martyrs of the Palestinian \nresistance.\n25.\tIsrael's disproportionate deployment of \nbrute force, its rejection of all moral codes and \nits arrogant display of racial contempt and \nreligious fanaticism have demonstrated to the \nentire membership of the Organization the real \npurposes of the entity whose ideology can easily \nbe mistaken for exacerbated chauvinism, the \noppression of others and the denial of their \nrights. Israel's stubborn refusal to bring about \npeace in the Middle East unless it be on its own \nconditions by legalizing its hegemony in the \nregion, which is the consistent policy of \nZionism, is today the subject of universal \ncondemnation. The pursuit of the plan undertaken \nhalf a century ago for the physical elimination \nof the Palestinian people and the usurpation of \nits land shows that the goal of Zionist \nimplantation is to blot out all traces of its \ncrime by a \\\"final solution\\\" of sorry memory.\n26.\tIt goes without saying that neither the \nArab nation, the victim of this ongoing \naggression, nor the international community as a \nwhole can accept this diktat on the part of the \nZionist entity and the repeated challenges to any \nglobal consensus and the relevant resolutions \nthat have time and again been adopted by the \nSecurity Council and the General Assembly.\n27.\tAs has always been the case, genuine and \nlasting peace in the Middle East and real \nsecurity for all must necessarily be based upon \nthe unconditional and complete withdrawal of \nIsraeli occupying forces from all occupied Arab \nterritories, including the Holy City of Al Quds \nand the recovery by the Palestinian people, under \nthe leadership of its sole legitimate \nrepresentative, the PLO, of its inalienable \nrights, particularly its sacred right to set up \nits own sovereign State on the land of its \nancestors.\n28.\tAny other approach would be to reward \narrogance, aggression and blackmail in that \nregion and would engender a new cycle of violence \nthat would endanger the stability of the entire \nMiddle East and peace throughout the world. \nDespite the desire for peace which has undeniably \nbeen shown on a number of occasions by the Arab \nnation, the Zionist enemy persists in its \nconstant refusal to envisage any policies which \ndo not endorse its own tremendous territorial \nappetite and its determination to annex \npermanently the Syrian Golan Heights and the \nPalestinian territories, as well as its senseless \ndream of exercising tutelage over the destinies \nof the peoples of the Arab east.\n29.\tAs we said last year, the Organization \nmust take the enforcement measures contained in \nthe Charter and make Israel abide by the rules of \ninternational law and our repeated decisions. It \nis for the United States of America, which gives \nIsrael massive military and financial aid and \nsustained political assistance, to assume the \nvery special responsibilities conferred upon it \nas a permanent member of the Security Council, \nand fulfil as soon as possible the weighty duty \nwhich derives from its dual role as a friend and \nally of the Zionist entity, by exerting the \nnecessary pressure on Israel to ensure that it \nabides by the rules of ethics and international \nlegality.\n30.\tWe should like to reiterate to our \nbrother people of Lebanon the expression of our \nsolidarity with it in achieving its objectives\u2014to \nliberate its homeland, preserve its territorial \nintegrity and bring about the unity of its people \nin the context of the global strategy of the \nwhole Arab nation. We appeal to friendly and \nfraternal States and to the international \ncommunity as a whole to redouble their efforts to \nensure that Lebanon receives all necessary \nsupport in reconstructing its country and \nensuring the immediate and unconditional \nwithdrawal of Israeli troops from its soil.\n31.\tIn southern Africa, another area of major \nconcern for our country, we deplore the delay in \nNamibia's liberation and the increased \naggressiveness of the South African regime, both \ninside the country, and also outside where it is \ndirected against the front-line States. The \nNamibian problem remains unchanged. In the \nopinion of our delegation, the only realistic \nbasis for re-establishing international legality \nand ending the usurpation of  at Territory is \nSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978).\n32.\tWe take note of the fact that the contact \ngroup of Western States has reaffirmed its \ncommitment concerning the expeditious \nimplementation of that resolution so that the \nNamibian people can exercise its right to \nself-determination. While welcoming the \npraiseworthy efforts made by the five Western \ncountries in order to bring about a friendly \nsettlement of the Namibian crisis, we cannot \nshare either their optimism or all their \nconcerns. Indeed, it is not at all obvious to the \nfree peoples of Africa that there is any real \ndesire in Pretoria to resolve the existing \nconflict peacefully, legally and democratically. \nFurthermore, while we respect the rights of all \nthe ethnic communities in Namibia, we refuse to \nrecognize that the minority which is of European \norigin has special exclusive rights, and, in \nparticular, an exaggerated right of veto.\n33.\tSo far as the principle of security is \nconcerned, we are amazed that the only concerns \nwhich seem to prevail in certain Western circles \nrelate to South Africa's security, like the \nsecurity of Israel. In our opinion, this is \nputting the cart before the horse. In the eyes of \nthe Islamic Republic of Mauritania the security \nthat is being denied and violated is that of the \nAfrican people. Our country would like once again \nto reaffirm that the only conceivable security \nfor all is in the speedy establishment of the \nState of Namibia by the implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978) in full \nassociation with the South West Africa People's \nOrganization, the sole, legitimate representative \nof the people of the Territory. Within the \nfrontiers of South Africa, and despite the \nso-called improvement in racial segregation\u2014as if \nthere could be such a thing\u2014the apartheid regime \nremains fundamentally as it always has \nbeen\u2014contemptuous, inhumane, exploitative and \nrepulsive.\n34.\tThis is, an occasion to pay a \nwell-deserved tribute to our brothers in the \nAfrican National Congress who, by their passive \nand active opposition to this barbaric regime, \nhave reinforced the faith of the oppressed \nmillions in the possibility of a multiracial and \negalitarian South African society.\n35.\tfollowing the same path as Zionism, \napplies its criminal laws against African \npatriots and outside the country acts as the \npoliceman by its almost permanent occupation of a \npart of the sister Republic of Angola and its \nperiodic incursions against Angola, Mozambique, \nZimbabwe, Zambia and the other countries in \nsouthern Africa. This is an opportunity to \nexpress our solidarity with those brother \ncountries, victims of the indescribable acts of \naggression perpetrated by the racist regime of \nSouth Africa. We also reaffirm our total \ncommitment to stand side by side with these \nfront-line countries.\n36.\tQuite apart from these anachronistic \nattempts at colonization, in the Arab east and in \nsouthern Africa in the twilight of classical \ncolonialism, new embers of tension have begun to \nsmoulder in recent years in various parts of the \nworld. Of all those armed conflicts, which for \nthe people and Government of Mauritania are \nsubjects of deep concern, that in Western Sahara \nis the one which most closely affects my country. \nIndeed, for practically seven years now Western \nSahara has been fighting a difficult war to \nensure national survival and to be able to give \nexpression to its inalienable right to \nself-determination and independence.\n37.\tWe make an urgent appeal that this \nruinous and useless war should be brought to an \nend, a war which has pitted against each other \ntwo fraternal peoples, which is taking place very \nclose to our frontiers, and which entails the \ncertain danger of engulfing the whole region and \nleading to an international conflict. The Islamic \nRepublic of Mauritania, which sees the admission \nof the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic to the \nOrganization of African Unity as a positive \nfactor, will give its sincere support to any \npractical solutions accepted by the two parties \nconcerned, the Moroccans and the Sahraouis, which \ncould put an end to their fratricidal \nconfrontation.\n38.\tNevertheless, as we have repeatedly \nstated, our country remains convinced that the \nonly possible means of achieving genuine peace, \nthen the necessary reconciliation, and finally a \nnatural co-operation, requires the opening of a \nconstructive dialogue directed to beginning the \ndirect negotiations which are an indispensable \nprerequisite to the conclusion of a peace \nagreement. As we see it, that agreement should \nlead eventually to the self-determination and \ncomplete independence of the Sahraoui people, \nthus removing any obstacles and constraints of an \nadministrative or military nature. That would \nremove the final obstacle to the building of a \nfraternal, egalitarian and closely united Arab \nMaghreb.\n39.\tThis cursory survey of the burning \nproblems in our continent reminds us that Africa, \nwhich in the past suffered the terrible \nexploitation of its human and material resources, \nand which is now the target of imperialist \nappetites and intervention, needs, more than ever \nbefore, the cohesion of all the countries which \nmake it up.\n40.\tThe OAU, which was created in 1963 and is \nbased on the common aspiration of our peoples to \nachieve fully political and economic liberation \nof all its members and of all colonial \nterritories, will, in spite of everything, be \nable to preserve its essential unity and its firm \nfaith in its charter and its fundamental \nprinciples.\n41.\tThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania, a \ncountry ideally suited to meetings and exchanges \namong all the members of the African family, is \nfirmly convinced that our continental \norganization will once again surmount its \ntemporary difficulties by closing ranks, while at \nthe same time avoiding the sacrifice of thesacred \nprinciples of pan-Africanism, namely, the equal \nright that all enjoy to self-determination and \ntheir inalienable right to national independence.\n42.\tIn the Gulf area, two countries that are \nboth members, as are we of the Islamic Ummah and \nthe non-aligned movement, have been confronting \neach other for more than two years in a \ndevastating war, at enormous cost both in human \nlives and in the destruction of a valuable \neconomic infrastructure. The Islamic Republic of \nMauritania would like to reiterate its heartfelt \nappeal for the cessation of hostilities between \nour brothers in Iraq and the Islamic Republic of \nIran and for negotiations to be opened between \nthem to reach a permanent solution to their \ndifferences.\n43.\tAnother equally unfortunate conflict is \ncontinuing in Afghanistan as a result of the \ninvasion of that country in violation of its \nsovereignty. Once again, we appeal for the \ncomplete and unconditional withdrawal of all \nforeign troops from the national territory of \nAfghanistan and for respect for the sovereignty \nof that country, for the integrity of its \nnational territory and for the sovereign right of \nits people to seek their own progress in \naccordance with their historic heritage and their \nsocio-cultural values.\n44.\tThe same is true with regard to the \nMember nation, which has also been the victim of \nfashion and prolonged military occupation. In \nthis connection, we would like to welcome the \nconstitution of a national front under the \nleadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, and we \nappeal for the withdrawal of foreign troops from \nthe national territory of Democratic Kampuchea.\n45.\tWe reaffirm our adherence to the \nDeclaration of the International Conference on \nKampuchea of July 19816 and to all the \nresolutions of the Organization calling for \nrespect for the sovereignty of Kampuchea and for \nan end to foreign interference in its internal \naffairs and respect for its people's sovereign \nright to organize their own national life in a \ndemocratic manner without any outside \ninterference.\n46.\tIn general terms, we condemn the claims \nof Powers, whether large, medium-sized or small, \nto arrogate to themselves the right to modify by \nforce the regime of a neighbouring country if \nthey judge it to be hostile.\n47.\tA secure world of nations joined together \nin independence and solidarity and determined to \nshoulder the noble responsibility incumbent on \nmankind cannot, obviously, live by the \nanachronisms of the past and by social and \npolitical injustice. There can be no other way to \nsatisfy the rights of peoples to national \ndifferentiation and the realization of their \naspirations to freedom and progress, than by \nbanishing all hegemonistic trends. There can be \nno other way to achieve the rights of every man \nto a life in dignity than through the triumph of \nfundamental freedoms. There can be no other way \nto redress on a global scale of all the damaging \neconomic relations that result from subjection or \nfrom structural imbalances than by setting up an \nequitable world economy.\n48.\tA world for tomorrow, one that man can \nlive in\u2014all men, equally\u2014must be built on justice \nand equality or it cannot be built at all. Let us \nliberate those peoples still under domination, \nthe victims of those who would deny them their \nidentity and their right to a homeland and a \nname. Let us destroy the barriers that prevent \nmen from achieving their dream of a life worthy \nof being lived in freedom and from satisfying \ntheir basic social and cultural needs. Let us put \nan end to the unjust heritage of an outrageous \ncolonialism and to the further deprivations \ncaused by an ill-adapted world economy suitable \nneither to equity nor to the aspirations and \ninterests of all men, in North and South alike.\n49.\tLet us, in other words, work devotedly to \nensure the emergence of a new international order \nworthy of this end of the twentieth century that \nshould witness the triumph of a united \ncivilization brought together not around the \nvalues of a single continent or spiritual family, \nbut imbued with a common heritage rich in its \nvery diversity,\n50.\tWe will thereby have undoubtedly laid the \ngroundwork for a new equilibrium that will be \nmore realistic, more peaceful, more stable and \nmore human. Indeed, we will have opened the way \ntowards the realization of one of the noblest \nwishes of the drafters of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, who stages three years after one \nof the most fearsome catastrophes of our time, \ntheir determination \\\"to saw succeeding \ngenerations from the scourge of war\\\".\n\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, in congratulating Mr. Hollai on his \nunanimous election to the presidency, I wish to \nexpress the confidence of the Spanish delegation \nin his experience and knowledge of the questions \nthat we shall be discussing and assure him of our \nco-operation to ensure that this thirty-seventh \nsession will be crowned with success.\n\n199.\tI should also like to congratulate the \noutgoing President, Mr. Kittani, who conducted \nthe work of the Assembly during the past year \nwith a sense of impartiality and wisdom that we \nall should recognize and appreciate.\n\n200.\tFor the first time in the history of the \nOrganization, the responsibility of conducting \nthe work of the Secretariat has fallen to a Latin \nAmerican. Spain shares the satisfaction and \nlegitimate pride of Peru and all the peoples of \nLatin America. Today we reiterate our confidence, \nalready confirmed by the facts, in the political \nskill of Mr. Perez de Cuellar. His experience and \nability, well known to us, have been manifested \nin recent months during critical times at which \nhe has shown himself capable of placing his full \nefforts at the service of the cause of peace with \npatience, wisdom and dedication.\n\n201.\tDuring the year that has elapsed since \nthe beginning of the last session of the \nAssembly, it could not be said that the United \nNations has reached the goals of international \nco-operation and coexistence laid down in the \nCharter. In addition to problems inherited from \nthe past, we have seen new tension and conflicts \nemerge with their tragic sequel of loss of human \nlives, irreparable damage, suffering and the \ndevelopment of potentially still more dangerous \nsituations. Unfortunately, all this casts greater \ndiscredit upon the Organization. Both in \ndisarmament and in the progress of economic \nco-operation, two serious questions, progress has \nbeen practically nonexistent.\n\n202.\tMy country has been a member of the \nSecurity Council for some two years. From this \nposition of responsibility we have been able to \ntake an active part in the consideration of \nmatters such as the Middle East conflict, the \nsituation in southern Africa, the crisis in \nLebanon and the problem of the Malvinas.\n\n203.\tIn each case, we have maintained an \nabsolutely independent position, based on the \napplication of principles of our foreign policy \nin defence of the Charter and of the resolutions \nadopted in the United Nations. We have constantly \nendeavoured to ensure that the action of the \nCouncil was sufficiently prompt and effective to \nprevent open confrontations and loss of human \nlife.\n\n204.\tThe Spanish delegation has taken part \nboth in the deliberations of the Council and in \nnegotiations among its members and interested \nparties in the solution of conflicts. When we \nhave felt that our initiative was necessary, we \nhave placed before the Council draft resolutions \ninspired by those principles and by humanitarian \nreasons.\n\n205.\tAt times our efforts have led to the \nadoption of resolutions. At other times, they \nhave been blocked. Unfortunately, some countries \nhave placed greater trust in victory by arms than \nin the fruits of dialogue and negotiation. We are \nat least left with the satisfaction of knowing \nthat we have put forward appeals and proposals \nfor peace, negotiation and compromise when there \nwas still time to prevent bloodshed. Still, a \nminimum of lucidity suggests that once again, \nthis year, the reason of force has made more \nheadway than has the force of reason.\n\n206.\tDuring the past year, Spain has pursued \nits course towards full membership in the \npolitical, economic and defence institutions of \nthe world to which it belongs. It has done so \nfaithful to its European and Western vocation and \naware that the defence of its national interests \nand of international peace and progress required \nthe full normalization of its presence in its \nnatural forums and aware also that through that \nnormalization it was serving the objectives of \nequality and absolute and uncompromising defence \nof its own sovereignty. These are objectives \nwhich are best served by participation rather \nthan by maintaining anomalous positions of \ndissociation and indirect links with those \nforums. This was required by our history, our \nculture and our own geographical situation and \nmade possible by the full restoration of the \npolitical values of freedom and pluralistic \ndemocracy.\n\n207.\tWe are taking our place in Europe and the \nWest. We are doing so in conditions of equality \nand respect for our sovereignty, overcoming the \nmerely indirect relationship which previously \nexisted. We have done so aware that it does not \ndiminish but rather enhances our independence for \noutside action and our capacity for activity in \nthe world; good proof of this has been our \ninvolvement with the Security Council.\n\n208.\tWe have done so with the certainty that \nour action is not directed against anyone but \nonly in favour of our national interests and \nrights\u00f3aware, finally, that the historic \nrestitution of Spain to a position of equality \nwith the rest of the West enriches and gives \nmeaning, depth and coherence to the other innate \nand profound dimension of our historical being, \nthe Latin American dimension, and at the same \ntime encourages our involvement in other forums \nof particular relevance, such as relations with \nthe Mediterranean, Arab and African nations.\n\n209.\tIn recent years, our relations with the \nbrother peoples of America have grown \nspectacularly in the area of economic, commercial \nand technical exchanges, cultural and educational \nco-operation and Spain's presence, contacts and \nfull participation in the institutional framework \nbeing shaped by that community of nations.\n\n210.\tThus, we have now become members of ECLA \nand observers in the Andean Pact and we have, as \nfull-fledged members, subscribed to the Andres \nBello Convention this year and the Hipolito \nInanue and Simon Rodriguez conventions in 1981. \nIt is clear that greater involvement by Spain in \nits environment enables its presence in the \nAmericas and the Americas' presence in Spain to \nhave greater depth, impetus and promise.\n\n211.\tBut, above all, we maintain with Latin \nAmerica a common political will, seeking to \nensure that in the United Nations and in other \ninternational forums to which Spain belongs we \ncan advance and defend tin problems and just \ncauses of those brother nations which Spain \ndefends as its own.\n\n212.\tThese months of crises and international \nproblems have been particularly difficult for \nLatin America. The grave situation in Central \nAmerica, with its tragic spiral of violence and \ntension which threaten to spill over the borders \nof the States of that region, is taking on \nalarming proportions. The instability is growing \nthrough the deterioration of national economies;, \naggravated by adverse international economic \nfactors and a lack of understanding on the part \nof the economically powerful countries, which \nreduce to cold figures the treatment of issues so \nbasic to Latin America as trade of commodities, \non which the development and survival of entire \npeoples depend.\n\n213.\tVarious plans and peace proposals for \nCentral America have not attained the objectives \nset. The coherent and reasonable plan of \nPresident Lopez Portillo of Mexico, proposals for \nCentral American meetings emanating from Panama \nhave not reached a stage of maturity and \nexecution because the common horizon is darkened \nby misunderstanding and violence.\n\n214.\tSpain is continuing to give priority \nattention to and show greater concern for the \ndevelopment of the Central American tragedy. We \nconsider it necessary to design a pattern of \nsolutions based on a number of basic ideas, which \nin our judgement could be the following: \nrejection of so-called military solutions, which \nlack effectiveness; reliance on political \nnegotiations involving all national forces; an \nappeal to the principle of non-intervention, \nwhich must be applied strictly in Latin America \nto ensure that each people can determine its own \nfate; a willingness to assist in the \nconsolidation of democratic and pluralistic \nalternatives, convinced of the need to organize \npeaceful coexistence on the basis of a respect \nfor life and freedom and the requirements of \nsocial justice; and unequivocal and \nindiscriminate condemnation of the violation of \nhuman rights, without any territorial or \nideological exceptions.\n\n215.\tIn affirming these ideas the Spanish \nGovernment will always be ready to contribute its \nefforts and determination, as we have said before \nin United Nations forums and as we publicly \nproclaimed in the Bogota Declaration last August. \nSpain understands the deep roots of the problems \nof these nations. We feel these problems as our \nown, and we know that it is unrealistic to trust \nthat the course of time or unilateral formulas \nwill resolve them, because the Central American \nsituation needs solutions urgently, before it \ndeteriorates into a conflict affecting the entire \narea and becomes one of the major focal points of \nworld crisis.\n\n216.\tThe renewed Central American tragedy is \neven more regrettable in that it is avoidable. \nAll that is necessary is a collective commitment \nto respect borders; to give Central American \nStates the assurance that there will be no \ninterference and that there will be \nself-determination for their peoples; to refrain \nfrom sabre-rattling, which makes neighbouring \ncountries nervous and causes them to give the \nacquisition of weapons precedence over the \nsatisfaction of social needs; to make the \nnecessary effort to modernize their societies and \nencourage scrupulous respect for human rights. If \nwe all dedicate ourselves to the task of \nencouraging the restoration of social and \npolitical balances, facilitating negotiation \nbetween democratic and representative forces and \navoiding the possible dead-end of armed \nconfrontation and political polarization, we \nshall have embarked upon a road leading to peace \nand stability in the entire zone. The Spanish \nGovernment whole-heartedly desires that peace and \nstability and is prepared to co-operate fully, \ntogether with sister republics of Latin America, \nin the achievement of that noble objective.\n\n217.\tAnother focal point of tension in Latin \nAmerica has been in the South Atlantic, where a \ncolonial situation has led to bloodshed and a \ntragic war. The Spanish Government has followed \nwith concern and anxiety the development of the \narmed conflict in the Malvinas, a confrontation \nwhich should never have happened and which could \nhave been avoided if appeals for dialogue and \nnegotiation, insistently repeated by Spain, had \nbeen heeded. It is well known that my country \nmade a number of attempts, both bilaterally and \ninternationally, to halt the escalation towards a \nsenseless and anachronistic war, in an effort to \navoid bloodshed, the enormous material losses and \nthe opening of a huge abyss of resentment and \nmisunderstanding between Latin America and \nEurope. The Secretary-General and other countries \njoined in this effort, but our appeals were not \nheeded, with the disastrous consequences of which \nwe all know.\n\n218.\tIt is now our duty, since it was \nimpossible to avoid war, to redouble our efforts \nto ensure peace in the future. To that end Spain, \nwhich opposed the use of force as a means of \nsettling international disputes from the \nbeginning of the crisis, considers it \nindispensable that negotiations on the substance \nof the problem be opened, the substance being \nnone other than decolonization of the Territory, \nin order to achieve a diplomatic solution which \nwould contemplate the restoration of the \nterritorial integrity of Argentina and \nsafeguarding and guaranteeing the legitimate \ninterests and rights of the population of the \nMalvinas. This is the only way we can \ndefinitively eliminate the roots of a conflict \nwhich would otherwise become a permanent source \nof tension and destabilization throughout the \nregion, with the foreseeable negative impact on \nrelations between Europe and Latin America, which \nwe believe must be harmonious and must be \nimproved.\n\n219.\tIn recent months the situation in the \nMiddle East has continually worsened. Despite the \nexistence of some positive elements, such as the \nrecovery of the whole of the Sinai by Egypt, \nother developments, such as the illegal \nannexation of the Golan Heights and, more \nrecently, the brutal armed intervention by Israel \nin Lebanon, with its consequent tragedies, have \nposed a constant challenge to the international \ncommunity and have seriously disturbed the \nconscience of mankind.\n\n220.\tSpain has co-operated actively in the \nSecurity Council in the search for a solution and \nhumanitarian activities to alleviate the \nsufferings of the Lebanese and Palestinian \npeoples. The results achieved have been modest. \nThe resolutions of the Security Council, which \nare binding upon all Member States, have remained \nineffective. We have seen the powerlessness of \nthe Organization to prevent the invasion of \nLebanon, the assault upon Beirut and, in a \ncontext in which the horror of the deed was much \ngreater than any political consideration, the \nsacrifice of hundreds of innocent victims in the \nPalestinian refugee camps, an act of barbarism \nsuch as we had thought was a thing of the past.\n221.\tIn the ruins of Beirut and the renewed \ntragedy of the Palestinian people, however, some \nelements can be perceived that would seem to \npoint towards the beginning of a solution. For \nmany years Spain has stated in this forum that \nany solution to the Middle East conflict must \nnecessarily include recognition of the national \nrights of the Palestinian people.\n\n222.\tThe principles of Security Council \nresolution 242 (1967) remain valid and include \nwithdrawal from all the occupied territories and \nthe right of all States of the area to live in \npeace within secure and recognized boundaries, a \nright which Spain accepts, recognizes and \nrespects and from which it excludes none. But \ntogether with this recognition it is necessary to \nview the Palestinian phenomenon in its full \ndimensions. Spain welcomes the new proposals, \nespecially the Arab plan prepared in Fez, with \noptimism. These are gaining growing acceptance as \ncontaining all the political elements necessary \nto ensure a just, lasting and comprehensive \nsolution to the Middle East problem.\n\n223.\tSpain seeks to intensify its co-operation \nwith all the countries of Africa, being closely \ninvolved with the problems affecting that \ncontinent. We feel ourselves linked with those \ncountries, more especially the northern African \ncountries, for reasons which go beyond immediate \ngeographical proximity, including the old \nhistorical and cultural ties which unite us with \nthe Arab nation.\n\n224.\tSpain's determination to maintain \npermanent and fruitful co-operation with the \nneighbouring countries of the Maghreb is well \nknown, as is our desire to ensure that the \nproblem of Western Sahara is solved to the \nsatisfaction of all parties, in accordance with \nthe principles and resolutions of the United \nNations and the OAU and the expression of the \nwill of the people.\n\n?25. We believe that a decisive role must be \nplayed by the OAU in the solution of the problems \nof the continent and in eliminating the tension \nexisting today. Spain's determination to \nco-operate in the African continent, expressed \nboth in our political statements and in our \ngrowing links of co-operation wit: various \ncountries of that continent, is of signal value \nin the case of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, \na Spanish-speaking African nation now going \nthrough a vital stage of renovation of its \npolitical institutions with the approval by \nreferendum of a new constitution and is making \ngreat efforts for economic development and \nreorganization. Spain views with satisfaction the \nconvening, under the auspices of the United \nNations, of a pledging conference for that \nRepublic, a conference in which it took an active \npart. It will continue to enhance its links of \nco-operation with that nation, always adapting \nthem to the will expressed by the people and \nGovernment of that nation, in strict respect for \nits options, its independence and its sovereignty.\n\n226. With respect to the problem of Namibia, we \nview with concern the fact that our hopes for an \nimminent settlement are now meeting with new and \ngrowing difficulties. Spain considers necessary \nthe immediate implementation of the plans for the \nindependence of the Territory contained \nessentially in Security Council resolutions 385 \n(1976) and 435 (1978), whose principles and \nprovisions we support.\n\n227.\tWe reiterate our rejection of the heinous \npractice of apartheid which constitutes not only \na flagrant violation of human rights but a source \nof grave tension endangering peace and security \nin the Region and representing a permanent \nchallenge to the Organization.\n\n228.\tWith regard to the problem of Cyprus, we \nfavour the continuation of all efforts to \nrelaunch, under the auspices of the Organization, \nthe intercommunal dialogue upon which the future \nof peaceful coexistence favouring the economic \ndevelopment of the Cypriot people must be based, \nin order to ensure that a satisfactory solution \nmay be achieved on the basis of respect for the \nsovereignty, independence and territorial \nintegrity of Cyprus.\n\n229.\tIn other areas of the world there remain \ntension and armed confrontations to which the \nOrganization must attempt to put an end. The war \nbetween Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran, to \ncite only one example, has now lasted for more \nthan two years, with enormous losses of human \nlives and suffering for both parties. The Spanish \nGovernment views with distress and concern this \nconflict between two friendly countries and is \nprepared to support every effort designed to \nachieve a solution.\n\n230.\tWith regard to Afghanistan, three years \nafter the invasion there is still no glimpse of a \nsolution to this foreign armed intervention which \nwe have repeatedly denounced. We must continue to \ninsist on the exercise of international pressure \nto bring about the liberation of Afghanistan. \nTherefore we hope that the General Assembly will \nreiterate its resolutions demanding the \nwithdrawal of the foreign military forces and \ncalling for the restoration of Afghanistan as a \nfree and independent country.\n\n231.\tIn Gibraltar there persists a situation \nwhich must be brought to an end according to the \nrecommendations of the United Nations, through \nnegotiation between Spain and the United Kingdom. \nThis principle has been accepted by the British \nGovernment, which, in signing the Declaration of \nLisbon^ committed itself to resolving through \nnegotiation with Spain all differences concerning \nGibraltar, in a spirit of friendship and in \nconformity with relevant resolutions of the \nUnited Nations\u00f3a commitment that was reiterated \non later occasions.\n\n232.\tThe climate of dialogue and \nunderstanding, the favourable climate which must \nnecessary precede or accompany a negotiation \nwhich for us is of decisive importance, was \nmodified by subsequent events which have brought \nabout postponements. There have been \ncircumstances that have affected negatively the \nintensity, the earnestness, the seriousness and \nthe depth which these negotiations require. The \ncourse of authentic negotiation is the course \nthat Spain has long since chosen, in conformity \nwith the United Nations decisions and parallel \nwith activities in other forums, it is also the \nonly possible course. We are convinced that the \npersistence of a situation such as this is \ncontrary to the purposes and principles of the \nCharter, as the Assembly has repeatedly declared. \nWe also believe that two democratic countries \nsuch as Spain and the United Kingdom must resolve \nthis problem by the civilized method of dialogue \nand negotiation. However, the negotiation must be \nauthentic and conducted m good faith, and cover, \nof course, all the elements of the problem and \nessentially the one constituting the very root of \nthe dispute: the question of sovereignty. Any \nattempt to avoid that element because of \ntemporary circumstances, however strong the \npassions aroused, would constitute a grave \nresponsibility and could endanger the process of \nresolving the problem as it has been set forth.\n\n233.\tWith regard to the population of \nGibraltar, I wish to reiterate once more that \nSpain accepts the idea that its interests must be \nborne in mind and fully safeguarded in the \nnegotiations and that the preservation and \npromotion of their well-being and the protection \nof their rights must also be part of the solution \nof the problem. The Spanish Government has no \nhostility towards that population, nor has it any \nintention of interfering with its citizenship or \nany other questions of that nature in its \nrelations with the United Kingdom.\n\n234.\tSpain has the irrevocable objective of \nrestoring its territorial integrity by \nrecovering? through negotiations with the United \nKingdom, that portion of its territory, while \npreserving the interests, rights and well-being \nof the population. This has been the doctrine of \nthe United Nations, according to which the \nprinciple of territorial integrity, enshrined in \nparagraph 6 of the Declaration in Assembly \nresolution 1314 (XV), is applicable in this case, \ntaking precedence over any other criterion. This \ndoctrine has been estate listed by the United \nNations in an irreversible dear and manifest \nmanner for the solution of this problem.\n\n233. I wish to refer to various matters which \ndemonstrate both the essential nature of the work \nwe are doing in the Organization and the lack of \neffectiveness -chat the Organization has, \nunfortunately, had in recent years.\n\n236.\tThe first is the matter of human rights, \nwhich by its very nature is the ultimate goal of \nall political activity and of all organizations \nsuch as this one. Proper observance of human \nrights is the key to the peaceful solution of \nnational and international problems.\n\n237.\tSpain values respect for these rights \nnationally and internationally, with the \nintensity and passion of one who has recovered \nsomething he lost. The constitutional recognition \nof the value of international and European claims \nin this matter, the acceptance of all mechanisms \nfor monitoring at the international and European \nlevels, the full participation and assumption of \ninitiatives in every facet of the work of the \nCouncil of Europe, the United Nations and other \nbodies in these fields\u00f3these are clearly well \nknown and demonstrate the sincerity of our \nposition. There remains a great deal to be done \nin the protection and safeguarding of human \nrights, removing this question, as I have said \nbefore, from the geographical or ideological \nlimitations with which it is sometimes viewed, \nlimitations which because of their basic \ninsincerity prevent effective progress from being \nmade.\n\n238.\tThe first human right is the right to \nlife, a right which is being infringed every day \nby terrorists. Terrorism crosses all borders and \nthere must be international co-operation in order \neffectively to combat it. On previous occasions \nwe have spoken of that necessity and, more \nspecifically, I stated the following to the \nAssembly at the thirty-sixth session:\n\\\"... we cannot compromise with terrorists without \nendangering peace. No one can claim to be \npersecuted for political reasons\u00f3an allegation \nall too often made by the terrorist\u00f3if that \nperson is free in a free political society. \nWherever political change can be sought without \nrisk through regular elections allowing free \nexpression of every option, none can claim to be \npersecuted for political reasons. There are no \npolitical offenders in a real democracy: if it is \na democracy they do not exist; if they exist it \nis hot a democracy.\n\n\\\"It is abnormal to impose by force a nonexistent \nand brutal 'right' to kill and to seek protection \noutside one's borders, claiming that political \nfreedom is needed when it already exists.\\\"\n\n239.\tThat co-operation for which I appealed \nlast year is something that we have called for \nand sought firmly and emphatically, in all its \ndimensions and in all forums in which we are \nrepresented. In European and Western forums, as \nin international organizations, we have \ncontributed to creating sensitivity to and \narousing awareness of the immoral and obnoxious \ncharacter of terrorism and of its serious social \nand political aspects. The progress achieved, \nhowever, should not lead us to forget the \ncontinued existence, in increasingly isolated \ncases, of indifference or lack of solidarity, the \nexplanation of which can only lie in \nshort-sighted and suicidal egoism, and which is \nparticularly serious and painful when the \ncountries concerned have common borders.\n\n240.\tAnother aspect which an international \norganization must constantly bear in mind in \ndealing with human rights is the situation of \nimmigrants. If there is a group of human beings \nwho, together with refugees, deserve \ninternational understanding and protection they \nare immigrants. Spain will continue to work for \nthe adoption of a set of clear and precise rules \neffectively protecting the rights of immigrants \nand foreign workers, who need legal protection, \nsocial solidarity and economic security. The \nGovernment of Spain has presented specific \nproposals and working documents to the General \nAssembly designed to bring about a speedy \ninternational agreement guaranteeing the rights \nof migrant workers.\n\n241. Not only has the international economic \npicture failed to improve but all indicators \nsuggest that it may deteriorate still further in \ncoming months. The financial crisis which \nthreatens to distort the entire international \nmonetary system and imbalances in commodity \nmarkets which affect the most vulnerable \neconomies are leading the least developed \ncountries into increasingly untenable situations.\n\n242. Spain favours global negotiations conducted \nwithin the framework of the United Nations. The \npreparations for the negotiations should be open \nto all States concerned to avoid the danger of a \nrepetition of the problems that arose in \nconnection with the North-South dialogue. The \nexperience of recent years has demonstrated the \ninterdependence of the different economies, which \nare affected by global problems which can only be \nsolved through proposals and negotiations in \nwhich all the interested parties are involved.\n\n243.\tIt is obvious that one of the reasons for \nthe economic difficulties is the arms race. In \nthis field Spain, as is evident and is recognized \nby all, has made national defence, politically, \ninternationally and militarily, genuine defence, \nwithout threatening anyone, and proclaims its \nconcern about the arms race as well as the \nevasiveness and insincerity of those who really \ncould contribute to disarmament.\n\n244.\tThe Government of Spain has taken many \ninitiatives in this field and supports all \ninitiatives which, based on realism and the \neffective preservation of security and balance \nand not on Manichean consideration or the desire \nto spread propaganda, could lead to progress in \nthis field.\n\n245.\tOn 12 October the decade that will \nculminate in 1992, the date which will mark the \nfive-hundredth anniversary of the discovery of \nAmerica, will begin. When on that dawn in 1492 \nthe three Spanish vessels reached the coast of \nAmerica, communication was established between \nthe old lands of Europe and a fabulous new \ncontinent which its discoverers called the New \nWorld. The earth became round and history became \nuniversal.\n\n246.\tLet me recall that event to the \nOrganization the very aim of which is \nuniversality. The role played by Spain in that \ndiscovery justifies my mentioning to the Assembly \nnow a proposal by the Dominican Republic that the \nAssembly declare the year 1992 the year of the \nfive-hundredth anniversary of the discovery of \nAmerica. The Spanish Government supports and \nwelcomes that initiative without reservation.\n\n247.\tWe believe that the responsibility for \ncommemorating the five-hundredth anniversary of \nthe discovery should be universal, so as to bring \nto every comer of the world and to the mind of \nall the memory of the American past, its present \nreality and its future promise\u00f3a future in which \nSpain sees one of the great hopes of our time.\n"

        "file_text": "\nOn behalf of the Government of Haiti and in my own name, Sir, I wish \nto congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of \nthe thirty- seventh session of the General Assembly. I am sure that \nyou will demonstrate those outstanding qualities that won you this \ndistinction. I wish also to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. \nKittani, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iraq, for the discreet \nand able manner in which he presided over the work of the \nthirty-sixth session. I should particularly like to join preceding \nspeakers in congratulating Mr. Perez de Cuellar, Secretary-General, \nwhose election to head the Organization is unquestionably a source of \ndeep satisfaction for all third-world countries. May I take this \noccasion to emphasize the high quality of his report on the work of \nthe Organization, a report which lucidly depicts the shortcomings of \nthe United Nations, as well as the overriding need to strengthen its \ndecision-making machinery.\nThis session has opened in a tense atmosphere dominated by a note of \nanguish in the statements, which have persistently reflected the \ninternational community's concerns about the general deterioration in \nthe political and economic situation throughout the world.\nWhile the industrialized countries may perceive current economic \nproblems more in terms of cyclical or less extreme fluctuations, the \nthird world as a whole-particularly the least-favoured countries- \nstill believe that the structural imbalance between North and South \nhas become even greater and is now dangerously close to the point of \ncollapse. Most third world country delegations, from whatever \ncontinent they may come, have spoken with one voice from this rostrum \nof the tragic expansion of areas of poverty in their respective \nregions. They have described the growing distress of impoverished \npopulations desperately trying to eke out a meagre existence which \nbecomes more precarious with every passing day. Hence we small \nnations have no illusions when we wonder about our future.\n\nFor almost a decade now, negotiations on the establishment of a new \neconomic order-one that would be more just, more harmonious, but also \nmore efficient-have come up against a lack of true political will on \nthe part of the rich countries to make the adjustments essential to \nany genuine effort at solidarity. Clearly, there is no real prospect \nfor altering the current international order. The institutional, \nfinancial and technical measures required for sustained expansion of \nthe world economy and for a swifter growth in the developing \ncountries are still being awaited. Meanwhile, the terms of trade are \ndeteriorating at a catastrophic pace, and third-world debt has now \nrisen to $600 billion.\nAt the same time, there is no growth in official development \nassistance, which has never reached that famous target of 0.7 per \ncent of the gross national product of the rich countries, or less \nthan 5 per cent of annual arms expenditures. Indeed the Brandt \nCommission' noted ironically that the machinery of death was that \nwhich involved the greatest and most dynamic transfer of technology. \nEven the new law of the sea, which is based mainly on the concept of \nbalanced participation in the exploitation of common wealth, is \nchallenged because of the regrettable selfishness of certain \nindustrialized nations.\nIt is also most distressing to note that no systematic campaign has \nbeen undertaken to explain to the people of the rich countries that \neffective solidarity with the poor countries is less a moral \nimperative than an irreplaceable factor for economic growth at the \nworld level; for there is no better way of stimulating the production \nand distribution of goods and services than a determination to \nsatisfy the basic needs of billions of individuals who have not yet \nenjoyed the material benefits of even the most elementary progress. \nThere is no nobler task than that of contributing to the betterment \nof human beings who have been left on the sidelines of progress by \nhunger, ignorance and disease.\nIt is time for the collective conscience of the industrialized countries \nto stop looking upon international co-operation as a burden on the \nrich, as alms given to those countries that are supposedly incapable \nof looking after their own future. It is time for the people in the \nrich countries to understand that the new international economic \norder will not jeopardize the prosperity of the countries of the \nNorth but will rather give a new impetus to the world economy and \nprovide for more equitable distribution of the fruits of growth.\nA/37/PV.27\nThe Republic of Haiti remains convinced that the market economy, \nwhich at the national level has in some countries been able to adapt \nto the requirements of more human socio-economic development, will al \nso at the international level find the necessary resources to \nestablish a new kind of relationship that is more just and more \nbeneficial. To that end more appropriate and generous action is \nrequired on the part of the public authorities of the industrialized \ncountries. World phenomena have to be analyzed more objectively and \nto be less influenced by national experiences that are hard to \nimitate in different circumstances. To sum up, we need courage, \nimagination and a better sense of international solidarity. Some rich \ncountries do not lack those qualities, and we should like to pay a \ntribute to them here.\nThe problems of the developing countries, to which we have referred \nbriefly, assume the dimensions of a real tragedy in the case of the \nleast developed. In the last decade their per capita gross national \nproduct in real terms rose by only $11. Closer to us, the combined \neffects of world recession and inflation and the recent spiraling of \ninterest rates, along with a collapse in the price of commodities, \nhave tragically emphasized their economic vulnerability and paralyzed \ntheir ability, which was already rather pathetic, to import those \ngoods that are essential to their development.\nAdmittedly, the fifth session of UNCTAD, in Manila in 1979 and the \nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, in Paris \nin 1981 did decide to launch a new programmer and set forth a number \nof objectives that were ambitious and realistic, including the figure \nof 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of donor countries for \nofficial development aid to the least developed countries. \nUnfortunately the commitments formally entered into on those \noccasions have not yet been fulfilled. Thus it seems difficult for us \ntoday to speak about a real desire to stabilize export earnings, to \nincrease external assistance qualitatively and quantitatively.\nHow, under these circumstances, can we hope, as we had hoped, to \neliminate the category of least developed countries and ensure that \nby the end of the 1980s they will have joined the ranks of the \ndeveloping countries? How can we not doubt the ability of the \ninternational system to provide elements for the solving of the \nproblems of the third world, even if it was impossible to take \nadequate action for this small group of least advanced countries?\nThe Republic of Haiti, which more than any other country has \nthroughout its history as a sovereign nation experienced the cost of \nisolation and exploitation resulting from the selfish game played by \nthe big Powers, solemnly repeats its appeal for a truly constructive \nNorth-South dialogue. President Jean-Claude Duvalier has said that:\n\\\"The Republic of Haiti continues to believe in the future of global \nnegotiations for the establishment of a new international economic \norder which would enable the poor populations of the third world to \nattain a threshold of development compatible with the dignity of the \nhuman race and the right of every individual to a decent standard of \nliving.\\\"\nYet above all the third world countries must understand that if they \nwant to progress towards prosperity they must first of all rely on \nthemselves and fully shoulder their collective autonomy. They must \nsystematically explore the tremendous potential of co-operation among \ndeveloping countries in the financial, technical, trade, industrial \nand cultural fields. The Republic of Haiti reiterates its absolute belief \nin active and intelligent harmonization among the nations of the \nSouth based on mutual respect and understanding to generate concrete \nactions that would be of mutual benefit in an intraregional and \ninterregional context.\nBeyond the ideological positions that are inevitably stated in the \ngeneral debate, every statement here reflects the collective \naspiration to an international political order that would bring peace \nand progress. However, the state of the world today clearly shows if \nnot the failure at least the profound inability of mankind to face \nsuccessfully the many sociopolitical upheavals that are \ncharacteristic of our age. There are so many problems that have not \nbeen solved, and they create new divisions and increase the tension \nwhich here and there has led to permanent situations of crisis, overt \nor latent. Despite the belief constantly expressed by Member States \nin the values of the Charter, the machinery for peace and \ninternational security seems to be blocked, as can be seen from the \nworld situation today.\nIn the Middle East the situation remains explosive. Recent events in \nLebanon and their hideous cruelty continue to horrify the conscience \nof the world and confirm, if there were any need for that, that \naction by the Organization is necessary to establish overall peace in \nthe region. Contrasting with this background of absurd violence, some \nbilateral and multilateral initiatives have been taken. They are \nworthwhile and encouraging, and we trust that they can bring about a \nresumption of dialogue, which is so necessary for peace and essential \nin dealing with the fundamental issue of the future of the \nPalestinian people.\nThe Government of Haiti remains firmly convinced that Security \nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) provide the basis for \nan overall settlement of the Middle East problem. The Haitian \nGovernment believes that the search for peace necessarily involves \nall of Israel's neighbors recognizing and respecting its right to \nexist within secure and recognized borders. Likewise we believe that \nthere can be no question of challenging the right of the Palestinian \npeople to real self-determination within a physical, legal and \nadministrative framework that is in keeping with its legitimate \naspirations.\nLatin America is also going through a turbulent period, and there is \nan atmosphere of uncertainty because of the consequences of the \nconflict relating to the Malvinas Islands and the difficult situation \nin Central America. The recent war in the South Atlantic and the \nbloodshed it involved highlighted the remnants of a way of life that \nhas clearly passed. Indeed it placed a severe strain on the peace of \nthe region and undermined the solidarity of the continent.\nThe Republic of Haiti, faithful to its past and respectful of its \ntraditions, has never hesitated to oppose all forms of colonial \ndomination, and naturally expressed its solidarity with the just \nclaims of the Republic of Argentina. The Government of Haiti, aware \nof how fragile are victories imposed by force, believes that the \nUnited Nations can play a decisive role in the search for a \nnegotiated and peaceful solution which would make it possible to \nestablish the definitive bases for a mutually acceptable agreement. \nThat is why we joined in the initiative of Argentina and Mexico in \ncalling for the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the \nGeneral Assembly of an item on the Malvinas Islands.\nCentral America remains the theatre for many conflict situations \nresulting from ideological tensions, which have once again created \nhotbeds of crisis that could endanger regional peace and security. \nThe Republic of Haiti, which has always refused to view regional \nproblems simply in the context of the power balance between East and \nWest, cannot but express its deep concern over the manifest symptoms \nof the alarming deterioration in relations between some fraternal \ncountries in Central America. We call upon all States in the region \nto reject the sterile option of a dangerous arms race. We would go \nalong with any proposal to strengthen regional stability and security \non the basis of the great principles of international morality and \nlaw. In that way an atmosphere of peace could be established that \nwould be favorable to economic development, which is indeed the real \nproblem of the region.\nAs regards Asia, the Government of Haiti is carefully following the \ncourageous initiatives of the Republic of Korea for the reunification \nof the Korean nation. We regret the halt in negotiations between the \ntwo Governments and urge them to go beyond their differences of view \nin order to arrive at satisfactory results. That, of course, can be \ndone only by the Koreans themselves. However, the United Nations \ncould, with the agreement of the parties, take action to provide a \npropitious framework for the resumption of talks.\nThe Haitian Government welcomes the initiative to regroup the \nCambodian liberation forces within the Coalition Government of \nDemocratic Kampuchea. We lend our full support to the various United \nNations initiatives for a settlement of the conflict, which must \nnecessarily include the total and final withdrawal of Vietnamese \nforces from the territory of Kampuchea.\nSimilarly, the Government of Haiti strongly condemns the continued \noccupation of Afghanistan by foreign troops and urges the \nestablishment of conditions which would effectively enable the Afghan \npeople to choose their kind of political society freely, without any \noutside interference.\nThe negotiations on Namibian independence, despite optimistic \nstatements of members of the contact group, have made no progress and \nare simply marking time. Some people insist on making the Namibian \nquestion one aspect of East-West confrontation, but that is \ncompletely unjustified. Meanwhile, the South African regime, \nencouraged by the differences of view that have developed within the \ncontact group, is increasing its diversionary tactics in an attempt \nto delay the inevitable outcome.\nThe Haitian Government believes that any swift solution of the \nNamibian problem necessarily involves the full implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978), which reflects the \ninternational consensus on the need for immediate independence for \nNamibia under the leadership of the patriotic liberation forces of \nthe South West Africa People's Organization. It is upsetting to see \nthat South Africa, despite the measures taken against it by the \nUnited Nations, still continues openly to defy the international \ncommunity by pursuing its apartheid policy.\nThirty years have passed since the General Assembly began its \nconsideration of the item on racial conflict in South Africa. Just \nbefore the end of the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial \nDiscrimination it seems to us indispensable that the United Nations \nshould proceed at this session to a serious evaluation of the efforts \nmade to date and, if necessary, define a new strategy for the \ncomplete elimination of the system of apartheid.\nSuch action would seem to us particularly timely because this year, \nproclaimed by the General Assembly as the International Year of \nMobilization for Sanctions against South Africa, is also the \nseventieth anniversary of the African National Congress, for which \nthe Haitian Government would once again express full support in its \ndifficult struggle against the usurpation of political and economic \npower by a racist minority.\nThe Haitian Government once again condemns the South African regime's \ncontinuing strengthening of its arsenal of repressive laws. It also \ncondemns the South African policy of bantustanization and those who \ngo along with it, because it is a systematic undertaking to \ndehumanize the black people of South Africa. The Haitian people and \nGovernment, expressing their solidarity with the black majorities in \nSouth Africa and the people of Namibia in their legitimate \naspirations and struggles, once again urgently appeals to the \ninternational community to ensure that the sanctions adopted to make \nthe South African regime less intransigent are fully implemented.\nI have given a short account of the feelings, wishes and positions of \nthe Haitian Government on some of the major issues in the \ninternational arena. I would emphasize above all our unwavering \nconviction that the current system of international relations must be \nreplaced by a new order of justice, collective economic security and \ntrue co-operation, with respect for the self-determination and \ndignity of each people. Clearly, it would be an illusion to believe \nthat our wishes could be fulfilled in a single morning. That would \nmean simply disregarding human nature and forgetting that history \ndoes not follow a straight path and time is needed to bring it back \nto its true course. However, all progress made, every step taken, is \na victory for peace and justice over a world of hatred and violence. \nWe must therefore work courageously, patiently and with dedication to \nrespond to the aspirations of the anguished peoples who are listening \nto us.\nThe Republic of Haiti, which has always been inspired by the code of \nhonor and solidarity, will lend you, Mr. President, and all the \nbodies of the United Nations, full and whole-hearted co-operation in \norder to give life, however partial, to the hopes placed in our work.\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\tMr. President, may I, on behalf of the \ndelegation of Trinidad and Tobago, congratulate \nyou on your unanimous election to the office of \nPresident of the thirty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly. My delegation is confident that \nyour considerable experience and skill will \ncon\u00actribute significantly to the successful \noutcome of the Assembly's work. You are the proud \nrepresentative of a country with which Trinidad \nand Tobago enjoys the most cordial relations. I \nwould also like to pay a tribute to the outgoing \nPresident, Mr. Ismat Kittani of Iraq, for his \nvery commendable performance over the past year, \nas President not only of the thirty-sixth session \nbut also of the second special session on \ndisarmament and the emergency special sessions.\n2.\tTwenty years ago, Trinidad and Tobago, a \nsmall newly independent developing country, \njoined the Organization. We, like many others, \nwere attracted by the system of collective \nsecurity enshrined in the Charter of the United \nNations. It was this which impelled us to seek \nentry to the United Nations imme\u00acdiately upon our \nachievement of independence. We had neither the \ndesire nor the means to embark upon any \nlarge-scale expenditure for arms or sophisticated \nweapons of war in order to make ourselves \ninde\u00acpendently secure. Even those who have \nembarked upon such a course delude themselves \ninto believing that they can be secure.\n3.\tToday Trinidad and Tobago views with \nconsider\u00acable concern the widening gap between \nthe purposes and principles of the Charter and \nthe increasing law\u00aclessness in the world \ncommunity. This lawlessness is characterized by \nutter and distressing disregard for human life \nand suffering and little respect for the dignity \nof man. History will surely indict the United \nNations and its Member States for their chronic \ninaction in the face of such lawlessness. The \nSecurity Council has failed to fulfill its \nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of \npeace and security and to act in accordance with \nthe purposes and principles of the Charter. Loss \nof confidence in the United Nations system brings \nthe world closer to the brink of disaster as \nnations seek to impose their will on others by \nforce and to ignore decisions of the world body \naimed at peacefully resolving international \nconflicts.\n63\n4.\tThe refusal of Member States to renounce \nthe use of force as an instrument of national \npolicy and the refusal to respect the territorial \nintegrity and inde\u00acpendence of States and to seek \nthe peaceful settlement of disputes have given \nrise to a growing number of crises which threaten \nto engulf us all in a conflagra\u00action of \nunprecedented horror and destruction. The \nSecretary-General, whose skilful and untiring \nefforts in the cause of peace this past year must \nnot go unrecorded, has warned that this trend \nmust be reversed before once again we bring upon \nourselves a global catastrophe and find ourselves \nwithout institu\u00actions effective enough to prevent \nit . But will his warning be heeded? How can it \nbe, when in the quest for a so-called balance of \npower nations continue to increase their nuclear \narsenals? How can it be, when nations resort to \narms and refuse to limit and reduce their weapons \nof mass destruction- weapons which threaten \ncivilization itself?\n5.\tDuring the past year a number of old \nconflicts have continued to fester and pose \nobstacles to peace. Several new conflicts have \narisen which endanger international peace and \nsecurity. From the South Atlantic to South-East \nAsia, from Western Sahara to the Middle East and \nfrom Africa to Central America, situations of \nintense conflict have brought disaster and untold \nsuffering to millions of people.\n6.\tA few days ago the world was witness to \nthe most inhuman event in the Palestinian refugee \ncamps of west Beirut. The entry into that part of \nthe city of the Israel Defense Forces for the \nalleged purpose of preventing further bloodshed \nwas the signal for permitting the unleashing of a \nreign of primeval terror which has resulted in \nthe slaughter in cold blood of hundreds of \nunarmed civilians\u2014women, children and the \nelderly\u2014in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. \nRevulsion at this barbarous act has echoed around \nthe world. It is testimony to the enormity of the \ncrime perpetrated by those who connived in its \ncommission. We would dishonor the memory of the \nvictims of this massacre and betray the people of \nLebanon, if we did not provide at this time \nadequate and effective measures to heal their \nwounds, promote their unity and restore their \nnational sovereignty. At the very least, we \ndemand the total and unconditional with\u00acdrawal of \nIsraeli forces from Lebanese territory. The \ntragedy of Lebanon is inextricably bound up with \nthe problem of the Palestinian people. Trinidad \nand Tobago reiterates its firm conviction that \nthere cannot be and there will not be a lasting \npeace in the Middle East until the rights of the \nPalestinian people are recognized and respected \nand until the Palestinian people themselves have \nbeen allowed to exercise their right to \nself-determination.\n7.\tThe mounting toll of refugees and \ndisplaced persons fleeing political strife and \neconomic disorder attest to the increasing \ninhumanity pervading our world today. These \nconflict situations invariably affect people. It \nis the mass of the people who suffer when the \nmechanisms contained in the Charter for the \npeaceful settlement of disputes fail or are \nignored, as we see with increasing frequency. The \nfragile econo\u00acmies of developing countries and \nthe development aspirations of whole generations \nof people are jeopar\u00acdized by actual conflict or \nby the profligate expenditure involved in \npreparing for conflict. International tension and \ngreat-Power rivalry are perhaps the principal \ncause of the deflection of the world's resources \nfrom their correct use\u2014the advancement of the \nwell-being of all mankind.\n8.\tNowhere is this inhumanity more sickening \nthan in South Africa, where the apartheid regime \nof South Africa continues to defy international \nworld opinion in its brutal repression and \noppression of its black majority. The persistent \nattempts to establish Bantustans, the detention \nand banning of African leaders, and the death of \nfreedom fighters and trade union leaders while in \ndetention, serve only to confirm the need for \nmore stringent action by the United Nations to \ncompel South Africa to comply with its decisions \nnot only with respect to conditions in South \nAfrica itself but also with respect to Namibia, \nwhich it con\u00actinues to occupy illegally.\n9.\tWe must once more condemn the obstinacy \nof Pretoria in impeding the achievement of \ninde\u00acpendence by Namibia. We must condemn that \nregime for its persistent use of Namibian \nterritory for armed attacks on neighbouring \nStates. We rebuke that racist regime for its \nattempt to set up a puppet Government in Namibia. \nAbove all, we rebuke it for its ruthless \nexploitation of Namibia's natural and human \nresources .without any real benefit accruing to \nthe indigenous population. It is time for the \nfull implementation of Security Council \nresolution 435 (1978), which sets the sole \nframework for the independence of Namibia. It is \ntime to put a stop to the dilatory tactics \nemployed by Pretoria over the past four years to \ndeprive the people of Namibia of their peremptory \nright to self- determination and independence.\n10.\tWe cannot equivocate in our support for \nthe Namibian people in their struggle to free \nthemselves from the oppressive colonial yoke. \nTrinidad and Tobago's continuing commitment to \nthe process of decolonization has been \ndemonstrated by the leader\u00acship role it has taken \nin the Special Committee on the Situation with \nregard to the Implementation of the Declaration \non the Granting of Independence to Colonial \nCountries and Peoples. The Territories still to \nbe decolonized, many of them small in size and \nlimited in resources, are of particular concern \nto Trinidad and Tobago since several of them form \npart of our own Caribbean region. Some of these \nTerri\u00actories remain in a state of virtual \neconomic depen\u00acdency. In these circumstances it \nis very difficult for them to exercise freely \ntheir right to self-determination. The colonial \nPower therefore has a duty to devote the necessary \nresources to preparing these Territories for \nindependence. There is ample evidence to show \nthat when the colonial Power wishes to do so it \ncan.\n11.\tIf the political picture of the world \nwhich I have painted is one beset with problems, \nthe economic one is no less troubled. I do not \nthink that there is now any doubt that today we \nare experiencing the worst down-turn in the world \neconomy since the 1930s. What is perhaps even \nmore chilling is that there is little confidence \nin the prospect of global economic recovery in \nthe short term and even less in the international \nmonetary and financial system. Unemployment, one \nof the scourges of humanity, has reached \nunimaginable proportions. We in the developing \nworld have lived with unemployment for decades. \nLevels of unemploy-ment of 18 per cent and 20 per \ncent were seen by some economists as normal for \ndeveloping countries, while for developed \ncountries 2.5 to 3 per cent was considered the \nnorm.\n12.\tThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago is \ndeeply concerned about the growing levels of \nunem\u00acployment in developed as well as developing \ncoun\u00actries. It is concerned not only because of \nthe human suffering involved but also because the \nmonetarist prescriptions of certain major \ncountries and financial institutions for dealing \nwith the general economic situation are such that \nthey exacerbate the problem. The high interest \nrates associated with monetarist policies have \nadded considerably to the already over\u00acgrown debt \nproblem of the developing countries and resulted \nin unpredictable flights of capital.\n13.\tRecent events have reaffirmed, if that \nwere neces\u00acsary, just how interdependent the \nworld has become. In the industrialized countries \nlarge deficits, tight monetary policies and high \nlevels of inflation have resulted in high and \nvolatile interest rates and a decline in \nindustrial output, which in turn have affected \nthe earnings of developing countries. At the same \ntime the developing countries have faced a marked \ndecline in the level of official development \nassistance, dete\u00acriorating terms of trade, and \nhigher prices for imports, including food, and \nrenewed protectionist policies on the part of the \ndeveloped countries. Constrained by these \nconditions, developing countries are unable to \npay for their imports and service their debts. \nIndeed, so severe are these constraints that most \ndeveloping countries are experiencing negative \nrates of growth.\n14.\tFor the Caribbean the past year has been \npartic\u00acularly difficult. Not only did the \nrecession continue to decrease the demand for \ntourism, the primary source of foreign exchange \nfor many countries, but the major exports\u2014sugar, \npetroleum, bauxite/alumina and bananas\u2014also faced \nsoftening or declining markets. For countries \nwhich have already been experiencing negative \ngrowth rates the net result has been that the \neconomies of these countries are tottering on the \nbrink of bankruptcy. In order to achieve growth \nrates of 3 to 5 per cent per annum over the next \nfive years, the countries of the Caribbean \nCommunity will face an external resource gap of \nover $US 3 billion. They will need the support of \nthe multilateral financial institutions if this \ngap is to be bridged. We therefore, view with \nsome concern the decision of the World Bank to \nadopt a variable interest rate policy and to \nintroduce a front-end lending fee which will make \nproject financing much more difficult and \npainful. Without lower and more stable interest \nrates, initiatives designed to encourage \ninvestment in the Caribbean will not be \nmeaningful.\n15.\tTrinidad and Tobago believes that there \nis an urgent need for a significant increase in \nthe level of World Bank lending. A minimum \nincrease at the rate of 5 per cent m real terms \nis necessary if the Bank is to meet the \nrequirements of developing countries.\n16. With regard to the International Monetary \nFund [IMF], Trinidad and Tobago supports the call \nfor a substantial increase in and a \nredistribution of quotas so as to give developing \ncountries generally and economic groupings and \nregions a greater say in the operation of IMF.\n17.\tTrinidad and Tobago is disappointed that no \nconsensus has been reached on the allocation of \nspecial drawing rights during the present basic \nperiod and that as yet, despite the repeated \npleas of the developing countries, a direct link \nbetween special drawing rights and development \nfinance has not been established.\n18.\tTrinidad and Tobago has sought, within \nits own modest means, to contribute to the \neconomic progress of the countries in the \nCaribbean community by making funds available to \nthem through the Caribbean Development Bank and \nother regional financial insti\u00actutions, as well \nas through our own programmes for technical \nco-operation and assistance. Over the past five \nyears, Trinidad and Tobago has contributed $.5 \nbillion in balance-of-payments support, loans on \nsoft terms, and grants and project assistance to \nmem\u00acbers of the Caribbean Community. Even in \nthese trying times Trinidad and Tobago maintains \nits commitment to assist its partners in CARICOM. \nWe hope that other countries, particularly the \nbetter endowed ones in our hemisphere, will make \ngood their promises of concrete support for the \ncountries of the Caribbean. In six months it may \nbe too late. We hope, however, that when such \nassistance is given, it will not have a divisive \neffect on the region and encourage alienation \nfrom principles cherished by all Caribbean \npeoples.\n19.\tTrinidad and Tobago sees in the present \nsituation a clear and accurate demonstration of \nthe need for systematic transformation and more \nbalanced global management of the international \neconomy. We believe that the credibility, \nefficacy and relevance of the existing \ninstitutional structure and its theoretical and \nphilosophical underpinnings have been called into \nquestion. That has rendered the call for the new \ninternational economic order more relevant than \never.\n20.\tIt is a matter of concern to us that \nefforts to launch the global round of \nnegotiations on international economic \nco-operation for development have not met with \ngreat success during the past year. No agreement \nhas been reached so far between the Group of 77 \nand the industrialized countries on procedure, \nagenda and time-frame for the launching of \nnegotiations to tackle the problems of the world \neconomy simultaneously in a coherent and \nintegrated manner. Instead, developing countries \nsee, with mounting frustration, their in\u00acterests \nbypassed or ignored in the GATT negotiations and \nin deliberations at the World Bank and IMF.\n21.\tTo the developing countries here \nassembled, I launch an appeal to move swiftly to \nimplement the action program for economic \nco-operation among developing countries adopted \nby the Group of 77 at the High-Level Conference \non Economic Co-operation among Developing \nCountries at Caracas in May 1981. Not until our \nefforts to change our focus and to reorient our \npatterns of economic collaboration bear fruit \nshall we see a more positive response from the \ndeveloped community.\n22.\tThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago has \nnoted with satisfaction that after 14 years of \nprotracted dialogue and negotiation, the United \nNations has finally adopted the Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea. After much hard work, \nco-operative effort and give and take, a package \ndeal was reached on 30 April 1982.\n23.\tI must place on record the disappointment \nof the Government of Trinidad and Tobago that one \nof the major contributors to that package deal \nhas chosen to opt out of the painstakingly \nnegotiated settlement. The decision of that major \ncontributor to turn its back on a system which \nwould make for a stable order in ocean space is \nto be regretted. It remains our hope that all \nStates will sign and ratify the Convention to \nmake it universally acceptable.\n24.\tPerhaps it is not inappropriate that I \nvoice the cumulative disappointment of all \npeoples at the failure to halt the arms race and \nto reduce armaments of mass destruction. The \nthousands who have marched in the streets of many \ncities of the world in order to draw attention to \nthe existing situation and to signify their deep \nfear of the consequences to themselves and future \ngenerations of the arms race and nuclear \ncatastrophe have sent a clear message that the \nworld community cannot afford to ignore. Allow me \nonce again to voice the concern of peoples \neverywhere for the urgent adoption of measures to \nalleviate, if not to solve, the current economic \ncrisis, and to remove the hovering specter of \ndepression.\n25.\tIn conclusion, I should like to urge the \ngreat powers not to import into the Caribbean \ntheir rivalries, conflicts and tensions. Of our \nneighbors in the hemisphere, we ask at all costs \nthat they settle their disputes by peaceful \nmeans. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago, as \nit has done before, stands ready to assist in \nfinding peaceful and amicable solu\u00actions to \ndisputes which threaten to disturb the peace in \nthe Caribbean, and to retard the just aspirations \nof Caribbean peoples for peace, security and \neconomic well-being.\n"

        "file_text": "The task of congratulating the President on his \nelection to guide this thirty-seventh session of \nthe General Assembly and Mr. Perez deCuellar on \nhis appointment as Secretary- General is for me a \npleasant one. One is never at a loss for words \nwhen praising famous men. With his appointment as \nthe fifth Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar \njoins a procession of illustrious predecessors, \neach of whom has left a distinctive imprint on \nsome page of international history. The first was \nTrygve Lie, a direct-speaking, if sometimes \nemotional, man, whose objective was, through his \ncommitment to peace, to give credibility to the \nUnited Nations. The second was Dag Hammarslqold, \na man who worked hard to build on the fundamental \nprinciples of the United Nations, a peace-maker \nwho saw his position of Secretary-General as \nproviding him with a mandate for seeking and \nrestoring peace and who lived and died in that \ncause. The third was U Thant, a blunt, \nstraightforward and outspoken individual, .a man \nof proven negotiating ability; the fourth was \nKurt Waldheim, a professional and careful \ndiplomat. We salute them all. The present \nSecretary- General joins this line of succession \nin the face of many problems and difficulties, \nwhich he has already identified as conflicts \nbetween national aims and Charter goals... resort \nto confrontation, violence and even war in \npursuit of what are perceived as vital interests, \nclaims or aspirations\\\" . We are confident that \nwith his characteristic caution, his mature \nintelligence and his wealth of diplomatic \nexperience he too stands ready to inscribe his \nname on the roll of honor. I can assure him that \nmy country, Botswana, will heed his appeal to all \nGovernments for their conscious recommitment to \nthe j purposes and principles of the Charter. We \npledge our support for the continued search for \nsolutions to the different problems facing the \nUnited Nations and the world.\n334.\tThe role of the President of the General \nAssembly is no less challenging, onerous or \nnoble. We are equally confident that Mr. Hollai \nwill hold aloft the honor of his great country.\n335.\tWe are not so presumptuous as to think we \nhave the capacity or, indeed, the capability of \ncommenting on every item on the agenda of the \nAssembly. We shall therefore confine our remarks \nto a few only.\n336.\tThe scenario of international economic \ndevelopment co-operation remains bleak. There \nhas been a further deterioration, especially \nsince 1981, in the international economic \nenvironment. As we are all aware, the economic \nproblems of developed countries are being \ntransmitted to developing countries through a \nvariety channels, and vice versa. The development \ncrisis has deepened throughout the world, and the \ndevelopment process has come to a virtual \nstandstill in many countries. The dynamism of \ninternational trade, particularly in products of \nspecial importance to developing countries, is \nno longer assured as a mechanism for growth. The \nshrinkage in the real flow of external resources \nand development assistance has considerably \njeopardized the growth prospects and \nopportunities in many developing countries. The \nspirit of international co-operation has suffered \ngreatly. \n337.\tIn these circumstances, the current world \neconomic crisis can no longer be considered as \nmerely as another phenomenon of poor growth \nfigures. Nor can it be considered in complete \nisolation from the interests of developing \ncountries. Recent experience has amply \ndemonstrated that the worsening world economic \nconditions are of a structural, not a cyclical, \nnature. The establishment of a new international \neconomic order could have greatly facilitated the \nstructural adjustment and strengthened the \npossibility for economic revival and prosperity \nof the world as a whole, including the developed \ncountries. However, short- tern. Interests \ncarried the day, and we have missed many \nopportunities to facilitate structural \nadjustments and give impetus to economic growth.\n338.\tCommodity issues have emerged as major \ntrade problems for many developing countries. The \nrecent slump in commodity prices, together with \nthe rising tide of protectionism, has led to \nreduced export j proceeds, increased external \nindebtedness and a j worsened balance of payments \nin many developing j countries. My own country, \nBotswana, is in no different position. The \ninstability in commodity trade might have been \nminimized, even curbed, had there been a fully \noperational integrated program for commodities. \nThe convening of the sixth session of UNCTAD, in \nJune 1983 in Belgrade, offers yet another \nopportunity to act on these issues, which should \nnot be missed this time\n339.\tIn spite of the worsening world economic \nconditions, the international community has \nsucceeded in achieving some successes since 1981. \nThe Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for \nCommodities and the Substantial New Programme of \nAction for the 1980s for the Least Developed \nCountries\\\" adopted at the Paris Conference are \ntwo such achievements.if these are to be \ntranslated into action, there is much the \ninternational community should undertake in order \nto avoid talking about the same issues all over \nagain at UNCTAD.\n340.\tIt is equally necessary to remove the \nconsiderable uncertainties which currently \nprevail in the international financial system. \nRecent developments have caused concern regarding \nthe capability of the international financial \nsystem to deal with the effects of the \nunfavorable .economic environment.\n341.\tWe must persist in carrying through \nglobal negotiations on international financial \nissues which restore balance to the system which \naffects us all.\n342.\tInternal upheavals as well as wars born \nof external aggression are a common phenomenon in \ndifferent parts of the world. The irony of the \nmatter is that in many of these situations it is \neasy to identify the involvement of those Powers \nto which the custodianship of peace and security \nhas been permanently entrusted by us all. As a \nresult, the principal organs of the United \nNations can only chum out innocuous resolutions \nexpressing their grave concern at such \ninterventions and calling for the withdrawal of \nforeign troops, often without naming them. Such \nresolutions are quite often frustrated by the \nnon-compliance of the States concerned. The \nUnited Nations has thus become a place for the \nexpression of indignation and the trading of \nrecriminations. We have been guilty of \ndiminishing its capacity to deal effectively with \nissues affecting peace. We ourselves are weakened \nthereby, as there is no other instrument to which \nwe can turn for the solution of international \nproblems. My delegation therefore supports the \nSecretary-General in his call to all Governments \nto recommit themselves consciously to the Charter.\n343.\tMr. Fayez Sayegh, a Palestinian scholar, \nsays in his book \\\"The crux of the Palestinian \nproblem is the fate of a people and its homeland. \nIt is the piecemeal conquest and continued \nseizure of the entire country by military force. \nIt is the forcible dispossession and displacement \nof the bulk of the indigenous population and the \nsubjugation of the rest\\\".\n344.\tIn its resolution 521 (1982) of 19 \nSeptember the Security Council unanimously \ncondemned the massacre of Palestinian civilians \nin their refugee camps. The stench of death \ncontinues to hang like early morning mist over \nwest Beirut and the grief of those brutally \ntreated people is immeasurable. Nations severally \nhave condemned this criminal act perpetrated \nagainst an unsuspecting and defenseless people. \nMany searching and pertinent questions are being \nasked. Was it not enough to have made them the \nrefugees they were and to have thus condemned \nthem to live in squalor and misery? Why murder \nthem? Had they not suffered sufficient \nhumiliation when their leadership was dispersed \nthroughout the length and breadth of the Arab \nworld? Why massacre them? Protestations of \ninnocence should neither supplant nor be a \nsubstitute for response to the need to establish \nthe circumstances and the enormity of the crime. \nFor that reason, my country welcomes the decision \nto hold an independent and impartial \ninvestigation. This heinous crime will remain a \ndark eventin the life of nations, its \nperpetrators and their collaborators eternal \nvillains. History has not always been benevolent \nand charitable to Israel, yet the continued \noccupation of Arab lands by military force \nprovides no justifiable compensation. \\\"The crux \nof the Palestinian problem\\\", says Mr. Sayegh, \\\"is \nthe fate of a people and its homeland\\\".\n45. As long as nations in the area deny one \nanother the right to exist as sovereign and \nindependent entities within clearly defined and \nsecure borders, peace in the Middle East will \nremain elusive and unattainable.\n346.\tWe implore the United States, from the \nvantage point of its special relationship with \nIsrael, and the League of Arab States to \nreconcile their peace proposals and to intensify \ntheir search for a solution acceptable to all \nparties.\n347.\tThe situation in Afghanistan continues to \ndefy solution. Foreign troops have not yet been \nwithdrawn and the refugee population in Iran and \nPakistan has reached the 3.5 million mark. \nEfforts to bring the parties to the negotiating \ntable have hitherto been of no avail. The \nintractable nature of the situation typifies the \nimpotence of the United Nations in the face of \nsuper-Power Involvement. It is in such \ncircumstances that the words of the \nSecretary-General stand out in sharp relief, to \nbe quoted and quoted yet again\u2014a recommitment of \nGovernments to the Charter.\n348.\tWe appeal to the parties involved to \nengage in negotiations designed to secure the \nwithdrawal of foreign forces, the elimination of \nexternal interference in the internal affairs of \nAfghanistan and the facilitation of the return of \nthe refugees.\n349.\tIt is almost four years since the \nKampuchean People's Revolutionary Council \nsupplanted the Pol Pot regime. Attempts to reach \na political solution by way of negotiations among \nthe parties concerned have been frustrated by \nboycotts. The end to three decades of war in \nIndo-China is not in sight and regional \ninsecurity has become a matter of serious concern \nfor South-East Asian nations.\n350.\tThe complete withdrawal of all foreign \ntroops, the cessation of external interference \nand the unimpeded exercise by the people of its \nright to elect a Government of its choice is what \nwe desire for Kampuchea. This is our litany.\n351.\tKorea remains a divided country. The \nNorth- South dialogue, acclaimed by .many nations \nas a concrete manifestation of the determination \nof the Korean people to reunify their divided \npeninsula, has been suspended since 1973. \nProposals by one side are relentlessly spumed by \nthe other side. Notwithstanding this regrettable \ncircumstance, Botswana persists in its view that \nthe reunification of Korea is a matter to be \ndecided by the Koreans themselves in direct \nipter-Korean negotiations. It remains for the \nUnited Nations to continue to encourage the \nresumption of those talks without pre-conditions \nor external interference.\n352.\tSimilarly, we support the continuation of \nthe intercommunal talks in Cyprus. We believe \nthat their efficacy could be enhanced by the \nspeedy withdrawal of foreign troops from the \nisland.\n353.\t333. The position of my country regarding \nthe Falklands crisis has already been made dear. \nIt does no harm to reiterate it here. Botswana \ndoes not accept the use of armed intervention to \nenforce territorial claims. Our condemnation of \nsuch action by Argentina was therefore without \nprejudice to the merits or otherwise of its \nclaim. We do not regard the Falklands as an \nintegral part of Britain, some 8,000 miles away. \nSuch a concept belongs to the imperialism of \nbygone centuries. Our view is that the Falklands \nis a colony of Britain. The Falklanders, like all \ncolonized peoples, have the right to \nself-determination without external pressure or \nintimidation. We resent and resist the change of \none colonialism for another in Africa. We \nmaintain the same principle in the United Nations.\n354.\tA year ago the General Assembly met in an \nemergency special session to discuss the question \nof Namibia. Volumes of words were spoken on that \noccasion, as they have been spoken since the \ninternational challenge to South Africa's \noccupation of the Territory of South West Africa \nin 1946. The general  Assembly was reminded then \nthat the United Nations plan for Namibia \nremained, after three years, a pious declaration \nof intent, because nothing had come of it. Ft \nmust be admitted that there has now been some \naudible shuffling of feet by the contact group \nand the South African representatives, but there \nhas been no appreciable move forward or dramatic \nchange in the situation; no peace in Namibia. We \nsubmit that the validity of the vaunted \n\\\"significant progress\\\" made in the negotiations \nrelating to the constitutional principles and the \npreparedness of South Africa to move \nexpeditiously to resolve the question of the \ncomposition and deployment of the United Nations \nTransition Assistance Group is being somewhat \nneutralized and rendered ineffectual b the \nunfortunate linkage of the withdrawal of South \nAfrican forces from Namibia and the progress of \nthat Territory to independence with the \nwithdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola, in the \nname of regional security. We consider this \nrequirement strange, especially as it is the \nSouth African and not the Cuban forces which have \nbeen guilty of trans-border violations and have \nintensified their war of aggression against the \nPeople's Republic of Angola, even as the Namibian \nplan is being negotiated.\n355.\tOf equal concern to my delegation is a \nnew plan whereby South Africa seeks to establish \na so-called more effective interim Government, \nreported to be structured on ethnic lines, in \nNamibia. This plan, coupled with the possible use \nof Walvis Bay in a \\\"manner prejudicial to the \nindependence of Namibia \\\", in disregard of \nSecurity Council resolution 432 (1978), would not \nonly delay progress towards an acceptable \nsolution but might in fact frustrate all the \nefforts already made to resolve the problem. A \ngenuine solution of the Namibian problem can be \nreached, and soon, if South Africa desists from \nits recurrent invention of extraneous excuses. \nAfter many years of war waged by South Africa: \nforces against the people of Namibia, it is not \nin their interest that a settlement be further \ndelayed by being subordinated to or coupled with \nthe withdrawal of foreign forces from a third \ncountry.\n356.\tMy country, one of the front-line States \nbordering on Namibia, continues to call for the \nimmediate implementation of Security Council \nresolution 435 (1978) as the generally accepted \npeaceful means of ensuring the attainment of \nindependence by that United Nations Territory. \nNegotiations relating to outstanding issues \nrelevant to that resolution have been \nsuccessfully concluded. The process leading to \nthe liberation of Namibia should be unhindered. \nMy country looks forward with the most fervent \nhopes to seeing a liberated, free, independent \nand sovereign Namibia assume its rightful place \nin the Assembly at its thirty-eighth session.\n357.\tBut the accession of Namibia to \nindependence will not in itself bring peace to \nthe southern African region as long as apartheid \nand racism continue to be the fundamental tenets \nof South Africa's philosophy of government. For \n300 years the South African white has asked \nhimself these questions: Who are we? What is our \ndestiny? What is our divine and appointed role in \nAfrica? His answers to those questions are basic \nto the theory and practice of apartheid. His \nanswers are formulated in such a manner as to \nperpetuate his image as the divine messenger to \nAfrica, the torch- bearer of Christian truths and \nprinciples. He is in a class apart, the only \ncitizen of South Africa. Thus, after 300 years, \nthe black majority of the South African society \nremains aliens in their fatherland. The creation \nfor them of crowded, over-grazed and generally \ndenuded so-called homelands, the denial of equal \neconomic opportunities and power sharing, the \ndowngraded quality of their education, their \nrestricted and controlled movement\u2014these and the \nmany other disabilities they are made to suffer \nhave increased their frustration and anger and \nheightened their determination to secure an \nequitable deal for themselves by whatever means. \nThis should be avoided, for if the manner of \naccession to independence by Namibia, whenever it \ncomes, is to provide any lesson at all, it should \nbe in the realization that resistance to orderly \nand timely change can serve only to condemn even \nthe unborn of all races to future strife and \nsuffering.\n358.\tSouth Africa is fully cognizant of the \nghastliness of such an eventuality and is groping \nfor a solution. Whilst we welcome the reformist \ninitiatives of South Africa, we consider the \nso-called constitutional dispensation to be \nhollow. It is hollow because it denies the black \nmajority South African citizenship and relegates \nthem to Bantustans; it is hollow because it \nattempts to entice the Indian and Colored South \nAfricans away from their traditional \nidentification and solidarity with the other \ndisadvantaged group, the black South Africans, \nwithout in any way enhancing their political \nintegration within the South African society. A \nsystem founded on injustice is bound sooner or \nlater to collapse.\n359.\tDrawing the Colored South Africans and \nSouth Africans of Indian extraction into the plan \nwhilst excluding 70 per cent of the population \nwill only increase the areas of polarization and \ntheir ramifications\u2014whites versus non-whites, \nblack South Africans versus Colored and Indian \nSouth Africans conservative Colored and Indians \nversus their progressive compatriots whom they \nwill brand as renegades from the cause of genuine \nliberation.\n360.\tMoreover, it should be conceded that the \navowed objective of converting urban South \nAfrican Macks into rurai citizens elsewhere is \nnot oniy retrograde but ill-considered and \nimpossible of attainment. To succeed, any p!an \nor solution for the South African problem must \ntake cognizance of these basic truths. Neither \nthe mercenary invasion of Seychelles nor the \nsustained aggression against the People's \nRepublic of Angola and the continued occupation \nof parts of its territory by South African troops \nneither the support given to the Uniao Nacional \npara a Independencia Total de Angola [LW/7/1] in \nAngola, the Mozambican National Resistance in \nMozambique or the Lesotho Liberation Army in \nLesotho nor that given to dissidents in Zambia \nand Zimbabwe, all instruments of the \ndestabilization of neighbouring States will \nsilence the call for change within South Africa.\n361.\tOur undying refrain is the continuing \ncall urging South Africa to engage in meaningful \ndialogue with the recognized leaders of all the \ncitizens of that country and to work out a \nsolution acceptable to all.\n362.\tThe relevant exhortation in the Lusaka \nManifesto on Southern Africa is still as fresh \nand as valid today as when it was made some 13 \nyears ago:\n\\\"... we are demanding an opportunity for all the \npeople of these States, working together as equal \nindividual citizens, to work out for themselves \nthe institutions and the system of government \nunder which they will, by general consent, live \ntogether and work together to build a harmonious \nsociety.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Guatemalan delegation, over which I have the honor \nto preside, I wish to express to you, Mr. Hollai, congratulations on \nyour unanimous election as President of the General Assembly. Such a \nhigh distinction is well deserved recognition of your human act \nprofessional qualities and your profound knowledge of the problems \nbeing discussed in the Organization. I am convinced that under your \nable leadership our tasks will attain the very best results. Mease \nrest assured that you may count on the whole hearted cooperation of \nthe Guatemalan delegation. I also wish to express my delegation's \nrecognition of the work accomplished under the direction of Mr. \nKittani as President of the previous session. My delegation greets \nwith special satisfaction the Secretary General, Mr. Javier Perez de \nCuellar, that illustrious Latin American diplomat, who is \nindefatigable in his efforts in search of a more effective role for \nthe United Nations in its endeavors to attain international peace, \nunderstanding and harmony. As regards the national policy of my \ncountry, I wish to declare that the present Government of the \nRepublic of Guatemala, which assumed power on 23 March of this year \nto put an end to a practically untenable situation stemming from \ncorruption and lack of respect for the will of the people as \nexpressed at the polls, received the immediate assent and approval of \nthe entire Guatemalan people and met with expressions of \ninternational acceptance and satisfaction. The goals of the \nGovernment of Guatemala are basically to bring peace to the country, \nwhich is now in such a serious state of upheaval, especially in some \nareas, as a result of actions by subversive groups which have sown \nterror among the population and caused incalculable personal and \nmaterial damage to inhabitants, forcing them to abandon their places \nof origin, disintegrating families, causing suffering, desolation and \ndeath. My Government is trying to bring into active productivity and \nthe benefits of progress through policies, projects and development \nprogrammes, a great mass of the native population which has lived a \nforsaken and marginal existence and thus to eliminate as much as \npossible the enormous social differences that now prevail. It is \ntrying also to reduce the causes of dissatisfaction and frustration \nin various sectors of the population, to bring about respect for \nuniversally recognized human rights, and observance and full exercise \nthereof, to accelerate the process of integrated and harmonious \ndevelopment for the entire country, to reactivate the country's \neconomy and to create everywhere the conditions necessary for the \ncountry, to move towards a political event in which citizens may \nfreely choose their new authorities and thereby return to \nconstitutional normalcy. On coming to power the new Government of \nGuatemala, which is presided over by General Jose Efrain Rios Montt, \noutlined 14 points containing its aspirations and the guidelines to \nbe followed in order to achieve full wellbeing for the people of \nGuatemala. Those points are as follows: first, to make the people \naware that the authorities are there to serve them and not the people \nto serve the authorities; second, to bring about the reconciliation \nof the entire Guatemalan family for the benefit of peace and national \nconcord; third, to ensure the security and tranquility of the \nindividual, through absolute respect for human rights; fourth, to \nrestore individual and national dignity; fifth, to develop a \nnationalistic spirit and to create the foundation for the \nparticipation and integration of the various ethnic groups that make \nup our nation; sixth, to bring about the economic recovery of the \nnation in keeping with the free enterprise system, through the \ncontrols required by the present state of the nation; seventh, to \nrestructure the judicial power, with the participation of the Bar \nAssociation, in order to adapt it to present circumstances and ensure \nthat it Motions in accordance with ethical, moral and juridical \nnorms; eighth, to eradicate administrative corruption and promote \namong civil servants a genuine spirit of public service, which \nconstitutes the foundation of a national Government; ninth, to \nencourage among the various pressure groups which represent national \nactivity a new development oriented reformist and nationalistic \nspirit; tenth, to strengthen national integration, efficiently \nutilizing the cooperation of other States and international \norganizations, at the same time pointing out certain problems of the \nState in its foreign relations; eleventh, to improve the standard of \nliving of the people in order to reduce existing differences; \ntwelfth, to restructure the electoral system so that as a true \ndemocratic institution it represents the political participation of \nthe people and so that their wishes are not frustrated; thirteenth, \nto reorganize the public administration so that government programmes \nare carried out in a dynamic way and to ensure its efficiency and \ncontrol its regular functioning, thereby avoiding administrative \nanarchy; fourteenth, to restore a constitutional form of government \nfor the country within a fixed period of time, so that Guatemalans \nwill know and demand their rights and know their duties and \nobligations within free democratic institutions. To attain those \nobjectives the Government of the Republic of Guatemala has since \ncoming to power taken steps to cleanse the public administration, \nreduce public expenditure through a policy of austerity, promote \ninvestments, increase exports of traditional and nontraditional \nproducts and to provide immediate help to the villages affected by \nsubversive violence. At the political level, a Council of State has \nbeen created, with members representing all the sectors of the \ncountry and constituting an advisory body of the Government of the \nRepublic and a balancing factor within it. It should be emphasized \nthat this is a body which, for the first time in the history of the \ncountry, comprises the various ethnic elements which make up the \nnation, so that they now have a forum in which to put forward their \nproblems, needs and desires and the aspirations of their respective \ncommunities. In the future they will participate with all the other \nsectors of the nation in the decision making process, so that we are \nbetter able to define the destiny of the Republic. The President of \nthe Republic, in his address at the inauguration of the Council of \nState, said: The political concept which at present we define as \nGuatemalan reformism or reform will be valid only when the various \nobjectives materialize and become legal fact. These objectives, \nreached over the short, intermediate or long term, will be the \nframework upon which the roof of our nationality will rest. Among \nother general objectives, since the detailed objectives will be \nestablished by mutual agreement and depending upon the encouragement \nprovide I by the participation of those sectors concerned in the \ndevelopment of our nation, we point out the following. First, the \nCouncil of State shall legislate on the privileges and exemptions of \nGuatemalans, enhancing and reinforcing in this legal body all that \npertains to human rights. These rights must be examined, publicized, \ntaught and practiced and their principles should serve as the basis \nfor all types of legislation. The present Government is committed to \nthe inclusion in the fundamental laws of Guatemala of everything that \npertains to human rights. Secondly, the Council of State shall \npropose the legal procedures through which political development may \nbe guaranteed with the utmost security and respect for social \nstability. To this end, basic agreements must be reached to ensure \nthe democratization of the country, thus establishing its own system, \nefficient and reliable, just and flexible, capable of meeting the \nproblems inherent in our national identity, and a strong State which \nwill be representative, consolidated and dynamic. Thirdly, the \nCouncil of State shall, furthermore, draft a provisory law for the \npurpose of electing a Constituent Assembly which will broaden \npolitical life by the authentic representation of all Guatemalans, promoting \nparticipation by the people and consolidation of the State by \nencouraging the expression of public opinion and organizing large \nnumbers of people and social groups in order to establish a more \nunited society which will emphasize our common interests and ensure \nthe enjoyment of harmony with freedom among its pluralistic \nconstituents. In view of the frustrations suffered by the \nGuatemalans, the repeated and successive contradictions inherited \nfrom previous Governments, the lack of an overall strategy on the \npart of the political authorities to deal with subversion; the lack \nof solutions to our basic problems; the total lack of any ethical or \nmoral example set by those leading or claiming to lead the nation; \nand in view of the obvious irresponsibility in the management of the \nnational economy and the widespread corruption, the Guatemalan army \ncommits itself to lead the country, the President asked me to state \nbefore the Guatemalan people, with firmness and a vocation to serve, \ntowards a democratization process which will create the conditions \nand legal machinery required for the establishment of a Government \nthat will represent legitimacy and put an end to corruption. The \nGuatemalan army firmly rejected the disruptive activities of \nindividuals or institutions, as well as the corrupting effects of any \ndemagogy on the part of those who that upon themselves rights which \nare only the result of their own frustration, irresponsibility or \nignorance. Corruption in former regimes led Guatemala to a process of \ndecay, not only politically but also socially, spiritually and \nmorally, and to the loss of the ethical values that are essential to \npeople's lives. For this reason, the Government of the Republic has \nencouraged a dialogue between the people and the authorities; and it \nis hoped that by example, new attitudes and the implementation of a \nnew philosophy of Government, these intrinsic values of our people \nwill be gradually restored, so that together with material \ndevelopment can also be a change in the ethical and spiritual \nstandards, which will unquestionably enable Guatemala to see its \nfuture more clearly, recover its identity as a nation, and shape its \nown destiny. Our national problems are difficult, we shall need \nsacrifice, effort, work and good will on the part of all Guatemalans \nto see our country through. It is to these noble tasks that we are \npresently devoted, tasks that will undoubtedly also require \ninternational understanding and cooperation. The stage which \nGuatemala is presently going through is critical because the \nstructures, resources, values and principles that held good are now \nbeing judged and analyzed so that we can apply them in future and \ngain a clear and revised image of our situation. We are in fact a \ncountry where there is a great deal to be done. And so it must be \nwhen a people decides to face the responsibility of building its own \nhistory. From experience we have learned that if we do not take the \nmaking of our own history into our own hands, others will do it for \nus in their own way, which implies an ominous fate for a people which \nrespects itself: intervention. The historic commitment of the present \nGovernment of Guatemala is to consolidate the peace and security of \nthe nation; to solve the serious economic crisis which is affecting \nGuatemala, as indeed it is affecting the entire world, because of an \neconomic recession which in Central America has become aggravated by \ninternal causes; to restructure and incorporate large sectors that \nare representative of the country and which have been unjustly left \nout in the past and have not participated in the democratic decision \nmaking of the nation, but which under a new and safe electoral system \nwill for the first time freely exercise their right of universal \nsuffrage, thus ensuring the self determination of the people of \nGuatemala and ruling out the electoral fraud which in the past has \nbeen the means of diverting our democracy from its true course; to \nreturn to a state of law and to install a democratic Government \nrepresentative of all the people, a process whose gradual development \nwill be completed by the beginning of 1985. We are convinced that all \nsectors of the country will patriotically cooperate in this \nenterprise to implement a true democracy involving the representation \nand participation of the people of Guatemala. That is our commitment, \nand those are the firm steps we shall take towards the future of \nGuatemala in the search for a better national and international \ndestiny. From this rapid glance at the transformation which has taken \nplace in my country, it can be inferred that its international policy \nwill also be different from now on. Without underestimating the \nsacred concepts of the sovereignty and independence of nations, the \nGovernment I represent is aware of the interdependence of nations in \nthe economic, political and cultural fields and it recognizes the \nneed that our problems a id our differences be resolved in the \nconcert of nations, in open discussion, in the best way, on the basis \nof respect and trust. In addition to the circumstances just \ndescribed, we have also had to deal with a national disaster in the \nsouthern part of the country, brought about by an atmospheric \ndepression, causing loss of human life, crops and property. All this \nhas brought a shadow of mourning over Guatemala. I wish to take this \nopportunity publicly to express, on behalf of the Government of \nGuatemala, our appreciation for the prompt and effective help we have \nreceived from friendly Governments and international organizations. \nAs regards the foreign policy of my country, the Government of \nGuatemala has since the day it assumed power on 23 March this year, \nseen the necessity of revitalizing our democratic institutions and \nrestoring the fundamental values of the people and the dignity of the \nnation, and it has declared its intention of abiding by and complying \nwith the international commitments acquired by Guatemala and \nmaintaining full respect for the legal rules governing relations \nbetween States, as well as cooperating closely with the organizations \nthat concern themselves at the international level with human rights \nand guard and protect their exercise. The Government of Guatemala \nintends to strengthen its bonds of friendly relations and cooperation \nwith all countries with which such relations already exist and to \nextend them to all countries which love peace and democracy and which \ndesire such relations, in order to achieve the principles of progress \nwithin the international community. Guatemala also wishes to confirm \nits trust in international organizations and its decision to comply \nwith commitments undertaken in terms of the principles and the \nCharter of the United Nations and those of the charter of the \nOrganization of American States and to reaffirm my Government's \nsupport for the United Nations as the principal instrument for \nmaintaining peace and strengthening international security. As \nregards our Central American policy, Guatemala pursues a policy of \nfraternity with the countries of the region, as we have the same \norigin, we acceded to independent life at the same time, we make up a \ngeographic unit, we share the same history, we speak the same \nlanguage, we have the same traditions and customs and we face similar \nproblems. Maintaining utmost respect for the principle of \nnonintervention in the internal affairs of other countries, Guatemala \nseeks a rapprochement with the sister nations of Central America. The \nterms of this rapprochement can best be summarized as respect for the \nhighest values of humanity, namely peace, justice and freedom, and \nthe building of economic, legal and political mechanisms for the \ndevelopment of the Isthmus, to promote cooperation among our nations, \nto strengthen the bonds among our peoples and to engage in a joint \nsearch for a more promising future for the area, which of late has \nseen 50 many upheavals. At the Latin American level, Guatemalan \npolicy is aimed at reaffirming its faith in the inter  American \nsystem, the objectives of which are outlined.in the charter of the \nOAS; our international policy at the regional level is one of interrelation, \nsolidarity and cooperation with the countries of the region. We \nbelieve that Latin America must play its proper role, within the \nworld community, for it is a continent that has struggled for the \nprinciples of freedom, social justice and dignity and a region that \nhas a geo political influence of undeniable importance within the \nworld community. Guatemala has faith in the historic destiny of our \nAmerica and believes that by strengthening relations in the \nhemisphere within the framework of the QAS, Latin America will be in \na position to promote gradual, independent and sovereign development \nfor its peoples and to secure for them the conditions necessary to \nderive maximum benefit from their natural resources and to utilize \nthe advances of science and technology. As far as world policy is \nconcerned, Guatemala supports those democracies which respect the \ndignity of the human being. In the economic field, Guatemala, as a \ndeveloping nation, shares the just aspirations of the third  world \ncountries and, as a member of the Group of 77, we share the concern \nof poor nations with regard to the obvious international injustice \nevident at many levels but fundamentally in the areas of \ninternational trade and economics. As regards human rights, the \nFundamental Statute of Government, which constitutes the highest \nlegal instrument regulating the actions of the Government of the \nRepublic of Guatemala, provides that respect for human rights is one \nof the basic principles of its internal organization and of its \ninternational relations. The same Fundamental Statute of Government \ndefines human rights and elaborates on them in its articles, covering \nbasic human rights, civil and political human rights and social, \neconomic and cultural human rights. The Government of the Republic \nrespects those rights within the country and internationally it is \ncooperating with the organizations created to ensure their \nobservance. In line with this policy, the Government of the Republic \nextended a cordial invitation to the whole Inter American Commission \non Human Rights to visit Guatemala to ascertain that those rights \nwere being observed, within the context of the national situation. \nThis invitation was accepted with pleasure and the visit took place \nduring the week of 20 to 26 September this year. The Inter American \nCommission on Human Rights publicly recognized that its members \nenjoyed full cooperation and broad freedom during their stay in \nGuatemala while carrying out an in depth investigation of human \nrights in my country. They met with officials from the Government, \ninstitutions, associations, representative groups and political \nparties, as well as with individuals and legal entities who wished to \nfile complaints. They travelled to the interior of the country, \nvisiting the villages of their choice, to interview the inhabitants \nand exchange impressions with them and to view on the spot their \nproblems and their living conditions from a human rights standpoint. \nThe report of the Inter American Commission on Human Rights, once the \nprocedural requirements laid down in its rules and regulations have \nbeen met, will be made public by the Commission and may be read by \nthe entire international community. At the end of their visit the \nmembers of the Commission made recommendations to the Government of \nGuatemala, which are at present under consideration for appropriate \nimplementation. Within the jurisdiction of the United Nations, the \nCommission on Human Rights decided to appoint a special rapporteur to \ninvestigate the human rights situation in Guatemala. The Government \nasked the Secretary General to propose the name of a candidate for \nthat post. The person proposed has already been appointed and has \nbeen accepted by my Government, and he will be given full cooperation \nand freedom for the fulfilment of his mission. There have also been \ninterviews and conversations with the Working Group to examine \nquestions relevant to involuntary or enforced disappearances of \npersons, established by the Commission on Human Rights, and the \ninformation requested concerning cases under consideration by it has \nbeen submitted. It has been offered our full cooperation for the \nfulfilment of its mandate. This attitude by the Government of \nGuatemala reflects its sincere mention to improve the human rights \nsituation in the country and to request the assistance of the \nrelevant international organizations in order to make human rights in \nGuatemala more effective every day. I turn now to the problem of the \nMalvinas Islands. Following the decision of the Republic of Argentina \nto reincorporate the Malvinas Islands within its sovereignty, \nGuatemala confirmed its position in support of that sister nation's \nlegitimate rights over those islands and endorsed its determination \nto claim sovereignty over them. My country, in public declarations \nand in statements both in the Security Council and at the twentieth \nconsultative meeting of Foreign Ministers convened by the OAS in \naccordance with the Inter American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty, \nexpressed its views in connection with the Malvinas Islands, \nreaffirming its solidarity with the Republic of Argentina and \nrecognizing the latter's full rights to territorial integrity. In the \nSecurity Council itself Guatemala stated: It is inconceivable that \nthe colonialist system, which is fortunately in its death throes \nthroughout the world, including our continent, should have sprung to \nlife, allowing a colonialist empire to impose its interests upon our \nAmerica to the detriment of a Latin American country, whose right to \nsovereignty over the full extent of its territory has been \ninternationally recognized. We believe that this matter should be \ndealt with through negotiations so that the vast majority of the \nStates that make up this international community may maintain their \nfaith and belief that international justice lives and prevails, even \nwhen what is at stake are the interests of great Powers which seek to \nimpose their will by means of their military might. If this does not \ncome about, Latin America will consider this action against Argentina \nas a serious threat to all of Latin America too and very disturbing \nfor the rest of the world, which might suffer similar treatment if an \nattempt were made to subject them to similar circumstances. We have \nwitnessed the anguish of a Latin American republic being attacked by \nan extra continental Power in violation of international law, and we \nhave also been grieved at the fact that Argentina did not receive the \nresponse of solidarity which it should have in this case and provided \nfor in treaties which up to now have been in full force and fully \ncomplied with. As the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Guatemala, \nI had the honor to sign together with the Foreign Ministers of other \nLatin American countries, a request for the inclusion of an item on \nthe Malvinas Islands in the agenda of the present session of the \nGeneral Assembly, to be discussed in plenary meeting. None the less, \nI now urge the countries involved in the controversy to resume as \nsoon as possible the required negotiations under the auspices of the \nUnited Nations for the purpose of resolving that dispute. The \npeaceful settlement of disputes is and must continue to be, within \nthe United Nations, perhaps the most powerful instrument for \nachieving peace and security. The General Assembly has not discussed \nthe question of Korea in the pa x years. Guatemala feels that it \nshould be for the Koreans themselves to find a peaceful solution to \nthe problem of Korea and that the Organization can help to create a \nfavorable climate in which to resume inter Korean talks rather than \nengage in an unproductive debate on the question. Nevertheless, in \nview of the tense and unstable situation prevailing at present in the \nKorean peninsula, my country is of the opinion that resumption of the \ndialogue between North and South Korea is urgent, so that, through \ndirect negotiations and without outside pressure or interference, \nthey may find a solution to their differences. To that end, it is \nessential that North Korea make the political decision to return to \nthe conference table as soon as possible. Guatemala believes that, \nirrespective of the main objective that total reunification of the \nKorean peninsula be achieved, both South Korea and North Korea, as a \nmeans of relieving the existing tension and creating conditions \nfavorable to the stability of the area, could be admitted as Members \nof the United Nations, pursuant to the principle of universality \nprovided for in the Charter. In regard to disarmament, with which the \nUnited Nations has concerned itself since its creation my delegation \nwould like to quote the statement by the President of Guatemala sent \nas a contribution by my country to the twelfth special session of the \nGeneral Assembly, the second special session devoted to disarmament: \nGuatemala, whose people and Government are deeply committed to peace, \ndeems it appropriate to express its ideas to this forum convened to \ndiscuss all aspects of disarmament. Guatemala considers that the arms \nreduction campaign is vital for the peace of the world, the \ndevelopment of States and the prosperity of peoples. It is necessary \nto express openly the dangers inherent in the continuation of the \narms race and to dispel the hope that peace and security can coexist \nwith the accumulation of vast quantities of means of destruction. \nGeneral and complete prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons is of \nparamount importance, since it helps to reduce the risk of nuclear \nwar which would mean a holocaust for mankind. My country believes \nthat both atomic and nuclear energy should be used only for peaceful \npurposes and for the benefit of the human race. Guatemala considers \nthat a lasting peace can: be secured only through general and \ncomplete disarmament under effective and strict international control \nand not through a balance of armaments between the great Powers. \nDisarmament is one of the objectives proclaimed by the United Nations \nfor over three decades, but despite the numerous initiatives adopted, \nby the Organization, the world is witnessing a frenzied arms race. \nAlthough the great Powers should be primarily responsible for \ndisarmament, Guatemala believes that it would also be desirable to \nban sophisticated weapons in Latin America as a way of contributing \nto universal disarmament and of increasing the resources allocated to \neconomic and social development. The Treaty of Tlatelolco, to which \nGuatemala is a party, is a very useful instrument for preventing \nLatin America from being converted into a depository of nuclear arms \nor a test site for atomic weapons. I feel it is appropriate to \nunderscore the great importance of the highly industrialized \ncountries understanding that if, instead of devoting large sums of \nmoney to the production of weapons of mass destruction, they were to \nchannel those resources to poor countries to help them in their \nefforts to achieve integral and harmonious development, the major \nscourges of hunger, unemployment, malnutrition, illiteracy and \nprecarious living conditions which prevail in the third world would \nbe considerably reduced. Peace and social justice, which are the \ngreatest aspirations of mankind, can be achieved with the active \nparticipation of all nations with a view to establishing a new \ninternational order and creating for present and future generations a \nmore human and balanced world based on, solid foundations of equality \nand dignity. Guatemala believes that all the problems of disarmament \nshould not continue to be viewed in the traditional way, but that it \nis necessary to extend the field of knowledge as to the attitude of \ncertain Powers and countries which unconditionally serve their \nhegemonistic interests by providing subversive movements with arms, \nmunitions, military training, logistical support, money and \ninternational patronage. If a global analysis of matters related to \ndisarmament is not carried out,, various initiatives to reduce \nmilitary expenditures and calls to Powers to halt their arms race \ndeal with only one aspect of the problem but overlook the other \naspect, which is the supplying of arms to subversive factions so that \nthey may continue to use terrorism and armed struggle as means to win \npower, at the resulting cost of human lives and suffering and \nhardship for the civilian population, as well as the unavoidable use \nof resources to fight subversion, which could otherwise be used for \nworks of public benefit and major social interest. Guatemala notes \nwith satisfaction that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law \nof the Sea, after holding several sessions, has succeeded in \nproducing the text of a Convention on the Law of the Sea. My country, \nlike others, sincerely regrets that a text which has the subject of \nprotracted negotiation has not been adopted by consensus because some \nStates have reservations concerning some of the provisions of the \ninstrument, basically those concerning the exploitation of sea \nresources beyond national jurisdiction. Guatemala urges those nations \nto show their goodwill by making concessions in their political \nattitudes, so that the Convention on the Law of the Sea may be \nstrengthened through its implementation by all the States Members of \nthe Organization. Guatemala voted in favor of the Convention and will \nsign it when it is open for signature by States. As regards Belize, \nGuatemala reiterates and maintains in this Assembly its reservations \nregarding the unilateral granting of independence to Belize by the \nUnited Kingdom, ignoring Guatemala's legitimate rights to that \nTerritory, which was the subject of dispute under an international \nlegal controversy, in accordance with the peaceful procedures of the \nCharter of the United Nations. That dispute remains unresolved \nbecause of that unilateral and illegal act by the United Kingdom \nwhich has created a permanent situation of insecurity in the area. We \nfeel it indispensable to resolve this controversy through \nnegotiations and by means of a peaceful solution that is equitable to \nall parties, including basically the rights of Guatemala, which are \nfounded on solid historical, geographical, legal, political and moral \narguments. 170. Guatemala, confronted by this unacceptable action, \nconsiders that the way in which independence was granted to Belize \nwas in violation of international norms; therefore, it does not \nrecognize that independence, it does not recognize Belize as a State, \nnor does it recognize its sovereignty or its borders, or its \nmembership in the community of nations. That will continue as long as \na fair, equitable solution preserving Guatemala's legitimate rights \nover the Territory and the interests of the population of Belize is \nnot found. 17l. Guatemala has asked the United Kingdom of Great \nBritain and Northern Ireland not to disregard its historical \nresponsibility in this matter and to continue direct negotiations so \nthat a peaceful and at the same time equitable and honorable solution \nmay be found for this age old controversy. The noble purposes of the \nUnited Nations will not truly be achieved the large majority of \nmankind ceases to suffer from poverty, hunger, ignorance, illiteracy, \nunemployment, malnutrition, precarious living conditions, lack of \nhousing and many other hardships. If all human beings have a right to \nhappiness, material progress and intellectual, moral and spiritual \nadvancement, the main tasks of the United Nations must be to \nstrengthen international cooperation and to create the conditions \nnecessary to exercise those fundamental rights. My delegation \nbelieves it essential to initiate global negotiations on cooperation \nfor development in the economic field, since everybody is aware that \nit has not been possible to reduce the gap between developed \ncountries and developing nations. On the contrary, the economic and \nmonetary crisis has of late merely worsened those adverse effects on \nthe sensitive economies of developing nations. No effective solution \nhas been found for the problems of commodities, international debts, \nbalance of payments, protection of the purchasing power of developing \ncountries, trade and transactions, transfer of technology, increase \nof actual available ,resources, and access to capital markets. \nAlthough Guatemala believes that the United Nations is the most \nappropriate forum for resolving questions affecting the future of all \nthe countries of the world, we admit that the Organization has not \nalways acted with the promptness and effectiveness needed to solve \nthe crises threatening world peace. This situation occurs because it \nis difficult to strike an accurate and practical balance between \nhuman rights, the interests of States and the principles and purposes \nof the Charter. We have thus noted that the Security Council and the \nGeneral Assembly have not always made the same assessment of \nsituations that threatened international peace and security. The \nSecurity Council itself has to some extent distorted its role by \nusing procedures of informal consultations among its members, instead \nof concerning itself, as it ought to, with handling matters falling \ndirectly within its jurisdiction and finding adequate solutions for \nthem. My country saw a good example of that when we submitted to that \nbody our petition opposing the admission of Belize to the United \nNations. The Security Council, in open violation of the principles of \nthe Charter, refused to be seized of the matter. It did so without \nany reason, forgetting that there had been an open controversy to be \nresolved within the principles of the Charter. It is necessary to \nestablish a solid basis of equity and justice for the development of \ninternational relations. My delegation believes that we must return \nto the sources that gave birth to this Organization. The light which \nthen shone at San Francisco, when the Organization was created, \nshould become a beacon for present and future generations; one which \nwill light our way and enable us to build a better and more balanced \nworld, one founded on the pillars of fraternity and solidarity, where \npeace, social justice, freedom and dignity to which all human beings \nwithout exception are entitled will prevail.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, I should like at the outset to extend to \nyou, on behalf of the delegation of the \nDemocratic Republic of the Sudan, sincere \ncongratulations upon your election as President \nof this session of the General Assembly. We are \nconfident that your experience and wisdom will \nenable you to lead our deliberations successfully.\n46.\tWe should also like to take this \nopportunity to express to your predecessor, Mr. \nKittani, our deep appreciation of his \nindefatigable efforts for the success - of the \nthirty-sixth session, and to wish him all the \nbest in his future endeavors.\n47.\tSince this is the first regular session \nof the General Assembly since the election of the \nnew Secre\u00actary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de \nCuellar, I should like to congratulate him first \non his election, and secondly on his excellent \nreport on the work of the Organization. The \nreport is of special importance, in our view, for \ntwo reasons: first, for its candour and courage \nin identifying the weakness in the Organi\u00aczation \nand of its authority, and secondly, for its \ntimeliness, as it was released at a time when the \nauthority and prestige of the Organization were \nwaning and when the Security Council, the \nprincipal organ entrusted with the maintenance of \npeace and security, was almost paralysed.\n48.\tWe say this with specific reference to \nthe failure of the Security Council to deter \nIsrael and to put an end to its aggressive \nactions, the latest of which was the invasion and \noccupation of Lebanon and of its capital, Beirut \nand the genocide carried out against Palestinians \nand Lebanese in southern Lebanon and west Beirut \nwhich culminated in the massacres at the Shatila \nand Sabra refugee camps. Session after session, \nthe overwhelming majority of the members of the \ninternational community represented in the \nAssembly have warned about and called attention \nto the aggres\u00acsive nature of Israel, its \nexpansionist policies and its sinister design to \nexterminate the Palestinian people. Its latest \nact of aggression against Lebanon and the \nPalestinians is but additional proof of those \nsinister designs.\n49.\tThe records attests to this assertion: \nfirst, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon was \nmounted under extremely dubious pretexts at a \ntime when the PLO was fully respecting the 1981 \ncease-fire agreement; secondly, the invasion and \nthe genocide that followed took place at a time \nwhen the Security Council was constantly meeting, \nadopting resolution after resolu\u00action to no \navail; thirdly, the invasion and its gruesome \naftermath took place while the whole world, \nthrough the mass media, was watching the carnage; \nfourthly, Israel persisted in its barbaric \nactivities in Lebanon despite the advice, the \nwarning, the opposition and the denunciation of \nthe whole international community, including \nIsrael's allies; fifthly, Israel not only defied \nthe resolutions of the General Assembly and of \nthe Security Council, but went further, defying \nand brushing aside the authority of the Security \nCouncil represented by the United Nations \npeace-keeping forces in southern Lebanon: \nsixthly, the Beirut mas\u00acsacre was a further \nmanifestation not only of Israel's defiance of \nthe United Nations but also of its defiance of \nthe whole international community and of its \nMends when it blatantly violated the Beirut \nagreement, under which the Palestinian fighters \nleft Beirut, leaving thousands of Palestinian \ncivilians under the sole protection of the \nguarantees contained in that agreement.\n50.\tIsrael is committing all these atrocities \nunder the pretext of defending its security. What \nkind of security is Israel referring to? Is it \nthe indefinable security that was the pretext for \nbombing the Iraqi nuclear research centre, \nhundreds of miles away and across the territory \nof two sovereign countries at a time when the \nIsraeli nuclear reactor in Daymona operates \noutside the obligations contained in the Treaty \non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and \noutside the monitoring and safe\u00acguards of IAEA? \nIs it the security that was the pretext for \nannexing Arab Jerusalem and declaring it the \neternal capital of Israel over the objection of \nthe world and against the resolutions of the \nGeneral Assembly and of the Security Council? Is \nit the security that was the pretext for \noccupying and then annexing the Syrian Golan \nHeights, the strategic heights that overlook \nDamascus? Is it the security that was the pretext \nfor the perpetual occupation of the West Bank and \nfor the planting of fortified settlements and \narmed settlers in the midst of hundreds of \nthou\u00acsands of unarmed Palestinian villagers? Is \nit the secu\u00acrity that was the pretext for \nstorming through southern Lebanon, destroying its \ntowns and villages, besieging Beirut and \ninterring in Lebanon's internal affairs after \nviolating its sovereignty and destroying its \nnational unity? Is it, in the final analysis, the \nsecurity that was the pretext for exterminating \nthousands of unarmed Palestinians, women, old \npeo\u00acple and children, because more than 30 years \nof homelessness and oppression had not silenced \ntheir demands for the fulfilment of their \nlegitimate rights?\n51.\tWhat security and secure boundaries does \nIsrael want? Is it the kind of security that does \nnot recognize the right of others to security or \nthe kind where bound\u00acaries are continuously \nshifting and expanding? Is it not painfully \npuzzling that some of us still argue that peace \nin the Middle East will not obtain unless \nIsrael's security is guaranteed? To whom are the \nsecurity guarantees more vital: to Israel, that \nspreads its troops and modem war machine all over \nthe region; or to Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, the \nother Arab coun\u00actries and the homeless \nPalestinian people, victims of daily Israeli \naggression?\n52.\tWe have opted and we shall continue to \nopt for peace, peace that is based on justice and \nnot peace imposed by guns. The Twelfth Arab \nSummit Confer\u00acence at Fez clearly reflected this \nstrong commitment to just and lasting peace in \nthe Middle East, peace that will guarantee the \nsecurity of all States in the region and the \nachievement of the inalienable rights of the \nPalestinian people, including their right to \nself-determination and to the establishment of \ntheir State on their land. That peace will not be \nachieved unless the Palestinians, represented by \nthe PLO, their sole legitimate representative, \nparticipate in negotiating that peace.\n53.\tIt is now abundantly clear to the \nAssembly, which represents the conscience of the \ninternational community, that a just and lasting \npeace in the Middle East cannot be achieved \nwithout a just and lasting solution to the \nPalestinian question, which remains the core of \nthe Middle East conflict. This solution must \nguarantee the achievement of the inalienable \nrights of the Palestinian people, including their \nright to self-determination, sovereignty and \nindependence and to the establishment of their \nindependent State on their land. This will not be \nachieved without ensuring Israeli compliance with \nthe resolutions of the Security Council and the \nGeneral Assembly calling for the total and \nunconditional withdrawal of Israel from all Arab \nterritories occupied since 1967, including Arab \nJerusalem, and for the realization of the \nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n54.\tAt the Fez Conference the Arabs were \nunani\u00acmous concerning peace based on justice, and \ncon\u00acfirmed their genuine desire for it. In our \nview, the Fez decision has created, for the first \ntime in the history of this issue, a favorable \nclimate for all parties con\u00accerned to bring about \na just settlement of the conflict in the Middle \nEast, especially bearing in mind the new, \npositive development in the American attitude. \nThis is reflected in President Reagan's \ninitiative and his expressed desire for a \npeaceful settlement that will end the tragic \nsuffering in the Middle East.\n55.\tWe welcome all the efforts now being \nexerted to ensure a just settlement of the Middle \nEast prob\u00aclem and hope that those efforts and \nendeavors will not be nullified by the \nintransigence of the Israeli Government.\n56.\tIn surveying the present international \nsituation, we clearly note the gap between the \nprevailing situa\u00action in international relations \nand that situation which the peoples of the world \naspire to in regard to the realization of \ninternational peace and security. The problems we \nare facing are becoming more complicated and \nhotbeds of tension and conflict throughout the \nworld continue to pose serious threats to \ninternational peace and security.\n57.\tThe Sudan is following with increasing \nconcern the Iran-Iraqi war, which has been going \non for more than two years now despite all \nefforts to stop it. From this rostrum, we commend \nthe Iraqi initiatives and efforts, made within \nand outside the United Nations, to stop the \nsuffering of the peoples of those two Moslem \ncountries. We call on Iran to respond positively \nto those efforts so that Moslem resources and \nwealth can be utilized for the good of the Moslem \nnation.\n58.\tThe Sudan firmly believes in the \nprinciples of respect for the sovereignty and \nindependence of all countries and peoples, the \nillegality of intervention in all its forms in \ninternal affairs, the inadmissibility of the use \nor threat of use of force in international \nrelations and the necessity of halting all forms \nof aggression and pressure\u2014covert or overt\u2014that \nthreaten the sovereignty and political \nindependence of other countries.\n59.\tThat is why we view with anxiety the \npresence of foreign troops in Afghanistan and \nKampuchea. We reiterate our call for the \nwithdrawal of all foreign troops so that the \npeoples of those two countries can exercise their \ninalienable right to decide on the politi\u00accal, \nsocial and economic systems they deem fit for \ntheir countries, without foreign intervention or \ndomi\u00acnation.\n60.\tWe also hope that efforts to arrive at a \njust and peaceful solution to the questions of \nKorea and Cyprus will meet with success and bring \npeace, stability, development and national unity, \nwhich are the aspirations of the peoples of those \ncountries.\n61.\tThe Sudan is following with great concern \nand attention the developments of the political \nsituation in South Africa. In this regard, it is \nabout time for the racist clique in Pretoria to \nlearn that neither peripheral nor cosmetic \nchanges can remedy that abhorrent situation. What \nis needed is radical and far-reaching change that \nwill abolish the apartheid system and establish a \njust and democratic society, where the majority \nenjoy their freedom as well as their inalien\u00acable \nsovereign rights. It is our conviction that, no \nmatter how long it takes, that goal will be \nachieved through the ongoing heroic struggle of \nthe national resistance movement in South Africa.\n62.\tOne cannot venture to address the \nproblems in southern Africa without addressing \nthe question of Namibia, which the international \ncommunity had expected would take its rightful \nplace in this body.\nIt is time for the international community to put \nan end to the delay in the settlement of the \nNamibian issue. It is our understanding that the \nlatest round of negotiations has achieved some \npositive results, which we hope will lead to the \nadoption of accelerated measures in implementing \nthe peaceful plan for the independence of Namibia \nin accordance with Security Council resolution \n435 (1978).\n63.\tWe in the Sudan hail the heroic role of \nthe South West Africa People's Organization \n[SWAPO] and its capable handling of the arduous \nnegotiations despite the maneuvers employed by \nSouth Africa in that process. We also commend the \nrole of the front\u00acline African States and the \nwisdom, co-operation and flexibility they \nexhibited in the course of those negotiations. \nMoreover, we appreciate the role played by the \nWestern contact group in the initial efforts, \nwhich helped make possible the adoption of \nresolu\u00action 435 (1978). However, now more than \never before, we urge the contact group, to do its \nutmost to exert the necessary influence on South \nAfrica so that it will meet its commitment as \nstipulated in the plan within the framework of a \ndeclared timetable, before we lose this valuable \nopportunity, which may be the last. It is also \nimperative that such a move ultimately lead to \nthe peaceful termination of the illegal \noccupation of Namibia by South Africa and allow \nthe people of Namibia to exercise their \nlegitimate right to self- determination.\n64.\tIn view of its commitment to the cause of \nAfrican liberation in general and the \nindependence of Namibia in particular, as well as \nits uncompromising belief in the effective role \nwhich the United Nations must play in settling \nthe Namibian problem, the Sudan has agreed in \nprinciple to participate in the United Nations \npeace-keeping force envisaged for the \ntransitional period of the implementation of the \nindependence plan for Namibia. This was \noriginally stated by President Jaafar Mohamed al \nNemery, at the thirty- third session of the \nGeneral Assembly meeting, in his capacity as \nChairman of the Assembly of Heads of State and \nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity \nin 1978. We should like once again to confirm \nfrom this rostrum the fact that we agree to \nparticipate in the United Nations peace\u00ackeeping \nforce for Namibia. That participation is, indeed, \nin pursuance of our African obligations to render \nmoral and material support to SWAPO and to the \npeople of Namibia to enable them to manage their \nown affairs after independence.\n65.\tDespite the aspirations that led the \ninternational community to convene the second \nspecial session devoted to disarmament, last \nJune, that session failed to meet those \naspirations to even the minimum degree.\n66.\tHowever, the failure of that session \nshould not preclude us from stressing the \nimportance of the comprehensive programme of \ndisarmament, which would determine the specific \nmeasures of disarmament which should be \nimplemented within a defined time\u00acframe, as well \nas other measures to prepare the way for future \nnegotiations leading towards general and complete \ndisarmament. Priority in disarmament negotiations \nshould be given to nuclear weapons, and then \nother weapons of mass destruction, including \nchemical weapons and any others which may be \ndeemed to be excessively injurious or o have \nindiscriminate effects.\n67.\tThe Sudan firmly believes that the \nestablish\u00acment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on \nthe basis of agreements or arrangements freely \nreached among the States of the zones concerned \nconstitutes an important disarmament measure. In \nthat conviction, the Sudan has consistently \nsupported the efforts of the Organiza\u00action to \ntransform the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace, \nfree from the arms race and foreign military \npresence manifested in the form of military bases \nand installation, nuclear weapons and other \nweapons of mass destruction, and any \nmanifestation of great- Power rivalry.\n68.\tTo that end the Sudan will spare no \neffort, in sincere co-operation with the States \nof the region, to crystallize the concept of \n'.the Red Sea as a lake of peace free from \nbig-Power military strategic rivalry.\n71. Faithful to the decisions of the OAU, the \nSudan also consistently stresses the necessity to \ntransform the African continent into a \nnuclear-weapon-free zone and eliminate all forms \nof foreign influence and intervention therein.\n72.\tThe economic reports issued recently by \nGovern\u00acments and various bodies of the United \nNations system all indicate that the present \ninternational economic crisis is the most serious \ncrisis since the 1930s. This evaluation is made \nmore disturbing by all the economic indicators in \ndeveloped countries. Unemployment has broken all \nthe records of the past 50 years. Growth rates \nare becoming slower than ever and inflation is \nnot yet under control. Trade restrictions and \nbarriers threaten the world with new trade wars \nthat would complete the similarity between the \ncurrent crisis and that of the 1930s.\n73.\tThe most dangerous aspect of the present \ncrisis is its devastating impact on the economies \nof the developing countries, particularly the \nleast developed and the African countries, and \nits negative impact on international economic \nco-operation, which is characterized at present \nby a diminished commitment to multilateralism and \na decline in official develop\u00acment assistance, \nwhich is essential to the development efforts of \nhe least developed countries. The financial \ncrisis in UNDP and the difficulties connected \nwith the sixth replenishment of the International \nDevelop\u00acment Association and other international \ndevelopment institutions are clear proofs of this \ndangerous trend.\n74.\tThe Sudan and the other least developed \ncoun\u00actries are the hardest hit by the \ninternational economic crisis, and the least \ncapable of cushioning the recur\u00acrent \ninternational economic shocks. Despite this \nunfavorable international economic climate, the \nSudan is endeavoring to overcome its economic \nproblems with a two-pronged approach. The first \nis self-reliance and the mobilization and \ninvolvement of its citizens and regions in the \nprocess of development. The second is the \nutilization of bilateral, regional and \ninternational economic co-operation for its \nbenefit and that of its partners.\n75.\tThe most outstanding achievement \ninternally is the implementation of the new \nregional government system in the Sudan, a \ncountry with a territory of 1 million square \nmiles, which must broaden the political and \neconomic participation and involvement of all \nparts of the country. Under this system, the \nSudan is divided into six regions, each with a \nparliament, a cabinet and a governor, enjoying \nwide powers, especially in economic and social \ndevelopment and the provision of various \nservices. It is our hope that the application of \nthis system will accelerate regional development, \nconsolidate the principle of self-reliance and \nfacilitate the fair distribution of the fruits of \neconomic and social development throughout the \ncountry.\n76.\tIn spite of our own efforts and \nself-reliance, we have to admit that the present \nstage in the prevail\u00acing international economic \nsituation necessitates increasing support from \nthe international community for our development \nefforts, particularly through increasing official \ndevelopment assistance, bilaterally and \nmultilateral, and technical co-operation through \nUNDP and other United Nations agencies.\n77.\tTrue to its racial, cultural and \nhistorical identity, the Sudan, which belongs to \nthe Arab African region, has worked actively for \nAfro-Arab solidarity and the strengthening of the \nmachinery and economic and political institutions \nthat serve that end. In Africa the Sudan \nconsistently calls for adherence to the policy of \ngood-neighborliness, the non-use of force and the \npeaceful settlement of disputes through political \nsolutions, because these are the lasting \nsolutions. We do this in the conviction that such \na policy will bring Africa peace, stability and \nprogress. Only in that way can Africa channel all \nits abilities towards develop\u00acment and \nconstruction, rather than waste them in disputes \nand conflicts. Africa is in great need of the \ntractor and other means of construction rather \nthan the cannon and other means of destruction.\n78.\tMatching words with deeds, the Sudan \nworks seriously for the strengthening of \nrelations with neighbouring countries. Bilateral \nand tripartite ministerial committees have been \nestablished with many of those countries, with a \nview to consolidating and strengthening those \nrelations, ensuring respect for the independence \nand security of those countries, the well-being \nof their peoples and the enhancement of their \nsocio-economic development.\n79.\tAs a result of that conviction, and with \nthe aim of achieving such objectives, a charter \nof integration between Egypt and the Sudan has \nbeen drafted and will be signed in the next few \ndays. This charter represents the organizational \nframework for steering the development process in \nthe two countries through the implementation of a \nnumber of projects of eco\u00acnomic, social and \ncultural integration. By establishing such an \ninteraction, the Sudan and Egypt are attempting \nto create an example of regional co-oper\u00acation. \nThe charter of integration between the Sudan and \nEgypt constitutes a serious step towards the \nachievement of regional co-operation and \nintegration in Africa, in accordance with the \nLagos Plan of Action adopted by the OAU Assembly \nof Heads of State and Government in April 1980.2\n80.\tThe OAU was created as an embodiment of \nAfrican wisdom inspire by a heritage deeply \nrooted in historyand as a manifestation of \nAfrica's ability to overcome all the obstacles in \nits path. Since its inception in 1963 the \norganization has upheld the same lofty and noble, \nprinciples and objectives as the United Nations. \nAs envisaged by its founding fathers, the OAU has \ncome to be regarded as a tributary of this \ninternational Organization whose aim it is to \nstrengthen and uphold the same ideals and \nprinciples. Throughout the years the OAU has \nproved to be resilient in the face of the \nafflictions and crises it has faced, and it has \nproved stronger than the problems imposed upon \nit. It has also resisted attempts to weaken it or \ndisrupt its unity or to hinder the achieve\u00acment \nof its objectives. The OAU has continued to be \nthe embodiment of the conviction of all African \npeoples that solving African problems is the \nrespon-sibility of the Africans themselves and \nshould be faced with African wisdom and \ndetermination and dealt with through the \ninstitutions and machinery devised at sessions of \nthe OAU Assembly for the settlement of these \nproblems. We trust that, despite the crises it \nfaces today, that organization will be able to \ncontain the differences confronting it. Faithful \nto the objec\u00actives and principles of the OAU, the \nSudan and its African brothers will spare no \neffort to enable the organization to overcome \nthose differences and to attain the objectives \nfor which it has been created.\n81.\tUnlike other least developed countries, \nthe Sudan suffers not only from the impact of the \ninternational economic crisis but also from a \ncontinuous influx of refugees, which adds an \nadditional burden that drains resources and \nefforts already earmarked for financial, economic \nand social development. The refugees registered \nby the United Nations in the Sudan total more \nthan a half million, although the number actually \nentering the country across the borders with its \neight neighbors far exceeds that. In spite of \nthis heavy burden and its disruptive \nconsequences, the Sudan has succeeded in \ndeveloping a unique experiment in the field of \nreceiving and caring for refugees. Our experience \nin rehabilitating refugees, in an exemplary \nmanner commended by the international community, \nhas enriched the experience of the Sudanese \nauthorities concerned and created an able cadre \nin that Held. As a result, the problem of the \nrefugees in the Sudan has gone from the stage of \nimmediate relief to a system of planning for the \nrelocation of refugees in well-prepared \naccommodations, together with basic educational \nand health services and employment opportunities, \nwhich allow the refugees to become independent.\n82.\tTo implement these projects, the Sudan \nmade considerable efforts to mobilize resources \nfrom Governments, international organizations and \nvolun\u00actary agencies. In this context, in June \n1980 the Sudan organized the International \nConference on Refugees, in Khartoum, and declared \n1980 the Year of Refugees in the Sudan. In \ncontinuation of those efforts an inter\u00acnational \nseminar was held in Khartoum on 11 Sep\u00actember of \nthis year. Participants in that seminar included \ninternational experts in the field of refugee \nproblems as well as representatives of the \nrefugees themselves. The seminar discussed a \nnumber of issues, the most important being the \nintegration of the refugee projects into local \nand national develop\u00acment plans. The Sudan has \nalways pursued positive policies on refugee \nquestions, for humane and ethical reasons, and \nalso in compliance with regional and \ninternational instruments\u2014to which the Sudan is a \nparty and which it has incorporated in its \nConstitu\u00action\u2014as well as practices, providing for \nsuch rights.\n83.\tThe Sudan welcomed the convening of the \nInternational Conference on Assistance to \nRefugees in Africa, held at Geneva in April 1981, \nand commended its outcome as a step in the right \ndirection to be followed by other international \nmeasures commensurate with the needs of those \nrefugees, taking into account their continuous \ninflux and the negative impact on the host \ncountries and peoples.\n84.\tMy delegation would like to reiterate the impor\u00actance of holding \na follow-up conference in 1983 to evaluate the \nprogress achieved in the implementation of the \nrecommendations and decisions of the first \nConference, to consider ways and means of \nover\u00accoming the difficulties and problems \nhindering the implementation of some of the \nrecommendations and decisions of that Conference \nand to urge the inter\u00acnational community to \nhonour its commitments to African refugees and \nAfrican host countries.\n85.\tAt the thirty-sixth session I con\u00accluded \nmy statement to the Assembly by reaffirming the \nSudan's unequivocal belief in the role of the \nUnited Nations, particularly with respect to the \nmaintenance of international peace and security. \nToday I shall conclude by reiterating our call \nfor the con\u00acsolidation and strengthening of the \nUnited Nations, especially the Security Council, \nso that the Organi\u00aczation can fulfill its basic \nrole in the maintenance of peace. The \nSecretary-General's report on the work of the \nOrganization has courageously and frankly \nreflected the concerns of the majority of the \nMember States about what has become of the \nOrganization and of its role in the maintenance \nof international peace and security. We hope that \nthe Secretary- General's ideas and proposals will \nbe seriously considered by all Member States, and \nparticularly by the Security Council\u2014perhaps at a \nhigh-level meeting, as the Secretary-General has \nproposed. In this regard it suffices to submit \nthe following observations.\n86.\tFirst, we agree with the \nSecretary-General that the establishment of the \ncollective security system provided for in the \nCharter is the only way for the United Nations to \ncarry out its basic task. Reinforcing the \ncollective security system would protect the \nsmall and weak nations and save the vast \nresources now wasted on armaments in a world that \nrespects only force.\n87.\tSecondly, the reluctance of some States \nto resort to the Security Council for the \nsettlement of disputes or the maintenance of \npeace or to do so only when it is too late, \ndefeats the main objective behind its creation. \nIt is worth mentioning here that adjudication by \nthe Council must be coupled with an absolute \ncommitment on the part of Council members, \nespecially ifs permanent members, which have a \nspecial responsibility in this respect, just as \nthey have special rights, to fulfill their \nresponsibility.\n88.\tThirdly, the Security Council must \nconsider appropriate ways of making Member States \nobserve and respect its decisions. The Council \nwill have to be ready to deal with those States \nwhich violate its decisions.\n89.\tFourthly, the role played by the United \nNations peace-keeping forces cannot be separated \nfrom the efficacy of the Council in exercising \nits authority and using its prestige and in \nensuring that its resolutions will be \nimplemented. Peace-keeping forces, as we all \nknow, are a moral rather than a military \ndeterrent. We believe that the \nSecretary-General's proposal for strengthening \npeace-keeping operations through collective \nguarantees is a matter which deserves serious \nstudy.\n90.\tIn conclusion, the commitment of Member \nStates to the Charter and its objectives is the \nonly guarantee of its effectiveness in \nmaintaining international peace and security and \nensuring prosperity for all the peoples of the \nworld.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, it is with great satisfaction that we see the post of President \nof the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly occupied by the \nrepresentative of a friendly people with great historical traditions \nof struggle for freedom, peace and progress. The Hungarian people \nsucceeded in preserving their dignity and personality for all time by \nheroically resisting Hitler's fascism and building a socialist \nfatherland free from foreign domination. Strong ties of friendship \nand solidarity forged during our armed struggle for national \nliberation from colonialism bind our two countries. After the \nproclamation of our independence, these ties took on a new dimension \nand scope, extending to multidisciplinary cooperation, the basis of \nwhich is the defense and pursuit of the fundamental interests of our \npeoples and Governments and building and defending socialism. In \nexpressing our firm guarantee of close cooperation in the fulfilment \nof the weighty responsibilities that have been entrusted to you, my \ndelegation joins previous speakers in warmly welcoming you and \ncongratulating you on your unanimous election. We wish also to \nexpress our appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Kittani, for the \nskilful and intelligent manner in which he conducted the work of the \nlast regular session of the General Assembly. This was no easy task \nconsidering the grave crisis existing at the time in international \nrelations, in which dialogue and mutual trust among nations gave way \nto cold war language, threats, aggression and intimidation. We extend \nour greetings to the Secretary General, whose action in defense of \nthe Charter of the United Nations and in the endeavor to find \npeaceful solutions to world problems at the most critical times is \ndeserving of the respect and confidence that the international \ncommunity extended to him when it elected him one year ago. The \ndisdain in which the United Nations is held as a privileged forum for \ndiscussion and for the search for peaceful solutions to international \nconflicts is expressed in the constant violation of the purposes and \nprinciples set forth in the Charter. The overwhelming majority of the \nspeakers at this session have denounced the aggravation of the \nalready critical situation prevailing in all parts of the world. \nThere is an atmosphere of insecurity and latent warfare, which seems \nlikely to lead to a holocaust. As if the already existing hotbeds of \ntension were not enough, we are witnessing the outbreak of new \nhotbeds and the emboldening of localized conflicts. This situation \nforces peoples to divert their human and material resources from the \nsolution of problems inherent in underdevelopment, such as hunger, \nhomelessness, illiteracy and disease, in order to concentrate on the \ndefense of their sovereignty and on the fight to achieve and preserve \ntheir freedom. To the obstinate refusal to acknowledge the right of \npeoples to self determination, the peoples respond with the \nresolution to die rather than live in slavery. Harmonious relations \nand cooperation among nations require the creation of a climate of \npeace and security in the world and absolute respect for the \nfundamental right of peoples to self determination and independence. \nIt was the ideals of peace, justice and liberty that inspired the \npeople of Mozambique. When we took up arms against colonialism in \nMozambique we fought to eliminate the causes of war in our county; we \nwere moved by the noble aspiration to establish, with all the peoples \nof the world good and just relations founded on sovereign equality \nand mutual respect. This is a just aspiration for which all the \npeoples of the world, in which inequities and imbalances are \nincreasingly felt, are prepared to fight. With the achievement of our \nnational independence we established the conditions for the \nexpression and development of our culture and our personality, which \nhad been trampled upon and inhibited during the centuries of \nexploitation and domination. But the scope of our ideals was not \ncircumscribed by the liberation of our territory alone. We were \nforced, shortly after independence, to wage another war, imposed upon \nus by Smith's racist regime.\nA/37/PV.26\nIn expressing solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe in their just \nstruggle, Mozambique was contributing to the elimination of one of \nthe causes of war and instability in our area. The independence of \nZimbabwe made it possible for a climate of relative peace to be \nrestored, which enabled broad perspectives to be opened up for our \neconomic development and stimulated cooperation among the countries \nof southern Africa. Since then it has become possible for us to \nconcentrate our attention on the search for solutions to the numerous \nproblems facing our people. Our objective is to promote the material \nand social wellbeing of all the people in Mozambique, who were denied \nthis throughout the entire period of the domination of their country. \nThe relative peace that we achieved was of short duration. In \ndefining and using an illegal minority racist, regime as their \nprincipal ally in the area, the imperialist forces consciously, \nwilfully and impudently gave Pretoria the moral strength which, more \nthan any technical or technological means, allows it to provoke war \nand occupy parts of the territory of Angola, a sovereign State, \nspreading death and destruction to all the front line States. This is \na deliberate action which is typical of heir redoubled \naggressiveness, the basis of which is the refusal of the imperialists \nto recognize the right of peoples to independence, freedom and \npeaceful and harmonious development: the face of the qualitative \nadvances achieved by our people in the reconstruction of our country \nthe imperialist forces have intensified their activities against the \nPeople's Republic of Mozambique. They are trying by all possible \nmeans to prevent the establishment of a civilization without \ndiscrimination, which the building in Mozambique of a socialist \nsociety, free from man's exploitation by man, represents in our part \nof the world. No longer able to rely on a political and \nadministrative structure in Mozambique, something they were able to \ndo until recently, imperialist forces are today resorting to other \nmore insidious and brutal means of attacking us. Using as a spearhead \nthe racist minority regime in South Africa, imperialism is waging a \ntrue undeclared war against us, committing direct armed acts of \naggression against our country through the use of regular South \nAfrican troops and special detachments of armed bandits. The Pretoria \nregime recruits and trains, finances and equips, arms and outfits, \ntransports and supplies, evacuates and commands armed bands in \nMozambique in order to commit crimes against our people, spread \nunrest and terror and destabilize our country. The target of these \nbandits is the helpless civilian population, intimidating them and \ncommitting all kinds of atrocities. They savagely torture, mutilate \nand assassinate children, women and the elderly. They rob peasants \nand loot their property. These armed bandits also perpetrate \nkidnappings and assassinations against foreign nationals who \ncontribute with their labor to the progress of the People's Republic \nof Mozambique. These armed bandits are recruited by South Africa from \namong those former members of the political police force of the \ncolonial regime who did not have the courage to join in the process \nof national reconstruction and thus to wipe from their hands the \nblood resulting from  their crimes. They are recruited from among \nthose elements of the colonial army such as commandos and special \nunits which, like the former, rushed cheaply to themselves to new \nbosses instead of waiting for the clemency of the people. They are \nrecruited from among traitors to the fatherland, marginal elements \nand foreign mercenaries. The common denominator of these bandits is \ntheir anti social character, parasitism. Characteristics of the \ndecadence of the so called free world. They do not pursue any \npolitical objectives. Their motivation is crime for its own sake, and \ndrug the nature of their acts and their criminal motivation \ncharacterize them as bandits. The armed banditry taking place in our \nregion today is a new phenomenon, a new form of mercenarism. In \norganizing and utilizing armed bandits, imperialism and the apartheid \nregime a aiming at implanting among the world public the false idea \nthat opposition and a climate of insecurity exist in Mozambique. \nConcurrently with the acts of armed aggression, the enemy is \ninfiltrating spies into our country and promoting economic sabotage. \nIn promoting a vigorous campaign of slander and misinformation on the \ninternational scene, the enemy endeavors to project to the world the \nimpression that there exists in Mozambique a permanent state of \nterror and panic. It promotes an economic blockade, thus hampering \nsound and fruitful cooperation with other peoples of the world. It \nendeavors to hamper the consolidation of our independence enforcement \nduring this phase of our development process and tries to discredit \nsocialism, a system freely elected by the people of Mozambique. In \nthis struggle, in which the enemy is using the most subtle methods of \naggression, our people has demonstrated the highest degree of \ncritical consciousness and has become that cannot be penetrated by \nthe designs of imperialist agents. We wish to express our gratitude \nin all those members of the international community that have in \nvarious ways extended support to us and that contributed progress of \nour country and the strengthening of fair and equitable cooperative \nrelations. We reiterate our appeal to the international community to \nmaximize its assistance to the People's Republic of Mozambique so as \nto enable us to reinforce our defensive capability and successfully \nto carry out the struggle gains underdevelopment. The existence of \ncolonialism, racism and apartheid is the fundamental cause of the \ntension through which we are living in southern Africa and our \npermanent confrontation with the South African regime, which \nobstinately refuses to accept the course of history. South Africa \ncontinues to intensify its criminal actions against the South African \npeople, whose struggle for national liberation is growing in scope \nand depth and spreading to practically all sectors of the economic \nand social life of the Pretoria regime. To the wave of \nassassinations, detentions, the torture of those who oppose and the \nrepression of trade unions, in which many whites are now also \nmilitantly involved, the people of South Africa respond with positive \nactions of resistance, causing the erosion of the very establishment \nof the Pretoria regime. The people is fighting heroically against \noppression, discrimination, repression and humiliation. Large \nsections of the white population are rising against the restriction \nof liberty, repulsed by the brutal nature of apartheid, whose \ncriminal action is beginning to be felt in their own homes. Thus \ncontradictions deepen in the very heart of Botha's racist minority \nregime in the face of its manifest inability to contain by force the \nliberation. struggle of the South African people under the leadership \nof the African National Congress. Confronted by a wave of popular \nuprisings, and unable to fi: 3 a solution to its internal strife, \nPretoria chooses to generalize the conflict in the area. South Africa \nattacks and occupies part of the territory of the People's Republic \nof Angola, at the same time supporting and promoting puppet groups \nsuch as the Union Nacional para la Independence Total de Angola. It \ncontinuously and systematically commits acts of armed aggression \nagainst Lesotho, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe, violating the \nterritorial integrity of those sovereign countries and showing no \nrespect whatever for the ethical conduct governing relations among \nStates signatories of the Charter of the United Nations. The \nobjectives pursued to bring about permanent destabilization are in \nthe last analysis intended to divert ns from the struggle for \neconomic independence under the Southern Africa Development \nCoordination Conference. That Conference is the weapon of the nine \ncountries of the region for independent development and the gradual \nelimination of dependence on South Africa and imperialism in general. \nSouth Africa is taking action again.  It aimed at its disintegration \nin the face of the progress achieved in the various sectors of \ncooperation, particularly in the area of transportation and \ncommunication. We continue to be preoccupied with the question of \nNamibia. Arrogant and irresponsible, South Africa continues to use \ndilatory maneuvers to delay the self determination and independence \nof the people of Namibia, which, like every other people, has the \nright to freedom and independence. In Namibia, it is the people that \nis fighting for independence. That is the reality which is being \nobliterated. That is the reality which is being conjured away. That \nis why any attempt at connecting the independence of Namibia, either \ndirectly or indirectly, with the withdrawal of internationalist Cuban \nforces from Angola is not only intolerable interference in the \ninternal affairs of the People's Republic of Angola but also a crime \nagainst the people of Namibia, because by this subterfuge an effort \nis being made to prolong war and massacres. The internationalist \nCuban forces are in Angola because the racist regime in South Africa \nviolated the sovereignty of that territory. Therefore we must demand, \nin the first place, the unconditional withdrawal of the invading \nSouth African troops from Angolan territory and an absolute guarantee \nthat such aggression will not be repeated. In fact, all the \nindependent countries of the area which are being threatened and \ninvaded by the forces of the apartheid regime are demanding \nguarantees of security. The foreign forces which are attacking, \nassaulting and occupying independent States in southern Africa in \nviolation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of those \nStates are not Cuban. The only invading forces which, as the entire \nworld knows, attack and occupy the territories of the independent \nStates of southern Africa are the forces of South Africa. It is \nabsurd to set the security of South Africa as a pre condition for the \nindependence of Namibia. Namibia is not the first country bordering \non South Africa to fight to achieve its independence will not come \nfrom outside South Africa. It is the children of the people of South \nAfrica who will overthrow that hideous regime from within. If it were \na matter of involving foreign forces in the struggle for the \nliberation of South Africa, they could have used the territory of \nZimbabwe for more than two years now and the territory of Mozambique \nfor more than seven years; and the territory of other independent \ncountries bordering on South Africa could have been used even \nearlier. The sovereignty of the people of Angola cannot be used as \ncurrency in exchange for the liberation of Namibia. The liberation of \nNamibia is an integral part of the universal emancipation movement of \npeoples. The People's Republic of Mozambique reaffirms once again its \nunconditional support for the struggle of the people of Namibia under \nthe leader ship of the South West Africa People's Organization its \nonly legitimate representative. As far as we are concerned, Security \nCouncil resolution 435 remains the political and juridical framework \nfor the fair solution of this problem. No pretext designed to impede \nthe implementation of that resolution can stand up to a correct \nanalysis of the reality. The remaining problems could easily be \nsolved if there were the essential political will on the part of \nSouth Africa and its allies. We are of the opinion that even during \nthis session of the General Assembly it should be possible to define \nan electoral system for the election of a constituent assembly. It \nshould be possible during the current session to establish the forces \nof UNTAG and a date and the conditions for a cease fire in Namibia. \nThis is the International Year for the Mobilization of Sanctions \nagainst South Africa; nevertheless, the indices of economic growth of \nthe\tregime show an ever increasing connivance by Western \ncountries in maintaining and reinforcing that abominable and hideous \nregime. While it is said that to apply sanctions against South Africa \nis a useless exercise, sanctions are being applied against other \ncountries. Where, then, is equity, justice and integrity? Today we \nare observing the international Day of Solidarity with South African \nPolitical Prisoners. On this day, dedicated to the struggle, we \nsalute the determination and the courage of the peoples of South \nAfrica. We demand that the freedom fighters be released from South \nAfrican prisons. The action of imperialist forces is not confined to \nsouthern Africa: its scope spreads throughout the African continent. \nAt the present time those forces are endeavoring to implement their \nstrategy aimed at the manipulation, paralysis or even disintegration \nof the Organization of African Unity, an important anti colonialist \nand anti imperialist instrument. We are certain that the African \ncountries will know enough to turn down the blackmail, intimidation \nand bribery and reject the divisive tactics, and to work towards the \nconsolidation of the OAU. We repeat our support for the admission of \nthe Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic to the OAU and reject the idea \nthat that may be a cause for division within our continental \norganization, since it is based. The forces that will overthrow the \napartheid regime on the principles embodied in the OAU charter and in \nthe Charter of the United Nations. We reaffirm our active solidarity \nwith the just struggle of the people of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic \nRepublic. It is a struggle that could find its resolution through \nnegotiation, which unfortunately is hampered by the intransigence of \nthe Morocco regime. This intransigence is the reason for the \nprotracted state of war, which threatens to spread and even involve \nother countries, because of the involvement of alien forces on the \nMoroccan side. That danger must be averted by countries which cherish \nfreedom and the independence of peoples. The image of the massacres \nin Beirut is a blown  up picture of a Dantesque world transferred to \nthe latter part of the twentieth century. Beirut invaded, Beirut \nbombed, Beirut besieged, deprived of water, food and medicines, will \nremain forever engraved in the history of the resistance struggle of \npeoples. It was a gratuitous demonstration of Zionist murderous fury, \nthe purpose of which was the total elimination of the Palestine \nLiberation Organization. Despite the powerful weaponry unleashed by \nthe Zionist regime, the PLO and the progressive Lebanese forces \nresisted the slaughter and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. We \nhail their heroism. The People's Republic of Mozambique supports the \nstruggle of the Palestinian people, with the certainty that it will \nend with the creation of a Palestinian State, autonomous and \nsovereign, and the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab \nterritories, which is the only acceptable solution to the conflict in \nthe Middle East. The illegal occupation of East Timor continues. The \nexpansionist Indonesian regime insists on the criminal occupation of \nthat Territory, denying the Maubere people its inalienable right to \nself determination and independence. How many times must the events \nin Beirut be repeated in Dili before we can say enough and finally \nacknowledge the right of the Maubere people to exist and build its \nindependent and sovereign State? Independence is not a privilege of \nthose who are richer or more powerful. It is not an attribute of \nMoslems or Catholics. Independence is an inherent right of all \npeoples, regardless of geo strategic, religious or other \nconsiderations. Every people has its history, its culture, its \npersonality. By preserving them, the people can face any obstacle and \naccept any sacrifice from the best of its children. It is because \nthey are making such sacrifices and because their struggle is a just \none that the Maubere people deserve our support. The curtain of \nsilence drawn around the massacres and the famine to which the \nMaubere people are being subjected can no longer muffle the cries of \nthe hundreds of thousands of people of Timor who are resisting the \nbrutal Indonesian occupation. Both Republican and Democratic United \nStates, Senators have recently called attention to the gravity of the \nsituation. The situation in East Timor was compared by them to that \nof Biafra at the time of the secessionist war and that of Kampuchea \nduring the Pol Pot era. They clearly admitted that the Maubere people \nhad not exercised their right to self determination. We cannot watch \nthese atrocities in silence. In East Timor there are people who, \nunder the leadership of Frente Revclucionaria de Timor Leste \nIndependents their legitimate representative, reject the annexation, \nresist Indonesian occupation and fight for the affirmation of their \nnational rights. They have our admiration and our solidarity. We are \ncertain that in Dili the banner of liberty of the Maubere people will \nbe raised. In Korea, the presence of United States troops in the \nsouthern part of the territory contributes to the creation of \ntension, hampering the reunification process of the Korean nation a \ndismembered country, split in two by an imaginary line drawn in \nconformity with geo political concepts, to the detriment of national \nreality. We support the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its \nefforts to ensure the peaceful reunification of its nation. Its \nproposals for direct negotiations between North and South Korea with \na view to the creation of a confederated republic constitute a \npositive contribution to the unification process. In Latin America, \nCuba, Nicaragua and Grenada are the targets of constant threats of \naggression. The imperialist aggressiveness ranges from economic \nblockade to imminent invasion and occupation. The peace and stability \nof the area must necessarily be contingent on the cessation of the \nuse or threat of force or of any type of coercion against Cuba, \nNicaragua and Grenada, free countries which have the right to choose \nin full sovereignty their own way of achieving socio economic \ndevelopment. In Chile, El Salvador and Guatemala popular uprisings \nare developing and apologists of Western civilization are endeavoring \nto intensify their military and financial support of the \ndictatorships in the area. No bayonets can silence the people's cries \nfor freedom. Fairness and moral considerations dictate that we \nsupport the peoples of those countries in their struggle to gain \ntheir freedom and tum their countries into lands free from terror and \nrepression, where no one need any longer live with the fear of never \nagain being reunited with his loved ones. The People's Republic of \nMozambique reaffirms the principles of solidarity with all peoples \nwho fight for their political and economic emancipation and for \npeace. We meet again in an international debate in an atmosphere \ntense and heavy with threats. The crisis expands and worsens and is \nbeing felt most acutely in developing countries. The dramatic effects \nof this crisis on our countries are well known: the imported \ninflation, the growing deficit in the balance of payments, the \ndeterioration in the terms of trade, the food shortages, and so on. \nDeveloping countries are faced with all the symptoms of \nunderdevelopment, where hunger is the overpowering scourge of the \npeople. Specific short term and long term measures must be taken with \na view to the eradication of the hunger and malnutrition that ravage \nAfrica. Our continent is becoming ever more dependent on imports of \nfood because of the lowered production and the natural catastrophes \nthat have periodically devastated our region. The adoption of \ncoercive economic measures aimed at the attainment of specific \npolitical objectives is so common today that it is as though an \nattempt were being made to replace the norms in the juridical \ninstruments governing the Organization by that practice. It is thus \nthat the countries that freely chose paths to development which led \nthem to real independence have fallen victim to blackmail and \npressures. Taking into account the present international economic \nsituation, we are concerned by the insistence of some developed \nmarket economy countries on taking unilateral and arbitrary decisions \nand refusing to engage in meaningful negotiations. The initiation of \nglobal negotiations on international cooperation for development is \nof primary importance. The People's Republic of Mozambique calls for \nthe exertion of all possible efforts during the current session of \nthe General Assembly to ensure the initiation of global negotiations. \nWe wish to assure the Assembly that our country will sign the \nrecently adopted United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,' \nwhich establishes a new juridical order for the utilization of the \nocean space as an instrument of justice, peace, development and \ninternational cooperation among States. true cooperation among States \nbased on a common examination of international economic problems and \non common action is absolutely necessary. Only then will it be \npossible for us to respond to the yearnings of all peoples for \nequitable and rational development in all parts of the world. It is \nimportant to ensure the appropriate conditions without delay, \nestablish normal economic relations among all States, regardless of \ntheir socio economic systems and to reinforce international \ncooperation as a means of stabilizing peace. The exploitation of the \nweak can no longer be regarded as the right of the rich, nor can \npoverty, hunger, ignorance and disease continue to be the lot of the \npeoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America. The struggle for peace is \nthe greatest preoccupation of our time and most of mankind is \ninvolved in it. The struggle for peace means the reduction, \ndestruction and Final elimination of the causes of the conflicts that \nrage around the world: imperialism, colonialism, neo colonialism, \nracism, apartheid Zionism. It means, in addition, that we must apply \nall our efforts to achieving general and complete disarmament. That \nis why the failure of the second special session of the General \nAssembly devoted to disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, is \nof great concern to the People's Republic of Mozambique. The wanton \narmaments race and the use of the ocean space and the stratosphere \nfor purposes of warfare are serious obstacles to development and to \ncooperation among States. Development for the peoples and the \npromotion of worthwhile social and material wellbeing cannot be \nachieved unless all available human and material resources are used \nfor peaceful purposes. In the realm of the struggle for peace, the \nPeople's Republic of Mozambique considers that nuclear disarmament \nhas the highest possible priority, since the devastating effects of \nthis type of weapon represent a serious threat to our very survival. \nIt is essential for the sake of all mankind to prevent a nuclear \nconflict, and this must be a matter of fundamental concern in the \npolicy of every Government. A threat to peace continues in the Indian \nOcean region, where we see the consolidation, expansion and \nnuclearization of imperialist naval and military bases. Some Western \ncountries persist in their firm opposition to the convening of the \nworld Conference to adopt measures to give effect to the Declaration \nof the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace free from nuclear weapons. We \nhope that those countries will change their position in order to make \npossible the implementation of General Assembly resolution 36/90, \nwhich provides for the Conference to be held during the first half of \n1983. The struggle for the implementation of peace and cooperation is \none of our greatest priorities. Peace is necessary in the struggle \nagainst underdevelopment. Cooperation among the people of the world \nemerges as a necessity in the history of humanity and as an \ninstrument in the struggle against underdevelopment, in particular \nthrough the creation of a just international order. The People's \nRepublic of Mozambique reiterates its commitment to contribute, \ntogether with the other members of the international community, to \nthe search for a just and equitable solution to the problems that \nbeset all of humanity. Despite the systematic and deliberate \nviolation of international legal instruments by certain Member \nStates, we reaffirm our adherence to the principles and purposes of \nthe Charter. The People's Republic of Mozambique expresses its full \nconfidence in the Organization and in its everlasting dedication to \nthe struggle for the achievement and preservation of international \npeace and security. The struggle continues.\n"

        "file_text": "      1. On behalf of the State of Qatar, it gives me great pleasure, \nSir, to express to you warm felicitations on your election as \nPresident of the current session of the General Assembly. I also wish \nto pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Kittani, who presided over \nthe past session and conducted its proceedings with exemplary \ncompetence and objectivity. I should like to avail myself of this \nopportunity to extend my sincere congratulations to the Secretary \nGeneral. I wish him, on behalf of my country, full success in all his \nefforts and activities aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the \nOrganization in the service of the international community. I also \nwish to thank his predecessor, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the \npraiseworthy and sincere efforts that he made throughout his term of \noffice as Secretary General.\n\n2. The deteriorating political conditions which have recently \ndominated the entire world are a grave indicator of the incompetence \nof the Organization in contributing to international peace. It is not \ntrue that the Organization, despite all its great and meritorious \nendeavors, has not been able to resolve the problems before it and \nhas not brought about the peace for which our world longs?\n\n\n3. I do not believe that we are the only ones that pose this \nquestion. In his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary \nGeneral, with commendable candor and objectivity, warns of the \nemergence of indications of such a sad state of affairs. Undoubtedly, \nthe Secretary General reveals the heart of the matter and puts his \nfinger on the root malaise when he states that, as a result of the \nbreach of the provisions and principles of the Charter by certain \nStates, the Security Council clearly all too often finds itself \nunable to take decisive action to resolve international conflicts. \nThis feeling of incompetence is intensified by the fact that Security \nCouncil resolutions, which include resolutions adopted unanimously, \nare increasingly defied and ignored by those who feel themselves \nstrong enough to do so. That strength may be their own or may be \nderived from the absolute support given them by a super Power.\n\n4. This phenomenon did not emanate from a vacuum. It is surely the \ncorollary of certain policies that have recently emerged on the \ninternational scene to resolve conflicts and problems on the basis of \nunilateral initiatives outside the effective framework of the United\nNations, which is the only international organ qualified to solve \nsuch conflicts by peaceful means. As such practices and unilateral \ninitiatives have increased, it is natural that the effectiveness of \nthe role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international \npeace and security not to mention the very credibility of the \nOrganization, has diminished.\n\n5. The question of Palestine is a genuine embodiment of the \naforementioned fact. Hundreds of resolutions have been adopted on \nthis question, but Israel, with its customary tyranny and \nintransigence, has persistently rejected all those resolutions. It \nhas gone so far as to violate them daily, cutting the whole world to \nthe quick by trampling on its most noble human sentiments, propped up \nby States that shower it with financial and military aid. This aid is \ncoupled with the individualistic political stand that opposes all the \npeace loving voices concerned with the general good of man and which \nseek to impose sanctions on the aggressor in such a way as to \npreserve the human rights and dignity of the victim.\n\n6. Israel is an anomalous phenomenon in the international community. \nIt came into being through oppression and aggression. It murdered and \nrendered homeless thousands of Arab Palestinians for its selfish \nends. This is its persistent policy and immutable creed: murder, \nmurder and more murder. The most recent manifestation of its \nbarbarism and racism was its genocidal onslaught on the camps of \nSabra and Shatila in Lebanon, which claimed thousands of victims \nwomen and children who had lived in peace in those camps, suffering \nfrom alienation and dispossession. They have been driven there by \nIsraelitself since 1947.\n\n\n7. As if the displacement it caused them were not enough and as if \ntheir agonizing plight, living in inhuman conditions in shanty towns, \ndid not satiate it, Israel did not renounce the principle which \nbrought it into being that genocidal principle to which it had \npreviously had recourse in the Palestinian villages of Deir Yassin \nand Kafr Qasim, as well as in other massacres of the Palestinian \npeople. Israel is well aware that wherever the Palestinian people \nexists, its right to its homeland and the right to return will remain \nunshaken.\n\nA/37/PY.22\n8. The fact that Israel ravaged west Beirut and forced its way into \ncivilian quarters after the forces of the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization had withdrawn, under a guarantee from the United States \nGovernment that Israel would not intervene or harm the civilian \npopulation there, is irrefutable and is proof of the wanton Israeli \npractices that flout all covenants, values and instruments. In this \nconnation, we affirm to the entire world that fraternal Lebanon, its \nterritorial integrity and the security of its people should not be \nthe subject of interpretation and discussions. This issue requires \nall of us, as an international community, to take the necessary \neffective measures to compel Israel to comply with Security Council \nresolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982) concerning immediate and \nunconditional withdrawal from Lebanese territory.\n\n9. My delegation holds the international community represented in the \nOrganization responsible for allowing Israel to remain a Member of \nthe Organization. My delegation calls for the suspension of its \nmembership and the adoption of stringent measures against it to \ncompel it to comply with the relevant resolutions of the \nOrganization, the principal demands of which are total and \nunconditional withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and that \nthe Palestinian people be enabled to return to its homeland and \nestablish its independent national entity.\n\n\n10. The core of what is termed the Middle East question is the \nPalestinian question. Unless the international community finds a just \nsolution for it the situation there will remain unstable and there \nwill be a state of constant turmoil and the threat of a conflagration \nat any moment. A collective Arab resolution was put forward on the \nbasis of the comprehensive principles approved at the Twelfth Arab \nSummit Conference, held at Fez in 1982. The Arabs considered this an \nacceptable basis upon which to resolve the Palestinian question \npeacefully and permanently, proceeding from the basic principles \ncontained in United Nations resolutions. These principles provide a \ngood opportunity to reach a peaceful solution to the question.\n\n11. However, there are other issues that produce permanent hotbeds of \ntension, including the security of the Arab Gulf and the war between \nIraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The State of Qatar firmly \nbelieves that ensuring the security of the Gulf area is the task of \nthe States of the area. This will be possible only when the big \nPowers refrain from interfering in their affairs.\n\n12. The Iraqi Iranian war constitutes a disturbing situation for and \ncauses apprehension to all the States of the area and the whole \nworld, because of its brutality, the time it has lasted and the act \nthat it is raging in a strategic and important location for all \nStates of the world. My country supports and sees a good omen in the \nIraqi initiative under which Iraqi troops were withdrawn to the \ninternational borders, and Iraq indicated continued willingness to \nnegotiate on a cessation of hostilities. We sincerely hope that the \nGovernment of Iran will respond to this good initiative to avert \nMoslem bloodshed and to allow these two brother peoples to apply \nthemselves to the task of reconstruction and rehabilitation in order \nto repair the havoc wreaked in that fierce war.\n\n\n13. The establishment of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States \nof the Gulf, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and \nthat of the League of Arab States, reflected the will of six Gulf States. \nThey envisaged it as a prime necessity to achieve political, economic \nand security complementarity and coordination. It is a testimony to \nthe desire of those six States to achieve peace and prosperity for \ntheir region. We pledge that the member States of this Council will \nexert all possible efforts through it to maintain the security and \npeace of that strategic region of the world.\n\n14. My country views with concern the present situation in \nAfghanistan because it is an Islamic country with which we are linked \nby bonds of brotherhood and religion and because it is one of the \nhotbeds of tension in our area.\n\n\n15. We earnestly hope that the Soviet Union will heed the calls of \nthe international community and withdraw all its forces from Afghan \nterritory so that the Afghan refugees may return to their homeland \nand the Afghan people may choose their own political system and forge \ntheir destiny in freedom.\n\n16. We have pinned high hopes on the holding of an international \nconference to consider the issue of the Indian Ocean as a zone of \npeace, since this is one of our repeated demands. We hope that this \nwill take place as soon as possible so as to contribute to world \npeace and stability.\n17. The situation on the African continent is also one of our \nconcerns. We sincerely hope that appropriate solutions will be \nreached concerning the areas of tension there. We affirm our support \nfor and solidarity with the people of Namibia in its just struggle \nunder the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization \nand the national majority in South Africa in the struggle being waged \nagainst the policies of\tand racial discrimination pursued by the \nwhite minority Government. We call on all peace loving States to \nexercise all forms of pressure on the Government of South Africa to \ncompel it to respond to international good offices aimed at achieving \na comprehensive and just settlement of the situation there and \nnullifying South Africa's designs and stratagems to prevent agreement \non a peaceful settlement.\n\n18. The whole world was bitterly disappointed when the second special \nsession devoted to disarmament resulted in failure. That was clear \nevidence of the desire of certain parties to continue to develop \nmeans of destruction and place the entire world under constant fear \nand anxiety as a result. This effort should have been directed \ntowards the achievement of tranquility and a peaceful life for all. \nThe astronomical sums involved should be spent on developing and \nimproving man's life everywhere on this planet.\n\n\n19. It has become clear to the international community that the \nestablishment of a new international economic order is indispensable \nif we are to prevent the crises and problems that may occur in the \nfuture if international economic relations remain unchanged.\n\n20. The economy of each State in our world today is, in varying \ndegrees, in constant interaction with the economies of other States. \nWe are fully convinced that the sooner we determine the effects of \nthis the greater will be our chance of averting exacerbation of the \nnegative implications. We can then draw up national policies taking \ninto account their implications for the international economy.\n\n\n21. Our target is stability for the international economy which is \nthe cornerstone of the achievement of international economic \nprogress. We maintain that the efforts being made to this end at \npresent by various international organizations and agencies should be \nsupported.\n\n22. If economic stability is jeopardized that creates a threat to \ninternational peace and security. Developing countries cannot \novercome poverty and food problems, as well as their other economic \nproblems, without concrete aid from the international community. This \nshould be directed essentially to effecting structural changes in the \neconomies of these countries to enable them to advance the wheel of \ndevelopment in such a way as to realize their ambition to achieve a \nproper degree of economic growth.\n\n\n23. The State of Qatar wishes to stress in this international forum \nits conviction that the task of grappling with and resolving the \neconomic problems of the developing countries rests, in the first \nplace, with the Governments and individuals of those countries. \nHowever, as we are all well aware, because of their nature the \nsolution of these problems requires, in addition to the efforts of \nthe developing countries, the consistent and collective efforts of \nthe international community with regard to debts, the flow of \nfinancial and technical aid and the laying of the foundations of \nmodem technology.\n\n24. We look forward to a sincere and constructive international \ndialogue in which all nations of the world participate to consider \nsolutions for current international economic problems: world \nrecession, currency fluctuations, deterioration of the terms of \ntrade, increased indebtedness in the developing countries and chronic \ndisequilibrium in the balance of payments of the least developed \ncountries.\n\n\n25. As a Member of the United Nations, the State of Qatar pledges \nthat it will cooperate fully with the rest of the Member States, \nsparing no effort to preserve the principles of the Organization, \nwhich are aimed at achieving dignity, security and stability for all \nmankind.\n"

        "file_text": "I begin by paying a tribute to the new \nSecretary-General, who has brought great \ndistinction to the office during his brief \ntenure. Dag Hammarskjold once told the General \nAssembly that whichever word one chooses \nindependence, impartiality, objectivity\u2014they all \ndescribe essential aspects of what, without \nexception, must be in the attitude of the \nSecretary-General . Javier Perez de CueBar, a man \nof the third world, and, I am proud to note, of \nthe New World as well, has already demonstrated \nhis strict adherence to this most exacting \nstandard. In so doing, he has earned the esteem \nof my Government and the gratitude of all who \nbelieve in the purposes of the Charter.\n197.\tI also congratulate Mr. Hollai of Hungary \nupon his election as President of the \nthirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\n198.\tAs I stand here today I cannot help but \nreflect on my relation to this city and to this \nHall. I was born about four miles from here. I \nwas reared and educated not far away, just across \nthe Hudson River, and I took a tour through this \nbuilding just after it opened in 1952, marveling \nat the reality of a temple erected in the hope, \nat least, of abolishing war. ,\n199.\tWhen I took that tour back in the early \n1950s, there was great public interest in what \nwas called the Meditation Room. I understand the \nroom is still here. But in the years since then \nthis institution has become more famous for talk \nthan for meditation. This Hall has heard great \nideas eloquently expressed. It has also heard \ndouble-talk, platitudes and ringing protestations \nof innocence\u2014all too often aimed at camouflaging \noutrageous and inhuman acts.\n200.\tBut we must not ridicule words. I believe \nthat the greatest advance in human history was \nnot the wheel, the use of electricity, or the \ninternal combustion engine. Indispensable to \nprogress as these have been, our most remarkable \nachievement was the slow, clumsy but triumphant \ncreation of language. It was words that released \nour ancestors from the prison of the solitary. \nWords gave us the means to transmit to our \nchildren and the future the crowning jewel of \nhuman existence: knowledge. The Code of \nHam\u00acmurabi, the Bible, the Analects of Confucius, \nthe teachings of the Buddha, the Koran, the \ninsights of Shakespeare, the creed of Mahatma \nGandhi or Martin Luther King\u2014all these were \narrangements of words.\n201.\tIs it not profoundly revealing that the \nfirst victims of tyrants are words? No people \nbetter know the meaning of freedom than those who \nhave been arrested or beaten or imprisoned or \nexiled because of what they said. A single man \nspeaking out\u2014a Lech Walesa, for example\u2014is more \ndangerous than an armored division.\n202.\tAll of us here, whether we arrived after \na short one-hour flight, as I did, or came from \nthe other side of the globe, as many others of \nthose present did, enter this auditorium for one \nmain purpose\u2014to talk about what our Governments \nsee as the problems ahead and how they should be \nsolved. On one point at least we can all \nagree\u2014the problems are many and difficult. I \nshall not try, in the minutes allotted me, to \ndeal with each, or even most, of these issues in \ndetail. Instead, I want to give the Assembly some \nsense of the principles and general approach that \nthe United States will take toward our common \nproblems.\n203.\tAmericans are, by history and by \ninclination, a practical and pragmatic people, \nyet a people with a vision. It is the \nvision\u2014usually simple and sometimes naive\u2014that \nhas so often led us to dare and to achieve. \nPresident Reagan's approach to foreign policy is \ngrounded squarely on standards drawn from the \npragmatic American experience. As de Tocqueville \npointed out,  To achieve its objective, America \nrelies on personal interest, and gives full reign \nto the strength and reason of the individual. \nThat is as true now as when it was said 150 years \nago. Our principal instru\u00acment, now as then, is \nfreedom. Our adversaries are the oppressors, the \ntotalitarian, the tacticians of fear and pressure.\n204.\tOn this foundation, President Reagan's \nideas and the structure of his foreign policy are \nso straight-forward that those of us enmeshed in \nday-to-day details may easily lose sight of them. \nThe President never does, he consistently brings \nus back to funda\u00acmentals. Today I will talk about \nthose fundamentals. They consist of four ideas \nthat guide our actions: we will start from \nrealism; we will act from strength, both in power \nand in purpose; we will stress the indispensable \nneed to generate consent, build agree\u00acments and \nnegotiate on key issues, and we will conduct \nourselves in the belief that progress is \npossible, even though the road to achievement is \nlong and hard.\n205.\tIf we are to change the world, we must \nfirst understand it. We must face reality, with \nall its anguish and all its opportunities. Our \nera needs those who, as\nPericles said, have the clearest vision of what \nis before them, glory and danger alike, and \nnotwithstanding that, go out to meet it.\n206.\tReality is not an illusion or a sleight \nof hand, though many would have us believe \notherwise. The enormous, grinding machinery of \nSoviet propaganda daily seeks to distort reality, \nto bend truth for its own purposes. Our world is \noccupied by far too many Governments which seek \nto conceal truth from their own people. They wish \nto imprison reality by con\u00actrolling what can be \nread or spoken or heard. They would have us \nbelieve that black is white and up is down.\n207.\tMuch of present-day reality is \nunpleasant. To describe conditions as we see them \nas I do today and as President Reagan has over \nthe course of his presidency, is not to seek \nconfrontation\u2014far from it. Our purpose is to \navoid misunderstanding and to create the \nnecessary pre-conditions for change.\n208.\tSo, when we see aggression, we will call \nit aggression. When we see subversion, we will \ncall it subversion. When we see repression, we \nwill call it repression.\n209.\tThe events in Poland, for example, cannot \nbe ignored or explained away. The Polish people \nwant to be their own master. Years of systematic \ntyranny could not repress this desire; and nor \nwill martial law. But in Poland today truth must \nhide in comers.\n210.\tNor can we simply turn our heads and look \nthe other way as Soviet divisions brutalize an \nentire population in Afghanistan. The resistance \nof the Afghan people is a valiant saga of our \ntimes. We demean that valour if we do not \nrecognize its source.\n211.\tAnd Soviet surrogates intervene in many \ncoun\u00actries, creating a new era of colonialism at \nthe moment in history when peoples around the \nglobe had lifted that burden from their backs.\n212.\tNor will we shy away from speaking of \nother problems affecting the free and the \ndeveloping worlds. Much of the developing world \nis threatened by a crisis of confidence in \nfinancial institutions and the stultifying \neffects of State-controlled economies. The \nnaturally vibrant economies of many Western \nnations and trade between the world's major \ntrading partners are threatened by recession and \nrising protectionism. The great alliances that \nshore up world stability and growth\u2014our \nhemispheric partnership, NATO\u2014and the Western and \nJapanese industrial democracies are challenged by \nnew as well as chronic strains.\n213.\tFinally, the shadow of war still darkens \nthe future of us all. There is no ultimate safety \nin a nuclear balance of terror constantly \ncontested. There is no peace of mind at a time \nwhen increasing numbers of nations appear willing \nto launch their armies into battle for causes \nwhich seem local but have ramifica\u00actions for \nregional and even global harmony.\n214.\tThe list of troubles is long, the danger \nof despair great. But there is another side to \nthe present reality; it is a reality of hope. We \nare living in a fantastic time of opportunity.\n215.\tHistorians in the future will surely \nmarvel at the achievements of human beings in the \nlast half of this century. We have expanded the \nfrontiers of thought\u2014in science, in biology, in \nengineering, in painting and music and \nmathematics, in technology and architecture\u2014far \nbeyond the point anyone could have dared predict, \nmuch less hope for. We know much today about the \noceans and forests and the geological strata that \nlock in the story of our past. We have more \nknowledge about a baby, or the brain, than was \naccumulated in 10 millennia before our time. We \nare learning to produce food for all of us; we \nare no longer helpless before the threat of \ndisease; we explore our universe as a matter of \ncourse. We are confronting the nature of Nature \nherself. The oppor\u00actunities are grand. This, too, \nis a clear reality.\n216.\tThus realism shows us a world deeply \ntroubled, yet with reason for hope. There is one \nnecessary condition: the only way we can enhance \nand amplify the human potential is by preserving, \ndefending and extending those most precious of \nconditions\u2014freedom and peace.\n217.\tAmerica's yearning for peace does not \nlead us to be hesitant in developing our strength \nor in using it when necessary. Indeed, clarity \nabout the magnitude of the problems we face leads \ninevitably to a realistic appreciation of the \nimportance of American strength. The strength of \nthe free world imposes restraint, invites \naccommodation and reassures those who would share \nin the creative work that is the wonderful \nconsequence of liberty.\n218.\tStrength means military forces to ensure \nthat no other nation can threaten us, our \ninterests or our friends. But when I speak of \nstrength I do not mean military power alone. To \nAmericans, strength derives as well from a solid \neconomic base and social vitality at home and \nwith our partners. And, most funda\u00acmentally, the \ntrue wellspring of strength lies in America's \nmoral commitment.\n219.\tThe bulwark of America's strength is \nmilitary power for peace. The American people \nhave never accepted weakness, or hesitancy or \nabdication. We will not put our destiny into the \nhands of the ruthless. Americans today are \nemphatically united on the neces\u00acsity of a strong \ndefense. This year's defense budget will ensure \nthat the United States will help its friends and \nallies defend themselves\u2014to make sure that peace \nis seen clearly by all to be the only feasible \ncourse in world affairs.\n220.\tAlong with military readiness and \ncapability must come the willingness to employ it \nin the cause of peace, justice and security. \nToday in Beirut the United States \nMarines\u2014together with our allies, Italy and \nFrance\u2014are helping the Lebanese Government und \narmed forces ensure the safety of the peoples of \nthat tormented capital. I regret to report that I \nhave just learned that one American Marine died \nand several were injured today in a mine \nexplosion at the Beirut airport. Our marines \nrepresent an extension of American power not for \nwar but to secure the peace. They are there to \nspeed the moment when all foreign forces depart \nfrom Lebanon. There must be an early agreement on \na timetable for the full application of Lebanon's \nindependence, sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity. Lebanon deserves the world's help\u2014to \nsecure peace and to rebuild a thriving society.\n221.\tAmerica will continue to use its strength \nwith prudence, firmness and balance. We intend to \ncommand the respect of adversaries and to deserve \nthe confidence of allies and partners.\n222.\tThe engine of America's strength is a sound economy.\n223.\tIn a time of recession, industrialized \nand less developed nations alike are bedeviled by \nexcessive inflation, restricted markets, unused \ncapacity, stagnating trade, growing pressure for \nprotectionism and the most potent enemy of \nexpansion\u2014pervasive uncertainty.\n224.\tThe United States with its vast human and \nscientific resources can survive an era of \neconomic strife and decay. But our moral \ncommitment and our self-interest require us to \nuse our technological and productive abilities to \nbuild lasting prosperity at home and to \ncontribute to a sound economic situation abroad.\n225.\tPresident Reagan has instituted a bold \npro\u00acgram to get the American economy moving. Our \nrate of inflation is down markedly, and we will \nkeep it down. That will add stability to the \nvalue of the dollar and give greater confidence \nto international financial markets.\n226.\tThe recent drop in United States interest \nrates will stimulate new investments within and \nbeyond our shores. Conservation through market pricing \nof energy has reduced United States demand for \nworld energy supplies. We are putting the \nrecession behind us. A growing and open American \neconomy will provide new markets for goods and \nservices produced elsewhere, and new \nopportunities for foreign invest\u00acments. Just as \nwe have a stake in world-wide recovery, others \nwill prosper as our recovery develops.\n227.\tFor wider prosperity to take hold, we \nmust co\u00acoperatively attend to these international \nissues. The lure of protectionist trade policies \nmust be resisted everywhere\u2014here in the United \nStates and all over the world\u2014whether in the form \nof overt import restrictions and export subsidies \nor by more subtle domestic pro\u00acgrammes. These can \nonly distort world trade and impair growth \neverywhere. Let us determine to make the November \nministerial meeting of GATT a time to stem these \nprotectionist pressures and to reinvigorate \npositive efforts for a more open trading system.\n228.\tThe implications of the external debt of \nmany nations must be understood. Immediate debt \nproblems are manageable if we use good sense and \navoid destabilizing actions. But the magnitude of \nexternal debt will almost inevitably reduce \nresources available for future lending for \ndevelopment purposes. Economic adjustment is \nimperative. IMF can provide critical help and \nguidance in any country's efforts to smooth the \nadjustment process. The new borrowing \narrange\u00acment proposed by the United States can be \ncrucial to this effort.\t'\n229.\tAnd the necessity of reducing government \ninterference in the market must be recognized. Of \ncourse every nation has the right to organize \nsociety as its inhabitants wish, but economic \nfacts cannot be ignored. Those facts clearly \ndemonstrate that the world's command economies \nhave failed abysmally to meet the needs of their \npeoples. The newly pros\u00acperous industrialized \nnations are those with the most free and open \nmarkets.\n230.\tThe bedrock of our strength is our moral \nand spiritual character. The sources of true \nstrength lie deeper than economic or military \npower. They lie in the dedication of a free \npeople which knows its responsibility. America's \ninstitutions are those of freedom accessible to \nevery person and of govern\u00acment as the \naccountable servant of the people. Equal \nopportunity, due process of law, open trial by \njury, freedom of belief, speech and assembly, our \nBill of Rights, our guarantees of liberty and \nlimited govern\u00acment were hammered out in \ncenturies of ordeal. Because we care about these \nhuman values for ourselves so must we then be \nconcerned, and legiti\u00acmately so, with abuses of \nfreedom, justice and humanitarian principles \nbeyond our borders. This is why we will speak and \nact for prisoners of con\u00acscience, against \nterrorism and against the brutal silencing of the \nSoviet Helsinki Watch Committee. This is why we \nare anxious to participate in periodic reviews of \nthe human rights performance of ourselves as well \nas of others. We welcome scrutiny of our own \nsystem. We are not perfect and we know it, but we \nhave nothing to hide.\n231.\tOur belief in liberty guides our policies \nhere in' the United Nations as elsewhere. \nTherefore in this forum the United States will \ncontinue to insist upon fairness, balance and \ntruth. We take the debate on human rights \nseriously. We insist upon honesty in the use of \nlanguage; we will point out inconsistencies, \ndouble standards and lies. We will not compromise \nour commitment to truth.\n232.\tThe world has work to do for the \nrealists, the pragmatists and the free. With a \nclear understanding of the troubled circumstances \nof the hour and with a strengthened ability to \nact, we need as well the vision to see beyond the \nimmediate present.\n233.\tAll of us here represent nations which \nmust understand and accept the imperative of fair \nengage\u00acment on the issues before us and, beyond \nthat, of common effort towards shared goals. \nWhether we are seeking to bring peace to regional \nconflict or a reso\u00aclution of commercial \ndifferences, the time of imposed solutions has \npassed. Conquest, pressure, acqui\u00acescence under \nduress was common in decades not long past\u2014but \nnot today. Not everybody who wants his concern \naddressed will find us automatically receptive. \nBut when negotiations are in order America is \nprepared to go to work on the global agenda and \nto do so in a way that all may emerge better off \nand more secure than before.\n234.\tWe manage our problems more intelligently \nand with greater mutual understanding when we can \nbring ourselves to recognize these problems as \nexpressions of mankind's basic dilemma. We are \nseldom confronted with simple issues of right and \nwrong, between good and evil. Only those who do \nnot bear the direct burden of responsibility for \ndecision and action can indulge themselves in the \ndenial of that reality. The task of statesmanship \nis to mediate between two\u2014or several\u2014 causes, \neach of which often has a legitimate claim.\n235.\tIt is on this foundation that the United \nStates stands ready to try to solve the problems \nof our time \u2014to overcome chaos, deprivation and \nthe heightened dangers of an era in which ideas \nand cultures too often tend to clash and \ntechnologies threaten to out\u00acpace our \ninstitutions of control.\n236.\tWe are engaged in negotiations and \nefforts to find answers to issues affecting every \npart of the globe and every aspect of our lives \nupon it. Let me take up just two of these with \nyou.\n237.\tThe agony of the Middle East now exceeds \nthe ability of news bulletins or speeches to \nexpress: it is a searing wound on our \nconsciousness. The region is in constant ferment. \nUnrest flares into violence, terror, insurrection \nand civil strife. War follows war. It is clear to \neveryone in this Hall that international peace, \nsecurity and co-operative progress cannot be \ntruly achieved until this terrible regional \nconflict is settled.\n238.\tAM of us have witnessed in the past \nseveral months a graphic reminder of the need for \npractical peace negotiations in the Middle East. \nOf the nations in the world which need and \ndeserve peace, Israel surely holds a pre-eminent \nplace. Of the peoples of the world who need and \ndeserve a place with which they can truly \nidentify, the Palestinian claim is undeniable.\n239.\tBut Israel can have permanent peace only \nin a context in which the Palestinian people also \nrealize their legitimate rights. Similarly, the \nPalestinian people will be able to achieve their \nlegitimate rights only in a context which gives \nto Israel what it so clearly has a right to \ndemand: to exist, and to exist in peace and \nsecurity.\n240.\tThis most complex of international \nconflicts cannot be resolved by force: neither \nthe might of armies nor the violence of \nterrorists can succeed in imposing the will of \nthe strong upon the weak. Nor can it be settled \nsimply by the rhetoric of even the most carefully \nworded document. It can be resolved only through \nthe give and take of direct negotiations, leading \nto the establishment of practical arrangements on \nthe ground. In other words, it can be resolved \nonly through hard work. For those who believe \nthat there is no contradiction between permanent \npeace for Israel and the legitimate rights of the \nPalestinian people\u2014and fbr those who believe that \nboth are essential for peace and that neither can \nbe achieved without the other\u2014the task can truly \nbe a labour of love.\n241.\tOn 1 September President Reagan \nchallenged the parties to the Arab-Israeli \nconflict to make a fresh start on the road to \npeace in the Middle East. The Camp David \nagreements, resting squarely on Security Council \nresolution 242 (1967), with its formula of peace \nfor territory, remain available to those who \nwould accept the challenge to make this journey \nwith us. The road will not be easy, but in his \nstatement President Reagan made a number of \nproposals which, for those who are willing to \njoin the effort, make the journey safer and \neasier.\n242.\tI call on all concerned to accept \nPresident Reagan's challenge and hasten the \nrealization of true peace in the Middle East,\n243.\tIn addition to the imperative need to \nresolve regional problems, there is an equally \nsignificant global imperative: to halt, and \nreverse, the global arms build\u00acup. As an \nAmerican, I am aware that arms control and \ndisarmament are a special responsibility of the \nworld's most powerful nations, the United States \nand the Soviet Union. And as an American, I can \nreport that we are fulfilling our responsibility \nto seek to limit and reduce conventional and \nnuclear arms to the lowest possible levels.\n244.\tWith this goal in mind, President Reagan \nhas initiated a comprehensive program for \nnegotiated arms reductions. In Central Europe, \nthe most heavily armed region on this planet, the \nWestern allies are seeking substantial reductions \nin troops of NATO and the Warsaw Pact to equal \nlevels. To achieve this goal, we have recently \nintroduced a new proposal designed to revitalize \nthe Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces, \nArmaments and Associated Measures in Central \nEurope.\n245.\tIn the area of strategic arms, the United \nStates has also taken the initiative by calling \nfor a one-third reduction in the number of \nnuclear warheads that American and Soviet \nballistic missiles can deliver. And in the talks \nin Geneva on intermediate-range nuclear forces, \nthe United States has gone even further, by \nasking the Soviet Union to agree to a bold \nproposal for eliminating an entire category of \nweapons from the arsenals of the two sides.\n246.\tBut important as these negotiations are, \nthe problems of arms controls cannot be left to \nthe two super-Powers. The threat of nuclear \nproliferation extends to every region in the \nworld and demands the attention and energy of \nevery Government. This is not solely, or even \nprimarily, a concern of the super\u00ac powers. The \nnon-nuclear countries will not be safer if \nnuclear intimidation is added to already deadly \nregional conflicts. The developing nations will \nnot be more prosperous if scarce resources and \nscientific talent are diverted to nuclear weapons \nand delivery systems.\n247.\tUnfortunately, as the task becomes more \nim\u00acportant it also becomes more difficult. \nGreater quantities of dangerous materials are \nproduced and new suppliers emerge who lack a \nclear commitment to non-proliferation. But the \ntechnology that helped to create the problems can \nsupply answers as well. Vigorous action to \nstrengthen the barriers to aggres\u00acsion and to \nresolve disputes peacefully can remove the \ninsecurities that are the root of the problem. \nThe United States, for its part, will work to \ntighten export controls; to promote broader \nacceptance of safeguards; to urge meaningful \nactions when agreements are violated; and to \nstrengthen IAEA. As our action last week in \nVienna should make clear, we will not accept \nattempts to politicize\u2014and therefore emasculate\u2014 \nsuch vital institutions.\n248.\tPerhaps the most common phrase spoken by \nthe American people in our more than two \ncenturies of national life has been you can't \nstop progress . Our people have always been \nimbued with the conviction that the future of a \nfree people would be good. America continues to \noffer that vision to the world. With that vision, \nand with the freedom to act creatively, there is \nnothing that people of good will need fear.\n249.\tI am not here to assert, however, that \nthe way is easy, or quick, or that the future is \nbound to be bright. There is a poem by Carl \nSandburg in which a traveler asks the Sphinx to \nspeak and reveal the distilled wisdom of all the \nages. The Sphinx does speak. Its words are: \nDon't expect too much . That is good counsel for \nail of us here. It does not mean that great \naccomplishments are beyond our reach. We can help \nshape more constructive international rela\u00actions \nand give our children a better chance at life. It \ndoes mean, however, that risk, pain, expense, and \nabove all endurance are needed to bring these \nachieve\u00acments into our grasp.\n250.\tWe must recognize the complex and vexing \ncharacter of this world. We should not indulge \nour\u00acselves in fantasies of perfection of \nunfulfillable plans, or solutions gained by \npressure. It is the responsibility of leaders not \nto feed the growing appetite for easy promises \nand grand assurances. The plain truth is this: we \nface the prospect of all too few decisive or \ndramatic breakthroughs; we face the necessity of \ndedicatingour energies and creativity to a \nprotracted struggle towards eventual success.\n251.\tThat is the approach of my country, \nbecause we see not only the necessity but the \npossibility, of making important progress on a \nbroad front. For example: despite deep-seated \ndifferences between us and the Soviet Union, both \nsides are now at work in a serious, businesslike \neffort at arms control; Presi\u00acdent Reagan has \nissued an important call for an inter\u00acnational \nconference on military expenditure. The \nachievement of a common system for accounting and \nreporting is the prerequisite for subsequent \nagreement to limits or curtail defense budgets. \nThe Caribbean Basin Initiative establishes the \ncrucial bond between economic development and \neconomic freedom. It can be a model for fair and \nproductive co-operation between economies vastly \ndifferent in size and character; and the \ndiplomatic way is open to build stability and \nprogress in southern Africa through inde\u00acpendence \nfor Namibia under internationally accept-able \nterms.\n252.\tRealism and a readiness to work long and \nhard for fair and freely agreed solutions\u2014that is \nour recipe for optimism. That is the message and \nthe offer which my Government brings to the \nAssembly today.\n253.\tI began my remarks here today with an \ninformal personal word. May I end in the same \nspirit? We must be determined and confident. We \nmust be prepared for trouble, but always \noptimistic. In that way the vast bounties \nproduced by the human mind and imagination can be \nshared by all the races and nations we represent \nhere in this Hall.\n254.\tA predecessor of mine as Secretary of \nState, whose portrait hangs in my office, \nconveyed the essence of America's approach to the \nworld's dangers and dilemmas. He said we would \nact with  a stout heart and a clear conscience \nand never despair . That is what John Quincy \nAdams said nearly a century and a half ago. I \ngive the Assembly my personal pledge today that \nwe will continue in that spirit, with that \ndetermination, and with that confidence in the \nfuture.\n"

        "file_text": "On 8 October 1967, exactly 13 years ago, revolutionaries and freedom \nfighters all over the world learned with both grief and indignation \nthat Commander Ernesto Che Guevara, the heroic guerrilla, had been \nmurdered in Bolivia. Today, from this rostrum, where he spoke as a \nrepresentative of the Cuban revolution, we should pay him the only \ntribute he would accept, that of following faithfully his example and \nstruggling to achieve true independence for our peoples and to \nrepulse any attempt to rob us of the rights that we have already won. \nMay he continue fighting wherever the children of our oppressed \npeoples are struggling for freedom and keep working wherever creative \nefforts are paving the way to development.\nThe Arab peoples have waged a long struggle to win recognition of \ntheir right to govern in their own land. As early as 1881 Jose Martel \nsaid The brilliant Arabs should at all costs return to Arabia, as \nthough avenging their centuries old oriental drift. He was then \nreferring to the rebellions against European colonial domination and \nmovingly praising the spirit that the Arab peoples brought to their \nfight. Few struggles, however, have attained such heroic heights and \nmobilized all the people young and old, women and children as the one \nthat we have just witnessed in the long days of the Palestinian \npeople's struggle against the genocidal Zionist imperialist invasion \nof Lebanon.\nAt the meeting of the Co coordinating Bureau of the Non Aligned held \nin Nicosia, during the unforgettable moments of the defense of \nBeirut, the non  aligned movement, that powerful, independent force \ngrouping nearly 100 States, declared that it was necessary to \nrecognize the Palestinian people's right to establish their own State \nand return to their homeland. The Twelfth Arab Summit Conference \nexpressed itself in much the same terms, and it also insisted on the \nnecessity of recognizing the PLO as the sole legitimate \nrepresentative of the Palestinian people.\nThe non aligned countries call for the immediate holding of an \ninternational conference on Palestine, with the participation of the \nPLO and all States interested in finding a real, permanent solution \nto the situation in the Middle East, where the nub, the first step, \nmust be recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian \npeople.\n\nBy entering west Beirut, in a gesture of utter disregard for world \npublic opinion and for Israel's pledges to respect the peace \nagreements, Israeli troops created the conditions for Haddad's \nmurderous gangs to take cowardly advantage of the honorable \nwithdrawal from Beirut of the heroic Palestinian leaders and fighters \na withdrawal designed precisely for the purpose of avoiding the \nindiscriminate slaughter of civilians and fall like bloodthirsty \nsavages on the defenseless Palestinian camps. In doing so they relied \non the collaboration of Israel, which had responsibility and which \nset the scene for them and facilitated the carrying out of the \nslaughter. Hitler would have had much to learn from the madness of \nMessrs. Begin and Sharon.\nHO. The Zionist genocide in Beirut is the direct result of the United \nStates Government's policy of force, violence and oppression. Nobody \nhas failed to notice the direct connection and manifest complicity \nbetween the crimes committed in Lebanon and the continual United \nStates vetoes in the Security Council, which have convinced the \ncriminal Tel Aviv authorities that they are immune to any political \nor moral limitations that the United Nations should have placed upon \nthem a long time ago.\nIn his denunciation of this situation to the United Nations contained \nin a letter addressed to the Secretary General, Fidel Castro, \nPresident of the Council of State of the Republic of Cuba and \nChairman of the non aligned movement, asked:\nHow long can mankind and all decent and sensible Governments endure \nthis brutal and merciless genocide? What new horrors will be \nnecessary before the aggressors are stopped and their bloody hands \nstayed? Is not this proof that Israel's rulers are preparing to \ncontinue, in defiance of all, to eliminate the Palestinian people, \nannihilate the patriotic Lebanese resistance and extend their \naggression to other Arab States?\nIn the name of the non aligned movement, whose indignation I voice; \nin the name of the Cuban people, whose feelings of grief and staunch \nsolidarity I represent, I join in the universal demand that the \nmurderers and those who set the tragic scene for them and facilitated \nthis abominable action be punished. It is indispensable that there be \nat least a political and moral exemplary sanction of all those guilty \nof the Beirut crime. For crimes against humanity such as this, for a \nmurderous and racist philosophy such as that which motivated these \ndeeds, the criminals at Nuremberg were seated in the dock and sent to \nthe gallows.\nThe time has come for the United Nations to act, and only exemplary, \nprompt and energetic punishment of those who committed the genocide \nand their accomplices will save the honor and respectability of our \ninstitution before the coming generations and the inexorable judgment \nof history.\nThe Palestinian leaders and fighters have withdrawn honorably from \nBeirut, but only to continue the fight for the Palestinian people's \ninalienable rights until victory is won.\nMr. President, we should like to say how pleased we are that you, Mr. \nHollai, an outstanding son of the heroic Hungarian people, are \npresiding over this thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. \nWe should also like to express our appreciation for the exemplary \nwork done by the former President of the General Assembly, our friend \nIsmat Kittani. We greet the Secretary General, the first Latin \nAmerican to occupy such a high post of responsibility, Mr. Javier \nPerez de Cuellar, for his tenacious efforts aimed at strengthening \nand reinforcing the Organization. We are living in a world \ncharacterized by a sharpening of tension in international relations, \ndue to the acts of provocation and the policies of arms buildup and \nnuclear blackmail advocated by United States imperialism. The danger \nof a nuclear war that would wipe out all the work of mankind grows \nconstantly and hangs like an ominous cloud over man's right to live \nin peace.\nAll attempts to hide from the peoples the real consequences of a \nnuclear conflict and make them believe that such a conflict could be \nlimited to a specific geographic area or instil in them the idea that \nit is feasible to start such a war with the possibility that some \nPower may emerge victorious, is exceedingly dangerous and \nincompatible with the vital interests of all mankind. Therefore, it \nis necessary to continue mobilizing public awareness of the dangers \nposed by nuclear war and weapons of mass destruction.\nThe arms race has continued its upward spiral, and imperialism keeps \non trying to impose policies from positions of strength. In spite of \nthe fact that negotiations have started on strategic weapons, on \nnuclear weapons in Europe and on the reduction of weapons and \nmilitary personnel in Central Europe, the United States shows no \nwillingness to negotiate and tries to hide its militaristic plans \nfrom the world public and impose them upon its Western European \nallies.\nThe second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament, \nheld midway through this year, was an example of the lack of \npolitical will of a group of States to negotiate seriously and \nconstructively to find solutions for the problems of disarmament.\nThe unbridled arms race that some countries are practicing a race \nwhich includes attempts to install 572 medium range missiles in \nEurope, the production of neutron bombs and the establishment of \ninterventionist rapid deployment force constitutes a serious threat \nto international peace and security and to mankind's very survival.\nThe arms buildup policy is closely linked to the imperialists' plans \nto impose their dictates in various parts of the world. Thus, on the \none hand, imperialism is obstructing the negotiations on disarmament \nand, on the other, is encouraging and providing political and \nmilitary support for the reactionary forces all over the world.\nThus, besides the concerted aggression of Israel and the United \nStates against Lebanon, other trouble spots are present in the \nexplosive Middle East.\nUnfortunately, the war between the peoples of the Islamic Republic of \nIran and Iraq still continues. As chairman of the non aligned \nmovement, Cuba has made tremendous efforts, together with other \ncountries, to help find a peaceful, just and honorable solution to \nthe conflict. We take this opportunity of addressing this important \nforum to reiterate our hopes and renew our offer of services to help \nbring the war to an end for the benefit of both peoples, of other \npeoples in the region and to prevent the spread and worsening of the \nconflict.\nThis is also a good occasion for expressing a most energetic protest \nagainst the direct and indirect aggressions which United States \nimperialism has perpetrated against the People's Democratic Republic \nof Yemen, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and other \npeoples in the north of Africa engaged in peacefully building their \ndestinies.\nConcerning Namibia, the United States is ignoring Security Council \nresolution 435 (1978) as well as General Assembly resolution 36/172 \nB, proclaiming 1982 the International Year of Mobilization for \nSanctions against South Africa, and is not using the means at its \ndisposal to pressure South Africa into accepting a negotiated and law \nabiding solution based on the relevant resolutions of the Security \nCouncil and the General Assembly. In fact, Washington is playing the \ngame of Pretoria which seeks to rob the Namibian people of their \nvictory and true independence.\nThe racist regime of South Africa and its United States allies are \ninsisting on linking Namibia's independence to the presence of the \nCuban forces in Angola as an essential prerequisite for arriving at a \nnegotiated solution. But they will not be able to hide the truth of \nthe fact that Angola's independence, territorial integrity and \nsovereignty have made and are making an important contribution to \nNamibia's independence. The Cuban internationalist fighters went to \nAngola to help defend Angola's independence and prevent the spread of \nthe apartheid regime beyond the borders of Namibia; for no other \nreason.\nIf the Yankee imperialists and partners of the Apartheid regime have \nbeen forced to talk about the independence of Namibia, it has been \nbecause of the armed struggle of the heroic sons of the people of \nNamibia, because of the actions headed by SWAPO and because they have \nfailed in their attempts to prevent the independence of Angola.\nIn 1976, the Governments of Angola and Cuba decided to begin \nwithdrawing the Cuban military forces that were in Angola and the \nnumber of Cuban personnel was reduced by more than one third. New \nthreats against Angola interrupted this process and even made \nnecessary the return of new forces to replace those which had already \nleft the noble Angolan soil. Other aggressions; by South Africa \nfrustrated similar attempts another occasions. Now, when the racist \ntroops of the Pretoria regime have been occupying a part of the \nterritory of southern Angola for more than a year and are threatening \nto invade other provinces, the United States Government seeks to \npresent a demand that the Cuban forces should  withdrawn from Angola \nas a condition, a prerequisite, for the withdrawal of South   African \ntroops from Namibia, as something that would contribute to Namibia's \nindependence.\n\nThat is why the front line States, at their recent meeting in Lusaka, \nresolved categorically to reject any attempt to tie the Cuban \npresence in Angola to the process of decolonization in Namibia, \nreaffirming in their final declaration that that matter concerned \nonly the Governments of Angola and Cuba.\nCuba and Angola stated in February this year that Cuban military co \noperation with Angola constituted an absolutely sovereign and \nlegitimate act by the two countries and as a result was completely \nunrelated to the problem of Namibia. They also pointed out that if \nthe selfless struggle waged by SWAPO, the sole legitimate \nrepresentative of the Namibian people, and the demands of the \ninternational community succeeded in bringing about a real solution \nto the problem of Namibia, based on strict compliance with Security \nCouncil resolution 435 (1978), and it resulted in truly independent \nrule and to the total withdrawal of the South African occupation \ntroops to the other side of the Orange River, which would \nconsiderably reduce the danger of aggression against Angola, then the \nAngolan and Cuban Governments would consider the renewal of the \nimplementation of the programme for the gradual withdrawal of the \nCuban force within a period of time determined by the two Governments.\nWe can consequently reaffirm here, in the General Assembly that when \nthe Governments of Angola and Cuba so determine, the withdrawal of \nthe Cuban forces stationed on Angolan territory will be effected by \nvirtue of the sovereign decision of the Government of the People's \nRepublic of Angola once all or any possibility of an attack by an \narmed invading force has disappeared. In this regard, the Government \nof Cuba reiterates that it will unhesitatingly respect any decision \nthat the sovereign Government of Angola makes concerning the \nwithdrawal of those forces.\nIn view of the evident closing of options for negotiation, SWAPO, the \nsole and legitimate representative of the Namibian people, has the \nright to continue the armed struggle to achieve Namibia's \nindependence, with full respect for its territorial integrity, \nincluding Walvis Bay, and without the presence of South African \ntroops on its soil.\nThe struggle of the African peoples will inexorably bring to an end \nthe vestiges of colonialism and racism on that continent. The \nPretoria regime knows that historically it is doomed. The growing \nrebelliousness of the black South African masses, led by the African \nNational Congress, shows that the exploited majority is advancing \ninexorably towards the liquidation of the power of the exploiting \nwhite minority. We endorse the decisions to support the ANC adopted \nby the heads of State at the frontline States at their Maputo meeting \nin March this year.\n\nIn Latin America, after nearly a century of imperialist domination, \nthe situation could not be more hopeless for tens of millions of \nhuman beings subjected to the most dreadful poverty. Compulsory \nwitnesses of the profits of the local oligarchies and of the \ntransnational corporations, the peoples of Latin America will be \ncarrying on their shoulders a foreign debt which, by the end of this \nyear, will reach the astronomical figure of $300 billion, without \ncounting the $30 billion they will have to pay annually in interest. \nThe indices that measure the living standards of the popular sectors \nin the vast majority of the countries in our region are falling \nalarmingly without any restraint. It is precisely this state of \npermanent inequality that is the main cause of the social revolt that \nis shaking Central America today.\nBlinded by stupidity and lack of realism, Mr. Reagan's Administration \nhas rejected dialogue and a negotiated political solution in this \nexplosive area and is preparing the conditions for an armed \nintervention that would prevent a revolutionary triumph in El \nSalvador and drown the Nicaraguan revolution in blood. Such is the \nspirit of the Symons Amendment, passed recently by the United States \nSenate, preparing public opinion for the United States President's \nuse of all means, including the use of troops, to oppose an alleged \nCuban threat in Latin America.\nThe United States Government is engaged in using the armed forces of \nHonduras as a spearhead against Nicaragua and the Salvadorian \npatriots, with the aim of legalizing a probable direct intervention \nby United States forces. The entry of Honduran army personnel into El \nSalvador and of former Somoza supporters into Nicaragua from camps in \nHonduras unquestionably means dangerous and definitive steps towards \nthe spreading of armed conflict throughout the Central American region\nThus far the Reagan Administration has not contributed to the moves \ndirected to apolitical solution to the tensions in the region. A few \ndays ago, President Lopez Portillo of Mexico and President Herrera \nCampinas of Venezuela made new proposals which Cuba hopes will \nproduce positive results.\nIf the United States intervenes militarily in El Salvador or \nNicaragua, it would lead to the appearance of a new Viet Nam in \nCentral America, because the peoples of Farabundo Marti and Augusto \nCesar Sandino will defend their national independence and their right \nto be Ate until they defeat their enemies.\nPresident Fidel Castro pointed out in the letter he sent to Jose \nLopez Portillo, President of Mexico, in February this year that:\nIf the Government of the United States the source of all the problems \nwhich affect Latin America and the Caribbean today pledges not to \nattack its neighbors, if it ceases its constant threats, if it stops \nusing its weapons and finances to back genocidal regimes and if it \nputs an end to its subversive activities, all these being acts which \nhave absolutely no legitimacy, Cuba is willing to co operate in the \nnoble efforts you outlined in Managua to bring about the atmosphere \nof peace, mutual respect and necessary change in the region, to which \nwe also aspire.\nCuba today reiterates its full support for Argentine sovereignty over \nthe Malvinas Islands. Hard, concrete, stubborn facts have \nconvincingly shown who is who in our continent. When forced to show \nits true colors the United States, the self appointed arch  defender \nof Latin America and dedicated architect of the Rio Treaty and of the \nmyth of hemispheric unity against dark extra continental forces, \ndropped its so called pan American vocation and shamelessly joined \nforces with England to fall, as Marti would say, with so much greater \nforce on our Latin American lands. At the moment of truth, the \ninstitutions built on hypocrisy went down in the Atlantic without the \ndignity of the crew members of the General.\nNow, a new awakening of Latin American awareness is the order of the \nday; a deepening of anti imperialist feeling is spreading through our \ncontinent; the peoples are learning daily from history in the making, \nfrom the blows they receive and from the experience they acquire; and \nno propaganda, however sophisticated or subtle, can change or twist \nthe historical positions taken on the facts relating to the Malvinas.\nCuba also reiterates its unswerving support for the legitimate \nstruggle that the fraternal people of Puerto Rico are waging to \nattain full independence and sovereignty. Nothing can keep the \npeoples from travelling the destined path of their history; like it \nor not, one day the free Latin American people of Puerto Rico will \nthemselves sing the beloved anthem of their homeland and they \nthemselves will raise their flag with the lone star, free of \nhypocritical trusteeships and master of their destiny. There will \nremain in our continent tyrannies that every day spill blood on the \nroad that will lead these peoples to the freedom to which they are \nand for which they are waging an exemplary fight.\nWe reiterate our firm solidarity with heroic Grenada, which, with \nunparalleled efforts, is laying the foundations for a new exemplary \nresistance against the imperialists' attempts to destabilize its \neconomy, subvert domestic interest and frustrate the revolutionary \nprocess rooted in that Caribbean island.\nCuba supports the aspirations and desires of the Panamanian \nGovernment and people in their struggle for implementation of the \nCanal agreements.\nWe support the right of Bolivia in its historical and just claim to \nrecover its outlet to the sea.\nCuba's position is well known on the subject of the negotiated \nsettlement of disputes. We hope that, in the spirit of the necessary \nstrengthening of the relations among the peoples of our continent, \nthe differences over the border limits between Guyana and Venezuela \nwill be settled peacefully, by means of mutually accepted formulas.\nCuba supports the independence, territorial integrity and non \nalignment of Belize.\nWe must also struggle to guarantee peace and stability in South East \nAsia. The Sixth Conference of Indo Chinese Foreign Ministers was held \nin July this year; it announced that a summit meeting of those three \ncountries would be held in December and that the withdrawal of a \nnumber of Vietnamese troops from the territory of the People's \nRepublic of Kampuchea had been initiated in late July. This shows the \nthree countries' good will in trying to ease the tension in the \nregion through political means. A climate of understanding, mutual \nrespect and security must prevail in South East Asia, and the efforts \nto begin a constructive dialogue between the parties in conflict \nshould continue.\nMy delegation reiterates its support for the legitimate aspiration of \nthe Democratic People's Republic of Korea to bring about the peaceful \nreunification of its homeland for which it is absolutely necessary \nthat interference in its internal affairs should cease and that the \nUnited States forces of intervention withdraw from the southern part \nof the Korean peninsula.\nWe support the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic in its legitimate \nrights to live in peace and take its rightful place among independent \nStates. We support the aspirations of the Comoros to regain their \nsovereignty over Mayotte, the restitution of Madagascar's rights over \nthe Malagasy Islands of Gloheuses, Juande Nova, Europa and Bassas da \nIndia, and the just claim of Mauritius to recover Diego Garcia island.\nThe United States continues to increase its presence in the Indian \nOcean and to enlarge its military installations in the area, as is \nthe case with the Diego Garcia base, and to block the holding of a \nconference for making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. This policy \nis detrimental to security in the region and exacerbates tensions by \nconstituting a threat to the Governments that are striving to lend \ntheir national interests.\nWe support the Cypriot people's sustained efforts to preserve its \nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity in a united and \nnon aligned republic.\nThe efforts and actions that various agencies and the international \ncommunity are carrying out with regard to the peoples' legitimate \ndemand for a stable, lasting peace cannot be consolidated if we do \nnot devote ourselves seriously and frankly to the constitution and \npractice of a new system of international relations whose main aspect \nis the implementation of a fair and equitable new international \neconomic order that does away with the abysmal differences between \nthe poor and the rich countries. This is not a question of alms or \nprivileges; we demand the help of the developed countries so that, by \ncombining our efforts, we may eliminate the differences that separate \nus.\n133. The insistence on dealing from positions of strength, from \npositions of military superiority, is leading the present Republican \nAdministration in the United States to plan increases in its military \nbudget for l983 that come to the astronomical sum of more than $260 \nbillion. By 1986 military spending will exceed $372 billion, or 35.2 \nper cent of the total United States budget. This harmful trend of the \nUnited States Government towards increasing its military spending at \nan explosive rate will for other States to increase their budgets for \nthe defense of their territories.\n154. The world is sitting on a powder keg, without any guarantees of \nsecurity, and the danger increases when the means for exploding it \nare in irresponsible hands, as unscrupulous as those that led the \nworld of the conflagration of the 1940s. Therefore the struggle for \npeace is no mere slogan of enlightened forums or Sunday clubs; it is \na pressing necessity for the survival of all mankind. We mean by that \na peace that is equal for all, in whatever part of the globe they may \nbe. We are constantly striving for those aims, and guided by those \ncriteria. Cuba has made the struggle for peace a fundamental part of \nits Constitution, and the struggle to preserve peace, to contribute \nto easing the hotbeds of tension and to prevent the worsening of the \ninternational situation is one of the main elements of our \ninternational action.\nThe preservation of peace and the struggle for development are \ncomponent elements of a single ideal, for what peace can there be without \ndevelopment? What peace can there be when the people are hungry and \nhave no pillow to lessen the weariness of their despair? What peace \ncan there be when their children are hungry, and there is no light in \ntheir eyes and no future before them?\nThe countries belonging to the non aligned movement and all the other \nunderdeveloped countries have constantly urged that the preservation \nof peace and the pursuit of development should be aims to be sought \nsimultaneously. We recall that the 1979 Ministerial Meeting of the \nGroup of 77 in Arusha, in the United Republic of Tanzania, stated its \nconviction that real peace was not merely the absence of war but \nshould also establish the conditions for political freedom, sustained \nand accelerated development for the developing countries and the \npromotion of the methodical development of the world.\nToday the situation is much more serious than it was then. \nImperialism's aggressive, expansionist and exploitative posture has \nworsened. The recent events in Lebanon, the conflict in the South \nAtlantic and continual threats of aggression and armed intervention \nin the Caribbean have been dangerously added to the use of economic \npressures as a weapon of political coercion against the \nunderdeveloped countries that aspire to an independent, honorable \nlife and seek the path of development. At the same time, we note with \nalarm that never before has the situation of the third world \ncountries been so desperate as it is today, when inflation, monetary \ninstability, blatant protectionism on the part of the industrialized \ncountries, unparalleled indebtedness and the systematic lowering of \nthe prices the third world countries get for their primary \ncommodities are not only endangering their real prospects for \nadvancing towards development within a more or less acceptable time \nspan but posing an immediate threat to the lives of millions of \npeople and the very future of dozens of nations.\nThe United States is maintaining an attitude of clear opposition to \nthe launching of the global negotiations, which are an important \ninstrument for enabling the international community to face in an \nappropriate manner the serious problems of the world economy.\nCuba supports the efforts exerted by the Group of 77 to obtain the \nlaunching of global negotiations, which would spur the development of \nthe backward countries, but would also be an effective means of \nenabling the developing economies to emerge from the constant \nrecession in which they have been for several years.\nEveryone knows that Cuba has always held the firm opinion that there \ncan be no development without peace and no peace without development. \nFidel Castro has reiterated that on several occasions, including here \nin this Hall during the thirty fourth session of the General \nAssembly. Therefore, we call on the General Assembly to devote itself \nto sustained hard work that will contribute to an ever greater extent \nto making the United Nations a real participant in the process of \nbuilding the future of the peoples, rather than a mere spectator, \nwatching from the sidelines. Cuba has presided over the non aligned \nmovement during three years filled with complexities, tension and \nconflicts in international relations. In the midst of the stubborn \nstruggle waged by imperialism and international reaction to paralyze \nthe action of the international agencies and to prevent the third \nworld countries from concerting their plans and positions, the non \naligned movement has emerged from those trials as an even more \nunited, more independent and stronger force.\nEver since the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of \nNon Aligned Countries, held at Havana in 1979, our movement has been \nengaged in active efforts in the most diverse spheres, developing \nvarious initiatives of special significance; noteworthy among them \nare its efforts to mediate in disputes between member countries. \nDuring those three years, the movement consolidated a broad programme \nof co operation, extending the scope of co operation and exchanges of \nviews among our countries.\nMany meetings were held in the movement's various branches and \nspheres of action. Noteworthy among its activities were the \nextraordinary meetings of its Coordinating Bureau at the ministerial \nlevel on Namibia, held in Algiers; on Palestine, held in Kuwait; and \non the situation in Lebanon, held recently in Cyprus; as well as the \nConference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non Aligned Countries, \nheld at New Delhi in February 1981; the Ministerial Meeting of the \nCoordinating Bureau held this year in Havana; and the meetings of \nMinisters and Heads of Delegation of the non aligned countries \nattending the sessions of the General Assembly, for the purpose of \ncoordinating actions and setting priorities among those countries.\nIn spite of the obvious efforts to divide the movement and to boycott \nthe work of its organs especially its Coordinating Bureau and in \nspite of the direct pressure brought to bear on many of its members, \nthe non aligned movement has given proof of its cohesion, maturity \nand strength. The tireless struggle for peace, disarmament, an end to \nthe arms race, a new international economic order, respect for the \nprinciple of non interference in the internal affairs of other \nStates, renunciation of the use of force in international relations \nand solidarity with national liberation movements have been important \nbattles fought daily by the non aligned movement.\nHistory, as always, has made sure that deceit has been unveiled. \nThose who declared that in Cuba in 1979 the movement would be split \nare brought face to face with today's reality: that our movement has \nincreased its dynamism, preserved its original principles and its \nunity, and extended its action, its strength and its influence in the \ninternational arena.\nWithin the framework offered by the present session of the General \nAssembly we advanced our preparations for the Seventh Conference of \nHeads of State or Government of Non Aligned Countries, which will be \nheld at New Delhi in March of next year. Fidel Castro, Chairman of \nthe movement, has had to make special efforts to overcome the \nobstacles that arose concerning the holding of that conference, \nefforts that brought out the movement's capacities, cohesion and \nunity, and the outstanding qualities and wisdom of the heads of State \nor Government of our member countries.\nThe present international situation presents enormous risks for man's \nsurvival. We must tackle that situation with determination and \nfirmness: the same determination and firmness with which the heroic \nPalestinians defended Beirut, the same determination and firmness \nwith which the Vietnamese people defeated imperialist aggression and \nthe same determination and firmness with which the courageous \nSahraoui fighters are waging their struggle.\nThe imperialists must abandon their policy of confrontation, threats \nand aggression. They must know that they will not succeed in \nintimidating the peoples, which have learned now that firmness is the \nposition of principle to hold in the face of the imperialists.\nOn 26 July 1982, President Fidel Castro stated that\nWe are not in favor of wars. We are in favor of peace, in favor of \nsolutions. We are well aware of the consequences a war would have for \nthe world. And the dangers really exist. We are in favor of \nsolutions, and we have said this repeatedly concerning the various \nhotbeds of tension: solutions for the war between Iran and Iraq; \nsolutions in the Middle East; solutions in Central America, solutions \nin Angola and in South Africa. Therefore, our attitude is not that of \npromoting conflicts. However, we are not going to step back even half \nan inch before the imperialist threats and aggressions not even half \nan inch.\n"

My delegation \ntrusts that the President will guide this session \nwith fairness and wisdom. I have noted with great \ninterest the contents of his thoughtful statement \nat the opening of this session, and especially \nhis cogent reference to:  the inclusion in the \nagenda of items on so-called crisis situations \nthat produced nothing but sterile debate and \ndiverted attention from the real crises \nthreatening the world with an escalation of the \nconflict .\n58.\tThe annual general debates at the General \nAssembly provide an occasion for surveying the \nstate of the world, the working of the \ninternational system during the preceding year \nand for a public airing of the hopes and \nconcerns, the expectations and anxieties of our \nnations. Such a survey will show that the \nprospects for a better life and for peace for \nthe peoples of the world have hardly been \nadvanced this past year, while new difficulties \nhave been added to the old unresolved problems.\n59.\tMajor international problems of an \neconomic, social and military nature have also \ngrown at a rapid rate, and the international \nsystem has not been able to cope with them. Many \nessential problems have not reached the United \nNations agenda at all. With regard to others with \nwhich the United Nations did engage itself, its \ncontribution has been far from encouraging. Thus, \nuniversal disappointment has been caused this \nyear by the failure of the special session on \ndisarmament and the stalemate in the North-South \ndialogue.\n60.\tThe world scene is constantly threatened \nby simmering conflicts, some of which remain \ndormant for the time being while others are on \nthe verge of eruption, their solutions eluding \ninternational statesmanship.\n61.\tIn Afghanistan, the aggressive invasion, \noccupation and strife continue unabated. A \npermanent member of the Security Council \ncontinues to ignore numerous United Nations \nresolutions.\n62.\tIn both the Horn of Africa and Western \nSahara conflicts persist, and the seeds of future \nviolence and bloodshed are being sown with no \nsuccess achieved through international efforts to \ndefuse those potential volcanoes.\n63.\tKampuchea remains occupied by Vietnamese \ntroops who have disregarded calls for a \nwithdrawal by the United Nations, ASEAN and other \nbodies.\n64.\tOnly recently we witnessed the violent \neruption of the old conflict over the Falkland \nIslands (Malvinas). Although the United Nations \nhas been involved for years in the question of \nthe sovereignty over those islands, it was unable \nto prevent war or to stop it.\n65.\tIn our region instability is endemic. It \narises from a variety of causes, which must be \nrecognized for what they are. In most countries \ngreat poverty exists alongside the immense wealth \nof some of the oil- producing States. Some \nGovernments are alarmed at the rise of fanatical \nfundamentalist movements. Most countries are \ngoverned by regimes that retain absolute power in \ntheir hands, and any expression of criticism or \nopposition is ruthlessly suppressed. Talk of Arab \nsolidarity and unity often conceals or is refuted \nby a reality of constant strife, tension and \nfriction between neighbouring States.\n66.\tThe Moody and senseless war between Iraq \nand Iran rages on. It has already exacted many \nthousands of casualties and consumed several \nscores of billions of dollars which could well \nhave been utilized for development and social \nprogress.\n67.\tLebanon is beginning to emerge from a \nseven- year-old conflict in which the Lebanese \nwere occupied and ravaged by their Syrian \nneighbors and their unwelcome guests, the \nterrorists of the PLO.\n68.\tI do not mention these conflicts and the \nchronic instability which produces them in a \nspirit of criticism or denigration. They are part \nof the reality with which everyone concerned with \ndurable peace and security in the Middle East has \nto contend. No magic formula can change this \nsituation or solve the problems that created it.\n69.\tNevertheless, there are those who \nsuggest, whether out of naivety, ignorance or ill \nintent, that a solution to the Arab-Israeli \ndispute would bring peace and stability \nthroughout the Middle East region. The recent \nevents in Lebanon alone demonstrate the fallacy \nof this suggestion. Some Arab Governments could \nnot resist the temptation to utilize the services \nof terrorist organizations to settle their scores \nwith other Governments. A small defenseless \nState, Lebanon, with a weak Government, became an \nideal battleground for this purpose. This was \ncompounded by Syria's designs on Lebanon's \nindependence and integrity. The resultant \nexplosion had little or no connection with the \nArab-Israeli conflict. The same applies to the \nIraq-Iran conflict, the tension between Jordan \nand Syria and the endless disputes between Libya \nand the rest of the Arab world.\n70.\tIt is frequently claimed that the fault \nlies, not in the United Nations system, but in \nits Members, that the Organization merely \nreflects their failings. This is of course true, \nbut it is equally true that a system which \nencourages contention rather than compromise, \nboycott rather than co-operation, confrontation \nrather than negotiation, hardly meets the needs \nof a world as diverse as ours in race, religion, \nculture and social and political practice.\n71.\tParticularly and unnecessarily disruptive \nis the undue politicization of the United Nations \nspecialized agencies. Instead of devoting \nthemselves to the social, humanitarian, \nscientific and technical tasks which they were \nset up to perform and which most of them perform \nwell when allowed to do so, these agencies are \nonly too frequently subverted and misused for \npartisan interests. Can it be doubted that this \nis one of the causes for the failure of the \nUnited Nations system to contribute effectively \ntowards halting the crises and deterioration in \nthe world economy?\n72.\tI feel that it is appropriate for me at \nthis juncture to pay a tribute to the \nSecretary-General, who has provided us with much \nfood for thought in his provocative and \nimaginative report on the work of the \nOrganization. I represent a country which most \ncertainly can be said to be reluctant  to resort \nto the Security Council or to use the machinery \nof the United Nations . The Secretary-General has \ncogently set out the reasons. I can assure him \nthat the Government of Israel will support \nconstructive and effective measures advancing the \nprospect of a world in which\u00f3to use his \nlanguage\u00f3the small and weak have reliable defense \nand shelter. At the same time, we shall warn \nagainst and oppose steps designed to exploit and \nabuse the Secretary-General thoughtful proposals \nas one more tool of political warfare.\n73.\tThe principles, upon which the United \nNations was founded, as well as the Charter, \nshould have moved the Organization and its \nMembers\u00f3as far back as 30 years ago\u00f3to take a \nstand against the denial on the part of the Arab \nworld of the right of a Member State, Israel, to \nexist in security. When the United Nations \nignored this inalienable obligation, it did so at \nits peril, undermining its own credibility and \nmoral power. Since then, the United Nations has \nlacked the courage to rise and condemn any act of \naggression, threat, violence, blackmail and \nterror, both direct and indirect, towards Israel \nby the Arab States and their accomplices.\n74.\tThe Assembly has even chosen to reject \nthe Camp David accords and the Israel-Egyptian \npeace treaty and has ignored the completion \nearlier this year of Israel's withdrawal from \nSinai. It has devoted much time to other, \napparently more congenial, aspects of the \nArab-Israeli conflict.\n75.\tAmong the thousands of resolutions \nadopted by the General Assembly and the Security \nCouncil or any other United Nations body during \nthe past 30 years, one will find hardly a single \ndecision or resolution that explicitly condemns \nby name any Arab State or organization for \nattacks on Israel or Israelis. During these 30 \nyears, have Arabs never practiced military \nattacks, terrorist actions, hijacking airplanes, \ntaking hostages, not to speak of the placing of \nembargoes and blockades and any similar hostile \nact which international law would even define as \na casus belli the Arab States and their terror \norganizations always appear to be innocent and \ninjured; offended but never offending.\n76.\tUnited Nations documentation is replete \nwith anti-Israel resolutions, which have \nincreased yearly in both number and length, \noverflowing with distorted suppositions, \narbitrary statements and one-sided and \ndestructive recommendations and decisions. Even \nthe discussion of the establishment of a nuclear- \nweapon-free zone in the Middle East did not \nescape the bane of politicization and \npartisanship. The consensus attained on this \nissue in the Assembly in 1980 was wrecked last \nyear. We hope that it can be restored, and we \nstand by our statements made here in the past. \nNone of the many differences between the States \nof the Middle East should be permitted to stand \nin the way of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. This we \nowe to our children and their common future. The \nGovernment of Israel stands ready to begin \nnegotiations to this end with all Middle Eastern \nStates at once, anywhere and without \npre-conditions.\n77.\tDouble standards and distortion have \nspread from General Assembly and committee \ndiscussions to other United Nations bodies, \nincluding the Security Council, and from there to \nthe directives given to the United Nations forces \nand instrumentalities in the Middle East. A \nnotable case is the misuse of UNRWA. That Agency \nwas charged with the rehabilitation of refugees \nbut became a tool to preserve the refugee camps, \nin which idle people were subjected to \nincitement and coercion in the service of \nterrorist organizations.\n78.\tThe specialized agencies, such as WHO, \nILO and so on have also been exploited for the \npurpose of propaganda warfare against Israel, \noverstepping their areas of responsibility and \ncompetence. Last week at the General Conference \nof IAEA great damage was done to the integrity of \nthat Agency and the whole United Nations system \nwhen the credentials of the delegation of Israel \nwere rejected in a blatant exercise of political \nabuse and discrimination.\n79.\tThe accumulated effect of these \ndistortions and shortcomings could be clearly \nseen in Lebanon. There developed a threat to \nIsrael, as well as to the welfare and \nindependence of Lebanon, a base for international \nterror and a large heavily armed force which was \nbeing put into action in constantly escalating \nattacks on the villages and towns of northern \nIsrael.\n80.\tBenefiting from the respectability and \nprestige bestowed by United Nations resolutions, \nthe PLO entrenched itself in Lebanon and set up a \npirate State within a State, forcing a regime of \nterror on the Palestinians and Lebanese. The \nPLO's terrorist bases, designed for attacks on \nIsrael and to serve international terror, \noperated and grew unhindered within camps marked \nby UNRWA signs and enjoying welfare payments \ncontributed for humanitarian purposes. Behind the \nbacks of the United Nations peace-keeping forces \nin southern Lebanon the terrorists built a \nmilitary infrastructure and huge arms stores, in \npreparation for a combined Arab assault against \nIsrael from the north and the east.\n81.\tHad we allowed United Nations \nresolutions, as distinct from the Charter, to \ndetermine what might or might not be done in \nArab-Israeli relations, our future would have \nbeen destruction. Those resolutions allowed Arab \ncountries to pursue their belligerence against \nIsrael\u00f3military, political, economic and so \nforth\u00f3and the PLO could continue its terror \nwarfare against Israel, Israelis and Jews, \nwithout any restriction by the United Nations. \nThe enemies of Israel felt that they could embark \non a full-scale military attack whenever they \njudged the hour to be right, knowing full wel \nthat the United Nations would not move a finger \nto stop them.\n82.\tIt is sufficient to recall United Nations \nbehavior in 1967, when discussion in the Security \nCouncil of the warlike steps Egypt had carried \nout in May and June 1967 was prevented. It is \nenough to be reminded of the apathy with which \nthe United Nations reacted when Egypt and Syria \nbroke the cease-fire and launched a co-ordinate \nsurprise attack on Israel on Yom Kippur 1973.\n83.\tEven the information at our disposal \nbefore the Peace for Galilee operation in early \nJune did not foresee all that we found in the \nterrorists' bases, headquarters, arms and \nammunition reservoirs, operational documents and \nso forth. We received concrete proof of planned, \nlarge-scale aggression which was to have taken \nplace in the near future.\n84.\tLebanese and also Palestinians who for \nyears suffered from PLO terror and feared to \ndivulge what had happened to them are now free to \nunmask the true face of the PLO in action. They \ncorroborate our gravest suspicions.\n85.\tThe entire international community has \nthe responsibility and should have the courage to \nstand up and formally ban PLO terrorism and expel \nits representatives from every self-respecting \nState and every international body. The United \nNations and its agencies cannot begin the process \nof rehabilitation and revitalization as long as \nsuch organizations and their representatives are \npermitted to set foot in a civilized forum.\n86.\tThirty-seven years ago, with the defeat \nof nazism, we all believed that the civilized \nworld had learned the lesson of anti-Semitism \nthat led to its most terrible \nexpression\u00f3genocide. Unfortunately, this monster \nis raising its ugly head once again. Often, \nattacks on Israel or Zionism in international \nforums serve as a transparent mask for \nanti-Semitism. The State of Israel, which is the \nfulfillment of the Jewish national movement, \ncannot and will not passively accept a resurgence \nof this evil ideology. We call on all self- \nrespecting people and Governments to join in a \nrenewed solemn undertaking to stamp out \nanti-Semitism, in all its forms and expressions, \nfrom human society.\n87.\tIt is a stain on our civilization and on \nthe Governments directly concerned that Jewish \ncommunities in the Soviet Union and in Syria \nremain deprived of their human rights, especially \nthe basic right to leave and take up residence in \ncountries of their choice. The State of Israel, \nnational homeland of the Jewish people, cannot \nand will not rest until these rights are granted.\n88.\tJust four years ago the leaders of Egypt, \nIsrael and the United States concluded an \nhistoric agreement at Camp David. Egypt assumed \nthe role of pioneer among Arab States. The two \nneighbors accepted each other's right to exist \nbehind secure and recognized borders. The \nnegotiations were long and arduous. Israel's \nsacrifices and the risks it undertook in the \nimplementation of the Camp David accords were \nheavy. A framework for general peace was \npains-takingly devised. Egypt, Israel and the \nUnited States repeatedly countered criticism of \nthe Camp David accords, emphasizing that these \naccords were the only agreed, and therefore the \nonly viable, path to peace between Israel and its \nneighbors.\n89.\tOur approach is practical and realistic. \nWe are ready to renew negotiations toward the \nestablishment of the self-governing authority for \nthe Arab inhabitants of Judea, Samaria and Gaza \nDistrict, as provided for in the autonomy plan. \nThe representatives who will be elected to the \nadministrative council will be empowered to speak \nfor the population and negotiate on the future \nstatus. There is a great deal of logic in the \nprovisions specified in the Camp David agreement \nthat the final status of these areas should not \nbe negotiated at the present stage. We remain \nconvinced that to focus now on what is beyond the \nhorizon is a sure way of inviting failure.\n90.\tIsrael would welcome additional partners \nto the process, as provided for in the Camp David \naccords. We firmly believe that agreement is \nachievable. There is no need to introduce new \nconcepts and approaches which were discarded or \nnot accepted at Camp David. We are not prepared, \nfor instance, to reopen the debate on issues, \nsuch as the creation of a second Palestinian Arab \nState, which were rejected at Camp David in favor \nof more realistic and acceptable solutions.\n91.\tAs for the refugee status in which many \nPalestinian Arabs have been kept over all the \nyears since 1948, this is shameful testimony to \nthe cynical exploitation of human suffering for \npolitical ends by Arab Governments. The number of \nPalestinian Arab refugees in 1948 was about \n350,000. There is no lack of land or financial \nresources in Arab lands, including Palestinian \nterritory in Trans-Jordan, to provide them with \nhomes and employment. Israel did as much and even \nmore, with meager resources, for some 800,000 \nJews who left or fled from Arab and Moslem lands \nafter 1948. The humanitarian aspect of this \nproblem could have been solved several times over \nin the intervening years.\n92.\tIn addition to creating a Palestine \nproblem and using it as a weapon against Israel, \nArab Governments instituted a boycott against \nIsrael in almost every sphere of human endeavor \nand supported the terrorist organizations' \nattacks on Israel. Against this background of \nactive and sustained belligerency, it is \nludicrous to search for moderation in possible \nhints contained in Arab summit resolutions, \nincluding the recent one at Fez. Any change \ntoward moderation must first be reflected in \ndeeds and facts.\n93.\tThe Arab leaders responsible for this \ncampaign against Israel have inflicted much \nsuffering on the Palestinian Arabs without \nbringing them any closer to a solution of their \nproblems. History will record the fact that \nIsrael did more for the Palestinian Arabs and \ntheir welfare than their Arab brethren.\n94.\tIsrael remains faithful to its commitment \nunder the Camp David accords. Israel has \ncautioned against attempts to reinterpret, \nrenegotiate or bypass them. These accords are the \nonly accepted blueprint for the implementation of \nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 \n(1973). Pressing Israel for more territorial \nwithdrawals will not bring peace. Indeed, there \nis no peace without security, and further \nterritorial amputations negate security. Those of \nIsrael's neighbors who seek peace and coexistence \nwill find Israel a willing partner. But those who \nthink that they can weaken Israel while dangling \nthe word  peace  as a bait are deluding \nthemselves. The reward for peace is peace itself. \nThere can be no greater recompense in such a \nvital and noble cause.\n95.\tThe foul massacre of civilians in the \ncamps at Beirut brought a wave of shock, outrage \nand revulsion in Israel. The perpetrators of this \ncrime are well known. They were not Israeli. \nNevertheless, there were manifestations of blind \nhatred and false accusations leveled at Israel \nfrom a number of quarters. Such actions are \noutrageous and deserve universal condemnation.\n96.\tAH those who proceed along this path must \nrealize that by such action they are weakening \nthe chances of peace and encouraging those \nelements in the Middle East whose interests are \nserved by radicalization and violence. The Middle \nEast is sorely in need of good counsel, \nmoderation, much patience and a sincere desire \nfor coexistence of diverse ideas, ideologies, \nfaiths and communities. Israel, for its part, is \nready to participate in and contribute to the \ncreation of such a reality and atmosphere in the \nMiddle East.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to begin by extending my \ndelegation's congratulations to Mr. Hollai on his \nelection to the presidency of this session of the \nGeneral Assembly. He has served many years in the \nOrganization. The reputation he has acquired \namong his peers is that of an extremely able, \nknowledgeable, affable man of goodwill. I should \nalso like to say a word of thanks to his \npredecessor, Mr. Kittani, for the excellent job \nhe did.\n207.\tI have read the report of the \nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization \nwith great admiration. It is refreshingly frank \nand self-critical. I agree with him that our most \nurgent goal is to reconstruct the United Nations \ncollective security system. With\u00acout such a \nsystem, first, Governments will feel it necessary \nto arm themselves beyond their means for their \nown security; secondly, the world com\u00acmunity will \nremain powerless to deal with military adventures \nsuch as Israel's invasion of Lebanon, the USSR's \ninvasion of Afghanistan and Viet Nam's invasion \nof Kampuchea; thirdly, local conflicts will \nthreaten to widen and escalate; fourthly, there \nwill be no reliable defense for the small and \nweak nations; and finally, all our efforts on the \neconomic and social side may well falter.\n208.\tThe Secretary-General has made a number \nof specific recommendations on how to strengthen \nthe United Nations collective security system. \nThe Independent Commission on Security and \nDisarma\u00acment Issues, chaired by Mr. Olof Palme of \nSweden, has also made a number of interesting \nrecommen\u00acdations on the same subject.\\\" I urge the \nSecurity Council to consider these \nrecommendations as soon as possible.\n209.\tTurning to the specific conflicts and \nsituations which threaten international peace and \nsecurity, the Secretary-General was cautiously \noptimistic on Namibia. He reports that after many \nsetbacks, we now see some signs of the \npossibility of a solution. Apart from the \nsolitary exception of Namibia, the past year has \nwitnessed no progress in our efforts to promote \nnegotiated settlements on the conflicts in the \nMiddle East and elsewhere.\n210.\tIn the conflict in Kampuchea, our various \nreso\u00aclutions have not brought about the \nwithdrawal of Viet\u00acnamese forces. But the \nunambiguous position of the vast majority of \nnations, as reflected in the resolution and the \nDeclaration of the International Conference on \nKampuchea, has denied legitimacy to the \naggres\u00acsor, has stiffened and heartened patriotic \nresistance to foreign occupation and encouraged \nthe various resistance factions to unite their \nefforts under the leadership of Prince Norodom \nSihanouk. Thus, the aggressor has not been \nallowed to enjoy the fruits of its actions.\n211.\tThe position of my delegation on the \nother questions on the agenda of this session \nwill be enun\u00acciated when these items are \nconsidered by the General Assembly.\n212.\tAll the conflicts which the Assembly was \ncon\u00acsidering when we last met are still with us \ntoday. The new wars in the South Atlantic and \nLebanon have shown us how quickly and \nunexpectedly violence and turmoil can spread. \nEvery day newspaper headlines and the television \nscreen bring the terrible carnage into every home.\n213.\tWhile these events have captured the \nattention of the world, an economic crisis, no \nless lethal In its effects on people, has been \nspreading through the world. One symptom of this \ncrisis is the debt prob\u00aclem. In recent months the \nworld's headlines have drawn attention to the \nproblem of third-world debt. It is estimated that \nthe third_ world's debt js more than $US 500 \nbillion. These debts were not accumu\u00aclated \novernight. The problem has been brewing for some \ntime. It is a combination of the problem of non- \noil-producing third world countries trying to \nadjust to changes in energy costs and the \noil-producing third world countries embarking on \nmassive development projects in anticipation of \nfuture oil income\n214.\tThe non-oil-producing third world \ncountries were first hit by high energy prices. \nThey were then hjt from another direction as the \nindustrialized coun\u00actries increased the prices of \ntheir products to meet increased energy costs. To \nadd to these difficulties, the recession in the \nindustrialized countries depressed the prices of \nthe primary commodities produced by these third \nworld countries. Squeezed between high costs and \nfalling incomes, these poor countries have had to \nresort to massive borrowing for consumption and \nnot for investment. It is inconceivable to me how \nthis debt can be repaid or the interest serviced.\n215.\tDefault on even a portion of the massive \ndebts that have accumulated could trigger a total \ncollapse of the global financial system, which \nwould, in turn, lead to a deep global recession. \nThe mild panic that seized the financial pundits \nof the West when they grasped the implications of \nthe situation that they had got themselves into \nnow seems to have been replaced by a mood of \nsuperficial confidence, perhaps because no one \ndares believe otherwise; no one dares say that \nthe emperor has no clothes.\n216.\tAnother problem with grave implications \nis that of starvation. As much as 40 per cent of \nthe world's population suffers from some form of \nundernourish\u00acment. The fate of millions is \ndownright starvation. As the population continues \nto increase in the poorest regions of the world, \nmore and more people will be forced below the \nsubsistence level of food intake. \nUndernourishment and starvation are the work not \nof fate but of human action. They can be \nprevented. Much of the increasing starvation can \nbe attributed to the failure of national \npolicies. But we are not here to pass judgment on \nnational policies; we are here to see how we as \nmembers of an international community can help \nthese nations in their plight. The problem is \nparticularly severe in Africa, where food \ncon\u00acsumption per person is 10 per cent less today \nthan it was a decade ago.\n217.\tThe problems of debt and famine, which I \nhave quoted as examples of the less \nheadline-grabbing prob\u00aclems of the global \ncommunity, are themselves only symptoms of a far \nmore serious malaise in the inter\u00acnational \neconomy.\n218.\tWhile the problem of global equity \nremains serious, what we are confronted with \ntoday is not simply the failure of the North to \nrespond to the South's call for a more equitable \neconomic relation\u00acship but the incipient \ndisintegration of the entire economic system that \nhas sustained both North and South for the past \n40 years. The consequences of such a total \ncollapse would far outweigh the present \ninjustices of the system. A renowned professor of \nthe London School of Economics, which is not \nunsympathetic to the third world, once remarked \nthat the misery of being exploited by capitalists \nis nothing compared to the misery of not being \nexploited at all.\n219.\tThe liberal trading regime set up after \nthe Second World War and institutionalized in \nGATT has clearly been unable to cope with the \nstresses and strains generated by new conditions. \nThe developed countries have been unable to cope \nwith the increas\u00acingly sensitive impact that one \nnational economy has on another under conditions \nof interdependence and they have been unable to \nrestructure their domestic economies to deal with \nnew patterns of international trade, production \nand consumption.\n220.\tThe result has been increasing \nprotectionism in the form of a complex system of \n\\\"orderly marketing arrangements\\\", \\\"voluntary \nexport re\u00acstraints\\\" and a host of other \neuphemistically named non-tariff barriers \ndesigned to circumvent GATT. So prevalent have \nsuch practices become that the danger is that \nexceptions to GATT will become more numerous than \ninstances of compliance. The effect of such \nprotectionism has been to freeze the existing \ndistribution of industrial capability and wealth. \nOne recent study has demonstrated that three \nquarters of all actions to restrict imports under \nsafeguard, surveillance and anti-dumping \nprovisions dealt with only three product groups: \nsteel, textiles and clothing. Locational \nadvantages in such production have shifted \nrapidly, and, by and large, the lowest- cost \nproducers are now countries in the third world, \nwhich are now being penalized for their success.\n221.\tThe problems of debt, famine and protectionism \nare interrelated. Protectionism freezes existing \npatterns of international trade in which the \ndeveloped countries have consistently enjoyed \nhuge trade sur\u00acpluses W.s-n-ws the developing \ncountries. Such imbalances require financing and \nthus necessitate heavy borrowing and a growing \ndebt burden.\n222.\tProtectionism also deliberately restricts \nlevels of food production. In Japan, North \nAmerica and Europe protectionist agricultural \nsystems have included measures to curtail the \nproduction of surpluses of major cereals and some \nother commodities. The European Economic \nCommunity has for two decades subsidized farm \nproduction while keeping out cheaper imports. The \ninevitable surplus stocks lie idle white much of \nthe world starves. The lesson is clear. The \nliberal trading system, in spite of all its \nfaults, offers the best framework for a more \nequitable international economic system. It is \nincreasingly clear that more developing countries \nare becoming competitive in the international \nmarket. It is also becoming clear that if the \nprinciples of comparative advantage are allowed \nto operate unhindered, this must result in a \ncorrection of the grossly disproportionate \nconsumption of the world's resources by the \ndeveloped countries. We cannot hope for a more \nequitable distribution of global income if the \nliberal trading regime continues to be \nunder\u00acmined.\n223.\tTo my mind, the basic cause of \nprotectionism is the failure of the developed \ncountries to manage State welfare within national \nmeans and to direct economic growth to keep pace \nwith technological changes. Over-expenditure on \nwelfare has resulted in inflexible domestic \npolitical structures. Governments of the \ndeveloped countries have been deprived of the \npolitical flexibility needed to make changes in \ninternational patterns of trade and production \nwithout resort to protectionism.\n224.\tThe pressure for protectionism comes from \nmany quarters. It comes from industries in \ndeveloped countries which have not modernized \ntheir production processes and thus find \nthemselves unable to compete with more efficient \nand lower-cost plants in developing countries. \nBut the political pressures for protectionism \nalso come from trade union movements in the \ndevel-oped countries, which, acting from a \nshort-sighted desire to protect workers in \ndeclining industries, have urged and forced \nprotectionist measures on Governments.\n225.\tThey have sought to organize boycotts of \nthird- world products and services under the \nguise of con\u00accern for the heath of workers in \ndeveloping countries or of preventing \nexploitation of workers in those countries. The \ncharge that exports from developing countries are \nbased on cheap labor is simplistic. It is true \nthat the wages of third-world workers are lower \nthan those of workers in developed countries. But \nthe choice before the workers in the third world \nis either one meal or starvation. For no third \nworld country with all the inherent drawbacks of \nits low development status can be competitive if \nits workers are paid the wages of workers in \ndeveloped coun\u00actries. Thus, when union leaders in \nsome developed countries insist that wages and \nworking conditions enjoyed by them must be \naccorded to workers in the third world countries, \nthey are in fact telling the workers in the third \nworld to starve. There are no welfare benefits \nand unemployment pay in most third world \ncountries. The irony is that low-cost imports \nfrom the third world would certainly benefit the \ncon\u00acsumer in developed countries by reducing his \ncost of living.\n226.\tThere has been a great change in the \nattitude of the developed countries towards \nthird-world devel\u00acopment. In the immediate \npost-war years, the developed countries took a \nvery positive view of economic development in the \nthird world. From the late 1940s to the 1960s, \nthey believed that it was in their interest to \nhelp in the economic development of the poorer \nnations of the world. These three decades of \ngenerous technical and monetary assistance to \nhelp these countries take advantage of the \nbenefits of the free-trade system.\n227.\tToday the attitude of the rich nations to \neco\u00acnomic development in the third world is a \nmixture of disillusionment and fear. To be frank, \nmuch of the blame for the disillusionment can be \nlaid at the door of developing countries \nthemselves. The launching of over-ambitious and \nprestigious projects has not encour\u00acaged those \nwho are sympathetic to aid programmes. More \nimportant, huge arms expenditures in pursuit of \nancient conflicts and animosities against \nneighbors has crippled economic growth in some \ndeveloping countries. Much emphasis has lately \nbeen placed on economic co-operation among \ndeveloping countries. The most vital form of \nco-operation among developing countries is \nco-operation to maintain peace and stability \namong neighbors.\n228.\tIn this respect I should like to point to \nthe regional grouping of the Association of \nSouth-East Asian Nations\twhich has created \nan area of peace, amity and co-operation among \nits five members. Its members have therefore been \nable to derive the maximum benefit from their \nnational economic devel\u00acopment policies.\n229.\tWhile we must not ignore the shortcomings \nin the third world, it is also true that a number \nof third world countries, in response to Western \nexhortations that they should trade rather than \ndepend on aid, have manifested a capacity to \ncompete with the West in industrial areas \ninvolving low technology. The response in the \ndeveloped world to this modest suc\u00access at \ndevelopment has not been praise or \nencour\u00acagement. Rather, there have been alarmist \ncalls for protection from entrepreneurs and \nlabour unions in developed countries.\n230.\tThe developing countries of the third \nworld are thus caught in a \\\"no-win\\\" situation. If \nthey are unsuccessful in their development \nefforts, they are condemned for inefficiency, \ncorruption, xenophobia and a host of other evils. \nIf they should succeed, they are penalized for \ntheir very success.\n231.\tThe slow strangulation of a liberal \ntrading system with increase international \ntension. The television cameras may not notice \nthe process, but I fear that, if we continue to \nneglect the problem, we shall have all too much \ndrama. The major devel-oped countries are \nincreasingly divided among them\u00acselves. The North \nand the South will move further apart. \nDesperation will breed irresponsibility. The \nbenefits of all this will redound to those Powers \nthat profit from and exploit instability and \ndivisions. The result will be an increase in \ninternational insta\u00acbility. This threat to the \nstability of the international system is \nfundamental. In an interdependent world, autarky \nis no longer a viable option for any nation. The \nquestion that all of us must face is whether we \ncan muster sufficient political will to preserve \nthe integrity of the system before the point of \nno return is reached.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the people and Government of Honduras I should like most \nsincerely to congratulate you, Sir, on your fitting election as \nPresident of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. I \nwould likewise express our gratitude to your distinguished \npredecessor, Mr. Kittani, who in the discharge of his duties, in a \nparticularly difficult year, demonstrated great ability, firmness and \ndiplomatic tact. As a Latin American I am also very happy to greet \nMr. Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary General, who, with the valuable \ncooperation of a Secretariat dedicated to the lofty ideals of the \nOrganization, has given dynamic direction and impetus to the many \nactivities that have been entrusted to him.\nThe creation of the United Nations inspired great hope among the \npeoples of the world. The Organization established the instruments of \npeace and cooperation that were needed to help a world that had been \nafflicted by war. Although the ideological rivalry of the super \nPowers soon paralyzed valuable initiatives and on many occasions \nbrought us to the brink of war, it is nevertheless true that the \nUnited Nations, as a forum for open discussion, made it possible for \nmankind to survive. There have been many important achievements over \nthe years, but we are now once again living in an era that requires \nMember States to make a conscious effort to strengthen the role of \nthe United Nations and its main bodies in the quest for international \npeace and security.\nToday's world weighs heavily on our conscience. Endless conflicts \npersist without a proper solution, including recent conflicts, as \nwell as internal and international tensions in various parts of the \nworld, which make it difficult to view the future as sounder and more \nsecure. Along with this disquieting situation, we have witnessed a \ntremendous growth of the power of destruction of conventional and \nother weapons in a frenzied arms race.\n\nThe world situation appears even bleaker when we realize with great \nconcern that the means of preventing or solving conflicts are \ninadequate, haphazard and slow and, what is even worse, are \ndisregarded or ignored by some States or rendered ineffective because \nof the obstacles created by attempts to achieve power.\n4\nThe fragile nature of the present international structure shows that, \nin the face of the threats to international peace and security, we \nmust display good sense and fulfil our basic responsibility towards \nmankind by making every effort to foster and strengthen procedures \nfor the prevention and solution of international conflicts. There is \nno doubt that this task must be undertaken on at least two levels: \nfirst, by the member States of the international community, and, \nsecondly, by global and regional international organizations.\nIn the first instance, individual States must display a political \nwill for peace in order to solve their conflicts and must lend their \nsupport to ensure that neighboring or friendly countries involved in \nan international crisis situation achieve a peaceful solution; they \nmust help in the implementation of resolutions adopted by various \ninternational bodies aimed at the settlement of conflicts between \nStates and abide by the decisions of international organizations.\nIn the second instance, we must make an effort to strengthen and \nimprove the means of obtaining peaceful solutions already available \nto all States Members of the United Nations, while at same time \ntrying to find new and imaginative formulas that will contribute to \nthe prevention and settlement of conflicts.\nMy country has at past sessions of the General Assembly emphasized \nthat the future of mankind depends upon real possibilities for \neffective negotiation and consultation to deal with conflicting \ninternational interests. I must therefore at this time express the \nstrongest support of the people and Government of Honduras for the \ncourageous initiative of the Secretary General in his report on the \nwork of the Organization, concerning the strengthening of the role of \nthe Organization for the sake of peace. Honduras congratulates the \nSecretary General on his timely report, and calls upon all Member \nStates to pledge themselves to the honorable mission of revitalizing \nthe juridical, institutional and diplomatic means available to the \nOrganization fully to implement the principles, goals and objectives \nlaid down in the San Francisco Charter.\nTo follow our words with deeds and translate our thoughts into \naction, Honduras has taken an audacious step to help bring about \npeace in Central America, particularly since the election of the new \nconstitutional and democratic Government of Roberto Suazo Cordova. \nThis pacifist tradition is deeply rooted in our history and in the \nconscience of our people. Honduras is the central country of our \nregion, having borders with El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. The \nwaters of the Atlantic and the Pacific bathe our shores.\nIn the nineteenth century and part of the twentieth century, Honduras \nsuffered the adverse consequences of its geographic position and its \nsoil was used as a battleground in the disputes of opposing political \nfactions in neighboring countries or conflicts between States. These \npolitical upheavals in Central America deeply affected the Honduran \npopulation and the ensuing internal wars caused grief and \ndestruction. Fortunately, the experiences of our history to which I \nhave referred helped us to overcome these problems and the Honduran \nnation emerged strengthened and we were enabled to substitute \ncivilized, democratic, political dialogue for confrontation.\nThe manner in which our economic structures developed helped us avoid \nthe establishment of a dominant class possessing most of the national \nwealth. The main items we produce fell to the monopoly of foreign \ninterests, particularly as regards export, and drained our country of \ncapital. Consequently the economic disparities which exist in \nHonduras have not resulted in an unbridgeable gap between the \ndifferent sectors of our society. We have no hegemonic oligarchies, \nno indigenous aristocracy. It is therefore not surprising that those \nwho have achieved economic, professional or political success are \noften people of humble extraction, who have learned and succeeded \nthrough hard work.\nThese harsh conditions are reflected in various actions taken \nrecently. No one is unaware of the fact that the countries which have \nsuffered most acutely from the impact of recession, are, like ours, \ncountries of the American continent which lack energy resources. \nNevertheless, Honduras has made an enormous internal effort to \nreadjust its economy and to meet fully all its economic and financial \ncommitments, which has enabled us to protect the stability of our \ncurrency and the image of a country which takes seriously its \nresponsibilities vis a vis the international economic community.\nIn the social field, we are proud of our free, strong and pluralistic \ntrade union movement. Our farmers have been organized for more than \ntwo decades and the various farmers' associations and unions have \nmore than 100,000 members. We also have numerous professional \norganizations of technical experts and craftsmen, and people involved \nin small , medium  and large scale industry, as well as associations \nof students, teachers, businessmen, farm workers, cattlemen, and \nothers. Four political parties represent different trends of thought \nin our legislative system and people of all walks of life are members \nof our judicial system. For more than 30 years we have had labor laws \nto protect our workers and for 20 years we have had a process of \nagrarian reform and a system of social security. The freedom of the \npress is unlimited and fundamental human rights are fully protected.\nIn saying this I do not imply that we have solved all our problems; \nfar from it. I am merely saying that we live in a society governed by \nthe law, that there is a plurality of interests which find expression \nin the framework of freedom, and there are more things uniting us \nthan there are separating us. We live in a society which is open to \npeaceful change and dedicated to the improvement of its democratic \ninstitutions.\nThe political, economic and social development of Honduras has \ncreated a reality which is unique in the Central American region. \nDespite many short, comings in social services in the field of health,\neducation, housing, nutrition and other areas, the Honduran nation \nhas achieved high standards in certain fundamental areas which enable \nus to look with optimism.\nThe Hondurans embrace the creed of peace through justice, and justice \nthrough freedom. Hence, those who are familiar with our people know \nthat we reject violence in all its forms. More than any other Central \nAmerican people, Hondurans practice dialogue in the settlement of \ntheir disputes. We support the electoral process for the \nestablishment of a government, in the belief that there is support in \nour society for all political sectors involved in running the affairs \nof our community.\nThese values of the Honduran nation were reaffirmed in the re \nestablishment of democracy which began in 1980, when the people were \ncalled upon to elect a National Constituent Assembly, and 84 per cent \nof the electoral population of Honduras went to the polls. Not even \ncountries with the oldest democratic tradition can boast such \nvigorous popular participation. There is no doubt that this \noverwhelming expression of the sovereignty of the people is an \noutstanding example for the future of our country and of Central \nAmerica.\nOne year later, in 1981, the Honduran people demonstrated even more \nvigorously their confidence in the free electoral process. Observers \nfrom almost all parts of the world witnessed a new, exemplary, civic \nevent, namely the establishment of the political and legal system \nwhich now governs the destiny of our country.\nThe Honduran people, on the basis of its sovereignty, calls for a \nreturn to a climate of political understanding, social peace and \nrespect for human dignity, at a time when we are witnessing in our \nregion the tragedy of violence and social upheavals.The situation in \nmy country is in stark contrast with the abolition in other States of \nthe region of individual and public freedoms and the denial of the \npeoples' right to self determination.\nFor these reasons, the democratic process which began in Honduras so \nsuccessfully undoubtedly represents renewed hopes for peace and \nfreedom which are bound to exert a positive influence in our \ntormented Central America.\nHonduras, its people and its Government, are fully aware of the \ncircumstances which threaten peace at home and abroad. They are \nequally aware of their role in the current situation in the region. \nThe President of my country, Mr. Roberto Suazo Cordova, upon coming \nto power, stated that Honduras did not want to become the arbiter of \nthe region and its anguish, its hopes and its expectations, for that \nis not its function. But Honduras ardently desires to help bring \nabout stability and harmony, in keeping with its devotion to the \nprinciples of non intervention and self determination, and to help \nCentral America to become a region of peaceful coexistence, whose \npeople and leaders will establish and maintain understanding on the \nbasis of effective dialogue. The President of Honduras wants Central \nAmerica to be a zone of peace, not to see it tormented by bellicose \ndisputes and polarizing confrontations. In that vein, the foreign \npolicy of Honduras is based on the simple but preeminent principle of \nthe internationalization of peace in that troubled region of our \ncontinent.\nBased on our desire to adopt concrete measures in Central America to \nrelieve the tension and dispel the violence of irreparable \nconsequences, Honduras has presented a peace initiative which has \nreceived broad national and international support. It consists of six \npoints which, in the view of my Government, cover the main questions \nto be discussed. This, however, does not exclude the possibility of \nconsidering others aimed at the same goal of achieving peace in the \nregion, which may come from other States equally interested in \nachieving the same goal. Honduras has proposed the following six \npoints.\nFirst, we propose that the bases for general disarmament in the \nregion be immediately established. This would imply not only a halt \nof the arms race which has created so much tension and instability in \nCentral America and in continental relations, but a real reduction of \nmilitary equipment and manpower to ensure that countries possessing \narmed forces maintain them at the level strictly necessary for the \ndefense of their territorial integrity and sovereignty and the \nmaintenance of public order, and that they abide by the universally \nestablished criteria recognized by every democratic society based on \nthe rule of law. There should also be agreements on the types of \nweapons whose limitation on proscription would be determined in this \ngeneral disarmament plan.\nSecondly, we propose that agreement likewise be reached on an \nobjective and reasonable reduction in the number of foreign military \nand other advisers, or any other elements which are liable to cause \nconcern or unrest, or undermine the identity of any nation.\nThirdly, we propose that there be a survey of and agreement on the \nrequired machinery to ensure, by means of international supervision \nand monitoring, to which Honduras will submit, that countries of the \nCentral American region fulfill their commitments and \nresponsibilities. This system of supervision and monitoring would be \napplied to countries where there exist conflicts and difficult \nsituations likely to affect peace in the region, especially in ports, \nairports, borders and strategic areas. My country is ready to open \nits territory without any reservations to any form of international \nsupervision for the purpose of achieving and maintaining peace.\nFourthly, we propose that there be consideration of and agreement on \nthe most appropriate procedures and mechanisms to put an end to the \ntraffic of arms in the region.\nFifthly, we propose that recognized boundaries and the traditional \nlines of jurisdiction of the States of the region be fully respected \nso as not to endanger peace through new disputes which might arise \nwith regard to land or sea.\nSixthly, we propose that a set of guidelines be drawn up for a \npermanent multilateral dialogue on the basis of this initiative, thus \nto promote political understanding internally, to achieve a \ndemocratic and pluralistic system and assure respect for public \nfreedoms and the right of the peoples to express their will freely.\nWe affirm that the arms race constitutes an inherent threat to the \nfuture of nations and the survival of mankind itself. We therefore \nbelieve that the excessive expenditures in war equipment should be \nused to combat poverty and misery and to promote the well  being of \nthe people, to lend technical and scientific assistance, to overcome \nconditions of backwardness facing developing countries and to help in \nthe establishment of a new international economic order so as to \nreduce the tensions that aggravate the tragic problems of our times.\nThis is the struggle that we are engaged in to achieve domestic as \nwell as international peace; but I must state clearly and \nunequivocally that we have fallen victim to certain problems which \nstem from the internal problems of neighboring nations which are \nthreatening our own security now. Honduras is being threatened by \nterrorism in which the direct participation of outside elements has \nbeen demonstrated, and which undermines fundamental human rights and \nattempts to undo the entire democratic process which we are building. \nThe recent acts of terrorism have been denounced by our people who \nmost energetically reject violence as a means of political action \nwhose sole purpose is to destroy social peace and jeopardize human \ndignity.\nThe Honduran people want to live in peace, work in peace, build in \npeace, bring about change in peace and know that the road of peace \nwas built to be used for peace in this democracy in which we live \ntoday.\nThe Government of Honduras expresses the hope that the international \ncommunity, represented in the Organization, will devise and adopt \nmultilateral legal instruments which will eradicate the underlying \ncauses of terrorism and will fight and impose sanctions on this \ndreadful scourge, one which offends the conscience of civilized \nnations and of the peoples who strive to build a better future based \non peaceful coexistence, understanding and solidarity.\nHonduras wants to devote all of its strength to the consolidation of \npolitical democracy and economic and social development. We want and \nneed a climate of peace and security, stability and harmony, to \nstrive to overcome the present economic crises in our country and at \nthe same time achieve social justice by means of peaceful change. We \nwould like to devote our limited material resources to combat poverty \nand promote the well being of our people rather than to compete in a \nruinous arms race. We do not want an armed peace for Central America, \nnor a balance of power based on the possession of sophisticated \nweapons of destruction.\nHonduras extends its hand to the countries that are ready to \nassociate themselves with this effort for peace with justice and \nfreedom.\nTogether with Costa Rica, Honduras has endeavored to find formulas to \nsolve the conflicts in Central America peacefully and democratically. \nA meeting of foreign ministers of several Central American and \nCaribbean countries was held in San Jose on 4 October last, to \nconsider ways and means truly and effectively to achieve these goals. \nA particularly significant issue was the establishment of a forum for \npeace and democracy with a mandate to carry out the peace initiatives \nbased on agreements between States of the region.\nThis meeting of democratic countries emphasized the need to help \nestablish peace in the region, to promote and. consolidate a \ncomprehensive system of institutions in the countries of the region \nand to create an appropriate scheme for intra regional and \ninternational cooperation in various fields on the basis of peace, \nsecurity, democracy and development.\nTins new vigorous effort is made in the context of the Honduran peace \nproposal, sincemultilateral dialogue on a permanent basis is the \nfundamental requirement for the achievement of appropriate and \nlasting solutions We would like to express the hope that the \nGovernment of Nicaragua will support this new initiative and the \nprinciples which have inspired it, for we believe that a Nicaragua \nwhich will establish and guide its revolutionary process along the \npath of democracy, pluralism and non alignment is essential for the \npolitical stability and the peace and security of the Central \nAmerican region.\nThe Secretary General asked me today, without prejudice to other \nongoing initiatives, to meet at Headquarters with the Foreign \nMinister of Nicaragua. I have accepted this fraternal invitation of \nthe Secretary General to demonstrate quite clearly once again, in \nthis Hall where we gather in the pursuit of peace, justice and \ncooperation, the unswerving desire of the Government of Honduras to \nhold a dialogue for a global exchange of views on the problems which \naffect the Central American region.\nI have tried to explain in plain and simple terms what Honduras \nconsists of and what its contribution is to the cause of peace in \nCentral America. The international community will judge us on the \nbasis of our actions. Before I refer to other matters in the general \ndebate, I should simply like to repeat, with all the strength that my \nGovernment is capable of demonstrating, that we shall continue to \nconduct our affairs in accordance with the principles of \nnonintervention, respect for the right to self determination of \npeoples, the territorial integrity of every State and, especially, \nour respect for the us^ of peaceful means to solve disputes. I am \nsimply emphasizing the words of the President of Honduras, Roberto \nSuazo Cordova, who, addressing himself recently to the Presidents of \nMexico and Venezuela, affirmed that The Honduran people will never \nresort to aggression or threats against any of our neighbors because \nwe firmly believe that any dispute between States can be settled \npeacefully.\nMy Government trusts that all Central American States will identify \nwith this postulate and that, setting aside claims of supremacy and \ndangerous ideological confrontations which are alien to our spirit, \nour destiny and our history, a free and democratic Central America \nwill see its efforts crowned with peace.\nThere are many political, economic and social issues on the agenda of \nthe General Assembly on which we should like to express our objective \nviews which guide us. in our participation in the work of cooperation \nthat motivates the United Nations. Our country will continue to make \nits enthusiastic contribution to the Group of 77, over which we have \npresided on two occasions in various forums. Honduras will also be \npresent as an observer in the meetings of the non aligned movement, \naware that, in political and economic matters, both groups agree on \nprinciples of justice in keeping with the growing aspirations of the \ndeveloping world.\nThe climate of mistrust and underlying hostility between the major \npolitical and military blocs of East and West this year have darkened \nthe picture. The limited achievements of the second special session \nof the General Assembly devoted to disarmament is an eloquent \nstatement on the real intentions which seem to guide the super Powers \nat this time.\nThe principles of international law enshrined in the Charter have \ncontinued to be ignored in various situations, sacrificed to the most \nblatant form of power politics, and the Security Council has been \nparalyzed during grave conflicts because of a total lack of agreement \non the objectives and the actions to which it could have legitimately \ncommitted itself.\nThis atmosphere of tension and lack of effectiveness has further \ncomplicated the solution of problems which are within the competence \nof the Security Council, thus prolonging existing conflicts and \nfailing to avoid the emergence of new crises and international \nconfrontations.\nIn the Middle East, conflicts have worsened. Hence, in the past few \nmonths we have witnessed the invasion of Lebanese territory by the armed \nforces of Israel, which, engaging in heavy fighting with Syrian and \nPalestinian military units, have occupied part of that territory and \nfor several weeks encircled its capital, Beirut, causing destruction, \ndesolation and death. This tragic situation was further aggravated by \nthe massacre of refugees, which caused indignation in the \ninternational community and deeply moved the Honduran people. My \nGovernment, which is attached to the values of respect for the human \nperson, most vigorously condemns this tragic holocaust.\nThe Honduran Government firmly condemns the use of force in the \nsettlement of international conflicts and rejects with equal vigor \nthe corollary that the acquisition of territories by occupation can \nbe justified.\nSimilarly, our Government believes that the legitimate rights of the \nPalestinian people to have their own homeland should be achieved \nthrough serious comprehensive negotiations and the open and firm \nsupport of the international community.\nThe right of Israel to exist and live in peace with its neighbors \nwithin secure and recognized boundaries, which Honduras has always \nsupported, can and must be coupled with the rights of the Palestinian \npeople to self determination and the establishment of their own State.\nIn southern Africa, the hopes raised five years ago by the plan of \nWestern Powers for Namibia, supplemented by the Security Council, \nhave given way to profound disillusionment, creating a dangerous \nclimate which could lead to new acts of aggression. In our view, \nthere is no other way but to persist in achieving the holding of free \nelections in Namibia as soon as possible and, therefore, we lend our \nsupport to fresh negotiations to put an end to the illegal occupation \nof the Territory by South Africa.\nThe world problems to which we referred earlier cannot conceal the \nimportant fact that conflicts emerge and develop basically in a \nregional context and that according to the letter and spirit of the \nCharter it is first and foremost for the members of each region and \nregional machinery they have established to solve conflicts with a \nfull sense of responsibility.\nBecause of its global character, the process of decolonization must \nbe in conformity with the peculiarities of history and geography. \nThus, in our American continent, a problem at once colonial and \nregional has been deeply felt recently by our peoples. We refer to \nthe colonial situation of the Malvinas and the grave crisis and armed \nconfrontation of last April and May between the Republic of Argentina \nand the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nHonduras recognizes the sovereign rights of the Republic of Argentina \nover the Malvinas and supports its claim. Honduras believes that \nevery conflict between States can be settled by negotiation; \ntherefore, it rejects the use of force in any international conflict. \nHonduras is in favor of a speedy negotiated solution between the \nparties which would give sovereignty over the Malvinas to Argentina.\nOur people is united in the quest for material and spiritual \nadvancement and the consolidation of Honduran nationhood through \nsound institutions based on justice, freedom and national harmony.\nWe are also united with regard to external matters. It is not a mere \nwhim to insist on peace; nor is it Utopia. Men of good will and \ngenerous thought know how to achieve it. Leaders who forget that the \nsupreme mandate is to secure the well  being of those they govern \nthrough respect for their dignity and the practice of harmonious \ncoexistence, will inescapably be drawn to the exercise of tyranny \nwhich is doomed to failure. The lessons of history are many and \nHonduras has learned from them. We have chosen to take the \nencouraging and promising road of democracy and peace.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to join previous speakers in warmly \ncongratulating Mr. Hollai on his election to the \nhigh and onerous office of Presi\u00acdent of the \nthirty seventh session of the General Assembly. \nHis election is proof of the confidence placed in \nhim personally and in his country by the General \nAssembly. I wish him all the best in guiding the \nwork of the session to a successful conclusion. \nOn behalf of my delegation, I pledge our full \nsupport in all his endeavors. Also, I wish to pay \na tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Kittani, who \nsuccessfully and with singular distinction guided \nthe work of the General Assembly throughout the \nthirty-sixth session and the special and \nemergency sessions. We owe him a debt of \ngratitude for his untiring efforts and the wisdom \nhe displayed at all times. This is also a fitting \noccasion for me to pay a tribute to the \nSecretary-General and the entire staff of the \nUnited Nations for the work they have done during \nthe past year.\n216.\tIn the Secretary-General's report on the \nwork of the Organization , we note the many \nprob\u00aclems and difficulties he has identified as \nconflicts between national aims and Charter \ngoals\u2014resort to confrontation, sporadic violence \nand even war itself in pursuit of w at are \nperceived as vital interests, claims and \naspirations. I wish to assure him that my country \nwill, as always, heed his appeal to all \nGovern\u00acments for their rededication and \ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the \nCharter.\n217.\tThe guiding spirit of my Government, \nunder the leadership of President Daniel Arap \nMoi, is peace, democracy and justice for all \nunder the rule of law in a system which \nrecognizes the supremacy of Parlia\u00acment. Another \nfundamental objective of the Govern\u00acment is the \nimprovement of the economic and social well-being \nof our people in unity, freedom and love for one \nanother. All our actions\u2014on the domestic front as \nwell as in the international arena, are geared to \npromote, project and vigorously defend these \ngoals. With all our might and within our \nresources, our people stand united in their \nresolve to ensure that our present population and \nfuture generations enjoy the fruits of peace, \nunity and stability while respecting the dignity \nof the individual in freedom. We extend the hand \nof friendship and co-operation to all nations and \npeoples which are, in turn, willing to do the \nsame to us in good faith.\n218.\tAs we have gathered here for the \nthirty-seventh session of the General Assembly, \nwe cannot help looking back and taking stock of \nthe achievements and failures of the \nOrganization. We are certain that when the \nbalance-sheet is drawn up the results will be \nunmistakably on the side of success. Whenever \nworld peace and security have been threatened, \nthe General Assembly has always exerted maximum \npres\u00acsure in favor of peace, tranquility and \nmutual under\u00acstanding. It is Kenya's sincere hope \nthat the votes cast in the Assembly will continue \nto reflect the general will of the international \ncommunity to maintain peace and security for all \nnations, as well as their resolve to improve the \nwell-being of mankind as a whole. Those who are \nentrusted by the Charter with the maintenance of \ninternational peace should pay more attention to \nthe resolutions that are adopted year after year \nby the Assembly. These resolutions truly reflect \nthe concerns of the world community.\n219.\tI should like first to make a brief \nsurvey of the African scene in the context of the \naims and objectives of the United Nations. When \nmy President addressed the General Assembly at \nthe 11th  meeting of the thirty-sixth session, he \nindicated in his statement that at that time a \nnumber of agreed and concrete steps were being \ntaken to re-establish peace and good order in \nChad. For the steps being taken to succeed in \nrestoring that peace and good order, it was \nneces\u00acsary for those directly concerned \nfaithfully to adhere strictly to, and fully \nimplement in good faith, the established \nprogrammes. Developments since then, however, \nhave shown that lasting peace continues to elude \nthe people of Chad.\n220.\tIn the case of Western Sahara, the way had \nfinally been cleared for a cease-fire agreement \nand the holding of a referendum by means of which \nthe people of the Territory were to determine \ntheir own future, We all know that the events \nwhich ensued led to severe disagreement among \nAfrican countries and that today the OAU stands \npartially paralyzed because of these deep-seated \ndifferences. It is my Govern\u00acment's sincere hope \nthat the ongoing consultations among member \nStates of the OAU will lead to the removal of the \nobstacles now standing in the way of unity in our \ncontinental organization.\n221.\tIn South Africa the tragedy of apartheid \ncon\u00actinues. The racist South African regime seeks \nto per\u00acpetuate its illegal occupation of Namibia \nin defiance of decisions of this body. After \ndecades of condemna\u00action and protests by all \npeace-loving peoples of the world, including some \nwhites in South Africa itself, the evil and \ninhuman system of apartheid Continues to \nflourish, even though it embraces the total \ndenial of political rights to the majority. \nOpposition to apartheid is met with brutal force \nagainst defenseless people, among them children. \nIt is a system which violates all the universal \nprinciples of human dignity on which the United \nNations itself is based; yet all our efforts to \nget stronger action to be taken against South \nAfrica continue to meet with resistance. We have \nadopted in the Assembly countless resolutions \ncondemning the system. We have held many \ninter\u00acnational gatherings which have exposed and \nequally condemned the evil system practiced by \nthe racist minority bent on destroying the very \ntenets of civilized conduct. Are we going to step \nthere?\n222.\tIn pursuance of its policies of seeking \nto per\u00acpetuate racist domination in South Africa \nand to maintain its illegal occupation of \nNamibia, as well as to expand its political \ninfluence beyond its borders, the regime has \nresorted to constant acts of aggres\u00acsion, \nsubversion, destabilization and terrorism against \nneighbouring independent African States.\n223.\tSpeaking in this Hall, our col\u00acleague the \nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Angola out\u00aclined \nin precise terms the extent of the military \naggres\u00acsion carried out by the racist regime of \nSouth Africa against the front-line States and \nthe continuing military occupation by South \nAfrica of large parts of his country, Angola. Was \nthe General Assembly estab\u00aclished to listen \nimpotently to such horror stories of aggression, \nmilitary occupation and deliberate \ndestabilization year after year without \ncorresponding action by the world community to \nput an end to the shame and indignity narrated by \nsuch stories?\n224.\tIn resolution 418 (1977) the Security \nCouncil, in a modest step forward, imposed an \narms embargo against South Africa. The Security \nCouncil decided that the sale of arms to South \nAfrica represented a threat to international \npeace and security. We all know that it is not \nthe sale of arms that represents the threat, for \nSouth Africa is already heavily armed and has a \nsophisticated arms industry of its own. Rather it \nis the regime itself and its policy of apartheid \nthat represents the threat to international peace \nand security.\n225.\tThe time has come when the international \ncommunity must wake up to the gravity of the \nsitua\u00action in this area. There is no longer any \ntime left for ambiguity and for prevarication \nover apartheid, We must therefore urge the \ninternational community, the Security Council and \nparticularly those permanent numbers of the \nCouncil, friends of South Africa, to declare \nwithout any qualification that the situation in \nSouth Africa poses a threat to international \npeace and security under the provisions of \nChapter VII of the Charter,\n226.\tInformation has come to us through the \npublic media to the effect that the racist regime \nis making moves to remove petty apartheid in \npublic places. Let us not be confused by such \ninformation. We have all along been calling for \nthe total eradication of apartheid. My country, \nKenya, will not allow itself to be deceived by \nsuch propaganda. We must reject such deceit. We \nmust remain confident that the struggleto put an \nend to the apartheid system itself will succeed. \nWe must continue to give every assistance \npossible to our freedom fighters in South Africa \nand Namibia in their legitimate struggle under \nthe leadership of their respective liberation \nmovements until final victory is won.\n227.\tIn the 37 years of the United Nations \nhistory voluminous records exist of the illegal \nand brutal occupation of Namibia by South Africa. \nNot content with the illegal occupation, South \nAfrica has converted Namibia into a military \nbase, a spring-board from which it has carried \nout frequent, regular, unprovoked armed attacks \nagainst neighbouring States. South Africa has, \nsince 1966, defiantly resisted every move towards \na peaceful termination of its illegal occupation \nof Namibia. All such proposals have been spurned \nwith impunity by the regime. Indeed, Africa and \nthe entire world community is bound to ask what \nit is that South Africa wants. Four years ago the \nUnited Nations plan for the independence of \nNamibia was adopted by the Security Council in \nits resolution 435 (1978). At the time that \nresolution was adopted, we had hoped that South \nAfrica had regained its senses and was ready to \nco-operate in implementing a peaceful tran\u00acsition \nto independence for Namibia. Our hope has been \nrudely dashed by South Africa's intransigence. \nInstead of moving towards the implementation of \nthe United Nations plan for Namibian independence \nthe regime has resorted to an intensified war \nagainst the liberation forces\u2014the forces of \nSWAPO\u2014and against the neighbouring States, \nparticularly Angola and Mozambique. Has not the \ntime come for the United Nations to act \ndecisively? We say yes and the time is now. Over \nthe years in our negotiations for the liberation \nof Namibia we have been patient. We have shown \nflexibility. We have been reasonable. SWAPO has \nmade significant concessions with regard to the \nunreasonable demands made by South Africa. On the \nother hand, South Africa has taken advantage of \nour patience and moderation and has in fact \nescalated its offensive beyond the borders of \nNamibia.\n229.\tIn our continued commitment to a peaceful \nsolution the Namibian problem, Africa has not \nlost hope m the negotiating machinery despite the \nduplicity shown by South Africa. During the last \neight weeks or so the African contact group has \nbeen negotiating with the five Western States for \nthe implementation of the United Nations plan for \nNamibia's independence according to resolution \n435 (1978). Although these negotiations have been \ngoing on for some time, pronouncements coming \nfrom South Africa offer little proof that it is \nnow ready for the implementation of Namibia's \nindependence as laid down in the United Nations \nplan. Some of those involved in the negotia\u00actions \nsay that South Africa is now ready to comply with \nthe United Nations plan. This is not the first \ntime we have heard this. We must remain cautious \nabout such statements, because while the current \nnegotiations are under way, South Africa \ncontinues its aggression against Angola, \nMozambique, Zimbabwe and indeed against all its \nneighbors. We have every reason for serious \ndoubts of South Africa's sincerity in all these \nnegotiations, given its past history of wrecking \nnegotiations at the eleventh hour. As soon as \nSWAPO makes one concession, South Africa brings \nforward more unacceptable demands to be fulfilled \nas a condi\u00action for making further progress. It \nis therefore not difficult to see the cause of \nour frustration and the reasons for our \nimpatience.\n230.\tBut we must not confuse the issue of \nNamibia's dependence and the territorial \nintegrity of Angola. We should like to make it \nclear, as we have always done before, that the \nproblem regarding Namibia's independence stems \nsolely from South Africa's refusal to get out of \nNamibia, which it con\u00actinues to occupy illegally. \nWe shall not accept pro\u00acpaganda conceived in \nsuper-Power context in order to justify South \nAfrica's presence in Namibia and its continued \naggression against Angola. We view the situation \nwith great concern. By now South Africa should \nknow that its puppets inthe so-called Demo\u00accratic \nTumhalle Alliance have no political support in \nNamibia and cannot win a fair election. These \npuppets will be rejected by the people of Namibia \njust and the puppets of Ian Smith were rejected \nby the people of Zimbabwe. In fact it is this \nfear, the fear of this truth, which frightens the \nracist regime of South Africa.\n231.\tThe international community must face its \nresponsibility in Namibia squarely. We remain \nextremely concerned that the United Nations \nefforts have been frustrated by the use of the \nveto in the Security Council. We have the rather \nanomalous situation where those whose efforts for \nthe inde\u00acpendence of Namibia are being spurned by \nSouth Africa are at the same time those who are \nprotecting South Africa with vetoes against the \nstronger action called for by South Africa's \nintransigence. Something must be done to end that \nanomaly.\n232.\tWe in Africa have come a long way in our \nstruggle to liberate our continent from regimes \nbased on race and colonialism. We will not stop \nin our drive at the border of Namibia. That \nshould serve as a clear message to South Africa \nand its friends.\n233.\tI will now draw the Assembly's attention \nto one of the most dangerous areas on the \ninternational scene today. I refer to events in \nthe Middle East, specifically in Lebanon. The \nsituation in this area has remained tense, with \nviolent conflicts flaring up, over the past three \ndecades and that long-standing conflict is still \nnot resolved. Despite the efforts of the \ninternational community over the years aimed at \nfinding a peaceful solution, intransigence has \nnot given way to compromise. Instead, one \ncommunity has sought to annihilate another \ncommunity. In the past three months, we have all \nwitnessed a new onslaught launched by Israel in \ntotal disregard of all the rules of international \nlaw and morality. Israel arbitrarily and \nmilitarily occupied the sovereign State of \nLebanon, a State Member of the United Nations. \nThe destruction of life that has taken place in \nLebanon leaver us all shocked and horrified, \nparticularly with regard to the recent massacre \nof Palestinian refugees in Beirut. That \nindiscriminate killing of innocent people, \nincluding women and children, in the refugee \ncoups in Beirut is a gross viola on of human \nrights and accepted international law and \nmorality. As my Presi\u00acdent said in his statement \non the tragedy, this callous and barbaric act \nagainst defenseless Palestinians, coming as it \ndid soon after the evacuation of Palestinian \nmilitary personnel from Lebanon, shocked the \ncon\u00acscience of the world and must be vigorously \ncon\u00acdemned by all peace-loving nations. President \nMoi has repeatedly stated that Kenya values human \nlife and will always condemn acts which destroy \nlife. I wish to reiterate here Kenya's conviction \nthat no lasting peace in the Middle East can be \nachieved without due recognition of the \nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people, \nincluding their right to inde\u00acpendence and to a \nsovereign homeland of their own. Once again, \nKenya calls for the immediate withdrawal of \nIsraeli and all other foreign troops from \nLebanese territory, in the interest of peace and \nstability in the region.\n234.\tI wish to make some observations on \nanother matter that continues to be of concern to \nthe Organi\u00aczation. Kenya has supported in the \npast and will continue to support in the future \nthe proposal that the Indian Ocean be designated \na zone of peace. Hence, for us in Kenya, the \nIndian Ocean as a zone of peace is not a \npolitical slogan; rather, it is imperative for \nour own security in our attempts to safeguard our \nterritorial integrity. In this spirit, Kenya \nsupports the call for an international conference \nto consider all the aspects of this problem. We \nurge all the maritime States to co-operate fully \nin the preparations for such a conference.\n235.\tThis regular session of the Assembly is \ntaking place soon after the conclusion of the \nsecond special session on disarmament. I \nexpressed the views of my Government on that \nmatter when I addressed the Assembly at the 19th \nmeeting of the twelfth special session. The \noutcome of that special session will of course be \ninterpreted differently by different \nGovern\u00acments, but in the opinion of my \nGovernment, the results of that session were too \nmeager to confer upon it the label of success. \nMost regrettably, at the second special session \non disarmament held in June and July of this year \nthe Assembly failed to elaborate and adopt a \ncomprehensive program of disarm\u00acament. On \nreviewing the implementation of the \nrecommendations and decisions of the first \nspecial session, at the second special session \nconcrete and practical proposals for removing the \nimpediments to progress in disarmament \nnegotiations could not even be agreed on.\n236.\tThe continuing deterioration of the \ninternational situation and the intensification \nof the arms race have brought the world to the \nbrink of a nuclear catastrophe. In such a \npolitical climate, no progress can be made on \ndisarmament negotiations. We therefore call on \nall States, in particular the nuclear Powers and \nother militarily significant States, to \ndemonstrate the political will and firm \ncommitment necessary for the implemen\u00actation of \nthe recommendations made and the decisions taken \nin the field of disarmament.\n237.\tAs stated earlier, the international \npolitical situa\u00action has not taken a turn for the \nbetter. We are disap-pointed that despite the \nOrganization's call for the withdrawal of \nVietnamese troops from Kampuchea and of Soviet \ntroops from Afghanistan, no movement in that \ndirection has been taken by those concerned. \nSimilarly, the United Nations resolutions on \nCyprus continue to be ignored, and the \nintercommunal talks which we have supported \nappear to be unnecessarily protracted. We also \nnote with continuing disappoint\u00acment and deep \nregret that the conflict between Iran and Iraq \nhas not ended, in spite of intensive efforts from \nmany quarters. We hope that the two non- aligned \nnations will allow good sense to prevail and will \ncease the senseless hostilities that have taken \nsuch a toll in human lives and untold economic \ndisruption. In the same vein, we support the \naspirations of the Korean people for the peaceful \nreunification of their country. In our statement \nto the General Assembly at the 27th meeting of \nthe thirty-fifth session, my delegation expressed \nconcern at the unilateral suspen\u00acsion of the then \nongoing South-North working level contacts by \nNorth Korea and urged the South and the North of \nKorea, the two parties directly con\u00accerned, to \nresume the dialogue immediately in accordance \nwith the letter and spirit of the joint \ncommunique of 4 July 1972 in order to ease \ntension and to improve relations. No progress \nseems to have been made so far, and my delegation \nwould like to renew that appeal.\n238.\tThe Government of Kenya is gravely \nconcerned about the critical situation in which \nthe world economy finds itself today. The effects \nof the deepening reces\u00acsion hurt the developing \ncountries the most, because it is those countries \nthat experience acute problems of balance of \npayments, falling per capita income, rapidly \nrising unemployment and high rates of inflation, \nto mention only a few. Those problems are \nmagnified by the reluctance of the developed \ncountries to acknowledge the importance of \nmultilateral co-oper\u00acation in the solution of \ninternational economic problems. The transfer of \nresources in real terms to developing countries \nhas been steadily declining and the growth of the \ngross domestic product in the developing nations \nhas decelerated to a level of 0.6 per cent from \nan average of 5.5 per cent achieved during the \n1970s. That trend in the world economic situation \npaints a very gloomy picture of the eco\u00acnomies of \nthe developing countries, which are adversely \naffected by external factors.\n239.\tEnergy is undoubtedly an essential \nelement of the development process, but it \ncontinues to be a very serious problem, \nparticularly for developing nations like my own, \nKenya, which are most adversely affected by the \nenergy crisis. The need to shift the dependency \nof nations from petroleum to a greater reliance \non alternative sources of energy was one of the points \nI stressed when I addressed the Assembly on 7 \nOctober 1980. On that occasion, I said, infer for \nIt is our hope that the United Nations \nCon\u00acference on New and Renewable Sources of \nEnergy, to be held at Nairobi in August 1981, \nwill offer the world community a rare opportunity \nto find alternative solutions to our energy \nproblems.\n240.\tAs you will recall, that Conference was \nheld in Nairobi as planned, and its outcome was \nthe Nairobi Programme of Action for the \nDevelopment and Utiliza\u00action of New and Renewable \nSources of Energy.for  As you also know, the \nAssembly last year took some important decisions \non the Nairobi Conference on energy pursuant to \nthe provisions of Assembly resolution 35/204. \nNoteworthy among the actions of the Assembly at \nits thirty-sixth session were the decisions \nconcerning the financial and institutional \narrangements for new and renewable sources of \nenergy, which have to be finalized at this \nsession of the Assembly. The Interim Committee \nestablished pursuant to General Assembly \nresolution 36/193 met in Rome in June of this \nyear, but it did not succeed in its primary task \nregarding the immediate launching of the \nimple\u00acmentation of the Nairobi Programme of \nAction. It is thus clear that at this session the \nAssembly has to take certain fundamental \ndecisions as a follow-up to the Nairobi \nConference on energy. First, we have to decide on \nthe question of mobilization of financial \nresources for harnessing new and renewable energy \nresources. In this regard, the role of the United \nNations must be recognized, and bilateral \narrange\u00acments for raising funds should \nsupplement, but not replace, multilateral \narrangements. Secondly, United Nations activities \ncarried out in implementation of the Nairobi \nProgramme of Action must be well co-ordi\u00acnated. \nIn this connection, my delegation deems it \nnecessary to establish a secretariat which would \nalso service an intergovernmental body, which the \nAssembly should designate, for new and renewable \nenergy sources. The delegation of Kenya stands \nready to participate actively in the discussions \nof this item now and in the future.\n241.\tTurning now to the question of science \nand technology for development, I should like to \nstress again the significance which my Government \nattaches to the strengthening of the capacity of \nthe developing countries in the fields of science \nand technology. We have always been keenly \ninterested and have actively participated at high \ngovernmental levels in international conferences \nand good-will missions constituted to discuss \nissues of science and technology for development, \nespecially of the developing coun\u00actries, because \nwe believe that science and technology are \ncrucial vehicles not only for the implementation \nof the Third United Nations Development Decade, \nbut also for the early attainment of the new \ninter\u00acnational economic order. It is regrettable \nthat, three years after the conclusion of the \nVienna Programme of Action on Science and \nTechnology for Development no substantial \nagreement has been reached on the establishment \nof a permanent United Nations financing system \nfor science and technology for development. My \nGovernment calls urgently for the early \nresolution of the unresolved issues in the Vienna \nProgramme of Action through intensified \nnegotiations within the appropriate United \nNations bodies, including the Intergovernmental \nCommittee for Science and Technology for \nDevelopment.\n242.\tOf particular importance to my country as \na developing nation is the question of economic \nand technical co-operation among developing \ncountries themselves. Kenya has repeatedly called \non developing nations to intensify their \nactivities at subregional, regional and \ninterregional levels and in all fields. It was in \nthis spirit that we participated in the \nformula\u00action and adoption of the Caracas \nProgramme of Action, the implementation of which \nhas been enhanced by the North-South meetings \nheld during this year, which included the meeting \nof the Group of 77 held last month in Manila to \nreview the imple\u00acmentation of the Caracas \nProgramme of Action. In certain regionsalso new \ninitiatives for interregional and subregional \nco-operation have emerged. These have included \nthe intensive negotiations held among 18 \ncountries of eastern and southern Africa, \nincluding my own country, which resulted in the \nsigning in Lusaka, in December 1981 of a treaty \nestablishing a preferential trade area for that \nAfrican region.\n243.\tWith regard to industrial development, we \nwel\u00accome the recommendations of the sixteenth \nsession of the Industrial Development Board and \ncall for their early implementation. We note with \nappreciation the full recognition in the \nIndustrial Development Board's report on that \nsession of the significance of the Industrial \nDevelopment Decade for Africa. As the Assembly \nknows, Kenya will play host to the Fourth General \nConference of UNIDO, in 1984, and the success of \nthat Conference will depend to a large extent on \nthe attitude nations display during the \npreparatory process for it. We there\u00acfore hope \nthat this process will be intensified in order to \nensure positive results from this forthcoming \nUNIDO Conference in Nairobi.\n244.\tWe are aware of the report submitted to \nthe Assembly on the work of the fifth session of \nthe Commission on Human Settlements and of the \ntwo sessions held this year by the Governing \nCouncil of UNEP. The important recommenda\u00actions \nof those sessions need to be implemented, and for \nthat to be done adequate financial resources are \nnecessary. My delegation therefore calls on the \ndevel\u00acoped donor countries, and others in a \nposition to do so, to make substantial \ncontributions towards the implementation of the \nplanned activities in the fields of the \nenvironment and human settlements.\n245.\tKenya would like to see a substantial \nincrease in the trade of developing nations in \nmanufactures. We condemn protectionism in all its \nforms, and we believe that at the sixth session \nof UNCTAD, to be held in 1983, serious attempts \nwill be made to tackle all the critical issues \nencountered by the international community in the \nHeld of trade and development. My delegation \ntherefore calls upon the Assembly to take \nconcrete action at this session to ensure the \nsuccess of the sixth session of UNCTAD.\n246.\tThe critical economic situation facing \nAfrica, which is the least developed of all the \ncontinents, requires concerted international \naction. It was in this spirit that the Lagos Plan \nof Action for the Imple\u00acmentation of the Monrovia \nStrategy for the Economic Development of Africa \nwas adopted. Kenya calls on the international \ncommunity to extend the technical and financial \nassistance necessary for the implemen\u00actation of \nthe Lagos Plan of Action in its entirety.\n247.\tAfrica also faces acute food problems, as \nrecent reports have shown. Food and agricultural \nproduction has drastically declined in recent \nyears, owing, inter alia to changes in climatic \nconditions, inadequate investment in the food \nsector, and lack of storage facilities. The \ninternational community must take urgent \ncollective measures to alleviate the critical \nfood shortages and attain collective \nself-sufficiency in food, to increase food and \nagricultural production, food storage, and food \nsecurity, as well as to increase capital from \nexternal resources. We look forward to greater \nassistance from both bilateral donors and \nmultilateral sources. More assistance from FAO \nand the World Food Council would be greatly \nappreciated, particularly by the food-deficient \ncoun\u00actries of the developing world.\n248.\tI wish now to turn to the issue of \nspecial eco\u00acnomic and disaster-relief assistance. \nMy Government commends the efforts of the Office \nof the United Nations Disaster Relief \nCo-ordinator. We reiterate our full support for \nthe activities of that Office and call on all \ndonor countries to increase their contributions \nto that important body in order to enable it to \ndeal more efficiently and promptly with \ndisasters, wherever and whenever they occur in \nthe disaster-stricken and disaster-prone areas of \nthe world, especially in Africa. The Kenyan \ndelegation will continue to attach special \nimportance to this problem and to participate \nactively ininternational deliberations on it.\n249.\tOne of the historic events of this decade \nhas been the adoption of the Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea. The occasion not only marked the \nemergence of a new legal regime governing the \nexploration and exploitation of the seas, the \nsea-bed, and the ocean floor and the subsoil \nthereof; it also demonstrated clearly the \nimportance of equitable compromise in the \ninterest of all mankind. The Convention has been \nthe result of hard negotiations over a period, of \nmany years, and it is Kenya's hope that even \nthose coun\u00actries which were not able to support \nthe Convention at its adoption will find it \nnecessary and possible to support it in future in \norder to ensure uniformity in its implementation \nand use. We also hope that the same spirit \ndisplayed by nations at the adoption of the \nConvention will be demonstrated by their \nratification of it.\n250.\tIn this and other forums we have \nconsistently condemned the activities of \nmercenaries. In the recent past we have witnessed \nincreased use of mercenaries against the \nterritorial integrity and independence of many \ndeveloping countries. We cannot stress strongly \nenough the need to bring this heinous crime to an \nend through concerted international action. AH \nthose participating in mercenary activities \nbelong to States, and urgent measures are \nrequired to outlaw mercena\u00acries and to stop their \nactivities permanently. Peace- loving people \neverywhere are anxiously awaiting action to \neliminate this heinous crime. We cannot afford to \ndisappoint our peoples.\n251.\tI should like to conclude my remarks by \nreiter\u00acating Kenya's total faith in the \nprinciples underlying the Charter of the United \nNations and our belief that in the end the \nnations of this world will have to swim \ntogether\u2014or sink together.\n"

        "file_text": "This is the sixth time in a quarter of a century \nthat I have had the honor to come to this rostrum \nto defend before the representatives of Member \nStates the interests of my country and its people.\n2.\tToday, as on the last occasion when I \naddressed the Security Council, in 1979,' \nfollowing the occupation of Kampuchea by the \narmed forces of the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam, it is for the very existence of my country \nas a free and sovereign State that I seek to be \nthe spokesman before the Assembly.\n3.\tI wish at the outset to express my most \nrespectful good wishes to the President of the \nAssembly. May I be permitted to salute very \nrespectfully Mr. Kittani, and congratulate him \nvery cordially on the outstanding leadership he \nprovided at the thirty- sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly and on his great ability, sense \nof fairness and integrity I extend respectful \ngood wishes to the Secretary-General, whose high \nsentiments and deep devotion to the cause of \njustice and peace we all admire.\n4.\tMay I be permitted also to salute the \ndelegations present here, amongst which it is my \nhonor and privilege to count many faithful \nfriends, in the name of my country, its Coalition \nGovernment and all patriots who struggle in \nacutely difficult circumstances, but with fierce \ndetermination, for the liberation of their \ncountry.\n5.\tContrary to certain false allegations, \nour Government is not a Government in exile. All \nits members live and fight in the interior of our \nnational territory, side by side with our heroic \nfighters. For, despite the efforts of a powerful \nVietnamese army in control of Kampuchean \nterritory, we have liberated and solidly held \nlarge zones not only near the Thai frontier, but \nalso in several regions of the south-west and the \nnorth-east of our country.\n6.\tLast July I myself visited my compatriots \nin three liberated zones, travelling by car, on \nCoot and on elephant, deep into the interior of \nour country. Everywhere I was welcomed by \nwell-armed and disciplined military units and by \ntens of thousands of civilians, amongst whom I \nhad the satisfaction to note an impressive number \nof little children.\n7.\tMy country and its Coalition Government \nwish to express their profound gratitude to the \nUnited Nations for having, since 1979, rejected \nthe pretensions of the regime installed by a \nforeign Power in our capital, a Power which seeks \nto obtain the seat of Kampuchea in the Assembly's \nmidst. Here everyone \u2014including those who support \nits candidature to this seat\u2014knows that that \nregime has no real existence, that it is under \nthe control of Vietnamese occupying authorities \nand that it depends in everything and for \neverything on the protection of two foreign \nnations.\n8.\tTo recognize the puppet regime of Phnom \nPenh would in fact mean: first, accepting the \npermanent foreign domination of our country, \nwhich has been a Member in its own right of the \nUnited Nations since 1953, and reducing it to the \nposition of a colony of Powers which shamelessly \nviolate the Charter of the United Nations and \ntreat with contempt its resolutions seeking the \nimmediate and unconditional withdrawal of \nforeign forces from our territory; secondly, \ngiving to many other countries\u2014not necessarily \nall of the third world\u2014that are also occupied by \nforeign forces the sad certainty that they are \nforever condemned to an anachronistic \ndomination; and, thirdly, augmenting the state of \ntension and risk of conflict in our region.\n9.\tKampuchea occupies on the geographical \nplane a strategic position of primary importance. \nI have sought in the past to make it a buffer \nState between two categories of State with \nopposing ideologies. We now know that the ravages \nof war have extended from Viet Nam to Kampuchea \nand they threaten to spread even further to the \nwest.\n10.\tIndependent, non-aligned and neutral, \naccepting no foreign bases on its territory, my \ncountry could have constituted a major element in \nthe peace not only of the peninsula, but of the \ntotality of southeast Asia and even of East \nAsia. On the contrary, a Kampuchea becoming a \ncolony and a military base for two expansionist \nand hegemonist Powers constitutes a menace, as \nthe years of the future will prove, to the \nstability, peace, security and progress of \nnations and peoples of the entire region and \ncould well provoke an armed conflict with \nincalculable consequences between the great \nPowers whose interests are in conflict in Asia.\n11.\tAs members of the Assembly know, I have \noften been the object of verbal attacks, of a \nmixture of contempt, sarcasm and abuse on the \npart of the leaders of Hanoi and their allies. I \nshall not reply to those attacks but shall limit \nmyself to recalling that in Asia there certainly \ndid not exist, before 1970, a non- communist \nleader who was more sincerely a friend of Viet \nNam than I was, one who rendered spontaneously \nand voluntarily so much important help to the \nVietnamese patriots of North and South in their \nstruggle for independence in their country.\n12.\tAfter the invasion of my country by the \narmy of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam I \nreminded the leaders of Hanoi of the assurances \nof  eternal gratitude  and promises of \nunswerving respect for the independence, \nneutrality and territorial integrity  of my \ncountry given many times orally and in writing by \nthe leaders of Hanoi, to remind them of their \ncommitments.\n13.\tAt the end of 1979 and the beginning of \n1980 I wrote three long letters to my  friend \nand former  companion-in-arms , Pham Van Dong, \nhead of the Vietnamese Government, to propose \nbilateral negotiations between his Government \nand myself, either in Hanoi or in any other town \nof his choice, in order to resolve peacefully the \ndifferences between our two nations. I stated in \nmy correspondence that, in the event that the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam would agree to \nrestore to Kampuchea its independence and its \nright to self-determination, our Government, \nwhich would result from the popular consensus, \nfollowing free elections held under international \ncontrol, would not fail to establish, on a basis \nof equality, co-operation and friendship with a \nViet Nam that is a neighbor and a brother.\n14.\tI waited in vain during the three years \nfor a sign of good will on the part of Hanoi, \naccepting even accusations made by certain \ncompatriots about my  pro-Vietnamese  indulgence. \nTo my patient efforts in seeking a peaceful \nsolution and re-establishment of mutual \nconfidence by complete neutralization and \ninternational control and guarantees for my \ncountry, the leaders of Hanoi replied, or caused \nreplies to be made, that they would not negotiate \nwith a man  who no longer represented anything , \nwho was  politically finished , and that the \nsituation in Kampuchea was  irreversible .\n15.\tYet today as yesterday, I feel no hatred \ntowards Viet Nam. 1 have never ceased to \nrecognize that the geographical position of our \ntwo countries makes them neighbors to the end of \ntime and that they are, because of this, \ncompelled to understand each other and to listen \nto each other. This understanding, however, can \nbe established only between equals and not \nbetween servant and master.\n16.\tThe present Government of Hanoi does not \naccept this analysis. It has chosen to forget, \nand how quickly, the repeated help that our \npeople and I myself have rendered during a \ncrucial period to the people of Viet Nam in their \nstruggle for independence and reunification. It \nhas also very quickly forgotten\u2014this is even more \nserious\u2014that the support ft has received in this \nstruggle from a large part of the international \ncommunity resulted from the fact that it appeared \nto be the innocent victim of colonialism and \nimperialism. Today, this very Viet Nam, restored \nin its territorial unity and independence, \nindulges, in its turn, in imperialist and \ncolonial rule. It goes so tar in its arrogance \nas to make serious threats against some of the \nneighbouring countries, which quite rightly are \nconcerned about its expansionism.\n17.\tWe have all noticed that in his last tour \nof Southeast Asia, the Minister for Foreign \nAffairs of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has \npermitted himself to issue, in respect of certain \ncountries that he has visited, threats thatare \nhardly veiled, simply because these countries ask \nViet Nam to withdraw its troops from Kampuchea \nand to let the people of Kampuchea regain their \nright to self-determination.\n18.\tThe Vietnamese Minister has accused \ncertain Governments of the member countries of \nthe Association of South East Asian Nations of \ninterfering in the internal affairs of \nKampuchea, but, as we know, it is Viet Nam which \nhas interfered in a shameless fashion in our \ninternal affairs, occupying our country with \nlarge numbers of troops and appropriating to \nitself material parts of our national resources, \nwhereas ASEAN has only asked our occupying Power \nto let Kampuchea become yet once more the master \nof its own destiny.\n19.\tPresident Ho Chi Minh, at whose funeral I \nwas the only head of State present to pay my \nrespects, loved to say that  nothing is more \nprecious than independence and liberty . This \nadage, one now sees, is to be applied, according \nto his successors, only to their own country, \nwhich arrogates to itself the right to confiscate \nthe independence and liberty of its immediate \nneighbors\u2014our country, Kampuchea, and an \nunfortunate Laos\u2014whilst waiting to attack other \nnations which may be militarily weaker.\n20.\tIn so far as Kampuchea is concerned, it \nis clear that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam \nseeks to retain it indefinitely under its heel by \nthe intermediary of a puppet Government which can \nrefuse it nothing.\n21.\tIt is in the face of these facts and in \nthis dramatic context that I find myself \ncompelled to commit myself to a tripartite \ncoalition at this juncture and to join, pacifist \nthough I am, the armed struggle so that our \ncountry may one day become once more master of \nits destiny.\n22.\tThe United Nations was good enough to \nadopt, in 1979, 1980 and 1981, precise and \nunambiguous resolutions showing the way to be \nfollowed to resolve with justice the problem of \nKampuchea, a problem which would not exist but \nfor the greed of Viet Nam on the political and \nterritorial planes.\n23.\tIn 1981 the International Conference on \nKampuchea was held in New York, under the \nauspices of the United Nations; the Declaration \nand resolution of the Conference^ conform to \nequity, justice and the Charter of the United \nNations, as well as to the best interests of \nKampuchea and Viet Nam and to those of the \npeoples of the entire region.\n24.\tThe Coalition Government of Democratic \nKampuchea cannot accept, any more than our \ncompatriots, that another conference should be \narranged by the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, \nwhich profits from the support of the Soviet \nUnion and the allies of that great Power. The \nprimary effect of such a further \nconference\u2014where, naturally, the puppet regimes \nof Phnom Penh and Vientiane would be seated\u2014would \nbe to sidetrack the  situation in Kampuchea  by \ndeclaring it finalized and thereby causing to be \nrecognized de the regime of Heng Samrin, docile \ncreature of Hanoi. Obviously there can be no \nquestion that Democratic Kampuchea and \npeace-loving nations committed to freedom and \njustice would fall into such a trap.\n25.\tIf the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, a \nMember of the United Nations, really wishes to \ncontribute to the return of peace and stability \nin the region, there is no other solution but to \nrespect United Nations resolutions and \nparticipate in the future work of the \nInternational Conference on Kampuchea. It is not \nin any way sufficient to announce, as was done \nrecently by Viet Nam, a  partial retreat  of its \nforces of occupation in Kampuchea in order to \nlessen the tension in our region; the reality of \nsuch a retreat has not been proved. As a matter \nof fact, many fresh troops were recently sent \nfrom Viet Nam into Kampuchea to reinforce the \nVietnamese occupying forces.\n26.\tI repeat that only the complete \nwithdrawal of Vietnamese forces of \noccupation\u2014withdrawal to be followed by free \nelections held under the control of the United \nNations permitting the whole of our people to \ndesignate their deputies, senators, ministers, \nhead of State and political regime\u2014would \nconstitute an honest solution to the problem of \nKampuchea. Aslong as the Socialist Republic of \nViet Nam refuses to take its troops out of \nKampuchea, my Government will oppose with all its \nforce the politics of fail accompli. We know all \ntoo well that for the past three years our \ncountry has been gagged, that all political \nopposition is repressed and that opponents are \nsent to prison or disappear without leaving a \ntrace.\n27.\tChemical weapons, especially toxic gas, \nare frequently used against the resistance \nfighters and the inhabitants of villages which \nhave escaped Vietnamese control. The forces of \noccupation appropriate to themselves ever more of \nthe natural riches and goods of Kampuchea and \nsend a growing number of Vietnamese immigrants to \ncolonize our fertile lands and rivers rich in \nfish but from which the legitimate owners have \nbeen driven away.\n28.\tVietnamese propaganda has strenuously \nsought \u2014and not without success\u2014to make Western \nobservers who are permitted to enter Kampuchea \nbelieve that this country, occupied but not \nsubmissive, enjoys a freedom and a well-being \nwhich it has not known for a long time. This is \nbut a facade denounced by other journalists who \nhave been in the region and who, in spite of \nmultiple obstacles placed in their way, have been \nable to make in-depth studies of the real \nposition.\n29.\tI have been telling representatives that \nthe only option which we have is to take up arms \nto protect our national sovereignty. I know that \nhere and there people mock our struggle and say \nthat we are too weak to challenge the powerful \nVietnamese expeditionary forces. Weak or not, we \nhave the sacred duty to struggle with all our \nstrength against the occupying Power.\n30.\tI would not predict a victory in either \nthe short term or medium term, but I can assure \nrepresentatives that we shall battle on to the \nend, without hate but with an unbreakable \nresolution. Those foreigners who impose their \ndomination on our country and exploit it to their \nprofit will perceive early or late that there \nwill never be peace and that the land of \nKampuchea will heat up ever more under their feet.\n31.\tWe are not making war on the Vietnamese \npeople. We are fighting for peace and the \nrestoration of independence and freedom to our \ncountry which is now reduced to slavery. We do \nnot want a Pax Vietnamica  or a  Pax Sovietica \nbut simply a peace of free men.\n32.\tWe ask nothing from others. We ask but \nrestoration of our national sovereignty and our \nterritorial integrity; and once that is achieved, \nwe solemnly commit ourselves to living in perfect \npeaceful coexistence with all our neighbors\u2014and \nfirst amongst them Viet Nam\u2014as with all other \ncountries which respect us, no matter what their \npolitical and social systems may be. Is that an \nunreasonable demand, an impossible pretension?\n33.\tWe proclaim solemnly before the Assembly, \nin conformity with United Nations resolutions, \nthat as soon as Viet Nam has totally withdrawn \nits troops from Kampuchea all will be possible in \nfriendship between our two countries.\n34.\tWe are ready to sign with Viet Nam a \ntreaty of peace and non-aggression implying \nrecognition and respect for the territorial \nintegrity of the two neighbouring nations within \ntheir present frontiers. This is a just proposal \nthat I make today to the leaders and the people \nof Viet Nam in the name of our Coalition \nGovernment. I am satisfied that, if they would \nbut listen to this appeal of reason, the people \nof South-East Asia, as well as the peoples of the \nwhole world, would feel the most genuine \nsatisfaction\u2014for not only would peace and harmony \nreturn to the Indo-Chinese peninsula but also \npotential major conflicts would thereby disappear.\n35.\tUnfortunately, the reality is that the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam is far from \nseeking to explore the way of reconciliation and \npeace. It seeks to propagate a very curious \nconcept of an international conference charged \nnot to solve the situation in Kampuchea, but  to \nconsider the security, the peace and neutrality \nin South-East Asia .\n36.\tMay I draw to the attention of the \nrepresentatives now present that the \ninternational conference  proposed by the Vietnamese \nwould logically mean side-tracking and avoiding \nthe central issue of Kampuchea, because \ndelegates to such a conference would find \nthemselves, right from the start, required to \nrecognize,\t, the puppet regime of Heng \nSamrin, functioning under the orders of Hanoi and \nMoscow.\n\n37.\tIt seems evident to me, as it must seem \nto you, that no country which loves justice and \nfreedom could, without reneging on its ideals, \nparticipate in such a meeting which has as its \nonly aim to serve the egotistical interests of \ntwo Powers in their expansionist and colonialist \nenterprises.\n38.\tWho, in effect, menaces the security and \npeace and the stability of South-East Asia, if it \nis not Viet Nam which, with the powerful help of \nthe Soviets, has stationed its forces in \nKampuchea, menacing henceforth Thailand and other \npeaceful member countries of ASEAN, as well as a \nnumber of countries further away?\n39.\tIt must be clear that any conference \ninterested in peace and stability in South-East \nAsia must necessarily resolve, as a priority, \nthe  situation in Kampuchea . This done, my \ncountry, having found its independence and its \nfreedom to act, there would remain no problem to \nresolve in South-East Asia, since no country \nadjacent to or a neighbor of independent an/1 \nneutral Kampuchea has anything to fear from us.\n40.\tASEAN, to which I must render my most \nprofound homage for its political sense and its \ncourage, has refused with reason to sign the pact \nof non- aggression that Viet Nam proposes. Such a \npact would have the same disastrous effects as \nthat which was signed in Munich in 1938 by \nChamberlain and Daladier in the hope\u2014tragic \nillusion\u2014of mollifying Hitler and Mussolini. Such \na pact would be but the prelude to further \naggression between countries and peoples who \nsubscribe to it.\n41.\tRepresentatives will understand why no \ninternational conference is imaginable if the \nfirst item on the agenda does not deal with the \nsituation in Kampuchea and does not seek to put \nan end to the occupation and colonization of my \ncountry by Viet Nam, with the multi-faceted \nsupport of the Soviet Union. If this problem is \nnot dealt with and resolved, there is really \nnothing to discuss, there is nothing to be done \nbut to bend the knee before the diktat of Hanoi \nand Moscow.\n42.\tIt would be lamentable to participate in \na Vietnamese conference which will have present \nas representatives of Kampuchea the regime of \nquislings of Phnom Penh put in place by the \nVietnamese leaders and protected by the powerful \nVietnamese army of occupation.\n43.\tTo accept the Vietnamese fail accompli in \nKampuchea would be to accept the law of the \njungle. This  law  is already in force in many \ncountries which tragically today are reduced to \nslavery by a great Power.\n43. States Members of the United Nations\u2014at least \nthose for whom the principles of freedom, \nindependence, justice and peace still \nmatter\u2014must have at heart, I am sure, the need to \ncry  Halt  to the Vietnamese occupation and \ncolonization of Kampuchea by adopting the \nresolutions and in taking measures which would \nrequire Viet Nam, which we once respected, to \nreturn to a sense of honor which, we hope but \nmomentarily, it has so singularly failed in.\n46.\tWe are very conscious of our limitations \nand of the fact that our own problems concern us \nin such absolute priority that we cannot pretend \nto concern ourselves with the problems of others. \nBut as, of course, our country has always been a \nMember of the United Nations, I trust I will be \npermitted to indicate briefly our position on \ncertain problems of major, importance.\n47.\tI would at the outset express the sincere \ngratitude of my country and our people to \nnations which have generously welcomed our \nrefugees and, in the very first place, to the \nKingdom of Thailand, which has carried a very \nheavy burden in the name of duty to humanity in \ngranting a haven of refuge and protection against \nthreats to hundreds of thousands of our \ncompatriots who fled slavery, misery and death. \nI thank equally, with all my heart, the other \ncountries of ASEAN for their active support and \ntheir diplomatic and other assistance to our \ncause.\n48.\tI salute also the other States which have \nwelcomed a large number of our refugees and \npermitted them to escape despair, as well as the \nmany countries which have made generous gifts and \ngiven assistance from which our compatriots have \nbenefited and benefit today. At the same time, I \nsalute and thank the Secretary-General, the \nInternational Red Cross, UNICEF and other \nhumanitarian organizations for all they have \ndone, are doing and will be doing for our \nrefugees and other compatriots in their need.\n49.\tI respect the Vietnamese people, dragged \nagainst their will into a colonialist adventure, \nalthough for many years now they have found \nthemselves plunged into difficulties without \nnumber and from all sides and of all kinds, which \ntheir Government is in any event obliged to \nrecognize, and which have provoked the tragic \nexodus of hundreds of thousands of  boat people .\n50.\tI do not consider that I have a right to \nask the Western Powers to cease providing \nhumanitarian aid to our neighbors, innocent \nvictims of the dreadful conduct of their \nGovernment. But I have the right, in the name of \nthe people of Kampuchea, to ask all countries \nwhich are not accomplices of Vietnamese \ncolonialism forthwith to cease granting to the \nregime of Hanoi financial, economic and material \naid which risk being used not to help the unhappy \npeople of Viet Nam, but inevitably to encourage \ntheir leaders to persevere in their enterprise \nagainst my people and my country.\n51.\tWe reaffirm our total solidarity with our \nbrothers and sisters, the Afghan people, who like \nus are involved in a struggle to enable their \ncountry to exercise again its inalienable right \nto self-determination. We support equally the Lao \npeople, our brothers and sisters, who desire to \nrecover Lao independence and liberty.\n52.\tWe reaffirm our total solidarity with our \nbrothers and sisters, the Palestinian people, who \nare suffering appalling trials for the rebirth of \ntheir country. We continue to recognize \nofficially the Palestine Liberation Organization \n[PLO] as the legal representative of the \nPalestinian people and nation.\n53.\tWe firmly support our brothers and \nsisters, the Korean people, in their legitimate \naspiration for a reunification of their country \nnow divided against its will, and we warmly \nsupport the wise and patriotic proposals of \nMarshal Kim Il Sung, President of the Democratic \nPeople's Republic of Korea, so that the \nreunification may take place through a peaceful \nand independent process.\n54.\tIt is our ardent hope that the two \nbrother countries at present in conflict with \none another, Iraq and Iran, will seek a peaceful \nsolution to their problems and realize, in peace, \ntheir necessary reconciliation.\n55.\tDeeply moved by the unmerited disasters \nand innumerable loss of human lives which Lebanon \nhas suffered\u2014a State which heretofore was the \nSwitzerland of the Near East\u2014it is our ardent \nhope that its sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity will at last be respected and the \nforeign armed forces will withdraw without delay, \nleaving the Lebanese people the opportunity to \nresolve their problems alone.\n56.\tWe renew our fraternal solidarity with \nthe valiant people of Namibia who, under the \nleadership of the South West Africa People's \nOrganization [SWAPO], are waging a just struggle \nfor national liberation against the colonialist \nand racist regime of Pretoria.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like to begin my speech by congratulating you \non behalf of my delegation on your election to the presidency of the \nthirty seventh session of the General Assembly. We are confident that \nyour vast experience, knowledge and personal wisdom will guide our \ndeliberations to a constructive conclusion. May I also express our \ndeep appreciation and thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Kittani, for \nhis excellent performance in discharging the duties of his office. I \nshould also like to extend my delegation's sincere greetings to the \nSecretary General, with the renewed assurances of my Government's \nsupport for his dedicated efforts in upholding the objectives of the \nOrganization. We are meeting at a time of increasing tension and \nanxiety. We are in a situation which demands that serious and urgent \nsteps be taken to prevent any further deterioration in the \ninternational climate and to align the norms of international \nbehavior with the proper human values prescribed in the Charter. The \nneed to strengthen the role of the United Nations in maintaining \nworld peace and security is felt at the present stage more strongly \nthan ever before. We should not allow the opportunity of this meeting \nto pass without effectively renewing our commitments to the \nobjectives of the Organization, and fulfilling the aspirations of our \npeoples. In his remarkable report to the Assembly, the Secretary \nGeneral has very ably diagnosed the world situation, and my \ndelegation fully agrees with him that our prime objective at this \ncrucial moment should be to renew the concept of collective action \nfor peace and security, and to render the United Nations more capable \nof carrying out its primary function. The United Nations was created \nfor the purpose of harmonizing the actions of nations in the \nattainment of common ends and it should effectively remain so with \nthe maximum capacity to safeguard peace and to be a forum for \nresponsible discussions and negotiations between nations. We feel \nalso that the responsibility as well as the authority of the Security \nCouncil in its function as the primary instrument for maintaining \ninternational peace and security should be reconfirmed and further \nstrengthened by all possible means. In this context, my delegation \nwishes to stress the important commitment of the permanent members of \nthe Council and their responsibilities to world peace. It is \nfrightening to imagine a world with no power at all to deal with \nsituations that endanger international peace. The recent military \nadventures in Lebanon and the earlier foreign interventions in \nAfghanistan, Kampuchea and some other countries in Africa and Latin \nAmerica have indeed alarmed the world community regarding the dangers \nof a new international anarchy. Therefore it is of the utmost \nimportance that we seriously and sincerely embark on a process that \nwill free mankind of these fears and anxieties. My delegation feels \nthat we should accelerate our efforts to achieve world disarmament. \nWhile we concentrate on removing the danger of a nuclear war, we \nshould continue with renewed determination our efforts to limit the \narms race and the production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons as \nwell as of other destructive conventional weapons. My delegation will \ncontinue to support the efforts of the world community in the \ndirection of total disarmament, including the safeguarding of outer \nspace, prohibition of nuclear weapon tests and establishment of \nnuclear weapon free zones. The situation in the Middle East remains \nthe most pressing issue on the international scene. The tragic events \nin Lebanon have added new dimensions to the gravity of the problem to \nwhich the Organization has to address itself. And yet the question of \nPalestine the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to self \ndetermination and freedom remains at the heart of the issue. The key \nto any lasting solution and to peace in that crucial area is, as is \nevident from the sequence of recent events, the realization of the \ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to \nhave their own independent homeland. The world has witnessed with \nanger and dismay the Israeli invasion of Lebanon while it continued \nits illegal occupation of other territories, perpetuating its policy \nof expansion through the establishment of illegal settlements, \nignoring and rejecting United Nations resolutions and violating all \nnorms of international behavior. My Government has joined the world \ncommunity in its repeated condemnation of the Israeli aggression \nagainst Arab territories and atrocities in the occupied territories. \nThe invasion of Lebanon under the cruel pretext of liquidating the \nPLO, which symbolizes the legitimate will of the Palestinian people, \nhas clearly revealed the nature of Israeli policies in the area. \nIsrael is not only a radical entity that aims to expand at the \nexpense of other peoples and of their rights, but is also a force \nthat will not hesitate to interfere in the internal affairs of \nsovereign States through occupation, terrorism and even assassination \nin order to achieve unjustifiable objectives. The world community, \nincluding States which continue to sympathize with Israel, should \nnow, in particular after seeing the horrible consequences of its \ninvasion of Lebanon, act firmly to stop the arrogance and \nexpansionism of Israel. Among the central issues of international \nconcern remain the questions of Afghanistan and Kampuchea, two small \ncountries which were subjected to foreign invasion. My delegation \nreiterates its policy of endorsing the United Nations resolutions \nwhich condemn foreign intervention and call for the withdrawal of \nforeign forces from those two countries, allowing the peoples of \nAfghanistan and Kampuchea the opportunity to exercise their own \nrights without outside influence or pressure, including the right of \nrefugees to return to their homes in safety and honor. We welcome the \nefforts of the Secretary General in initiating talks with the parties \nconcerned aimed at finding a political solution to the problems \ninvolved. In the same context and within the framework of the same \nprinciples involved, we look at the events in Africa and Latin \nAmerica in which intervention in the internal affairs of countries \ntook place under different pretexts in the past few years. My country \nis deeply concerned over this trend of military intervention, which \nundermines the orderly and peaceful existence of nations. Among \nissues of grave concern to the Organization and to the world as a \nwhole is the question of South West Africa. The continuation by South \nAfrica of its occupation of Namibia, despite the vigorous efforts of \nthe United Nations to grant independence to that deprived nation, \nconstitutes a flagrant violation of international law and endangers \nworld peace and the stability of the African region. It is our duty \nto continue political and economic pressure on South Africa in our \nefforts to force it to concede to the logic of human realities and to \ncontinue our support to the people of Namibia under the leadership of \nSWAPO. While condemning the occupation of Namibia by South Africa, my \nGovernment reiterates its support to the oppressed people in South \nAfrica itself under its inhuman policy in their struggle for \nequality, justice and dignity. Another question of concern to us is \nthe situation in Cyprus. We are disappointed by the slow progress in \nnegotiations between the parties concerned with the aim of reaching \nan honorable solution to the prolonged internal dispute that will at \nthe same time ensure the rights of the communities and preserve the \nnational and territorial integrity of the country. My country is \nconcerned also about the stalemate in the dialogue between the \npeoples of North and South Korea for the purpose of their peaceful \nreunification. We believe that the international community should \ncontinue its support to the Korean people and encourage them to \ncontinue that process within the framework of their own aspirations, \nfree from outside influence and pressure. In this respect we should \nwelcome all initiatives calling for the resumption of talks between \nthe two sides. We are deeply concerned that thewar between Iraq and \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran continues to rage despite the repeated \nappeals by the world community for a cease fire and for the solution \nof the dispute between those two neighboring countries by peaceful \nmeans. Maldives continues to be guided by a policy of non alignment \nand has always endeavored humbly to contribute its modest share in \norder to strengthen the unity and the charter of the nonaligned \nmovement, in sincerity for peace, friendship and international \ncooperation. Turning to our region and to a question of immediate \nconcern to my country, I wish to confirm our full endorsement of and \nsupport for the proposal to transform the Indian Ocean into a zone of \npeace, not only because of our strong opposition to the presence of \nforeign military bases and facilities in the Indian Ocean but also \nbecause of the awareness of increasing tension in the region and of \nthe strong possibility of their involvement in provoking and \nescalating conflicts in the area. The rivalry among the big Powers \nand their military presence in our own neighborhood divert our \nattention to potential dangers and compel us to exhaust our resources \non otherwise unnecessary security measures, while our limited \nresources are most vitally needed for the promotion of the welfare of \nour peoples and the development of our economies. The efforts to \nimplement the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace must \ntherefore be renewed and continued within the framework of the \nfundamental elements of the Declaration. We feel that the Colombo \nConference should be held on as early a date as possible. It may be \ntrue that the convening of the Conference will not be enough to \nresolve all the problems pertaining to the security of our region. \nHowever, we are convinced that the meeting will contribute to the \nfavorable development of the concept and improve the climate in the \nregion. My country is indeed glad to note the successful conclusion \nof the negotiations at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law \nof the Sea with the adoption of a comprehensive Convention on the Law \nof the Sea which reflects the expectations of the world community. It \nis our hope that the acceptance of the Convention by all the States \nMembers of the United Nations will become a reality as soon as \npossible. My delegation believes that the Convention will be an \nextremely important instrument far the promotion of a peaceful and \norderly discipline in ocean affairs as well as for the exploitation \nof the immense resources of the sea and the sea bed in a better and \nmore dignified manner, which would be beneficial for mankind as a \nwhole. While we focus our attention on the critical developments on \nthe international political scene, we find that further deterioration \nand serious erosion is taking place in multilateral economic \nrelations mainly due to the failure of some of the developed \ncountries to understand the inevitability of interdependence. My \ndelegation feels that the concept of global negotiation should be \nfurther pursued and that new initiatives should be undertaken to \naccelerate our effort to establish a new international economic \norder. Meanwhile we should continue our multilateral negotiations at \nthe sectorial levels within and outside the specialized world bodies. \nThe process should not be allowed to slow down under the pressure of \nthe still existing obsessions of protectionism and adverse national \npolicies. We should sincerely and collectively address ourselves to \nall the stresses and strains of the entire economic system of the \nworld, which extend beyond the relationship between North and South. \nMeanwhile we are convinced that the promotion of measures for \ncollective self reliance among the developing countries is now more \nindispensable than ever. In this regard we endorse the outcome of the \nmeeting of the Intergovernmental Follow Up and Coordination Committee \non economic cooperation among developing countries held in August in \nManila. As one of the least developed countries of the third world, \nMaldives was happy to note the positive responses from many ofthe \ndeveloping countries to the recommendations of last year's Paris \nConference. For our part, we shall try to demonstrate to the donor \ncountries and to our friends all over the world that we are sincere \nand serious in our efforts to develop our country and to emerge from \nthe bracket of underdevelopment to an appropriate stage of steady \nnational growth. We sincerely hope that the recommendations of the \nParis Conference will be followed up effectively, and we look forward \nto the round table meetings scheduled to take place in the near \nfuture in the earnest hope that they will produce positive results. \nIn conclusion I should like to reaffirm my country's faith and trust \nin the Organization as the instrument with the most potential for \nmaintaining peace and security in the world and fulfilling the \naspirations of mankind to justice and prosperity. We are bound by \nserious constraints and difficulties. We are more often faced with \nfrustrating situations such as that through which we are passing \ntoday. However, our faith and trust in the noble principles enshrined \nin the Charter of the United Nations demand of us that we renew our \ncommitments and continue our efforts to strengthen the role of the \nOrganization in fulfilling the lofty objectives of the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "I convey to the President Mr. Schmidt's and the \nFederal Government's congratulations on his \nelection. At the same time, I should like to \nthank the President of the thirty-sixth session \nof the General Assembly for his good work during \nthat session.\n100. The Federal Government also conveys its best \nwishes to the Secretary-General. He is faced with \ngreat and difficult tasks. As we have seen, he \ntackles those tasks with great skill and \nresolution and with a sense of reality which also \nembraces an awareness of the great influence that \nan international organization like the United \nNations and the Secretary-General are able to \nexercise on political events. During the first \nyear of his term of office, he has already \nrendered great services through his exemplary \ndedication to the cause of strengthening the \nimage of the United Nations and preserving peace \nworldwide.\n101. The conflicts throughout the world have not \nbecome fewer but have increased. They have become \nfiercer and more Moody and a greater threat to \nworld peace. Thousands of people have become the \nvictims of military and internal confrontation in \nLebanon, Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf, southern \nAfrica, South Asia, the South Atlantic and \nCentral America.\n102.\tHunger and want are growing in a word in \nwhich nation\u2019s economies are feeling the impact \nof a con-tinuing recession\u2014to the limits of their \ncapacity and no small number of them\u2014even more \nseriously. Every day people lose their jobs; \npeople in North and south, in East and West \nalike, are increasingly concerned at how things \nare to continue. This, too, poses a great threat \nto international co-operation, not only to \ndomestic harmony but also ultimately to \ninternational peace.\n103.\tAt the same time, armories are \noverflowing with deadly weapons of an \ninconceivable destructive power. The arms spiral \nappears to be never ending, and many people fear \nthat it could turn faster and faster and finally \nget completely out of control. In 1981 world-wide \nspending on arms and other military equip\u00acment \nfbr the first time exceeded $600 billion. This \ncorresponds to 6 per cent of the world's total \ngross national product. It amounts, per capita of \nworld population, to expenditure of over $100 per \nannum, yet many people in the world do not even \npossess $100.\n104.\tIn 1980 expenditure on arms production \nworld\u00acwide was many times greater than the total \nvalue of all official development aid provided by \nthe indus\u00actrialized nations, and, according to \nestimates by the International Institute of \nStrategic Studies in London and the Development \nAssistance Committee of the Organization for \nEconomic Co operation and Develop\u00acment, the \nmembers of the latter spend about 10 times as \nmuch on armaments as on development aid and the \nCouncil for Mutual Economic Assistance countries \neven 100 times as much. These facts prompt one to \nquestion the sanity of the international \ncommunity. Through our conduct we are all \ninvolved in this collective insanity; we must all \ntry to master it.\n105.\tThe second special session of the General \nAs\u00acsembly devoted to disarmament became the \nmouth\u00acpiece of the fears of our nations. Its \nvoice was heard, but it has still not carried far \nenough.\n106.\tGovernments must indeed face up to the \nquestion of whether they have until now lived up \nto their responsibility for world peace. They \nhave to accept the urgent and very anxious \nquestion of whether the weapons systems that are \naccumulating can ultimately be controlled by man; \nthey must also face up to the question of how \nthey intend to justify annually increasing \ninvestment in arms in view of the hunger and want \nexisting in the world, and in view of the growing \nhardship caused 6y the economic crisis.\n107.\tAs Chancellor Schmidt said at the 10th \nmeeting of the twelfth special session, the \nsecond special session devoted to disarmament \nthe driving force that has become apparent in the \nunrest of many of our fellow citizens must be \nregarded as a motivation and a moral obligation \nfor us.\n108. It is not sufficient to ascertain the causes \nof the threat to peace, nor is it sufficient to \ndevelop mere ideas on how to eliminate them. What \nis also needed is a firm and resolute will and \nability to reach agree\u00acment on better ways and \nmeans of safeguarding peace.\n109.\tAs Pope John Paul II said in his peace \nmessage at the beginning of 1980:  Without the \nreadiness for a sincere and lasting dialogue \nthere can be no peace.  The safeguarding of peace \nis a never-ending task. It is an illusion to \nbelieve that peace is a condition that can be \narrived at once and for all and then preserved \nand to believe that the causes of threats to \npeace can be eliminated permanently everywhere. \nThese causes become more numerous every year. Our \nconstant and unflagging efforts are needed to \nlimit them, to try to defuse them, to establish \neffective rules for co-operation and hence \nprevent the interna\u00actional community from \nrelapsing into self-destructive anarchy.\n110.\tPeople speak of crisis management. By \nthis they mean the attempts to detect as early as \npossible individual major or minor crises, to \ncurb them resolutely and effectively and, if \npossible, eliminate them completely. This is \nindeed a necessary, sincere and undoubtedly \nhighly difficult task, serving the purpose of \nsafeguarding peace.\n111. We must not content ourselves with this, \nhow\u00acever. We do not need just crisis management; \nwhat we need is a realistic peace strategy. For \nthis we require a return to the principles of the \nCharter, to the norms of international relations \nwhich the United Nations has established and to \nwhich we have all committed ourselves.\n112.\tWe must take seriously the precept of the \nrenunciation of force or the threat of force in \ninterna\u00actional relations. This comprehensive \nproscription of force, enshrined in the Charter, \noutlaws any form of attack and applies to the use \nof all types of weapons. Our aim must be to \nprevent all conflicts and to renounce the use of \nall weapons. In its declaration at the summit \nmeeting on 10 June 1982, the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization [M4 TO] reaffirmed that none \nof its weapons world ever be used except in \nresponse to an attack.\n113.\tWe must create peace through respect for \nthe independence of all countries, respect for \ngenuine non-alignment and respect for the right \nof all nations to self-determination.\n114.\tWe must create peace by establishing \ngreater security for all countries. If we see \nsecurity policy as a policy for world-wide peace, \nas indeed we must, we must also realize that \nsecurity cannot be established through rivalry, \nby constantly satisfying exaggerated security \nneeds through further arms build-up, by aspiring \nto supremacy, or by provocative and ulti\u00acmately \ndangerous gestures to indicate one's strength. AH \nthis simply results in an expansion of the \narmories on all sides.\n115.\tGreater security for all countries will \nexist only if we, by collaborating across \nalliance frontiers and ideological barriers, \nstrive for agreed security, for codified \nequilibrium at the lowest possible level.\n116.\tAn arms race cannot lead to equilibrium \nand stability; only agreed arms control and \ndisarmament are conducive to that goal. They must \nbe supple\u00acmented by a policy of dialogue and \nco-operation among States, both regionally and \nworldwide. For precisely that reason, existing \nlinks and contacts must not be disrupted but must \nbe maintained, particularly in difficult times. A \nlack of communication leads to \nmis\u00acinterpretations of the other side's \nintentions and hence to wrong action being taken.\n117.\tBut peace can be lasting and dialogue and \nco\u00acoperation have substance only if our own \ninterests are defended with moderation and \nrestraint, if the other side's interests are \nperceived and acknowledged as well and if \ncalculability and reliability prevail. \nFurther\u00acmore, peace in the world can be \nsafeguarded in the long run only if the gap \nbetween the rich and the poor does not become \neven greater and we try to eliminate it through \ngenuine partnership between North and South. To \nthis end, one of our most important tasks is to \nprevent the world economy from falling apart, \nwhich would not only result in the poor becoming \neven poorer but also constitutea threat to peace, \nperhaps even as great as the accumulation of \nweapons threatening human life.\n118.\tWhen the then Federal Chancellor, Mr. \nWilly Brandt, addressed the General Assembly, at \nthe twenty-eighth session, as the first \nrepresentative of the Federal Republic of Germany \nhe said  we have come to assume our share in the \nresponsibility for world affairs on the basis of \nour convictions and within the framework of our \npossibilities . We have honored that commitment \nover the years.\n119.\tLocated in the heart of Europe, we have \nmany neighbors, in East and West, in southern \nEurope and in Scandinavia, and we want to be a \ngood neighbor to all of them. As a member of the \nEuropean Community and as a partner in NATO we \nare helping to preserve and strengthen peace and \nstability, par\u00acticularly in Europe.\n120.\tWe declare our full support for what the \nDanish representative, speaking as its President, \nstated at the 8th meeting, on behalf of the \nEuropean Community. The European Community and \nthe way its member States live and work together \nwill always provide con\u00acvincing proof that a \nlasting peaceful order based on the closest \nco-operation and partnership is indeed feasible, \neven in a region where for centuries there have \ntime and again been rivalry, confrontation and \nwar.\n121.\tThe European Community and NATO are based \non firm, shared interests and on identical \nconcepts of democracy and freedom. A policy of \ngood-neighborliness, however, must be effective \nalso beyond ideo\u00aclogical, military and strategic \nfrontiers.\n122.\tGermany is a divided country at the \ninterface between East and West. Confrontation \nbetween East and West harms us Germans most of \nall. Co-operation with the Soviet Union, Poland, \nCzechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic \nand the treaties concluded with them have been \nbeneficial to us and others. They have created a \nmodus Vivendi that has rendered the situation in \nEurope stable and made peace there more secure. \nThis policy was made possible only by the \nexistence of NATO and its defense capability and \nby the Federal Republic of Germany's contributing \nfully to NATO.\n123.\tWe intend to adhere to that policy of \nco\u00acoperation, but we have to admit that East-West \ntension has increased. The reasons for this are \nthe Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the events in \nPoland and in particular the Soviet arms \nbuild-up. In particular, the Soviet build-up of \nintermediate-range nuclear weapons poses a deadly \nthreat to us.\n124.\tAfghanistan, a small nation, has now been \nholding out for three years against a highly \narmed invading army. The continuing fighting has \nexacted a high toll of lives. Over 20 per cent of \nthe Afghan population has now fled its home \ncountry. The situa\u00action in Kampuchea is similar. \nWe demand an end to the use of force and an end \nto the suffering; we demand peace and \nself-determination tor the Afghan and Kampuchean \npeoples.\n125.\tThe Federal Government has been following \nthe developments in Poland with very deep \nconcern. We expect Poland to settle its internal \naffairs on its own without external interference \nand to return\u2014as pledged by the Polish leaders \nthemselves\u2014to a situation without martial law and \nwithout internees and par\u00acticularly to a dialogue \nwith the trade unions. There can be no \nstabilization in Poland while the present \ndeadlock continues.\n126.\tI should like to add this. Germans and \nPoles have both endured much suffering in the \npast. They have not always treated each other \njustly, and we Germans know that the Second World \nWar started on 1 September 1939 with the invasion \nof Poland. Both sides have nevertheless\u2014or \nperhaps precisely for that reason\u2014shown courage \nand a readiness for under\u00acstanding. The Warsaw \nTreaty in particular and the agreements of 1975 \nare testimony to this. I am both pleased and \nproud that this readiness for understanding is \nquite clearly not confined to the Governments, \nfor millions of Germans has expressed in a \ntangible manner and on a very large scales their \nheartfelt readi\u00acness to help. Although the \ntreaties were initially an important act between \nGovernments, I feel that now especially the \nPolish people, in the oppression they are \nsuffering, have become conscious of our desire \nfor reconciliation.\n127.\tPrecisely at this time when East-West \nrela\u00actions have become more difficult we want to \ndo every\u00acthing possible to ensure that there will \nnot be a policy of confrontation. For us Germans \nin particular there can be no such confrontation. \nOur purpose is, as the Bonn Declaration of NATO \nof June 1982, states,  to develop substantial and \nbalanced East-West rela\u00actions aimed at genuine \ndetente .\n128.\tChancellor Helmut Schmidt and General \nSecre\u00actary Erich Honecker, at their meeting at \nLake Werbellin on 13 December 1981, reaffirmed \ntheir conviction that war must never again \noriginate on German soil. But Germany also must \nnever again be devastated by war. All Germans \nare, therefore, particularly aware of the \nobligation to help preserve peace in Europe. At a \ntime when East-West relations have become \ndifficult, German-German relations must not give \nrise to addi\u00actional strains. We shall therefore \nendeavor to keep these relations in as good a \ncondition as possible and to improve them \nwherever feasible.\n129.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany, which \nurges respect for the right to self-determination \neverywhere in the world, demands this right for \nthe German people as well. It therefore remains \nour political aim to work for a state of peace in \nEurope in which the German nation will regain its \nunity through free self- determination. We \nrealize that this goal cannot be attained in the \nshort term. It is therefore all the more \nimportant to seek improvements in our relations \nthrough dialogue and negotiation.\n130.\tThe policy of concluding agreements has \nalso proved valuable for Berlin. Detente and \nconflict management have had a positive effect in \nthis context in particular. Strict observance and \nfull application of the Quadripartite Agreement \nof 2 September 197 P remain the most reliable \nguarantee for a continuance of its stabilizing \neffects.\n131.\tThe Federal Government continues to \nregard economic co-operation with all countries \nof the world as a major factor of international \nstability, also and in particular in relations \nwith the East. A continuous trade war waged to \nachieve political goals would be both unwise and \nineffective. It is of special concern to us in \nthis context to be and to remain a reliable party \nto agreements. Existing agreements must be \nhonored also in difficult times for which they \nare intended as well.\n132.\tIn about a month's time the deliberations \nof the follow-up meeting in Madrid to the \nConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe \nwill be resumed. We attach particular importance \nto that meeting. For us, the process of that \nConference remains an essential facto: for \nshaping East-West relations and for pro\u00acmoting \ndisarmament and security in Europe. The people in \nEurope have derived tangible benefits from the \nHelsinki Final Act/ although their hopes have by \nno means been fully met. Setbacks can occur in a \nlong-term policy for safeguarding peace. They are \na bitter experience for those affected. But \nprecisely then it is essential to use the \ninstruments available and try to return to a \npolicy of reason. Implementation of all parts of \nthe Final Act, as we demand, can make a major \ncontribution towards improving East-West \nrelations and stabilizing peace in Europe. In \nMadrid we are aiming at a precise mandate for a \nconference on disarmament in Europe as part of a \nbalanced final document.\n133.\tA decisive step for safeguarding peace in \nEurope was taken last November when the dialogue \nbetween the two super-Powers was resumed and \ntalks on intermediate-range nuclear forces \ncommenced at Geneva. Let me add a remark in this \ncontext. In the present difficult phase of \nEast-West relations, it would be good\u2014of this \nChancellor Schmidt is con\u00acvinced\u2014if the two \nleaders of the United States and the Soviet Union \ncould have direct talks with each other.\n134.\tThe Bonn Declaration of NATO reaffirmed \nthe central elements of our security policy, \nnamely, deterrence and defense capability, on the \none hand, and disarmament and arms control, on \nthe other. Disarmament and arms control are vital \nissues and an integral part of our security \npolicy serving the cause of peace. It is \nessential to give our peoples the con\u00acfidence \nthat our security policy can indeed safeguard \npeace. It is not sufficient to talk about \ndisarmament. People in East and West alike want \nto see tangible results at last.\n135.\tIn his recent state of the nation \naddress, Chancellor Schmidt quoted General \nRogers, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, \nwho said:  I am convinced that the only pathway \nto a future for the kind of world we want leads \nto the negotiating table. We must negotiate on \ndisarmament and arms control, on all kinds of \nforces and weapons. This is the only way to stop \nthe arms race on both sides.\n136.\tOn the basis of the comprehensive \nproposals on arms control and disarmament \nnegotiations made to the Soviet Union by the \nUnited States of America at the NATO meeting in \nBonn, we support the idea of purposive, \npersevering and intensive talks aimed at \nachieving concrete results. First, we want a \ngenuine reduction in strategic nuclear weapons in \nEast and West. The American proposals for \nsubstantial reductions in the Soviet and American \narsenals of strategic weapons by means of \nstrategic arms reduction talks have aroused new \nexpectations worldwide of a turning-point in \ndisarma\u00acment policy. We welcome the fact that \nthose two coun\u00actries are endeavoring at Geneva to \nnegotiate not only on limitations but also on \nsubstantial reductions of their intercontinental \nweapons.\n137.\tSecondly, we want land-based \nintermediate- range nuclear missiles to be \neliminated. The proposal made to the Soviet Union \nby the United States at the Geneva talks that \nboth sides completely renounce a category of \nweapons regarded as a particular threat by them \nholds out the prospect of a major first step \ntowards disarmament and hence of eliminating the \nthreat felt by us in Europe owing to the build-up \nof Soviet intermediate-range missiles. These \nnegotiations which are being resumed in Geneva \ntoday are especially important to us.\n138.\tBy ratifying the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons resolution \n2373, we Germans have undertaken never to possess \nnuclear weapons. The Federal Government therefore \nfeels all the more justified in demanding time \nand again that the nuclear Powers, too, honor \ntheir commitments under the Treaty.\n139.\tThirdly, we want a codified comprehensive \nban on all chemical weapons. My country, which \nfor years now has committed itself to this \nquestion with particular dedication, recently \nsubmitted realistic and acceptable proposals for \nreaching agreement on reliable means of verifying \ncompliance with a treaty banning chemical \nweapons. I appeal to all Members of the United \nNations to examine those proposals carefully.\n140.\tFourthly, we want the force levels in \nCentral Europe to be reduced. Europe has the \nworld's largest concentration of mutually opposed \nconventional armed forces. Progress at the Vienna \nTalks on Mutual Reduc\u00action of Forces, Armaments \nand Associated Measures in Central Europe is \ntherefore of particular impor\u00actance to us, living \nas we do at the centre of this region.\n141.\tFurthermore, a conference on disarmament \nin Europe must agree on confidence-building \nmeasures for the whole of Europe, from the \nAtlantic to the Urals, which serve to make \nmilitary potentials and activities in Europe more \ntransparent and help to reduce in the long term \nnot only mutual fear but also the danger of \nunintentional military escalation.\n142.\tOur special responsibility in Europe, in \nthe European Community and in NATO does not mean \nthat the Federal Republic of Germany can remain \nindifferent to crises in other parts of the \nworld. On the contrary, we know that, just as \ndevelopments in Europe would quickly have effects \non other regions of the world, problems in other \nparts of the world, how\u00acever distant, can also \nhave direct repercussions for us. We not only \nwitness these repercussions but we also feel them \nphysically, especially in view of the fate of the \npeople directly affected.\n143.\tThe Federal Government is following the \ndevelopments in the Middle East with particular \nconcern. The assassination of the Lebanese \nPresident-\u00acelect, Bashir Gemayel, and the \nhorrifying massacre in the Palestinian refugee \ncamps have once again rendered the achievement of \npeace in the Middle East more difficult. The \nFederal Government, like its\nEuropean allies, strongly condemns these criminal \nacts, ft demands effective measures to protect \nthe civilian population, as well as an \nindependent inquiry. It hopes that the renewed \ndeployment of a multina\u00actional force will help to \nput an end to the violence and murders. The \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the \ncountry must be restored as quickly as possible, \nalong with its constitutional institutions. This \nrequires the swift withdrawal of all troops \nstationed in the country against the will of the \nLebanese Government. The Federal Government also \nhopes that all political forces in Lebanon will \nunite to reconstruct the country and that, by \nexercising restraint; further acts of violence \ncan be prevented.\n144.\tPeace and stability in the Middle East \ncan be ensured only through a comprehensive, just \nand lasting peace settlement. Such a settlement \nrequires the participation of all parties in the \nregion, including the PLO. It must be based on \nthe principle of security for all States in the \nregion, including Israel. It must be based on \njustice for all peoples, including the \nPal\u00acestinians, who are entitled to \nself-determination. Finally, it must be based on \nmutual recognition of all the parties concerned.\n145.\tThe Federal Government therefore welcomes \nthe new initiative by President Reagan as an \nimportant step to reconcile the rights of the \nparties concerned. The Federal Government has \nalso noted with satisfac\u00action that at the Twelfth \nArab Summit Conference, at Fez, almost all Arab \ncountries for the first time agreed on a policy \nfounded on peace between all countries in the \nregion. The Federal Government appeals to \nevery\u00acone concerned to seize the opportunity for \na new start and make every effort for a \ncomprehensive peace settlement.\n146.\tThe policy of suppressing the black \npopulation in South Africa and of racial \ndiscrimination is not only a grave violation of \nhuman rights. It could also lead to internal \nconfrontation with destructive effects for the \ncountry and the entire region.\n147.\tNamibia must at last acquire its \nindependence in 1983 through free elections on \nthe basis of Security Council resolution 435 \n(1978). Lasting peace in Africa can only be \nexpected if the countries of this continent are \nable to determine their lot on their own and free \nfrom pressure by alien Powers. The presence of \nforeign troops impairs any efforts to resolve \nconflicts by peace\u00acful means.\n148.\tThe Federal Government welcomes the \npro\u00acposals by the President of the Republic of \nKorea to reduce the tension h his divided country \nthrough dialogue and negotiation and to bring \nabout the peaceful reunification of North and \nSouth Korea.\n149.\tThe Federal Government urged a peaceful \nsettlement of the conflict in the South Atlantic \nfrom the very outset. We welcome the first \nconstructive steps aimed at normalizing relations \nbetween the United Kingdom and Argentina. A \npermanent solution to this dispute can be found \nonly through political dialogue and political \nnegotiations.\n150.\tOne of the prime goals of the Federal \nGovern\u00acment continues to be to maintain its \nlong-standing, close and good relations with \nLatin American coun\u00actries. The Federal Government \nfeels that the forth\u00accoming admission to the \nEuropean Community of Portugal and Spain can help \nstrengthen the Com\u00acmunity's relations with Latin \nAmerica even further.\n151.\tWe strongly support efforts to ensure \nthat all countries respect the principle of \nnon-alignment. We seek to promote and safeguard \nnon-alignment through our development policy \nbased on partnership. The Federal Republic of \nGermany encourages regional co-operation in the \nthird world which serves to strengthen stability, \nindependence and peace.\n152.\tThe Federal Government also fully supports efforts designed to secure \nworld-wide implementation of the principle of the \nrenunciation of force and of curbing the arms \nrace, as well as agreements on \nconfidence-building measures. It also directly \nbacks up such efforts with initiatives of its \nown. We hope that the United Nations will take up \nand develop further our proposals for a code of \nconduct on confidence-building measures, which we \nsubmitted at the second special session devoted \nto disarmaments We expect the international \nsymposium on confidence- building measures \nscheduled to be held in the Federal Republic of \nGermany next year to provide further impulses for \nthe development of such measures, which \nconstitute an instrument of peace policy of \nworld\u00acwide importance.\n153.\tSince the beginning of the last session \nof the General Assembly many thousands of people \nhave had to flee their home countries or have \nbeen expelled from them. We must not permit a \nsituation in which millions have to leave their \ncountries temporarily or even permanently to seek \nrefuge elsewhere. The basic consensus on the need \nfor suitable preventive meas\u00acures achieved at the \nlast session represents i first step towards \nimproving co-operation between coun\u00actries and \ninternational institutions to avert new flows of \nrefugees. We should preserve this consensus. The \nGroup of Governmental Experts on International \nCo\u00acoperation to Avert New Flows of Refugees \nshould take up its work as soon ac possible.\n154.\tIn view of the numerous violations of \nhuman rights throughout the world, it is not \nsufficient to profess good intentions. We must \ncontinue to work seriously and with perseverance \nto improve the international protection of human \nrights. The Govern\u00acment of the Federal Republic \nof Germany deems it necessary to establish an \ninternational court of human rights for this \npurpose, and we attach particular importance to \nour initiative on the world-wide abolition of \ncapital punishment. We know that, owing to \ndif\u00acferent legal traditions and religious \nconvictions, many countries may view this \nquestion different^. We advocate, however, that \ncountries which desire the abolition of capital \nPunishment should say so, also internationally, \nand they should say it clearly and in a way that \nbinds them.\n155.\tThe world economy is in poor health. This \nposes a grave threat to stability and peace. At \nthe same time, the prospects of eliminating \nhunger and want are more unfavorable than ever. \nAgainst the background of high interest rates \nthere is a continuing recession in industrial \ncountries. Unemployment rates are rising as a \nresult. We are also witnessing a decline in \ninterna\u00actional trade and growing protectionist \npressure. These developments are detrimental to \nus all, particularly the countries of the third \nworld.\n156.\tAs a result of lower commodity prices, a \ncon\u00actinually high burden caused by the cost of \noil imports and high, fluctuating interest rates, \ndeveloping coun\u00actries' opportunities for \nborrowing are limited. High debt-servicing \ncharges are a strain on their economies, \nstretching them to the limits of their capacity, \nor even beyond in some cases. Industrial and \ndeveloping coun\u00actries must co-operate in a spirit \nof partnership in order to restore stable growth \nand development in the world economy. The \nexisting international organizations, such as the \nInternational Monetary Fund [IMF] and the Word \nBank must be kept effective.\n157.\tAnother major task will be to preserve \nfree trade and capital flows. No country should \nignore the commitments it has assumed under GATT. \nAnyone who jeopardizes GATT aggravates the \nworld's eco\u00acnomic depression.\n158.\tFurthermore, in view of falling commodity \nprices we need a world-wide system to stabilize \nexport earnings.\n159.\tWe shall of course seek to increase our \nofficial aid further within the limits of \navailable funds. Despite the difficult economic \nsituation, considerable bud\u00acgetary problems, a \ndecline of 0.3 per cent in its gross national \nproduct and a high deficit on current account, \nthe Federal Republic of Germany provided official \naid worth 7.2 billion deutsche marks in 1981, or \n0.46 per cent of our gross national product\u2014its \nbiggest amount yet.\n160.\tHowever, in this situation the developing \ncoun\u00actries will themselves have to make even \ngreater efforts. Economy, a prudent use of \navailable capital and a cautious debt policy are \ncalled for. Develop\u00acment policy will have to be \nfocused on particular fields, above all the \npromotion of agriculture in the third world, \nsince this is the sector that determines the \neconomic growth and the food supply of many third \nworld countries.\n161.\tEmphasis must also be placed on the \nenergy sector. For many developing countries the \ncosts of energy supplies have become an almost \nintolerable burden. Consequently, this is a \npriority area of develop\u00acment aid afforded by the \nFederal Republic of Germany. It is in our view \nalso a contribution to the Nairobi Programme of \nAction for the Development and uti\u00aclization of \nNew and Renewable Sources of Energy, adopted by \nthe United Nations Conference on New and \nRenewable Sources of Energy.\n162.\tEnvironmental protection must also be \nseen as an important area of co-operation and we \nmust prevent man from destroying the basis of his \nown existence by recklessly polluting the \nenvironment and exhausting valuable resources. \nMuch important work has to be done in this \nrespect.\n163.\tFinally, we must not forget that the \ngrowth of the world population can overtake and \nnullify all our efforts to ensure greater \ninternational economic stability.\n164.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on \nthe Law of the Sea has made an historic attempt \nto develop an international regime for the use of \nthe world's oceans. The Federal Government played \nan active and constructive part in this. \nAdmittedly, the results have not lived up to our \nexpectations in every respect. In addition to \ncertain satisfactory provisions, there are \narrangements on future deep-sea mining which make \nit hard Mr us to decide in favor of signing the \nCon\u00acvention. We find it most regrettable that the \nCon\u00acference was not able to produce results \ncapable of commanding a consensus. The Federal \nGovernment will take a decision on whether to \nsign the Convention after careful consideration \nand close consultation with other participants in \nthe Conference.\n166. It is of decisive importance for \nco-operation in good faith between industrial and \ndeveloping countries that the dialogue between \nNorth and South should not be disrupted. We have \nunanimously decided to conduct global \nnegotiations on the subjects of raw materials, \nenergy, trade, development, monetary matters and \nfinance. Together with its partners in the \nEuropean Community, the Federal Republic of \nGermany urges that these negotiations be started \nnow. At the economic summit in Versailles a \nconstructive position on a resolution on the \ncommencement of global negotiations was \nformulated and has since been endorsed by all the \nmember countries of the Organ\u00acization for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development. Agreement \nmust now be reached on the early com\u00acmencement of \nglobal negotiations\n167. All too often in past decades the hopes \nplaced in the United Nations have not been \nfulfilled. But we must not overlook the fact that \nthe United Nations can be no stronger than the \npolitical will of all its Members to work \ntogether responsibly in the spirit of the \nCharter. Those that prefer voting on short-term \ngoals and one-sided resolutions instead of \nendeavoring to achieve compromise and consensus \nare blocking the way to genuine negotiations in \nthis forum\n168.\tI welcome the spirit of bold candor and \nrealism with which the Secretary-General \ndescribed the state of the Organization in his \nreport. I also welcome his constructive proposals \nfor improving the work of the United Nations and \nthe part played by the Security Council. My \nGovernment will actively support efforts to that \nend.\n169.\tOne of the central tasks of the United \nNations is, as before, to make an effective \ncontribution towards safeguarding world peace. \nIts capacity to do so must be enhanced, and \nbetter use must be made of the existing \ninstruments for this purpose.\n170.\tThe foreign policy pursued by the Federal Republic of Germany is and will \nalways be a policy for peace. We follow this \npolicy in collaboration with our partners in the \nEuropean Community, which is an outward-looking \nassociation alive to its responsi\u00acbility in the \nworld, as well as in the alliance with the United \nStates and Canada.\n171.\tOur peace policy is one of continuity, \nbased on the conclusions we have drawn from our \nown history and conditioned by our situation as a \ndivided country at the interface between East and \nWest. This peace policy enjoys wide and broad \nsupport in all sectors of our population. It \ncannot be discarded at will. Our paramount task \nis to preserve peace. It is not enough to dispel \nfear. We must also counter the dangers \nthreatening us worldwide. As the German \nphilosopher Immanuel Kant said  Peace is not a \nnatural state; it has to be established and \nworked on continuously.  To do so, we must make \nfull use of our powers of reason, of our \npolitical and moral responsibility and of our \ndetermination. We must not believe that what is \ntrue is on one side of the mountain and what is \nfalse is on the other, as Pascal put it. Since \nthe threats are global, global rules of conduct \nmust apply. This is the spirit that imbues the \nCharter of the United Nations. Only by acting in \nthis spirit will we be able to pursue an \neffective strategy for the safeguarding of peace.\n"

I take \nthis opportunity to commend the sincerity, the vigour and the vision \nshown in his report to the General Assembly on the role of the \nOrganization in these times of crisis.\nOn behalf of our President, Belisario Betancur, and the people of \nColombia, I should like to greet the representatives of States \nMembers of the United Nations and to express our confidence that at \nthis thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly we shall be able \nto work effectively in the search for solutions to the disputes that \ndisturb the peace and threaten the security of our peoples.\nI represent a country with a population of 30 million-the fourth \nlargest in population in the western hemisphere-situated at the heart \nof the Americas and sharing land and sea boundaries with 13 Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean nations. Our unique geographical position ties \nus irrevocably to the fate of a large part of the continent and \nobliges us to work in an open and constructive spirit.\nColombia is also a country of laws and an unsullied democratic \ntradition, where political differences are resolved through elections \nand authority emanates from the popular will. Our newly elected \nGovernment has devoted its efforts to the country's economic and \nsocial recovery and to a major peace initiative which will surely \nenable those groups which had resorted to armed rebellion to be \nreincorporated into civilian life. I have been so bold as to mention \nthese positive attributes of my country, but I shall not dwell \nfurther on a point which hold little interest for the news agencies, \nwhose preferred subject-matter is scandals and disasters.\nMy country believes in the possibility and the desirability of \npeaceful solutions. It defends the application of the principles and \nnorms of international law in the settlement of disputes and \nadvocates nonintervention, self-determination and strict observance \nof treaties. It none the less believes that justice complements law \nand it is therefore prepared to consider with an open mind all those \nintrinsically just causes that, for this very reason, warrant the \nattention of the international community.\nThe United Nations, created under the noblest of auspices to save the \nworld from the scourge of war, to promote more equitable conditions \nand standards of living for the peoples and to ensure a stable \neconomic order and harmonious development, has all too often been \nprevented from fulfilling its noble mission. In the view of many it \nhas even become ineffectual. To a large extent this view is correct: \npurely political controversy has invaded all United Nations forums. \nAgencies designed to promote social progress, economic recovery and \ntechnological progress have become arenas of bitter polemics. The \nspirit of co-operation is gradually disappearing; selfish interests \npredominate and the policy of blocs is expanding. Against the \nbackdrop of this kind of Tower of Babel, the imminent danger of \nuniversal cataclysm emerges as the only reality.\nIt is not surprising that, in this atmosphere, the arms race should \nhave intensified. What until recently was a phenomenon exclusive to \nthe great Powers has spread like a malignant growth to moderately \ndeveloped States and even to poor countries. Often it is the \nindustrialized nations themselves that encourage this trade in death.\nMilitary and economic might create conditions of dependence. The \nworld's backward countries must sacrifice their dignity to necessity \nand their conceptual independence in the face of threats. The will to \nsurvive leads to a servile pragmatism which destroys ideals and \nfosters resentment. This concentration of the factors of power \nexplains the formation of the major blocs and the humiliating \nsituation of those nations that have been forced to submit to one or \nanother sphere of influence.\nIt would be unfair to overlook the ideological motivation surrounding \nsome of the decisions of the great Powers. This ideological \nconfrontation is becoming increasingly rare, however. Above all, what \nwe have is a power struggle which threatens to engulf the entire \nworld community. As long as the system of major blocs persists, peace \nwill be impossible.\nColombia is profoundly concerned about this state of affairs. In the \npast year, far from decreasing, the causes for concern have actually \nincreased. The number of situations which disrupt world peace is \ngrowing, the economic crisis's becoming increasingly complex and the \nimbalance among nations is becoming increasingly marked Colombia is \nconcerned by the constant violations of the principles and norms of \ninternational law. We cannot countenance the illegal occupation and \nannexation of territories by force or other forms of intervention \nthat perpetuate a state of permanent anxiety.\nLike most countries, Colombia has condemned Israel's military action \nin Lebanon. It advocates withdrawal from the Arab territories now \nunder military occupation and recognizes the right of the Palestinian \npeople to a sovereign State.\nColombia believes that the various formulas now under consideration \nwith regard to the Palestinian problem must be reconciled as soon as \npossible. New negotiating machinery which is binding on the parties \nto the conflict and on the third countries involved is probably \nneeded. We believe that this vital step does not conflict with \nrecognition of the State of Israel and the latter's right to live in \npeace within its own borders.\nWe note with interest and satisfaction all efforts, such as those \nundertaken by the Korean people, tending to re-establish national \nunity.\nWe have voiced our opposition to the possible exclusion of any Member \nState from the various organs of the United Nations. Despite all the \nrisks, we believe that the principle of universality, which is \nfundamental to the survival and historical impact of the \nOrganization, must be maintained.\nUnfortunately, the latest acts of aggression and violence in the \nMiddle East are not the only ones suffered and repudiated by the \ninternational community. We have also condemned the military \noccupation of Afghanistan and Kampuchea and the persecution of the \ntrade union movement in Poland. In all these cases clear-cut norms of \ninternational law have been violated, resulting in the irreparable \nloss of human life and considerable material damage.\nWe are deeply concerned at the situation in Central America and at \nthe risk that this region so near to us geographically and so dear to \nour hearts might become a new arena of international confrontation. \nThe nations of Central America are struggling, each in its own way, \nto strengthen democracy and promote social change. In that process, \nwhich should occur peacefully as a result of self-determination, \nthere has in recent times been resort to the perilous course of \nideological extremism, arms buildup and foreign interference.\nWe cannot stand by and let the countries of Central America become a \nprey to international ambitions and their weak political and economic \nstructures be suddenly threatened by violence and civil war. It is \nessential to restore peace and, by means of a constructive dialogue, \nto create the conditions for' peaceful coexistence and development. \nIn achieving these objectives, it would be most useful to eliminate \nthe pernicious influence of the military apparatus that in one way or \nanother has become involved in Central American politics.\nAt the beginning of October, Colombia participated in a meeting of \nForeign Ministers organized by the Government of Costa Rica with the \naim of finding common ground and discussing specific actions which \nwould permit a return to normalcy. As a result of that important \nmeeting, it was agreed to create a body which would work for peace \nand democracy: a peace based on mutual respect and a democracy which \nwould guarantee free political expression in each country. At \nColombia's request, the Foreign Ministers meeting in San Jose \nproposed the removal of all military and security advisers from the \narea, in particular from El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.\nWe hope that the goodwill mission entrusted to the Foreign Minister \nof Costa Rica will help to broaden the regional dialogue and will be \nwell received in those countries which for various reasons did not \nparticipate in the first round of talks. My country will co-operate \nfully in achieving the objectives set.\nColombia does not advocate and has never advocated the use of force \nto resolve conflicts. It therefore deplores the fact that, in the \ncase of the Malvinas Islands, the protracted absence of a peaceful \nsolution and the persistence of colonialist practices let to the de \nfacto situations and that all efforts at conciliation to avoid an \narmed conflict failed.\nWe are now faced with the consequences: the loss of 3,000 human lives \nand damage estimated at over $1 billion. But this tragic outcome is \nnot the only cause for concern. The truth is that as a result of the \narmed conflict the possibility of a stable solution for the islands \nnow appears more remote than ever.\nThe United Kingdom, having gained a military victory, refuses to \ndiscuss the question of sovereignty over the islands. Although \nexplicable in the light of recent events, this position will prove \nuntenable in the long run. The anti-colonialist determination of the \nvast majority of countries, Colombia among them, will finally prevail.\nIn order to obviate the risk of further conflict and avoid a \nprolongation of the harmful consequences of this confrontation, \nColombia proposes that the Malvinas should immediately be made \nneutral and their administration entrusted to a multinational \nauthority until a way is found of reconciling Argentina's rights with \nthe legitimate interests of the islands' inhabitants.\nThe conduct of the United States in this unfortunate incident \nwarrants special comment. That country's decision to abandon its \ninitial neutral position and to afford economic, political and \nmilitary support to the United Kingdom aroused justified indignation \nin Latin America. That episode has given rise to the feeling \nthroughout the continent that the United States cares little of the \nfate of its neighbours. The United States attitude none the less had \nthe salutary effect of uniting the peoples of Latin America for the \nfirst time in their entire history. We must seize this opportunity to \ncreate effective machinery which will make possible a joint response \nin moments of crisis.\nThe impact of this conflict on the continent's political future \ncannot be ignored. Europeans and North Americans will in the short \nterm be able to correct many of the decisions taken during the war, \nbut it will take a long time for the wounds to heal. Clearly, Latin \nAmerica is not a priority on the great Powers' list. At the centre of \nthe armed confrontation in the South Atlantic the question of \ncolonialism appears as a last remnant of a world which has faded into \nhistory but the vestiges of which will continue to cause constant \nirritation and potential conflicts for years* to come. Practical \nproblems arise in this decolonization process, including that of how \nto ensure that newly independent territorial entities, many of them \nsmall, avoid the dependence forced on them by their limited economic \nresources. Faced with the danger of new forms of domination, these \nyoung nations will have to seek, with the support of the \ninternational community, systems of association that enable them to \ndefend their own independence successfully.\nIn analysing the factors which contribute to disturbances of the \npeace we are also concerned at the discouraging results of the second \nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We \nsee the problem as one not only of nuclear weapons butalso of \nconventional weapons. It is not enough for the great Powers to \ndeclare their willingness to refrain from the use of nuclear weapons. \nA decision must also be taken drastically to reduce conventional \nweapons and to agree to absolutely trustworthy verification \nprocedures.\nIn Colombia's view peace is not and cannot be a precarious balance \nbetween heavily armed nations but rather the result of a just \ninternational order. Pope Paul VI made this abundantly clear when he \nstated in his encyclical Populorium Progressio many years ago that \ndevelopment was the new name for peace. The Pontiffs historic maxim \nbecomes dramatically relevant in a world where opportunities are \ndangerously concentrated in the hands of a few and three quarters of \nmankind continues to be excluded from a development which would make \njustice feasible and freedom attainable.\nIt was this time bomb which prompted the international community a \ndecade ago to seek a new international economic order which would \nmake it possible to correct imbalances and bridge the gap between \nrich and poor. Without wishing to belittle the initial efforts that \nwere made, we must agree that the situation is not encouraging and \nthe prospects of establishing such an order are increasingly remote, \nabove all in the midst of one of the worst economic crises to face \nthe international community in three generations.\nThis crisis, which is probably both the cause and the effect of the \nchaotic situation in which mankind is living, is the result of \nnumerous factors, including theoretical dependence on rigid models \nwhich for a long time now have failed to take into account the whole \npurpose of economic management for the advancement of man and have \nbecome worn-out concepts which, at the political level, point the way \nto failure.\nThe peripheral countries that traditionally revolve around these \nsystems are often used as testing grounds. The all-out free \nenterprise of the so-called Chicago school on the one hand and the \nrigid self- management and planning, with total State intervention, \nadvocated by the current Marxist school, on the other, are the most \nrecent examples of how blind adherence to economic theories whose \norigins are purely political is doomed to failure.\nAnother no less important, cause of this far- reaching crisis is the \nrapidly growing indebtedness of the developing countries and of those \ncountries with a so-called centrally planned economy. Between them, \nthese countries are fast approaching a foreign debt amounting to the \nextraordinary sum of $800 billion. Two circumstances aggravate this \nphenomenon: on the one hand, the growing involvement of private \nlenders-calculated at 50 per cent-to the detriment of financing \nthrough international development agencies which are finding it \nincreasingly difficult to open the coffers of their rich members; on \nthe other hand, the all too frequent use of foreign loans for sectors \nother than infrastructure or social welfare.\nIn practice, those resources have become volatile material and there \nare difficulties in repaying loans because production has not \nincreased in proportion to indebtedness. There are, of course, \nexceptions but in the end only those countries that have exchanged \nforeign currency for progress will be successful and it will be \ndifficult to find a remedy for those which exchanged loans for \nprestige or used them for ill-planned investments to find a way out \nof their difficulties.\nThe external debt problem has reached such insane proportions that \nwhat formerly generated dependence today engenders mutual fear \nbetween debtors and creditors. The entire financial problem must be \napproached in new terms before this fear degenerates into political \nconfrontation.\nColombia is not subject at present to the pressures of a \ndisproportionate foreign debt. Its foreign debt amounts to over $7 \nbillion, but to a large extent this figure represents development \nloans whose short- term impact is manageable. The annual debt service \ntakes up barely 15 per cent of our foreign trade earnings. \nInternational reserves stand at over $5 billion. We are not,therefore, \npleading our own cause but rather speaking, out of an elementary \nsense of solidarity, as advocates of those countries which need rapid \nand effective support. To this end we support the preparation and \nimplementation of a short- term emergency plan as a first step in the \nprocess of global negotiations.\nThe economic crisis also has its mots in the policies of the \nindustrialized countries. The restriction of demand in order to \ncontrol inflation has caused a drop in the growth of price indices \nand more recently in that of interest rates, but at the high social \ncost of slowing down growth and increasing unemployment.\nThis affects international trade, which is the basis for the growth \nof most of the developing economies, and thus exports unemployment, \nthe social and political consequences of which are felt far more \nacutely in the third world than in the industrialized world. \nProtectionism has taken hold of the major markets, with obvious \nconsequences for trade but also with the distressing result that the \ndeveloping countries, seeing the deterioration in their trade \nbalances and balances of payments, try to save themselves and are in \nturn accused of protectionism, of violating free trade agreements or \nsimply of being trade terrorists who, by stimulating exports, attack \nthe world economy.\nAnother aspect that we must mention here is the deterioration of the \nsituation with regard to commodities. Producer countries were used to \nproducts enjoying good seasons bad seasons, and one usually cancelled \nout the other. Now there are only bad periods because of the \nrecession affecting the main purchasers, and especially because of \nthe irresponsible, selfish and disastrous policies of groups of \ndeveloped countries which, as in the case of sugar, have brought \nprices down to absolutely ludicrous levels.\nThe countries that uphold this sugar policy of subsidies, increased \nproduction and the imposition of quotas cannot expect us to be \ngrateful, to cooperate and to let them participate in our development \nplans. In my country the sugar sector generates considerable \nemployment and foreign currency, and it would be inconsistent of us \nnot to respond forcefully to seeing our international earnings \nreduced as a result of unilateral policies.\nAlmost all the Powers could be accused of this kind of policy with \nregard to other commodities. The sale of strategic reserves, the \nstockpiling of others by mining multinationals, the unilateral fixing \nof quotas for access to markets and the use of foodstuffs as a \npolitical weapon are only some of the many aberrations against which \nthe international community as a whole will have to fight.\nWe should, however, also mention, within this bleak commodity \nsituation, the success just achieved in London in connection with the \nInternational Coffee Agreement, of which my country has always been \nand will continue to be an ardent supporter. This agreement to \nprotect the market reached between producers and consumers in the \nsame forum is an example which I should like to mention here and \nwhich would not have been possible without solidarity between the two \ninterest groups.\nThis already long list also includes the affront constituted by \nmilitary spending. According to United Nations calculations, at 1978 \nprices the world spends $1.2 billion a day on armaments, $900 million \nof which represents the combined military budgets of the United \nStates, the Soviet Union, China, France and the United Kingdom. This \ndaily arms expenditure is equal to the sum total of the annual \nbudgets of UNDP, the World Food Programme, UNICEF, UNRWA and UNFPA.\nAnd, one further comment, compared with the over $380 billion spent \neach year on military budgets, the $21 billion in direct aid, the $80 \nmillion from the World Bank, the $24 million from the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank and the $67 million from the International Monetary \nFund seem paltry amounts. The $825 million of United States financial \nassistance to the Caribbean and the Soviet Union's $1,856 million to \nCuba, North Korea and Viet Nam are even more insignificant. These \nfigures speak for themselves.\nThe subject of the North-South dialogue is perhaps one of the few on \nwhich we all agree: we have failed miserably. Since 1973, the year of \nthe oil embargo and the floating of the principal currencies, the \nUnited Nations as an institution, its Members and the decade's most \neminent personalities have reiterated the need to restructure \nfundamentally the economic relationship between those that are the \nmost prosperous and those that are still the poorest. Then came the \nGeneral Assembly resolutions on the new international economic order \nand the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. The latter \ncould figure in the book of world records as the instrument most \nfrequently violated.\nThe same happened with the 1974 Paris Conference, which throughout \nits three long years brought nothing new to the solution of world \nproblems; with the various meetings of UNCTAD; the ministerial \nmeeting of GATT; the Conference of Science and Technology for \nDevelopment; the Tokyo Round; the annual rite of the International \nMonetary Fund, the World Bank and FAO; the proposal of the \nnon-aligned countries on global negotiations; the Brandt report; the \nCancun summit and the New Delhi and Oslo meetings.\nThese comings and goings of officials, diplomats, economists and \npoliticians have achieved little. Generosity has run out; these are \ndifficult times; such are the phrases we read in foreign ministry \nreports. We of the South say that the North lacks the necessary \npolitical will; those of the North say that we of the South do not \nknow what we want. There is nothing new; every possibility, including \nhope, has vanished.\nThe argument that we must wait for the world economy to return to \nnormal and regain its health is not convincing enough for us to \npostpone indefinitely the initiatives with regard to the North-South \ndialogue and the global negotiations. The illness has to be treated; \nthe solution is in the hands of those present here-developed or \nunderdeveloped, with or without a colonial past. It is a question of \npolitical will and of clearly identifying our goals and procedures.\nThere is light in all this darkness: co-operation among developing \ncountries. This South-South relationship is one of the few \nmultilateral successes of recent years and must therefore maintain \nits momentum and continue its identification of areas in which \nco-operation is possible and fruitful.\nIt is true that the developing countries enjoy only 28 per cent of \nthe wealth of our planet, but it is no less true that they represent \n80 per cent of the world's population. This tremendous sociological \nreality will make itself felt in the end and the developed countries \nrealize this. Unfortunately, they neither act nor allow others to \nact. Years ago there was a proposal, which was never put into \npractice, that the rich countries should earmark a minimum percentage \nof their gross national product for programmes of international \nco-operation. The proposal never got off the ground.\nThe only alternative is to strengthen the South- South relationship. \nIt is a question of seeking and offering support, encouraging \nexchanges, pooling experiences and developing new technologies. These \nare some of the goals. Although Colombia is not an economic Power, \nmuch less a military one, it understands and accepts its obligation \nto contribute to those goals and has tried to do so in its own area.\nOne result of my country's decision is the Andean Pact or Cartagena \nAgreement, an interesting experiment in sub-regional integration that \nhas managed to survive for over 10 years. Another example is the plan \nfor economic, trade and financial cooperation which Colombia is \npromoting with the countries of Central America and the Caribbean. \nThese are specific examples which prove that a stable and fruitful \nrelationship is possible among developing countries.\nIf it is not possible, as we have seen, to institutionalize the \nNorth-South dialogue and render it operational, then let the General \nAssembly at least offer effective backing to the agencies that \npromote South-South co-operation.\nIn the midst of so many disappointments, there is another very \nimportant and positive element in the work of the United Nations \nwhich shows that it is possible to find universally acceptable \nsolutions to problems affecting the international community when the \nspirit of consensus prevails and multilateral negotiating machinery \nis properly used. I am referring to the adoption on 30 April last of \nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the culmination \nof nine years of difficult negotiations and six years of careful \npreparation.\nThe new regime for the sea recognizes and develops for the sea-bed \nbeyond the limits of national jurisdiction a principle already \nformulated 150 years ago by the great Latin American legal expert \nAndres Bello, according to which there are assets which can remain \ncommon property for the benefit of all and belong to the indivisible \nheritage of mankind and cannot be marked with the seal of ownership. \nWith regard to maritime spaces under State jurisdiction, the \nConvention represents not only a complete legal framework, but also \nan instrument for the economic and social development of our peoples.\nColombia was one of the 130 countries to vote in favour of the \nConvention and hopes that at this session the General Assembly will \nprovide the Secretary-General with the necessary means to take on the \nresponsibilities assigned to him.\nThe Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful \nUses of Outer Space, which was held at Vienna in August, enabled the \nUnited Nations to review the conquest of space, and the developing \ncountries to call the attention of the technological Powers to the \nneed for more effective and systematic international co-operation. \nFor Colombia, an equatorial country, it was significant that several \nof the recommendations of the Conference stressed the urgent need to \nplan and regulate the use of the geostationary orbit, a limited \nnatural resource which can be over-exploited by its appropriation by \nthe technological monopolies. Since 1975, my country and nine other \nequatorial States have been demanding a special regime for the \ngeostationary orbit. In Vienna, all the developing countries, within \nthe framework of the Group of 77, turned our demands into a dire \nnecessity. We reiterate to the Assembly today that technological \ndevelopment must be regulated by international law and that \nconsequently the free consent of countries below the orbital arc must \nbe a prerequisite of any such regulation. We really believe that the \nprior consent of receiving and monitored countries must be obtained \nbefore direct television broadcasting by satellite or remote-sensing \nactivities are carried out.\nI could go on at length on many other topics of concern to my \ncountry, but I see no practical usefulness in doing so. Each country \nmust act within the limits of its possibilities and in relation to \nthe questions which concern it directly. I should like, however, to \nshare a number of closing observations with the members of the \nAssembly. These refer to the search for a lasting peace which would \nguarantee the survival of our species. If we are to achieve such a \npeace, we must replace confrontation by balance. This balance does \nnot arise from the strategic parity of the super-Powers, however, but \nis born of the tactical unity of medium-sized and small nations in \nseeking to dismantle the whole threatening apparatus of war.\nIt has been proved time and again that the United States and the \nSoviet Union are not in a position to offer mankind the good news of \neffective disarmament and that they will probably pursue their \nintensive political, economic and military rivalry. Colombia has \nthought carefully about these and other facts in relation to its own \ninternational position. For years, influenced by our dedication to a \nset of principles and consistent with a tradition, we have on \noccasion been regarded as a dependent country. We believe that the \ntime has come to clarify our position. Not so that we might disown an \nhonourable past, much less abjure principles that are deeply rooted \nin our people, but simply so that we might better serve the cause of \nmankind. We believe that the prospects for peace will be improved if \ncountries able to do so adopt more independent positions. This is \nalso valid in view of the aspirations to establish a new, more just \nand equitable economic order.\nThese are the main reasons for Colombia's decision to apply for \nadmission to the non-aligned movement. We are well aware that this \nmovement was, at the outset, made up principally of countries from \nother continents. We believe that the time has come for the countries \nof Latin America also to join in a process which, if well directed, \ncan make a decisive contribution to the cause of peace. Some have \nalready done so and others, like Colombia, hope to do so in the near \nfuture.\n"

My Government \ntrusts that this valuable tradition, so well \nrespected by his pre\u00acdecessors, will be \nmaintained during the deliberations that are \nbeginning today.\n127.\tI wish to take this opportunity to \nexpress our gratitude to Mr. Kittani of Iraq for \nthe dedication and energy with which he \ndischarged his functions during his presidency.\n128.\tThis is also an appropriate opportunity \nto pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. \nJavier Perez de Cuellar, for the zealous, devoted \nand skilful per\u00acformance of his duties in the \nbrief period of less than a year since he was \nchosen to shoulder this great responsibility. We \nmust express the deep satisfaction with which we \nwelcomed his election as Secretary- General. This \nonce again highlighted his great personal and \nprofessional talents and was a clear \ndemonstration of the confidence which the \ninternational community feels in a distinguished \nrepresentative of Latin America and a worthy son \nof the Republic of Peru\u2014a factor of particular \nsignificance to our region. We offer our warmest \nwishes for his success and once more reiterate \nour sincere willingness to co-operate with him in \nthe fulfilment of his important and sensitive \nresponsibilities.\n129.\tChile comes to the General Assembly with \nfeelings of deep concern about the delicate \ninterna\u00actional situation, which is affecting and \nimpairing world peace and the very foundations of \nthe Organization.\n130.\tThis recently inaugurated session is \ntaking place while the military occupations of \nAfghanistan and Kampuchea persist and the war \nbetween Iraq and Iran continues. No solution has \nyet been found for the Namibian situation. \nLebanon has been practically destroyed by the war \nbeing waged on its territory by foreign nations. \nThe Palestinian people remain without a physical \nterritory in which to grow and develop as a \nnation. And, finally, the cowardly practice of \nterrorism, international subversion and foreign \nintervention to gain political or ideological \nobjectives continues to spread with impunity in \nCentral America and other regions of the world.\n131.\tThe armed confrontations and conflicts \nand the systematic violation of the principles of \nthe Charter and of international law have \nworsened dangerously, while juridical and \npolitical mechanisms remain ineffective, not \nhaving the necessary power to impose real and \njust solutions.\n132.\tOur people note with great \ndisillusionment the inability of world \norganizations to keep the peace and to create a \nclimate of consensus in order to advance along \nthe road of co-operation and progress. \nUn\u00acfortunately, confidence in the international \nsystem is waning in a way that could become \nirreversible, especially in the Organization, \nwhich was created to promote harmonious and \npeaceful coexistence among States. We must face \nthe reality of this situation with vigour, a \nsense of responsibility and decisiveness and work \nintensively to achieve the necessary convergence \nof views, so as to restore the world's faith in \nthe principles and objectives embodied in the \nCharter. We are facing a situation which demands \nall our capabilities and efforts since at stake \nis the very future of mankind, of the \ninternational system and of respect for the \nobligations which all Member States have \ncontracted and to which our respective nations \nare in honour pledged.\n133.\tWe have affirmed in various forums that \none of the elements which guide the foreign \npolicy of Chile is its unwavering support for the \nprinciple of the peaceful settlement of disputes \nand its rejection of the threat or use of force \nin international relations. Today more than ever \nwe reaffirm our political will to abide by the \nprinciples of international law. We call upon the \nconscience of the world for the abandon\u00acment of \nmere declarations and decisive support for the \ndevelopment of legal instruments that will give \nthese principles the quality of mandatory \nstandard for the international conduct of States.\n134.\tThese essential norms, explicitly laid \ndown in Article 2, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the \nCharter, find their practical application in \nChapter VI, devoted to the obligations of the \nparties to a dispute and the powers and \nattributions of the Security Council. In a \nsimilar manner, numerous later instruments \nprepared within the framework of the Organization \nhave repeated them and expanded their scope. \nOutstanding among these are: the draft \nDeclaration on Rights and Duties of States, \nprepared by the International Law Com\u00acmission in \n1949 the Declaration on Principles of \nInternational Law con\u00accerning Friendly Relations \nand Co-operation among States in accordance with \nthe Charter of the United Nations, adopted in \n1970; the Declaration on the Strengthening of \nInternational Security, also adopted in 1970; the \nDefinition of Aggression, adopted in 1974; and, \nmost recently, the draft Manila Declaration on \nthe Peaceful Settlement of International \nDisputes, finalized by the Special Committee on \nthe Charter of the United Nations and on the \nStrengthening of the Role of the Organization at \nits meeting in Geneva in March of this year.\n135.\tIn the American region the principle of \nthe peaceful settlement of disputes has been very \nclearly established in three of the most \nimportant documents of the regional system: the \nInter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance \nconcluded in Rio de Janeiro in 1947; the charter \nof the Organization of American States of 1948;? \nand the Pact of Bogota of the same year.\n136.\tThe unrestricted application of the \nprinciple and its full doctrinal implications \nhave not been sufficiently developed, especially \nduring the past 30 years, despite the fact that \nit was contemplated in the documents I have \nmentioned and in many other documents of a \nbilateral and multilateral nature. At its current \nsession the General Assembly has the important \ntask of adopting the draft Manila Declara\u00action, \nthereby giving a strong impetus to the \nvitalization of the system of the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes.\n137.\tWithin this context, I should like to \nstress before the Assembly the special relevance \nand priority that my Government attaches to the \nobligation of Mem\u00acber States to settle disputes \nby peaceful means and the obligation to abstain \nfrom recourse to the threat or use of force in \ntheir international relations. These two \nobligations constitute the basic pillars of \ninternational relations. Repeated and systematic \nnon-observance by some States has led to the \ncreation of the present turbulent international \nsituation\u2014a situation which is diminishing the \ncredibility of the United Nations.\n138.\tTaking into account these and other norms \ncon\u00accerning the peaceful settlement of disputes, \nwe believe that these should be put into treaty \nform so as effectively to facilitate their \npractical application. As I have already noted, \nwe believe that the surest guarantee of the \npreservation of peace among nations would be the \nexistence of agreements and instruments making \nrecourse to the settlement of disputes by \npeaceful means obligatory under international \nlaw, in order to eliminate for ever the risk of a \nconflagration. What better guarantee could there \nbe for our peoples than the protection afforded \nby the procedure of peaceful settlement, thus \nsparing them the constant fear of a \nconfrontation, with incalculable conse\u00acquences? \nWhat better way could there be to demon\u00acstrate \ndedication to and respect for the law as peace- \nloving Members of the Organization than by being \nbound by treaties and agreements which establish \nthe means of effectively preserving peace? We \nfeel that the United Nations, as the supreme body \nentrusted with the preservation of international \npeace and security in our time, cannot remain \naloof from this noble task.\n139.\tUnfortunately, events of recent years \nhave shown that the failure to apply the norms \nand pro\u00accedures for the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes provided for in Chapter VI of the \nCharter results in the Security Council's being \ncharged with the responsi\u00acbility of acting once \nhostilities have broken out, when the solution \nbecomes much more complex because of the loss of \nhuman lives and the natural exacerba\u00action of \nfeelings. In other words, there is no effective \nand rapid fulfilment of the obligations the \nMember States assume in accordance with Chapter \nVI or the functions entrusted to the Security \nCouncil under Chapter VII. How much more better \nit would be if the Organization could carry out \nthe preventive and dissuasive role assigned to it \nby the Charter, reduce the sources of conflict \nand guide countries towards a peaceful settlement \nof their disputes. We are particularly pleased \nthat the Secretary- General, in his report on the \nwork of the Organi\u00aczation, concurs with the \nobservations that Chile has been making \nthroughout this year, particularly in the \nSecurity Council and at the second special \nsession of the General Assembly devoted to \ndisarmament. This task cannot be deferred and we \nbelieve that the Organization and the regional \nsystems are especially qualified to draw up and \nagree upon some procedure for preventive \nvigilance which could lead the parties concerned \nin a dispute towards the effective applica\u00action \nof the means of settlement available, or to \npursue the development of a procedure to prevent \nthe frustra\u00action of efforts and the creation of \nan irreversible situation.\n140.\tA discouraging and disquieting world \neconomic situation has been added to the increase \nin interna\u00actional tension. The common and almost \nunmanageable problem of inflation has been \naccompanied by a slow rate of growth, \nunemployment and governmental budget deficits, to \nwhich has been added external indebtedness. This \nlast, which fundamentally comple\u00acments the \nfinancing of the economic growth of almost all \ndeveloping countries, has made more difficult the \nsolution of urgent problems, owing to the high \ncost of money. This is particularly serious in \nthe social sector, since there is a daily \nincrease in the millions of human beings who have \nbeen left out of the mainstream of the progress \nwhich scientific and technological know\u00acledge has \nbrought to much of mankind.\n141.\tThe search for easy solutions to the \nproblems has resulted in rising budgetary \nimbalances in many countries, including the \nindustrialized nations with market economies, and \nthe worsening of their dif\u00acficulties over the \nmedium term.\n142.\tThe legitimate attempt by some developed \nStates to find basic solutions to their internal \nproblems has caused a slump in economic activity. \nThis in turn has resulted in the reduction of the \nprices of practically all raw materials, severely \naffecting the developing countries which are the \nprincipal exporters of such materials.\n143.\tThe international crisis has buffeted the \nweakest economies with a force hitherto almost \nunknown, and few countries have escaped its \neffects. Its mag\u00acnitude is such that however \nforceful internal efforts to combat the problem \nthe effects can be only tempo-rarily minimized \nand in no case has there been com\u00acplete recovery \nand progress for such economies. The \ninternational economic co-operation which could \nhave mitigated the effects of this crisis has \nalso decreased with the reduction of the \nresources devoted to that end.\n144.\tIn view of this situation, we must stress \nthat the world economic order must be reformed, \nin a spirit of co-operation and with complete \ninternational solidarity. While recognizing that \nthe present world political climate may not be \nthe most propitious for beginning such an \nexercise, we believe that the cost of maintaining \nthe present situation would exceed that of \ninitiating global negotiations, even in \nconditions which, in our view, are not the most \ndesirable from the point of view of the \ndeveloping countries.\n145.\tThe international community has a duty to \nstudy solutions within the existing institutions \nin order to facilitate the efforts and possible \nmodifications that should be made by developing \ncountries deeply affected by the international \ncrisis, a phenomenon not foreign to the Latin \nAmerican region.\n146.\tIn the mean time my Government has well- \nfounded hopes that the forthcoming ministerial \nmeeting of GATT will achieveconcrete steps \ntowards liber\u00acalizing international trade, and \nputting an end to existing protectionist measures \nwhich, we are certain, can only contribute to \nfurther aggravation of current difficulties.\n147.\tWe trust, likewise, that the economic \nco\u00acoperation between developing countries \nformally begun in 1981 at the meeting at Caracas \nwill begin to bear fruit and permit alleviation \nof the situation in many of our countries.\n148.\tI cannot refrain at this time from \nreferring to certain specific instances which \nconstitute persistent focal points of world \ntension and which are dete\u00acriorating despite \nresolutions adopted by the Security Council and \nthe General Assembly.\n149.\tUnfortunately, we have noted that the \nefforts of the Organization to find a solution to \nthe problem facing the people of Afghanistan have \nproved sterile, despite the fact that another \nyear has passed since three fourths of the Member \nStates voted in favour of General Assembly \nresolution 36/34.\n150.\tWe again condemn the flagrant aggression \nfrom which the people of Afghanistan are \nsuffering and we reiterate our support for those \nwho are struggling to re-establish that country's \ncomplete sovereignty. We add our voice to that of \nthe inter\u00acnational community, as we did in \ncommemorating the day of Afghanistan, and demand \nthe immediate with\u00acdrawal of Soviet occupation \nforces. We likewise wish to express our sorrow \nover the situation affecting numerous inhabitants \nof that land who have had to seek refuge beyond \ntheir borders in order to escape foreign \noppression.\n151.\tA year has also passed since the adoption \nof Assembly resolution 36/5, insisting on respect \nfor the territorial integrity, independence and \nright of self- determination of Kampuchea, \ntogether with the with\u00acdrawal of invading forces, \nand that resolution has likewise been flagrantly \ndisobeyed.\n152.\tChile, which gave its support to the \nefforts of the /M Roc Committee of the \nInternational Con\u00acference on Kampuchea to find a \ncomprehensive political solution of the problem, \nnow expresses its satisfaction with regard to the \nrecent formation of the Government headed by \nPrince Norodom Sihanouk.\n153.\tThe tense and unstable situation now \nprevailing in the Korean peninsula confirms our \nconviction that inter-Korean negotiations are the \nonly practical way of resolving through peaceful \nmeans and without foreign intervention, a problem \nthat has been dragging on for almost 40 years.\n154.\tThe situation in the Middle East \ncontinues to represent a threat to international \npeace and security. During the thirty-fifth and \nthirty-sixth sessions of the General Assembly, I \nemphasized that our rejection of the use of force \nas a means for settling disputes, controversies \nor conflicts is the principle which, for a \ncountry like Chile, has necessarily assumed the \nhighest priority. For this reason we emphasize \nthe need for a realistic solution based on the \nwithdrawal of Israel from all occupied \nterritories, with recognition of the right of all \nStates of the region, including Israel, to live \nwithin secure and internationally recog\u00acnized \nborders, and the full exercise by the Palestinian \npeople of their inalienable rights, including the \nright to the establishment of a sovereign \nState\u2014all this in accordance with the pertinent \nresolutions of the United Nations, especially \nSecurity Council, reso\u00aclutions 242 (1967) and 338 \n(1973).\n155.\tThe tragic crisis involving Lebanon today \nhas shaken the not always alert sensitivity of \nthe interna\u00actional community. We are deeply \nconcerned over the situation affecting that \ncountry, with which we are linked by so many ties \nof friendship and co-operation. The grave \nproblems besetting the Middle East have, \nunfortunately, resulted in the clashes between \nthe various parties taking place on Lebanese soil \nand at the expense of its people. We insist on \nthe withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon \nand demand complete respect for the territorial \nintegrity and political independence of that \nnation.\n156.\tWe cannot but express our grief over the \nbase attack upon the President-elect of Lebanon, \nMr. Bashir Gemayel. We condemn also most \nenergetically the inhuman and brutal massacre of \nthe Palestinian refu\u00acgees in the Sabra and \nShatila camps. We view with horror the terrorism \nwhich has struck down yet more victims, breeding \nhate and loss of confidence among a people which \nwas naturally longing for peace and prosperity \nafter long years of misfortune and des\u00acperation.\n157.\tWe trust that these reprehensible crimes \nwill not hinder the pacification process of that \nnoble country, which now faces the challenge of \nstarting its own reconstruction in order to seek \nthe good fortune it deserves. We therefore wish \nPresident-elect Amin Gemayel the greatest success \nin his management of the difficult tasks of \ngovernment that he has under\u00actaken.\n158.\tChile, in its dedication to peace and \nlove of justice, has supported all initiatives \ndesigned to bring about a just and lasting \nsolution to the complex and delicate situation in \nthe Middle East. In this context we applaud the \npeace plans of the President of the United States \nand those of the Arab nations emanating from the \nTwelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez. We call \nupon the States of this disturbed area to \nconsider the proposals which can contribute \neffectively to the cause of peace and offer hope \nfor the productive development of all its people, \nin a climate of under\u00acstanding and good \nneighbourliness.\n159.\tMy country, as a member of the Special \nCom\u00acmittee on the Situation with regard to the \nImplementa\u00action of the Declaration on the \nGranting of Independence to Colonial Countries \nand Peoples and of the United Nations Council for \nNamibia, has participated actively in the process \nof self-determination and independence that has \nbeen developing in recent years. For this reason \nwe note with special attention the negotiations \nunder way to find a peaceful solution that will \npermit the people of Namibia finally to achieve \nindependence in accordance with its interests. In \nthis regard, my Government firmly supports \nSecurity Council resolu\u00actions 385 (1976) and 435 \n(1978). We hope that a solu\u00action will be found to \nensure a stable peace in the region and the \nwithdrawal of all foreign forces from the zone.\n160.\tChile is a country with strong feelings \nof loyalty to the American continent. It is proud \nto belong to a young and forceful continent which \nhas given proof throughout its history of its \ngenuine spirit of co\u00acoperation and world \nsolidarity. For this reason, we observe with \nconcern the crisis affecting the inter- American \nsystem, the result of feelings of frustration and \ndisenchantment among the American nations \nthemselves resulting from the various conflicts \nand divisions within the confines of our \ncontinent.\nl63. The Government of Chile reaffirms from this \nrostrum the urgent need for the nations of the \ncon\u00actinent to strengthen their regional \ncoexistence on the basis not only of the \ncontinent's legal system, but also of an \nessential political consensus that will enable us \nto recover an appropriate position in the \ninternational community.\n164.\tThis year, Latin America was shaken by \nthe outbreak of the Anglo-Argentine conflict over \nthe Malvinas Islands. The deep impact on the \nhemisphere of this unfortunate confrontation \nreflects our natural concern about the problems \nwhich trouble the Latin American community, \nespecially the loss of faith in the effectiveness \nof the mechanisms of the inter-American and world \nsystems. Faithful to its tradition of respect for \nthe norms and principles of international law, my \nGovernment, together with 19 other Latin American \ncountries, sponsored a request to include an item \non the Malvinas Islands in the agenda of the \npresent session of the General Assembly and we \nmake an urgent appeal for the peaceful settlement \nof the dispute between Argentina and the United \nKingdom under the auspices of the United Nations.\n165.\tFaced with the present uncertain world \npan\u00acorama, it is necessary to continue fighting \ntirelessly in order to attain the positive goals \nwhich will strengthen the Organization. In this \nrespect we attrib\u00acute special importance to the \ndevelopment of the new international law of the \nsea, to the efforts being made on disarmament and \non the exploitation of outer space for peaceful \npurposes.\n166.\tAfter nine long years of negotiations \nwhich established consensus as the method of \nlegislating on international affairs, the Third \nUnited Nations Con\u00acference on the Law of the Sea \nhas adopted a con\u00acvention which should be a cause \nof pride to the world community. The \nSecretary-General of the United Nations has \ndescribed it as one of the greatest achievements \nof the century. The law of the sea Con\u00acvention, \nwhich brings together important institutions and \nprinciples, such as classic maritime law, the \nrules governing the sea-bed and for the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes and other no less \nsignificant matters, constitutes the new \ninternational law of the sea. These norms are \ndesigned to cover the activities of mankind on \ntwo thirds of this planet.\n167.\tSpecial reference should be made to take \neco\u00acnomic zone of 200 miles. This concept, which \nwas originally framed by the Governments of \nChile, Ecuador and Peru in 1952, is based on the \nlegitimate right of States to their natural \nresources for the benefit of their respective \npopulations. Latin America has gradually made \nthis new maritime space its own, to the point of \ntransforming it into one of the pillars of Latin \nAmerican law of the sea and then into general \ninterna\u00actional law.\n168.\tWe believe that the significance and \nscope of the law of the sea Convention make it \nadvisable that all member countries of the \ninternational community should participate in it. \nWe must make every effort to achieve this and to \navoid looking for alternative schemes lacking \nlegal foundation and validity, and therefore not \ndeserving of international recognition. It is \nimportant that the Convention be ready for \nsignature on the date scheduled, that the \nPreparatory Commission established by the \nConference* start functioning and that this \ndecisive instrument enter into force as soon as \npossible.\n169.\tIn June of this year I had the honour of \nad\u00acdressing the Assembly at the twelfth special \nses\u00acsion, the second special session of the \nGeneral As\u00acsembly devoted to disarmament [gee \n77/Meefwg]. In stating the position of my country \non that occasion, I pointed out that Chile, as a \npeace-loving nation, respectful of the law, \ncondemned the use of force in any of its \nmanifestations. Those principles, I added, \nconstituted the basis of our foreign policy and \ndeter\u00acmined our conduct in the difficult Held of \ninterna\u00actional relations. For that reason, we are \nconcerned over the arms race in which today \ncertain nations are involved, which is increasing \ntension and the threat of destruction hovering \nover mankind. Disarmament is closely tied to \ndevelopment and for that reason it will be most \ndifficult for nations to find the path to \nprogress if they have not first established \neffective and lasting peace. That is why we have \nsupported demilitarization by regions, under the \ncontrol of the United Nations, supporting \nvaluable proposals, such as that made by the \nJapanese Government, which seek to neutralize the \nconventional and nuclear arms races. Chile, \nmoreover, favours the strengthening of IAEA so \nthat, through universal acceptance of its \nmonitoring of nuclear facilities and the \ncomprehensive use of its technical assistance \ncapabilities, nuclear energy can be directed \ntowards those objectives which seek to expand \ndevelopment and consolidate world peace.\n170.\tAmong the challenges to the improved \ndevelop\u00acment of nations is the exploitation and \nutilization of outer space for peaceful purposes. \nIts condition as the common heritage of mankind \nmust be safeguarded so that its exploration and \nexploitation can be conducted for the benefit of \nall peoples. We believe also that in order to \npreserve that condition it would be highly useful \nto have a world authority to administer the \nresources that may derive from exploitation, \nade\u00acquately channelling applications of \ntechnology and indirectly preventing the \nmilitarization of outer space.\n171.\tAt the regional level, Chile has \nsupported the establishment of a Latin American \nspace agency which could serve to obtain the \ngreatest advantages of the uses of space and \nimprove expectations of well-being. We are happy \nto see that this initiative was favourably \nreceived by the Second United Nations Conference \non the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer \nSpace.\n172.\tWithin this context of promising \nperspectives I believe it would be appropriate to \ncomment on the interesting developments taking \nplace in the area of the Pacific basin. Various \nindicators have shown that we are in the presence \nof a process of growing economic interdependence \nbetween the coastal nations of that Ocean, where \ntransportation and communica\u00actions, trade, \ninvestments and the general flow of goods, \nservices and people have been growing more than \nin any other area of the world during the past \ndecade. As a result of these positive \ndevelopments, various initiatives, especially \nfrom the academic and private business sectors, \nhave been moving forward around a structure of \nregional integration and co-operation plans. \nAlthough this involves a vast basin, with many \ndissimilar racial, linguistic, religious, \npolitical and development factors, they \nfrequently complement each ether and provide \nincentives, together with the phenomenon of \ninterdependence I have already described, for \nestablishing a course towards a future economic \ncommunity in the Pacific.\n173.\tChile, a maritime country which attaches \ngreat importance to its diplomatic, economic and \ncultural activities in the Pacific region, \ndecisively supports such initiatives. My \nGovernment therefore upholds the concept of a \ncontinuing interchange of ideas and consultative \nmechanisms for a common Pan-Pacific dialogue and, \nmore particularly, the South-South co\u00acoperation, \nwhich is feasible among Latin America, the \nislands of the South Pacific and the members of \nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations.\n174.\tThe Chilean Government, faithful to its \nun\u00acwavering tradition of resolving disputes \nthrough peaceful means under international law, \nand its con\u00acsistent respect for treaties and \ninternational instru-ments, is continuing its \nattempt to settle its existing differences with \nthe Republic of Argentina in our southern waters. \nWe reiterate our faith in and full support for \nthe noble mission undertaken by His Holiness Pope \nJohn Paul II in his capacity as mediator. His \nprovidential intercession permitted the staving \noff of a dangerous crisis between our two nations \nat the end of 1978. The happy initiative of this \ndistinguished mediator has already yielded \nvaluable results which allow us to hope for the \nfinal and complete success of his efforts. We are \ncertain that the final agreement to be achieved \nwill contribute to the greater strengthening of \nthe deep historical ties which have joined the \ntwo republics together since the dawn of their \nindependence.\n175.\tIt is my very pleasant duty to reiterate \nto the Assembly the gratitude of the people and \nGovernment of Chile to a man who, as Vicar of \nChrist on earth, is engaged in such a noble \nundertaking in a world convulsed by violence.\n176.\tAs I stated at the beginning of my \ninter\u00acvention, the Chilean Government brings to \nthe General Assembly a deep concern about the \nsensitive situation facing the world today. We \nagree with the Secretary- General when he states \nin his report that \\\"We are perilously near to a \nnew international anarchy... one symptom of which \nis the crisis in the multilateral approach in \ninternational affairs and the concomitant erosion \nof the authority and status of world and regional \nintergovernmental institutions\\\". In order to \navoid such anarchy, my country considers it \nessential to deal firmly with the situations \nwhich today constitute the principal sources of \ninterna-tional tension, employing the means \navailable to the Organization to ensure that \nStates conform to the principles set forth in the \nCharter, in particular refraining from the threat \nor use of force, the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes and international co-operation in every \narea. An act of collective creativity is required \nwhich, with imagination and realism, will enable \nus to find agreed legal formulas to banish the \napocalyptic phantom of war and to prepare for a \nfuture of world coexistence. To do so, we must \nnot allow the Organ\u00acization to become merely a \nbody to which States bring their differences and \nproblems. We must arrive at a sufficient \nconsensus to enable us to avoid the outbreak of \narmed clashes, because once such a clash begins, \nit is almost impossible to stop it. To achieve \nthat aim, we reaffirm the need to change the \npro\u00accedures for the peaceful settlements of \ndisputes, and give them the necessary mandatory \ncharacter.\n177.\tIn the course of this statement, I have \nstated the fundamental principles upon which our \nforeign policy is based, namely, respect for the \nindividual and for the law. Our Government, \nmaintaining a clear and consistent position, is \napplying those same prin\u00acciples to its domestic \nlife. With the broad support of its citizens, it \nis carrying out a process of \ninstitu\u00actionalization designed to modernize the \ncountry in every sphere and to give its people \ngreater oppor\u00actunities for spiritual and material \ndevelopment.\n178.\tChile is prepared to continue along the \nroad of peace and respect for the law, a \ntradition which is deeply rooted in its national \ncharacter.\n"

        "file_text": "1.\tI should like at the outset, Sir, to \nconvey to you the greetings and congratulations \nof the delegation of Peru on your well-deserved \nelection to the presidency of the thirty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. This is \nrecognition of your personal qualities as well as \na tribute to Hungary, a country which has \nparticipated so actively and so significantly in \nthe work of the United Nations.\n2.\tMy delegation also wishes to express its \nappreciation and to convey its congratulations \nto Mr. Tsmat Kittani, who at a critical time for \nthe international community demonstrated his \nexceptional abilities as an experienced and \nskilful diplomat.\n3.\tYou will understand, Sir, with what \nsatisfaction we greet Mr. Javier Perez de \nCuellar, the Secretary- General. Peru takes pride \nin his election and in the contribution that he \nis making t^ the cause of the international \ncommunity.\n4.\tSince it took office on 28 July 1980 the \nconstitutional Government of Peru has shouldered \nthe difficult task of putting into practice a \nspirit of democracy in which the effectiveness \nof a modem Consti-tution, the interplay of the \nbranches of government, respect for human rights \nand the full enjoyment of freedoms should \nconstitute the best assurance that we shall \nachieve our ideal of making man the supreme end \nof our social efforts.\n5.\tTwo years have elapsed under the present \nGovernment and Peru takes satisfaction in the \nfact that it is fulfilling its aims. Freedom of \nexpression for all the communications media is \nnow absolute in our country. The elections that \ntook place in 1980 were followed in November 1981 \nby complementary elections at the municipal \nlevel. These indicated increased support for the \nparty led by President Fernando Belaunde Terry, \nwhich gained 70 per cent of the votes cast at the \nnational level.\n41\n6.\tThe problems of the present-day world are \nclearly causing serious frustrations in society \nto which it is reacting in different ways. The \ngreat majorities opt for political avenues which, \nin various ways, seek to find within the legal \norder appropriate replies to the requirements of \ncollective well-being. Unfortunately, there are \nalso those who react to adversity in irrational, \nblind and irresponsible ways.\n7.\tDespite the resolve and efforts of our \nGovernment to promote justice, well-being and \nprogress within the framework of democratic \nprinciples, some minority groups, seeking to use \nviolence to introduce an ill- defined political, \neconomic and social programme, have resorted to \nacts which cause irreparable loss of human life \nand very serious material damage for a developing \ncountry. The Peruvian people rejects this \ncriminal activity as shocking to its conscience \nand damaging to its interests, for what is \ndestroyed is lost to all. Our whole country has, \ntherefore, through its representative \ninstitutions and the broad range of political \nparties present in our national Parliament, \ncondemned terrorism and continues to do so. Our \nGovernment has taken steps to prevent it, in \nstrict observance of human rights. To that end, \nour Government will guarantee public peace with \nthe necessary firmness, but without overstepping \nlegal bounds in any respect. Persons involved in \ncriminal offences have been brought before the \njudiciary the independence of which cannot be \nquestioned for it is the only authority empowered \nto decide on the guilt of those involved and to \napply the necessary penalties.\n8.\tHis Holiness Pope John Paul II, in his \npontifical message of 1980, reminded us that \nbuilding peace is the task of all men and all \nnations and that violence is an evil unworthy of \nman, unacceptable as a solution to our problems, \ncontrary to the truth of our humanity and, \nindeed, destructive of what it seeks to defend: \nthe dignity, life and freedom of the human being. \nBut he told us also: \\\"We cannot sincerely condemn \nrecourse to violence unless we engage in a \ncorresponding effort to replace it by courageous \npolitical initiatives which aim at eliminating \nthreats to peace by attacking the roots of \ninjustice.\\\" That is precisely what the Government \nof Peru is seeking to do at the domestic level.\n9.\tHence, together with the legitimate \nexercise of its constitutional responsibilities, \nthe Government is pursuing a set of activities \ndesigned to bring about improvement in the \ndepressed economic and social conditions of the \npoorest areas of our country, those areas in \nwhich the largest number of acts of violence have \ntaken place. This poverty is the result of \ncomplex geographical conditions, isolation and \nthe failure for over a century to address basic \nneeds. It is being faced through courageous \ndevelopment programmes that will alleviate the \ndifficult situation of the people living in those \nareas.\n10.\tPeru has signed all the international \nagreements on human rights to which it could \naccede and the principles of those agreements are \nembodied in the new Constitution. Our Government \nbases its efforts upon those principles in \nbringing about the full realization of each \nperson and a regime of democracy and social \nsolidarity. The occasional stories reaching the \ninternational community which attempt to \ncontradict the spirit of authentic respect for \nhuman dignity in my country today must surely \ncome as a surprise to those who have had an \nopportunity to visit Peru and to witness the \nclimate of freedom prevailing in my country.\n11.\tIn the international arena, Peru has \nsought further to achieve ever closer ties with \nits neighbour countries, links to which it \nattaches particular importance within its \ntraditional policy of respect for the rights of \nothers as well as zealous defence of its own \nrights.\n12.\tPeru has continued to participate \nactively in the processes of regional economic \nco-operation and integration. My Government has \nsupported and resolutely contributed to the \nreactivation of the Andean Croup and to promoting \nthe Latin American Integration Association, as \nwell as in regional consultations and \nco-operation, within the framework of the Latin \nAmerican Economic System, which are institutions \nto which Peru attaches the greatest importance in \nthe strengthening and unity of Latin America as \nan effective response to the frustrations and \nunusual economic measures that the region as a \nwhole and some countries in particular have \nexperienced during the recent crisis in the South \nAtlantic.\n13.\tMoreover, in order to foster Latin \nAmerican integration and co-operation, the Latin \nAmerican region must be organized physically. In \nthis respect, the Bolivarian Highway along the \nedge of the jungle, an initiative of President \nBelaunde Terry, which has received broad support \nfrom Latin American and Andean countries, is \ntoday in an advanced stage of completion. In the \nsame spirit, President Belaunde has rescued the \nambitious project of interconnecting the three \nmajor watersheds of the South American continent, \na project which would make it possible to move \nlarge volumes of goods, services and passengers \nin the heart of our region. My Government is \nconfident that, after the technical meeting on \nwatershed inter-connection which took place last \nyear in Lima, we will soon be able to undertake \nthat work.\n14.\tOn the other hand, the project for the \ncreation of a trust fund for the promotion of \nhorizontal technical co-operation with the \ncountries of Central America and the Caribbean, \nwhich I presented at the 6th meeting of the \nthirty-sixth session of the General Assembly, has \nmet with broad support from the countries of \nthat area and from the Administration of UNDP. We \nhope that that fund, too, will be established in \nthe near future.\nSimilarly, my country is participating in the \nnecessary deliberations relating to the \ninter-American system. It is our view that it has \nbecome imperative to re-emphasize the capacity \nfor concerted action among the countries of the \nregion vis-a-vis the only country of the region \nwhich has world-wide interest. This task should \nnot lead to exclusions of any kind, but rather to \na clearer identification of our interests and a \nbetter representation and defence of those \ninterests in continental and world forums.\n16. The number of critical situations in the \nworld has increased and, paradoxically, none of \nthose that have now become traditional has yet \nbeen overcome. The worsening of the situation is \nseriously infecting the United Nations, and the \nconstantly repeated appeals to States to act in \nconformity with the principles of the Charter are \nno longer sufficient. It has become absolutely \nnecessary to prevent the spread of a cynical \nattitude.\n17.\tThe basic elements of this situation are \nan alarming tendency to disregard the obligations \nof international law, in particular the \nobligation to abstain from the resort to \naggression or the use or threat of force; \npolicies of strength and the maintenance of \nspheres of influence or domination; interference \nin the internal affairs of States; the \nimpossibility of getting the process of \ndisarmament under way, and the frustrations \nencountered at the second special session of the \nGeneral Assembly devoted to disarmament; the \nobstacles that are preventing the establishment \nof a new international economic order; the \ndifficulties experienced in concluding the \nprocess of decolonization; policies of apartheid \nand racial dis-crimination; and the crisis in the \nUnited Nations.\n18.\tThe Secretary-General has submitted his \nreport on the work of the Organization, the \nimportance and scope of which will be recognized \nby the world public. This report sums up the \ngenuine anxiety of our peoples and shows the need \nto listen to the voice of reason and morality in \nthe present dramatic circumstances. The Assembly \nwill examine various aspects of the report, \ndebate the proposals it contains and draw from it \nthe new inspiration the Organization needs for \nthe preservation of peace and the betterment of \nmankind and to ensure that it does not fail as \nthe depositary of ideals which are beyond its \nability and the will of our Governments to \nachieve.\nl9. The meagre results of the action of the \nSecurity Council compel us to ask whether the \nassumptions upon which the Organization was \nfounded have been overtaken by events. What is \nrequired is concerted diplomatic action at the \nhighest level, as proposed by the \nSecretary-General, or any other approach which \ncan ensure that the position of political \nprivilege conferred upon the permanent members of \nthe Security Council will be used for the \neffective fulfilment of their responsibilities \nwith regard to international peace and \nco-operation. Otherwise we shall have to consider \namendments to the Charter.\n20.\tWe hope that the Secretary-General's \nfirmness in presenting matters to the Assembly as \nhe sees them and not as we would wish to see them \nwill serve to promote a debate that will review \nthe Orga-nization, because our peoples are beset \nby a two-fold anxiety: daily survival in terrible \neconomic and social conditions, and survival as a \nspecies in the face of the increasing probability \nof a nuclear conflict.\n21.\tOur region has brought to the Assembly \nthe question of the Malvinas Islands. Everybody \nis aware of our support for the principle of \ndecolonization of the Malvinas Islands and for \nthe claim of the sister Republic of Argentina to \nsovereignty over that archipelago. This is also \ncalled for in resolutions of the United Nations \nand the Organization of American States and in \ndeclarations by the movement of non- aligned \ncountries. Faithful to its dedication to peace, \nPeru has made intense and repeated efforts to \nensure a negotiated solution of the conflict and \nwill continue to support negotiations between \nArgentina and the United Kingdom through the \nintermediary of the Secretary-Genera).\n22.\tIn Central America there is a growing \ntendency towards confrontation, and the \nconsiderable difficulties faced by the peoples \nof the area are compounded by forms of foreign \nintervention, political polarization and internal \nand external armed struggle. It is necessary for \nStates both within and outside this region, \ninstead of trying for ideological reasons to \ndecide how others should organize themselves to \ntry urgently to provide broad support for their \ndevelopment.\n23.\tPeru deeply regrets the recent \ndeterioration of the situation in the Middle \nEast. We have made clear our rejection of \nintervention in and military use of the territory \nof Lebanon^ in violation of its indepen-dence and \nsovereignty, the persistence of policies of force \nand the commission of genocidal crimes against \nthe Palestinian people.\n24.\tIn this world forum, in the name of the \nGovernment and people of Peru, I reiterate our \nmost vigorous condemnation, as already expressed \nby the Chief Executive of my country, of these \nacts, which violate the most elementary \nprinciples of human coexistence.\n25.\tRecent developments have clearly and \npainfully shown that the question of Palestine \nconstitutes the central factor of the Middle East \ncrisis. It is our view that for reasons of \nprinciple, of history and of justice, the \nPalestinian people must exercise the inalienable \nrights of all people, as recognized by the \nOrganization.\n26.\tWe renew our appeal to all the parties to \nthe conflict to co-operate in the search for a \ncomprehensive and definitive political \nsettlement, taking into account the rights of all \nthe peoples of the region, within the framework \nof the relevant resolutions adopted by the \nSecurity Council and the General Assembly.\n27.\tThe stability and well-being of \nSouth-East Asia are linked to the problem of \nKampuchea. Peru is a member of the /It/ Committee \nof the International Conference on Kampuchea, \nand we hope that the bases established by the \nGeneral Assembly, under the auspices of the \nSecretary-General, will lead to a negotiated \nsettlement.\n28.\tWe support the steps taken by the \nSecretary- General with respect to Afghanistan \nand Cyprus. Only with the political will of the \nparties will it be possible to achieve just and \nbalanced agreements which, as in the case of \nKampuchea, presupposes the withdrawal of foreign \ntroops and self-determination for the peoples \ninvolved.\n29.\tPeru hopes that the question of Korea can \nbe resolved by peaceful and negotiated means by \nthe parties.\n30.\tThe struggle for independence in \nTerritories that have not yet overcome \ncolonialism continues. Namibia must be rescued \nfrom the illegal occupation from which it is \nsuffering. Peru, an active member of the Special \nCommittee against apartheid; condemns and rejects \nthis practice, which is an infringement of human \ndignity.\n31.\tThe United Nations Convention on the Law \nof the Sea' is the fruit of a long and arduous \neffort to reconcile the rights and interests of \nStates in different circumstances by means of \nuniversal rules ensuring the rational utilization \nof the ocean areas not as an instrument of \nhegemony but as an instrument of justice, peace, \nsecurity, co-operation, development and \nwell-being for all peoples. Each State must now \nevaluate the advantages of a legal order, respect \nfor and implementation of which would protect \ntheir most essential rights and interests both \nwithin and outside zones of national \njurisdiction. My Government is making such an \nassessment in the light of certain provisions of \nour Constitution and the laws of our Republic. It \nwill be for the Congress of my country to express \nits approval or disapproval of the Convention. \nMeanwhile we shall follow with close attention \nthe statements made by other Governments, in the \nhope that the will for justice and international \nconcord will prevail.\n32.\tPeru will continue to defend its rights \nof sovereignty and jurisdiction over its \nadjacent waters and the sea-bed and subsoil \nthereof to the limit of 200 miles, for the \npurposes that have been foreseen since 1947, as \npart of its maritime territory and without \nprejudice to freedom of international \ncommunication. Furthermore, it will not renounce \nthe defence of the rules established by the \nDeclaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed \nand the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof, \nbeyond the Limits of National Juris-diction, \nadopted in 1970 Those principles have been \nincorporated in the Convention, according to \nwhich the sea bed and its resources outside the \nlimits of national jurisdiction constitute the \ncommon heritage of mankind and can be exploited \nonly for the benefit of all countries, under an \ninternational regime and international machinery. \nWe shall regard as illegal any use of the \ninternational sea-bed zone by States that have \nadopted unilateral legislation or which have \nsubscribed to agreements of reciprocity contrary \nto the principles of the Convention. We trust \nthat those States will refrain from following a \ncourse whose implications would be very grave in \nthe area of international law and in the \ndevelopment of friendly co-operation among \ncountries, as well as in relation to policies \napplicable to other areas of ocean space.\n33.\tThe results of the second special session \nof the General Assembly devoted to disarmament \nare discouraging. Not only was there no progress \nwith respect to what had been agreed at the first \nspecial session on disarmament, but the consensus \nof 1978 itself has apparently been challenged.\n34.\tIt is indispensable that all countries of \nthe international community, particularly the \nnuclear Powers, participate in a new effort to \nmove forward in the complex problem of \ndisarmament. For its part, Peru will continue to \nexert efforts, both internationally and \nregionally, to effect limitation of arms \nexpenditures and to protect Latin America and \nother regions of the developing world from the \nnuclear threat, in the conviction that the goal \nof disarmament will be reached only by approaches \nthat take due account of the interests of all \nparties.\n35.\tWe are witnessing a day-by-day \ndeterioration of the opportunities for diplomatic \nnegotiation and political agreement. In view of \nthis, the movement of non-aligned countries \nclearly has a role to play. Its objectives and \nits reason for existence as an independent \nfactor in international relations have become all \nthe more significant and relevant in view of the \ngrim picture we are facing in all parts of the \nworld.\n36.\tThe international economic situation \ncould not be more critical. Inflation and \nrecession continue to be the main features of a \ncrisis that has ceased to be a mere slump in the \nbusiness cycle. While it is true that the crisis \naffects everyone, it is also true that we are not \nall equally affected. Unemployment is the most \nserious social consequence of the international \neconomic crisis, but the developing countries, \nunlike the industrialized countries, find it \ndifficult to provide help for the unemployed. \nCapital goods have continued to rise in price, \nin inverse proportion to the prices of raw \nmaterials. Financing for development projects is \nbecoming increasingly costly and difficult to \nfind. The industrialized countries\u00f3some more than \nothers\u00f3are beginning to introduce tariff and non- \ntariff barriers which are contrary to the spirit \nof free trade that they themselves champion. The \nmounting external debt now constitutes for all \ncountries, industrialized and developing alike, \nboth a burden and a thread not only to their \neconomic progress but to the very stability of \nthe international financial system.\n37.\tThings cannot be allowed to remain as \nthey are much longer. The international economic \ncrisis is the result of grave difficulties of a \npolitical and social order fisting the \ninternational community. The sense of urgency \namong peoples of the world today is accompanied \nby a deep frustration at the lack of \nunderstanding and inability Governments have \ndemonstrated in finding common approaches to \nalleviating the tragic situation facing them.\n38.\tWe must prevent despair from setting in, \nand we must remove tension in order to facilitate \nthe solution of grave problems that directly \naffect international peace; and security. A \nsupreme effort on the part of all members of the \ninternational community is required to find a \nminimum consensus that will enable them to \nreactivate the world economy, at the same time \ntaking care to prevent the return of inflation.\n39.\tWe therefore consider it to be \nappropriate to agree on an emergency world \neconomic plan, in which all States and \ninternational organizations would participate \nwithout discrimination or self-exclusion. To that \neffect, my Government will put forward at Session \nof the General Assembly, a proposal for the \nimmediate adoption of such plan, in order to give \nimpetus to the recovery of the world economy.\n40.\tAt the same time, we must continue our \nefforts for the construction of a new \ninternational economic order. We must emphasize \nthat the launching of global negotiations is an \nimperative need for the international community \nas a whole, in order to rebuild, from the ground \nup, the imbalanced system of international \neconomic relations.\n41.\tMy Government recognizes the position \nassumed by the developed countries at the \nVersailles Economic Summit in June, and is \nprepared to co-operate closely W3th the rest of \nthe countries of the Group of 77, in the \ndefinition of a consensus that would permit the \nearliest possible beginning of global \nnegotiations. In view of the urgency of the \npresent circumstances, my Government expresses \nthe hope that at this session the General \nAssembly will adopt a resolution stipulating the \nbeginning of global negotiations.\n42.\tPeru is also aware of the importance of \nthe sixth session of UNCTAD, to be held next year \nin Belgrade. The serious problems faced by the \ndeveloping countries make it imperative that that \nConference achieves specific results, especially \nin the important areas of primary commodities, \ntrade, currency and finance.\n43.\tPeru also reiterates its support for the \nIntegrated Programme for Commodities and the \nCommon Fund for Commodities, as a central \ninstrument for the organization of international \ntrade in such com-modities.\n44.\tMy country, as a member of the \nConsultative Group of 18, is participating in \npreparations for the ministerial meeting of GATT \nto be held later this year. We find it \nindispensable that that meeting attach priority \nto the interests of the developing countries in \nview of the reduced benefits that they have \nderived from multilateral trade negotiations, \nbearing in mind that the process of global \nnegotiations must not be disturbed.\n45.\tPeru wishes to reaffirm the great \nimportance of South-South co-operation for the \ndeveloping countries and unreservedly supports \nthe implementation of the Programme of Action \nadopted at the High-Level Conference on Economic \nCo-operation among Developing Countries in May \n1981 at Caracas.^ In this context, we support the \nimmediate convening of a meeting to establish a \ngeneralized system of preferences among the \ndeveloping countries as a practical and effective \nmeans of promoting our economic links.\n46.\tNext year the Republics of America will \ncelebrate the two hundredth anniversary of the \nbirth of the Liberator, Simon Bolivar, the \nfounder of nations, a man of his time and of our \ntime. We hope that his spirit of freedom and \njustice will preside over the endeavours of \nGovernments today and we pay a well-deserved \ntribute to his memory and to his work.\n47.\tThis thirty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly is taking place in particularly \ndifficult circumstances. It has been many years \nsince we have seen an economic crisis such as \nthat of today, in which communication among \nStates is so charged with anxiety and \ndiscouragement is so prevalent among our peoples.\n48.\tOur country has demonstrated its \ndedication to peace, defence of the principles of \nlaw and international conciliation, which we do \nnot wish to abandon. We believe that the only way \nin which the urgent problems of mankind can be \nfaced and overcome is through negotiation, and we \nreaffirm our faith in the United Nations as the \nhighest forum of the peoples. For all these \nreasons, we declare that Peru will spare no \neffort to ensure that this session will be \nqualitatively different from others more \neffective and more committed to the goals of \nreconciliation and harmony, peace, freedom, law \nand justice.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to extend to you, Sir, \nthe congratulations of the Government of Finland \non your election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly. Finns and Hungarians have a common \nethnic and linguistic back\u00acground spanning \nthousands of years. This gives a special \ncharacter to our relationship which was evident \nduring the recent visit by the President of \nFinland to your country. You personally bring to \nyour high office an exceptionally long \nexperiences in, and profound understanding of, \nUnited Nations affairs. These, as well as your \ndetermination and patience, will ensure effective \nguidance of the Assembly's work at this \nparticularly crucial time.\n243.\tThe Secretary-General is not only the \nchief administrative officer of the Organization; \nhe is also the symbol and the guardian of its \nauthority. In Mr. Perez de Cuellar the United \nNations has a Secre\u00actary-General who has shown \nthat he will perform those functions well. His \nstrength of will\u2014sisu we would call it in \nFinnish\u2014combined with political realism are both \nnecessary for fulfilling the tasks entrusted to \nhim by the Charter.\n244.\tThe new Secretary-General has taken \noffice at a particularly thankless time. Rarely \nhas the interna-tional environment been less \namenable to peaceful resolution of disputes by \ncollective action through the United Nations. The \nSecretary-General himself has made a profound \nanalysis of this situation and the reasons for \nit. His report on the work of the Organi\u00aczation \ngives a graphic description of the erosion of the \nauthority of the Organization. His suggestions \nfor restoring the authority and ability of the \nUnited Nations to act are of crucial importance \nand have the full support of my Government.\n245.\tThe viability of the collective security \nsystem, as provided for by the Charter, is of \nparticular concern to small countries such as \nthose comprising the Nordic group. The Government \nof Finland has therefore followed with growing \nconcern the gradual weakening of the United \nNations in a world of tension and strife. In a \nstatement made in mid-August on behalf of the \nGovernment of Finland, I had occasion to expound \non that same theme. The matter was further \ndiscussed at the meeting of the Nordic Foreign \nMinisters in Helsinki who agreed to study amongst \nthemselves and with other Member States which \nshare this concern ways and means to remedy the \nsituation. Taking into account those \nconsultations, we intend to return to this matter \nin greater detail.\n246.\tAs a small neutral country, Finland has \nsought and found security not through reliance on \nmilitary alliances but through a foreign policy \ndesigned to keep it outside international \nconflicts and controversies. We have a vested \ninterest in promoting the development of a \npeaceful and rational world order based on the \nuniversal collective security system provided by \nthe Charter. In the words of the \nSecretary-General: \\\"Without such a system there \nwill be no reliable defense or shelter for the \nsmall and weak. And without such a system all of \nour efforts on the economic and social side, \nwhich also need their own collective impetus, may \nwell falter.\\\"\n247.\tIn his report the Secretary-General warns \nus that we are perilously near to a new \ninternational anarchy. In fact, the notion that \nit pays to use force to solve international \nproblems is gaining currency. Regional and local \nconflicts have erupted into open warfare. \nInternational tension mounts. Relations between \ngreat Powers have steadily deteriorated. \nConfrontation has replaced dialogue and \ncompetition has overwhelmed accommodation. The \narms race continues. Resources badly needed for \nthe alleviation of poverty and hungers are \nsquandered on the perfec\u00action of instruments of \ndeath. Confidence in the pos-sibility of peaceful \nsettlement of disputes is breaking down. The \ninternational system which was set up to maintain \npeace and security and to promote interna\u00actional \nco-operation is in jeopardy.\n248.\tThis year has put the United Nations \nsecurity system to a harsh test. It has to meet \nthis challenge if it wishes to survive. The \nconflict in th3 MiddleEast has assumed a new \ndimension of violence compounded by the Israeli \ninvasion of Lebanon. The question of the Falkland \nIslands (Malvinas) led to a bloody military \nconflict. The war between Iran and Iraq \ncontinues, causing devastation and suffering.\n249.\tIn addition, the persistent problems of \nthe situation in southern Africa, South-East \nAsia, Afghani-stan, Central America, Western \nSahara and the Horn of Africa stand unresolved. \nAll these remain ques-tions of legitimate concern \nto the international com\u00acmunity, yet the United \nNations has been ignored or pushed aside. Its \npotential for crisis management and peaceful \nsettlement of disputes has been neglected.\n250.\tThe United Nations has not been listened \nto; there has been scant willingness to use its \nservices. At worst, the authority of the United \nNations has been flouted. The abuse of the United \nNations for short- term interests has \novershadowed its ultimate im\u00acportance to all \nMember States as the only universal Organization \nfor finding peaceful and negotiated solu\u00actions to \nglobal problems.\n251.\tIn his report the Secretary-General has \nproposed concrete measures to halt the erosion of \nthe authority of the United Nations and to \nrestore its capacity to act. The \nSecretary-General proposes, as a first step, that \nGovernments consciously recommit themselves to \nthe Charter. He proposes that the Security \nCouncil keep an active watch on dangerous \nsituations and, if necessary, initiate \ndiscussions with the parties before they reach a \npoint of crisis. He considers it useful for the \nCouncil to give renewed consideration to \nreviewing and streamlining its practices and \npro\u00accedures with a view to acting swiftly and \ndecisively in crises. He appeals to the permanent \nmembers of the Security Council to reassess their \nobligations and to fulfill them at the high level \nof responsibility indicated in the Charter. He \nintends to develop a wider and more systematic \ncapability for fact-finding in potential \ncon\u00acflict areas, in close co-ordination with the \nSecurity Council. He proposes that the authority \nof peace\u00ackeeping operations be underpinned by \nguarantees, including explicit guarantees for \ncollective or indi\u00acvidual supportive action. For \nits part, my Government pledges its full support \nfor all these measures suggested by the \nSecretary-General.\n252.\tAs a matter of consistent policy, Finland \nhas taken a balanced and conciliatory position on \nthe various controversial issues in the world. It \nis our firm intention to continue this policy. We \nbelieve that Finland can best contribute to the \nsearch for a just and durable world order through \nstrict and consistent adherence to a policy of \nneutrality which, while it enjoins us to refrain \nfrom taking sides in disputes between the great \nPowers, enables us to maintain friendly relations \nwith all States across the dividing lines of \nideology or military alignments and thus to work \nwhenever possible for the cause of conciliation \nand the peaceful settlement of disputes. Neutral \nStates have, we believe, a special obligation, \nnot only to themselves but to the international \ncommunity as a whole, to conduct themselves with \nobjectivity and restraint in order to retain the \nconfidence of all sides and thus the ability to \nperform such peaceful services as may be required \nin the interests of international peace and \nsecurity.\n253.\tThe situation in the Middle East is often \nperceived as a regional conflict. This conception \nbelittles the pivotal political, strategic and \neconomic importance of the region, which \ntranscends the regional confines of the conflict. \nThe situation in the Middle East continues to \npose the most persistent threat to international \npeace and security. The dangers inherent in the \nabsence of peace in the Middle East have been \ndemonstrated once again by the events in Lebanon. \nIsrael has invaded and occupied and con\u00actinues to \noccupy a major part of a sovereign State Member \nof the United Nations, in defiance of the \nrepeated calls by the Security Council and the \ninterna\u00actional community as a whole. The tragedy \nof Lebanon has been compounded by the massacre of hundreds \nof innocent civilians in the refugee camps of \nSabra and Shatila. On 20 September the Government \nof Finland expressed its profound shock at that \ntragic event and gave its full support to \nSecurity Council resolution 521 (1982). Having \nentered west Beirut with the declared aim of \nmaintaining law and order in Beirut, Israel \ncannot now escape its responsibility for what \ntook place.\n254.\tIn the conditions prevailing the \nimmediate concern of the international community \nhas under-standably focused on the crisis in \nLebanon. That crisis, however, should be seen in \na wider context. It is but a consequence of the \nunresolved situation in the Middle East as a \nwhole. In our view the basic principles of a \npeaceful settlement remain immutable. The \nacquisition of territories by force is \ninadmissible. Israel therefore must withdraw from \nterritories occupied since 1967. It is equally \nimperative that the right of Israel and all other \nStates in the area to exist within secure and \nrecognized boundaries be guaranteed. Those \nprinciples are embodied in Security Council \nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which we \ncontinue to regard as basic. Furthermore, \nprovision must be made for the legitimate rights \nof the Pal\u00acestinians, including their right to \nnational self- determination. This presupposes \nthe right of the Palestinians and the PLO, as the \nmost significant representative of their national \naspirations, to par\u00acticipate in negotiations on \ntheir own future within a comprehensive solution \nin the Middle East.\n255.\tFinland has given its support to all \nthose pro\u00acposals and initiatives that aim at a \ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace in the \nMiddle East. Thus we supported the joint approach \nby the United States and the Soviet Union in \n1977, the Camp David process and the initiatives \nby the European Community and the King of Saudi \nArabia. In this general context, the initiatives \nby President Reagan and President Brezhnev and \nthe proposals made at the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference are of great significance. While these \ninitiatives approach the problem from different \npremises, they all have a common denominator: the \nachievement of peace in the Middle East through \nnegotiations. In substance they also have a \nnumber of basically identical or similar \nelements. In line with this general approach, the \nGovernment of Finland has recently given its \nsupport to another request bom out of the tragic \nconflict in Lebanon and addressed to the \nSecretary-General that he exert his influence to \nconvene an international conference on the \nquestion of the Middle East.\n256.\tIn southern Africa the Namibian problem \ncon\u00actinues to pose a basic challenge to the \nOrganization. My country has ties of friendship \nwith the Namibian people that span more than a \ncentury. Our commit-ment to early independence \nfor Namibia has been demonstrated by our \ninitiatives and contributions in different United \nNations forums. Based on a Finnish initiative, \nthe International Court of Justice declared, in \nits advisory opinion in 1971, that the presence \nof South Africa in Namibia was illegal. The \nUnited Nations Fund for Namibia and the \nNationhood Pro\u00acgramme for Namibia have also been \nlaunched on our initiatives.\n257.\tAt present, the urgency of arriving at an \ninter\u00acnationally acceptable solution to the \nquestion of Namibia is more pressing than ever. \nWe support every effort towards a negotiated \nsettlement and hope that the people of Namibia \nmay be permitted without delay to determine their \nown future through free and fair elections, under \nthe supervision and control of the United \nNations, as provided in Security Council \nresolution 435 (1978).\n258.\tFinland stands on its own record of \ncontributing to the goal of a free and \nindependent Namibia not only in words, but in \ndeeds. It is natural therefore that we have \npledged our best efforts to the imple-mentation \nof the United Nations plan by making Namibia a \nmajor recipient of our bilateral development aid \nand by keeping a peace-keeping battalion in a \nstate of preparedness should the Security Council \nand the parties concerned choose to avail themselves \nof our services in this respect.\n259.\tInternational tension fuels the arms \nrace, while the arms race feeds on tension. This \nis the deadly logic of reality. The arms race \nseems to be out\u00acstripping all efforts to contain \nand control it. The continually increasing pace \nof the arms race ultimately serves the interests \nof none. Its new technological dimensions may \neven undermine global strategic stability, \nhowever imperfect and fragile. The arms race as a \nthreat to the security of nations was the \npredominant theme when the special session of the \nGeneral Assembly on disarmament convened last \nJune. It generated a very high degree of public \nattention and interest. Anxiety about the danger \nof nuclear war had given rise to an increasingly \nactive world public. It would be a mistake to \nbelittle its significance. For all the intense \nwork and bargaining, the special session failed \nto produce a commonly acceptable substantive \ndocument.\n260.\tProgress or lack of progress, in \ndisarmament is dictated by political realities. \nThe past few years have again shown how \ndisarmament negotiations only too easily fall \nvictim to political confrontation. Yet at times \nof confrontation, disarmament negotiations would \nbe particularly urgent, both politically and \nmilitarily.\n26 L Since the introduction of nuclear weapons \nmore than a generation ago, nuclear arsenals have \ngrown in size, sophistication and destructiveness \nbeyond any conceivable purpose. The development \nand refinement of nuclear weapons have proved to \nbe the most dynamic field of advancing arms \ntechnology. Ulti\u00acmately, such advances may upset \nglobal strategic stability, an outcome that would \nhave incalculable consequences. It is equally \nalarming that the develop\u00acment of military \ntechnology is likely to complicate any future \nefforts to curb the arms race. It will be ever \nmore difficult to agree as to what weapons should \nbe limited, and how.\n262.\tThe two major nuclear Powers, the Soviet \nUnion and the United States, have the main \nresponsi-bility for constraining the nuclear arms \nrace. They have recognized that responsibility by \nengaging in the strategic arms limitation talks \nin the early 1970s. The agreements reached have \nmarked limited but not insignificant efforts \ntowards constraining the arms race and reducing \nthe danger of nuclear war. The continuation of \nthe dialogue is, furthermore, in itself a vitally \nimportant arms control measure and has intrinsic \npolitical value. The Government of Finland has \ntherefore welcomed the resumption of the \nstrategic arms dialogue between the Soviet Union \nand the United States last June. It is obvious \nthat the negotia\u00actions will prove long and \narduous. Nevertheless, the goal should be a \nsignificant quantitative and qualitative \nreduction in nuclear arsenal.\n263.\tNuclear weapons are a particularly acute \ncon\u00accern to the nations of Europe, the continent \nof the deadliest concentration of weapons. It is \nan urgent necessity for Europe to reach concrete \nand compre-hensive results in the Geneva talks on \nnuclear weapons. The goal should be to eliminate \nthe danger of nuclear weapons, deployed or \nscheduled to be deployed.\n264.\tThe Committee on Disarmament has not for \nthe past few years produced tangible results in \nthe form of draft treaties on arms limitation. \nThis is to be regretted.\nThe Committee on Disarmament, as the central body \nof the United Nations disarmament machinery, must \nintensify its work. Its agenda reflects the \nagreed priorities among disarmament issues: the \nsecurity of non-nuclear-weapon States, the \nprohibition and destruction of chemical weapons \nand the cessation of all nuclear testing. Finland \nis prepared to continue its fullest possible \ncontribution to this work.\n265.\tIn the post-war era, the Nordic region \nhas been largely untouched by international \ntension. Our security environment is one of \nstability. The absence of nuclear weapons in the \nregion is an important feature of this situation. \nIt is the basis of the idea of estab\u00aclishing a \nNordic nuclear-weapon-free zone. Finland will \ncontinue to pursue this idea. As emphasized by \n6th President of Finland, Mr. Mauno Koivisto, \nsuch a measure by the Nordic countries would \nconsolidate regional security. The question of \nsuch a zone has been discussed between the Nordic \nGovernments in various forums, most recently by \nthe Foreign Ministers at their meeting last \nAugust. The Ministers agreed to maintain contact \non the issue.\n266.\tIn view of our interest in \nnuclear-weapon-free zones, it is natural that \neight years ago Finland took the initiative at \nthe United Nations to undertake a comprehensive \nstudy on the question of nuclear- weapon-free \nzones. Since the study, progress has been \nachieved in arrangements for such zones. New \ncon\u00accrete ideas envisaging the establishment of \nnuclear- weapon-free zones in various regions \nsuggest the need for updating the comprehensive \nstudy to reflect new realities. It could \nfacilitate the creation of such zones and thus \nadvance limitation of nuclear arms. Finland \nproposed an updated study at the second special \nsession devoted to disarmament and will pursue it \nduring the present session.\n267.\tThe proliferation of nuclear weapons is a \nthreat to all States, nuclear and non-nuclear \nalike. It is par\u00acticularly serious in regions \nwhere international peace and security are \nalready in jeopardy. The Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons remains the \nbest instrument to combat that threat. As long as \nsome nations remain aloof from the Treaty and \nrefuse to accept interna\u00actional safeguards on all \ntheir nuclear activities, sus\u00acpicion about their \nintentions is justified. This also hampers \ninternational co-operation in the peaceful uses \nof nuclear energy, the benefits of which all \nnations should equally share. In this respect, we \nattach great importance to the forthcoming United \nNations Conference on the Promotion of \nInternational Co\u00acoperation in the Peaceful Uses \nof Nuclear Energy.\n268.\tWhile nuclear weapons represent the most \nawesome threat, this should not overshadow the \nproblem of conventional weapons. The conventional \nweapon is not only a threat but an instrument of \ndeath and destruction used every day. Efforts \ntowards conventional disarmament and control of \narms transfers should therefore be intensified, \nboth globally and regionally. Results from the \nVienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces, \nArmaments and As\u00acsociated Measures in Central \nEurope continue to be urgent.\n269.\tThe signatory States of the Conference on \nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe should make \nevery effort to reach a decision on a conference \non confidence-building and security-building \nmeasures and disarmament in Europe as envisaged \nin the follow- up meeting of the Conference in \nMadrid. A success\u00acful outcome of the Madrid \nmeeting, which was inau\u00acgurated two years ago, is \nof utmost importance in the present international \nsituation. The persistent efforts of this meeting \nand the results achieved so far are proof of a \nwidely and seriously felt need to preserve the \nprocess itself in order to revive and enhance its \ncon\u00actribution to detente in Europe. A successful \noutcome of the Madrid meeting would not only have \na positive effect on the relations between the \nEuropean States, but also have an impact on the \ninternational situation as a whole.\n270.\tThe Charter of the United Nations \nestablished respect and promotion of human rights \nas one of the main principles of the \nOrganization. In terms of the Preamble, respect \nfor human rights is equal in urgency with saving \nfuture generations from the scourge of war. The \nUnited Nations has created an ample body of \ninternational legislation on human rights. Yet \nthe implementation of these rights and freedoms \nis woefully inadequate. Violations of human \nrights are the rule rather than an exception. Yet \nall Member States have undertaken a solemn \ncommitment to promote and respect human rights. \nObservance of human rights is not an option but \nan obligation. The rights of man are not \ndependent on political or ideological \nconsiderations.\n271.\tThe Finnish views and values in the field \nof human rights are well known. They are based on \nthe Nordic concept of freedom, solidarity and \njustice. While we firmly believe in the validity \nof these funda-mental convictions, we are equally \naware that the international work in this Held \ncan best be carried out on the basis of common, \naccepted codes of conduct; no purpose is served \nby attempts to impose one set of values on \nanother. ESorts towards finding common ground are \ntherefore of primary importance. On the whole we \nsee a great task for all countries in promoting \nand implementing human rights, both nationally \nand internationally. Success in this task will \nhelp to strengthen the rule of law and build a \ndurable world order in peace and security. It is \non that basis that Finland approaches its term as \nrepresentative of the Nordic countries in the \nCommission on Human Rights.\n272.\tThe plight of an increasing number of \nrefugees and displaced persons fleeing wars, \noppression and persecution bears witness to a \nserious aspect of human rights violations. \nRefugee outflows confront the United Nations and \nits Member States with some of their most \npressing humanitarian, legal and political \nproblems. The response of the international \ncom\u00acmunity to the tragedy of the massive refugee \nexodus cannot be limited to humanitarian concern \nbut must encompass all aspects of the problem, \nincluding its underlying causes.\n273.\tThe Government of Finland notes with \nsatis\u00acfaction that the United Nations Convention \non the Law of the Sea'^ was adopted last spring \nwith the support of an overwhelming majority of \nStates, although full consensus could not be \nreached. The general acceptance of the \nConvention, which could well be the most \nsignificant legal instrument of this century, is \nobviously not in doubt. It is therefore of great \nimportance that the Convention gain the widest \npossible adherence in order to serve its purpose \nin accordance with General Assembly resolution \n2749 (XXV), the Declaration of Principles \nGoverning the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor, and \nthe Subsoil There\u00acof, beyond the Limits of \nNational Jurisdiction. A satisfactory order \ngoverning the world's oceans would greatly reduce \nthe possibilities of inter-State conflicts and \nconsolidate the role of the United Nations in the \ncodification and progressive development of \ninterna\u00actional law in other fields of human \nendeavor also.\n274.\tIn his report the Secretary-General has \ndrawn attention to the crisis in multilateralism. \nHis analysis applies also to international \neconomic co-operation. The lack of confidence in \nthe multilateral negotiating mechanism, the \nincreasing resort to unilateral action in the \nfield of trade and the decreasing financial \nbacking of multilateral development institutions \nall point to this crisis in multilateralism.\n275.\tThe prolonged delay in launching the \nglobal round of negotiations on international \neconomic co-operation and development is a case \nin point; yet, given the global dimensions of \nmany of the difficulties currently affecting \nnational economies, a global effort to tackle \nthose difficulties should call for general \nsupport. The envisaged global round should not, \nhowever, hold up urgent remedial action. \nNegotia\u00actions in various economic forums must be \nvigorously pursued and all multilateral \ninstitutions must be fully utilized.\n276.\tThe tendency to resort to unilateral \ntrade measures as a means of coping with \nstructural problems in the world economy causes \nserious concern. With a Western market economy \nheavily dependent on international trade, my \ncountry is affected by these developments. We \nsincerely hope that the forth-coming ministerial \nmeeting of GATT may strengthen the determination \nto maintain a free and open multi\u00aclateral trading \nsystem and to resist protectionist pressures. The \nsixth session of UNCTAD, to be held next spring, \ncan for its part give new stimulus to the \nNorth-South dialogue, which at present lacks \ndynamism.\n277.\tThe severity of the liquidity problems \nfaced by many developing countries is a serious \nissue not only for those countries but also for \nworld trade as a whole. As a result of their \ndebt-servicing problems, developing countries \nhave had to resort to growth- reducing policies. \nThe poorest among them have fared particularly \nbadly. They are entitled to the special concern \nof and action by the international community.\n278.\tMultilateral development institutions \ncontribute to a more equitable geographical \ndistribution of aid, taking particularly into \naccount the needs of the poorest countries. Those \ninstitutions must be provided with necessary \nresources, and that can be done only by reversing \nthe decrease in official development assis\u00actance \nin general and in multilateral aid in particular.\n279.\tFinland will continue its strong support \nfor multilateral development activities. In our \ndevelop\u00acment policies we have traditionally \nconcentrated on the poorest countries. Finland \nhas committed itself to allocating at least 30 \nper cent of its bilateral assis\u00actance to the \nleast developed countries, in compliance with the \nSubstantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s \nfor the Least Developed Countries adopted at the \nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed \nCountries. We have also consistently emphasized \nthe value and the unique role of United Nations \nprogrammes aimed at human resources development. \nIn that spirit, my Government is pro\u00acposing for \n1983 to increase the Finnish contribution to UNDP \nagain by 14 per cent and to double our support to \nUNICEF.\n280.\tOn this occasion I wish to reaffirm the \ndeter\u00acmination of the Finnish Government to \ncontinue the rapid growth of our international \naid program. This year Finland has reached the \nmedium-term target aimed at doubling the share of \ngross national product for official development \nassistance which we set ourselves five years ago. \nThe budget proposal for 1983 includes a further \nincrease of aid appropriations by 28 per cent. \nThis means that we are well on our way to \nreaching the United Nations target of 0.7 per \ncent before the end of the decade.\n281.\tWhile the realities of the present \ninternational situation seem to give little cause \nfor encouragement, this should make us more aware \nof our duties as Mem\u00acbers of the United Nations. \nThe United Nations is the principal instrument \navailable to the international community for the \nmaintenance of international peace and security. \nIt is the only universal forum where the nations \nof the world can unite their efforts for that \npurpose. The Charter of the United Nations is not \nsimply an expression of the aspirations of the \ninterna\u00actional community: it is a legally binding \ndocument through which nations, big and small, \nhave accepted a code of conduct for relations \nbetween them. These obligations transcend \nconsiderations of political expediency, which \nonly too often lead to their viola\u00action. During \nits existence the United Nations has proved its \nviability as an instrument for preventing \nconflicts and assisting the peaceful settlement \nof disputes, for enhancing the rule of law and \npromoting human rights and economic development, \nwhenever it has been given the opportunity to do \nso. Finland therefore remains committed to the \nUnited Nations as the principal instrument for \nthe maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity and for averting the impending anarchy \nof which the Secretary-General warns us.\n"

        "file_text": "113.\tSheikh ALHEGELAN (Saudi Arabia) I wish at the outset to \nconvey to you, Sir, our sincere congratulations on your well-deserved \nelection to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly. That election was indeed a wise decision and \ntestifies to your great competence for this post. 1 cannot fail to \npay a tribute to the outgoing President of the thirty-sixth session \nof the general Assembly, Mr. Kittani, and to express to him my \ncountry's very great appreciation of his untiring efforts in \npresiding over the proceedings of the general Assembly. 1 also thank \nhim sincerely for his successful presidency of that session. It gives \nme great pleasure, too, to express on behalf of the Kingdom of Saudi \nArabia our sincere congratulations to Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his \nelection as Secretary-General. We wish to express to him our hopes \nfor his success in strengthening the effectiveness of the \nOrganization so that it can achieve the purposes and principles of \nthe Charter.\n\n114. The thirty-seventh session has opened in an atmosphere of \ntension and anxiety. International conflicts and crises are becoming \nall the more complex and interlinked, and the factors that divide \nnations outweigh those that bring them together. The agenda of the \nAssembly is replete with complex problems that involve a genuine \ndanger to international peace and security. A careful consideration \nof the international situation reveals to us clearly that the gap \nbetween our aspirations to a peaceful world, where relations between \npeoples are based on right and justice, and the actual situation, \ndominated by criteria of force, the policies of hegemony and attempts \nto impose apartheid exists and has indeed probably widened.\n\n113. International relations at present are characterized by grave \nindications of cold war. Polarization breeds instability in the world \nand detente, which marked relations between East and West in the last \ndecade, has turned into confrontation, with unforeseeable \nconsequences.\n\n116. There is an escalation in the arms race. The use and threat of \nforce and terrorism have become dominant characteristics in \ninternational relations. On the other hand, the continued stagnation \nof the North-South dialogue and the resultant widening of the gap \nbetween the industrialized and the developing countries have resulted \nin a further deterioration of the international situation, which has \ndashed the hope of establishing a more stable world. In short, the \nworld is gliding back to the old system based on zones of. political \nand economic influence based on hegemony, domination and dependence. \nThere is no doubt that this is a source of anxiety and fear. Hence we \nmust master all our resources to tackle this grave situation.\n\n117.\tIs it not ironical that man, who in this age has been able to \nachieve incredible progress in science and technology, is unable to \nsolve some of the problems that he himself has caused? Is that not \nenough to make us intensify our efforts to face these challenges and \nseek ways of ensuring stability, peace and security for the \ninternational community and of protecting the interests of peoples \nand nations? It is not enough simply to draw attention to \ninternational crises and problems. In order to solve and eliminate \nthem it is necessary, after taking objective stock of the \ninternational situation, to put forward practical concepts and \npositive ideas which will enable the international community to face \nthe dangers that confront it.\n\n118.\tAs pointed out by His Majesty King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz in hi& \naddress to the Saudi people last August, we in the Kingdom of Saudi \nArabia,\n\n  ... work on the comprehensive international scene within the \nframework of the United Nations, its agencies and organs. We abide by \nits Charter, support its efforts and fight any abnormal action aimed \nat weakening it and restricting the force of international law with a \nview to replacing it by the force of arms and the language of \nterrorism. Our actions have effectively reflected and will continue \nto reflect our sense of commitment to the international community, as \none family, no matter what the difference in interests, and our \nbelief in the principles of peace based on right and justice. We \nbelieve that international security and political stability are \nlinked to economic justice.\n\n119.\tProceeding from that premise, we believe that the following \nconditions must be fulfilled in order to erect a solid edifice of \nrelations between States through which it will be possible to reduce \ninternational tension and overcome many of the dangers that threaten \ninternational peace and security.\n\n120.\tFirst, we join those who insist on the need for reform of the \npresent political system and believe that in this respect the \nfollowing must be taken into account.\n\n121.\tOne of the main things that encourage nations to try to \nacquire zones of influence and to adopt a policy of force to solve \nproblems is that they do not accept the rule of law or respect moral \nand ethical principles. Therefore if such States really want to \nmaintain peace and stability in the world and ensure prosperity, \nprogress, wealth and well-being for the peoples, they must \nscrupulously observe moral principles and be guided by them in the \nlabyrinthine complexities of contemporary international relations. In \nthis respect, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia offers its experience to \nthe international community as its contribution to ensuring stability \nand peace and eliminating the problems that jeopardize the very \nexistence and survival of nations.\n122.\tAs pointed out by His Majesty King Fahd,\n\n  Saudi Arabia is one of the Islamic nations and was created so that \nthe law of God would be respected and God has honoured it by allowing \nit to serve as His house of worship and the sanctuary of His Prophet. \nThus its responsibility was increased, its policy became set and its \nduties expanded. It performs those duties on the international scene \nby respecting God's way of wisdom and morality. Islam is a religion \nof mercy, of mind and of strength; it fights terrorism and overcomes \ndisorder, weakness and humiliation.\n\n123.\tThe United Nations is the principal body for the promotion of \nfreedom, peace, and justice, security and international co-operation. \nTherefore we must make available to it all that it needs to face the \nchallenges that confront it. It should become an effective instrument \nfor promoting world peace and economic and social progress for all. \nIf the Organization is to continue as an effective instrument of \npeace, the peoples of the world should place their trust in it, and \nour commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter should \nbe beyond discussion or doubt.\n\n124.\tThe arms race and the magnitude of the resulting expenditure \nhas increased tension in the world, and that has forced many \ncountries, and especially the least developed, to devote a great \nportion of their limited resources to defence, at the expense of \ntheir progress and economic and social development. We hope that the \nefforts which the international community expects the Organization to \nexertand the positive role that it can play in this respect will lead \nto concrete progress which will protect humanity from the dangers \nwhich threaten it and will spare the developing countries the \nconflicts and struggles for influence that have become a danger to \nhumanity in general.\n\n125.\tSecondly, one of the important goals of our contemporary \nworld and for the future is the establishment of a new and more \nequitable international economic order which will meet the \naspirations of the peoples of the world to higher standards of living \nand a better life. In order to establish such a system we must \ngrapple with the many important economic subjects that demand our \nattention.\n\n126.\tThe agenda includes many subjects and issues of extreme \nimportance as regards international economic co-operation for \ndevelopment. Therefore we deem it important that the launching of a \nnew round of global negotiations be accelerated in a serious attempt \nto improve the economic performance and increase the efficiency of \ninternational co-operation for development.\n\n127.\tIt is regrettable that the general Assembly's efforts aimed \nat the launching of a new round of global economic negotiations have \nbeen hampered by the existence of differences over certain procedural \nquestions which we had earnestly hoped would be solved in the light \nof the conclusions of the International Meeting on Co-operation and \nDevelopment, which was held at Cancun in 1981, for the establishment \nof confidence between developed and developing countries. We also \nmaintain that real efforts should be exerted to achieve the \nobjectives of the International Development Strategy for the Third \nUnited Nations Development Decade and to support in every way\nFAO, WFC, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and WFP \nin their efforts to overcome world food problems in general and to \nincrease food and agricultural aid to Africa.\n\n128.\tI should also like to stress the importance of economic and \ntechnical co-operation among the developing countries. In Saudi \nArabia we consider it to be complementary to but not a substitute for \nco-operation between developed and developing countries. The \ninternational community should pay careful Attention to this.\n\n129.\tThirdly, word peace, security and stability are affected by a \nnumber of international problems at present afflicting the \ninternational community. If we really want to maintain international \npeace and security and to make progress, well-being and prosperity \navailable to the countries and peoples of the world, we must, \nintensify international efforts and work tirelessly to find rapid and \nequitable solutions for those problems. These problems increase and \nworsen with the passing of time and increasingly threaten world peace \nand security.\n\n130.\tIn South Africa, the racist regime continues to enforce a \npolicy of racial discrimination and\tM against the vast majority \nof that country's population. That violates the most elementary \ninternational norms and humanitarian principles. While we support the \npeople of South Africa, we call on the international community to \nexert the necessary pressure on the States which support the racist \nSouth African regime in order to put an end to it and to force the \nregime to submit to the will of the international community. South \nAfrica must cease its invidious practices, immediately halt launching \nattacks on neighbouring African countries, put an end to its \noccupation of Namibia and comply with relevant United Nations \nresolutions.\n\n131.\tWe further call on the international community to take a firm \nstand against the aggressive attitude manifested in the present \nco-operation between South Africa and Israel, especially in the \nnuclear field, and in their joint nuclear tests in particular. That \nposes a direct threat to the peoples of Africa, to the Arab nations \nand to the rest of the peoples of the world.\n\n132.\tOne of the most serious problems facing the international \ncommunity and requiring an effective, urgent solution is that of \nAfghanistan. The continued foreign military interference in the \ninternal affairs of Afghanistan constitutes a flagrant violation by a \nsuperpower of the sovereignty and independence of a small, \nnon-aligned country. Today, after almost three years of Soviet \ninterference in Afghanistan-coupled with continuous acts of \naggression against the Afghan people, against mosques and peaceful \nvillages, bombardment with incendiary bombs, the use of chemical \nwarfare, and violations of the most elementary principles of human \nrights-we once again urge the Soviet Union to withdraw from \nAfghanistan so that the fraternal Afghan people may regain its \nfreedom and independence and have the final say in the choice of its \nleaders and representatives and so that it may exercise sovereignty \nover its own land.\n\n133.\tThe raging war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran \nis another problem which troubles us. Saudi Arabia is pained by that \nwar, because it is being waged between two Islamic countries. In this \nregard, we wish to express our hope that the Iranian Government will \nrespond to Iraq's offers and to the missions of good offices of the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, the United Nations and the \nnon-aligned movement, so that a just settlement may be achieved, thus \nending the bloodshed and destruction, establishing a good-neighbourly \npolicy. That solution would be based on the principles of \nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States and \ninternational law.\n\n134. One of the gravest problems threatening international peace and \nsecurity, one which is prejudicing stability and prosperity, not only \nin the Middle East but throughout the world, stems from Israel's \ncontinuing aggression and its terrible racist settlements policy. \nIsrael's continuing defiance and its aggression constitute a most \ndangerous factor in the Palestinian issue, which is an important \nissue for all those who believe in the right of every people to \nself-determination and the right to expression of free will. When we \nspeak of Israeli aggression, we do net describe it merely as \naggression against a secure people settled in its own homeland, or as \nusurpation of that people's territory and property, or as disregard \nfor all human ideals, or as a flagrant violation of and challenge to \nthe resolutions of the Organization. We describe it as aggression \nagainst the Charter of the United Nations and all the ethical and \nhumanitarian principles enshrined therein.\n\n133. I do not wish to go into the history of the Palestinian \nquestion, which stretches back over 34 years. We in Saudi Arabia \nconsider this our primary cause, but it has rightly become the cause \nof the whole world. It has absorbed more of the efforts of the \nOrganization than any other issue. Despite recognition by most of the \ncountries and peoples of the world of the inalienable rights of the \nPalestinian people, including its right to self-determination and to \nthe establishment of an independent State on its own territory, and \ndespite the fact that the international community has come \nincreasingly to recognize the PLO as the sole legitimate \nrepresentative of the Palestinian people, Israel persists in its \naggressive policy and its imperialist settlement policy on the land \nof Palestine.\n\n136.\tBy means of its policy of physically liquidating the \nPalestinian people, and its attempts to distort the history of \nPalestine and destroy its religious and cultural institutions, as \nwell as to bring about changes in the demographic pattern there, \nIsrael is attempting to put an end to Palestinian identity, with no \nrespect either for international public opinion or for the United \nNations.\n\n137.\tIf Palestine is our primary cause, the Holy City of Jerusalem \nis its essence. In this connection, Saudi Arabia, on its own behalf \nand on behalf of the Islamic countries which are members of the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, reaffirms its determination \nto preserve the Islamic Arab character of Jerusalem and to return the \nHoly City to Arab sovereignty, under which it was always a meeting \nplace for all believers in the three revealed religions and a place \nof hope, tolerance and coexistence for the followers of the various \nreligions.\n138. Israel persists in following a policy of force and aggression, \nand it does not confine its aggression against the Palestinian people \nto occupied Palestine. It goes far beyond that territory to commit \nacts of aggression against neighbouring Arab countries. The flagrant \nand barbaric act of aggression against the fraternal people of \nLebanon, and all the consequent massacres, which constitute a source \nof shame for all of humanity, are a violation of the principles and \nnorms of international law and signal a return to the law of the \njungle. They are a setback for the principles and ideals which the \ninternational community has observed, enshrined and safeguarded.\n\n139.\tIsrael's use, in its barbaric aggression against Lebanon, of \nthe most destructive and deadly weapons against civilians-women, \nchildren and the aged- does not merely reveal Israel's malicious, \naggressive, terrorist and evil nature; it also lays responsibility at \nthe door of the countries that supply Israel with weapons. \nSophisticated weaponry flows to Israel under the fallacy, which has \nbeen spread throughout the Western world and of which Israel has been \nable to convince the highest-level politicians, that it is needed for \nIsrael to secure its safety. But that is a very dangerous policy and \nIsrael's arsenal and nuclear capability have become a direct threat \nto world peace and security.\n\n140.\tIsrael's theory of security is the most dangerous and \naggressive that has been seen in our era. It is no less dangerous \nthan the Nazi and Fascist theories which dragged the world into a \ndestructive war. Today in the Middle East, the Zionists are trying to \napply the same theories as the Nazis applied in Europe before the \nSecond World War.\n\n141.\tThe barbaric acts committed by Israel in west Beirut, to \nwhich thousands of Palestinian refugees -women, children and the \naged-have fallen victim in the Shatila and Sabra camps, are but \nfurther confirmation of Israel's aggressive nature and criminal \ncharacter. These massacres of innocent and defenceless civilians were \nnot only aimed at the Palestinian and Lebanese people, but are a \nshameful stigma for humanity itself. They have given the lie to \nIsrael's calumny and its fallacious claims that Israeli troops \nentered west Beirut to maintain peace and security. For it has been \nproved beyond doubt that this flagrant act of aggression was aimed at \nliquidating the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples.\n\n142.\tWe call on the international community to support Lebanon, to \nassist it in regaining its sovereignty and securing the unconditional \nwithdrawal of the Israeli invading forces from its territory, and to \ntake all necessary measures against Israel so that it will be unable \nto pursue the policy of hegemony and force that it has tried to \nimpose in the Middle East. The international community should be no \nless courageous than the voices heard in Israel itself in denouncing \nIsrael's aggressive practices in Lebanon and requesting that they \nleave. The absence of international deterrence and the abuse of the \nveto in the Security Council encouraged Israel to persist in its \narrogance and to depend on force to achieve its expansionist aims and \nambitions. We call on all countries, especially those which support \nthe Zionist entity and provide it with political, military and \neconomic help.\nto stop that help forthwith so as to put an end to Israel's \naggressive policy in the Middle East.\n\n143.\tIsrael should not be allowed to continue its unlawful acts \nwith impunity. It is time for the international community to go \nbeyond the stage of condemnation and take effective measures to stop \nsuch conduct. Those who blatantly support the Zionist entity \nencourage the most hateful and dangerous theories against humanity \nand its rights and support aggression and expansion.\n\n144.\tThe Arab world is eager to maintain the principles of peace, \nstability, right and justice. We wish to live in peace on our \nterritory and to have equal and proper relations in order to achieve \nthose goals, and to choose our friends and enemies on these noble \nprinciples. Thusthe Israeli aggression which seeks to impose hegemony \nin the area is met by a genuine trend in the Arab countries, seeking \nthe consolidation of stability and peace in the Middle East and the \nworld as a whole.\n\n145.\tThe Arab position is based on the principles adopted at the \nArab summit conferences, especially the Twelfth Conference held in \nFez last month, the resolutions of which have confirmed that the \nArabs seek to achieve right, peace and justice and to exert every \neffort to maintain a peace which is just and comprehensive in the \nMiddle East in compliance with the resolutions of the United Nations.\n\n146.\tThe resolutions of the Fez Summit Conference reaffirmed the \nArab will for peace based on justice because it took into account the \ntrue situation in the area and that involved the principles and bases \nwhich could be an objective starting point for establishing a just \nand lasting peace. Among those principles is the inalienable right of \nthe Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment \nof an independent State on its own territory and under the leadership \nof the PLO, its sole legitimate representative. This is in accordance \nwith the principles of right and justice and the resolutions of the \nUnited Nations. Thus at a time when the Arab countries reaffirm by \nresolution adopted at Fez their will to establish peace base on \njustice, Israel proves, through its conduct, that it does not wish \npeace but rather seeks more expansion and more occupation of \nterritory. It has become clear that Israel is not the party that \nseeks security. Those who look for security are the Arabs.\n\n147.\tPeace will not be achieved as long as there is a people \nsuffering oppression, occupation, humiliation, racism, imperialism \nand other forms of domination. History has taught us that the people \nwho have been deprived of their basic rights have stood resolutely in \ndefence of those rights. That resistance has taken different shapes \nand forms. Genuine peace in the Middle East will not be established \nunless there is a complete recognition of the right of the \nPalestinian people to self-determination and the establishment of its \nown independent State, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all \nArab occupied countries, including the Holy City of Jerusalem. There \nwill hot be genuine peace in the Middle East so long as Israel \npersists in violating the simplest principles of human rights in the \noccupied territories and in Lebanon. Peace will not be realized so \nlong as Israel adheres to its expansionist designs and racist policy.\n148.\tLast, but not least, finding a comprehensive and just \nsolution to the Palestinian question will be a starting point for the \nsolution of many international problems which pose a danger to \ninternational peace and security. If such a solution is not reached, \nthen international tension and a deterioration of the situation in an \nunpredictable way will be a constant source of danger.\n\n149.\tIf we want to keep the world away from the edge of the abyss \nand from the policies of extremism, force and aggression, then wisdom \nand reason should prevail in all our conduct and we should also \nobserve all the principles and bases that can lessen international \ntension and overcome many of the dangers to international peace and \nsecurity to which I have referred. We should co-operate to find a \nsolution for all international problems and conflicts, in order to \nestablish an international community which enjoys stability, \nprogress, peace and security.\n"

I also wish to express my \nGovernment's and my own pleasure at the good work done so tirelessly \nby the Secretary- General since the day he assumed the lofty and \nimportant responsibilities of his office. We are certain that his \nsound knowledge, his broad judgement, his sensitivity and his \nexperience are and will continue to be positive factors that, \ntogether with his realistic outlook, will lead to the accomplishment \nof the mission entrusted to the Organization by the peoples of the \nworld.\nI should now like to present the general foreign policy views of the \nGovernment of National Unity, which I represent. Beginning in 1979, \nEl Salvador took the first steps towards the establishment of \nappropriate and effective mechanisms to make the frequently postponed \nprocess of social, economic and political change a reality; to enable \nthe great majority of the population to enjoy better living \nconditions, democracy and social justice; to bring about effective \nenjoyment of human rights by the exercise of self- determination; in \nshort, to enable Salvadorian society to improve its overall way of \nlife. Now, as then, my Government is engaged in a hard struggle to \nreduce the numbers of people living in or on the borderline of \npoverty, while also attempting to establish new structures with the \nsole purpose of fostering the development of the human person.\nThe entire world already clearly recognizes the scope of the \nstructural reforms my Government has undertaken, particularly \nagrarian reform, which has been termed the most thorough ever \nundertaken in the Americas, and the nationalization of banking and \nforeign trade. At the same time, we are undergoing a political, \ndemocratic, participatory and pluralistic process the legitimacy of \nwhich was confirmed when, on 28 March this year, our country entered \ninto history through the open door of elections held under the \nscrutiny of observers from more than 50 countries, recognized \ninternational organizations and institutions and some 300 foreign \njournalists. On that day, before the eyes of a world that was half \nindifferent and half amazed, the people of El Salvador rejected \nviolence, totalitarianism and terrorism and opted for the exercise of \nself-determination by peaceful and rational means as a solution to \nour many problems. The country chose the formula of pluralism and a \nmulti-party system. The present Government thus joined the political \nforces that represent 92 per cent of the electorate and, acting in \nkeeping with the aspirations of the people, adopted the basic \nplatform of government known as the Pact of Apaneca, which emerged \nfrom the common objectives of the various political parties as \nexpressed in the electoral campaign. Those basic objectives are \npeace, democratization, human rights, the consolidation of social \nreforms, the establishment of a climate of institutional and \njuridical confidence, the strengthening of international relations \nand economic recovery.\nNaturally, since we are aware that good declarations are the \nframework of great actions, and that at the present time pragmatic \nsteps that can achieve visible results are called for, my Government \nhas set up three commissions: a political commission, a peace \ncommission and a human rights commission. The Political Commission, \nwhich is made up, infer of the forces that were proved most \nrepresentative by the elections, is designed to bring a greater \ndynamism to the democratic process, to ensure its effective \nimplementation and to adopt the necessary measures for the \nimplementation of the Government's basic platform. The Peace \nCommission seeks the attainment of peace in a social climate that \nwill enable all Salvadorians to live, work and fulfil themselves as \nhuman beings through national reconciliation, the abandonment of \nsectarian attitudes and the channeling of political interests along \nan institutional path. It also proposes the solutions necessary to \nbring about lasting harmony and social stability. The Human Rights \nCommission serves as an instrument for the protection, promotion and \nmaintenance of human rights in the broadest sense and recommends \nappropriate measures for the effective attainment of human rights.\nTo give an example of the way in which these commissions operate, I \nam able to announce that the Political Commission has prepared a \ntimetable which includes deadlines for important political events, \namong them the holding of presidential and municipal elections on 28 \nMarch 1984 at the latest. We hope that in these elections all \npolitical sectors will be represented, without distinction as to \nideological or political views. It is clear that we are moving \nforward along the path leading to peace, harmony, justice and \nnational unity.\nA/37/PV.28\nWe must emphasize that the overall solution to the problem in El \nSalvador is not to be found in El Salvador alone, since everybody \nknows that there is a general situation of conflict in Central \nAmerica which gives rise to fresh tension and fosters old tension, \nmaking it difficult for any political project to be viable and \nstable. In this connection, the existence of various political \nprojects designed to meet and overcome the conditions resulting from \nunderdevelopment at the social, political and economic levels gives \nrise to tension and conflict when there is an attempt to give one \npriority over the other, and in certain sectors this nurtures the \nillusion that the concepts are mutually exclusive. Thus, when there \nis interventionist behaviour, regional peace is endangered in Central \nAmerica.\nOn the other hand, the situation in the region is not isolated from \nthe serious disorders in the international monetary system, the high \nrates of unemployment, excessive protectionism and the many other \nnegative symptoms, all of which the Central American subregion is \nencountering in its own social and political crisis.\nThus it is that there will be no peace in Central America if the arms \nrace continues; there will be no peace if the traffic in arms \ncontinues; there will be no peace as long as people continue , to \nsupport armed groups which seek to overthrow established Governments; \nthere will be no peace if there is no respect for the right of \npeoples to self-determination; there will be no peace if people do \nnot reject overt or covert foreign intervention; there will be no \npeace if there is no respect for ideological pluralism; there will be \nno peace if unfair social and economic structures are not eliminated; \nthere will be no peace if democratic institutions are not \nstrengthened and if human rights are not fully exercised. In sum, \nthere will be no peace if people do not have faith and work for peace.\nThrough the introduction of political interests alien to Central \nAmerica, which derive from confrontations on a larger scale, \ncountries of the region tend to perpetuate our problems and to play \nthe game of the merchants of war. If we do not begin to formulate \nideas which lead to harmony based on trust, cooperation, our common \norigin, our common geography and our common destiny, our peoples can \nbegin to write their own obituary-unless men of good will devote \nthemselves with great enthusiasm to the quest for peace. As long as \nthere is no peaceful coexistence, as long as there is no respect for \nthe principles of the self-determination of peoples and \nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States, as long as \nbase foreign interests influence the behavior of some countries in \nthe region, stability, peace, democracy, development and social \njustice will be beyond our reach.\nThat is why I pledge the good will of my Government in the efforts to \nachieve that peace, which is the first and the essential factor in \nthe attainment of the other conditions in which the well-being of the \npeoples can increase. For the same reason, it is essential that \nCentral American countries adopt consistent policies to limit \narmament and military equipment; that end all traffic in arms; that \nwe neither accept provocation nor harass a neighbor; for we are all \nentitledto organize ourselves at the social, economic and political \nlevels in the manner determined by the sovereign will of our peoples. \nMy appeal, the appeal of my people and of my Government, is for the \nestablishment of democracy, the full enjoyment of human rights, the \nrule of social justice and peace, tolerance and brotherhood among the \npeoples of Central America.\nAware of the fact that ideological pluralism must be the philosophy \nwhich inspires our Government so as to make possible the free \ninterplay of ideas and thus the promotion of democracy, our domestic \nposition can be reflected at the international level only by an \nattitude of respect for the struggles of the third world countries, \nwhich find expression in political forums such as those of the Group \nof 77 and the non-aligned movement. In the latter, El Salvador \nretains its observer status, bearing in mind the origin and the true \ndoctrine which led to its foundation. Thus we wish to stand aloof \nfrom East-West confrontations so as to facilitate progress along our \ntrue path to development, while we strengthen our freedom, our \nindependence and our sovereignty.\nThere is no doubt that so far in 1982 situations of conflict have \narisen which have led to serious breaches of world peace. Some of \nthose conflicts started a long time ago; others have emerged in more \nrecent times and situations.\nCertainly the behavior of the super-Powers in their mutual relations \nas well as with regard to countries that are within their respective \nspheres of influence has left much to be desired when it comes to the \nquest for peace. Such situations lead only to greater conflict, \nincreasing suspicion and the stepping up of the arms race.\nHistorical experience of relations between nations convinces us that \nno country remains indifferent to a disproportionate increase in a \nneighbor's arsenal, although the latter may claim threats to its \nterritorial integrity as an excuse. Even an endless arms buildup \ncannot alter the absurdity of that argument. That is why, in \nprinciple, the technological and economic gap between the developed \nand the developing countries must be closed, especially when \ndeveloping countries are poor in financial and investment resources.\nThe question arises as to whether this might be a legitimate need in \nterms of security, and the answer is obviously that it is not. The \npretense of absolute security when dealing with a super-Power is \neither an absurdity in itself or a pretext for extending hegemonistic \ndesigns. The irrational arms buildup is offensive in its internal \neffects on the poor countries, a source of concern for the wiser and \nmore prudent statesmen of the peoples living in the relevant region \nand sows the seed of discord. National situations which are \nexacerbated demagogically from outside and international tension \nprovoked by the extremist policies of ideological unilateralism which \ndenies pluralism constitute an explosive mixture which, unless action \nis taken, could set the region ablaze.\nWe recognize that the process of change in societies becomes \nirreversible both nationally and internationally and that the \nstrategy to be followed is not to fight against the march of history \nbut rather to adapt existing institutions to the necessary and \ninevitable change. But, if we have firm conviction and faith in the \ndestiny of Central America, we can overcome our differences with a \nview to adopting, by mutual agreement, methods which, without \nsacrificing our vital interests, would allow harmonious coexistence \nin the region, bearing in mind that the peoples are those who, in the \nfinal analysis, will define and determine their own destiny.\nIn this sensitive and complicated context, the Governments of Costa \nRica, Honduras and El Salvador established in San Jose, Costa Rica, \non 19 January 1982, the Central American Democratic Community, a \nnoble integration initiative based on the common historical destiny \nresulting from an identity of ideals, unswerving devotion to \ndemocracy, recognition of the economic and social interdependence of \nour peoples and the firm will to resolve, in a coordinated manner and \non a basis of solidarity, the social, political and economic problems \nwhich beset Central America.\nWe wish to express cur disappointment at the results of the second \nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, which \ndealt particularly with the problems of nuclear armament and the \ndangers this poses at the present stage of history. Peoples all over \nthe world, although they have certainly been more vocal in certain \nregions than in others, have clearly expressed their commitment to \npeace and their rejection of any atomic confrontation, however \nlimited.\nRecent events in Lebanon, including the reprehensible massacre in the \nrefugee camps, constitute a clear call to seek, by means of new \npolitical formulas, a lasting and just agreement in regard to the \nPalestinian problem, which continues to be at the heart of the \nArab-Israeli conflict. The absence of an overall solution in the \nMiddle East constitutes a permanent threat to world peace. We believe \nthat President Reagan's proposal, which was made known on 1 \nSeptember, is truly intended to lead to a viable and just formula. \nThere is no doubt that, because of the influence the United States \nhas on events relating to the Arab-Israeli conflict, the initiative \nof the United States President represents a step towards the solution \nof the problem and therefore towards the achievement of peace in the \nMiddle East. This initiative is also in keeping with the letter and \nthe spirit of Camp David. In the circumstances we cannot but applaud \nsuch a praiseworthy proposal, which points in the right direction.\nI need not repeat that my country condemns the acquisition of \nterritories by force regardless of the method used to that end but we \nalso believe that the formal existence of the State of Israel must be \nrecognized and also its right to live, free from all threats or \npressures, within its own boundaries. This is a legitimate \naspiration, and equally legitimate is the aspiration of the \nPalestinian people to establish its own State.\nWe must also refer to the question of Lebanon. After the trials that \nthis nation has experienced, the international community must see to \nit that Lebanon enjoys full sovereignty, eliminating from its \nterritory all foreign military forces regardless of the pretext that \nmay be used for remaining there, and restoring to it, as an \nindependent country, complete control and jurisdiction over its \nterritory. In other words, Lebanon should be allowed to exercise all \nthe attributes of a sovereign State, capable of rejecting foreign \nintervention or occupation. El Salvador, which does not and never \nwill permit interference by foreign troops in its territory, supports \nany international initiative designed to enable Lebanon, as a free \nand independent State, to achieve its political unity and territorial \nintegrity.\nThe agenda of this session of the General Assembly again includes the \nquestion of Cyprus, which has been debated for many years. Thus the \ninternational community is justly concerned over reaching a \ndefinitive agreement. We have taken note with satisfaction of the \ncontinued efforts of the Secretary-General and his missions of good \noffices with a view to promoting talks between the two communities, a \nmechanism which so far has proved the best vehicle for solving the \nproblem in a concerted manner. We must recognize in this case that \nUNFICYP has fully carried out its basic mission of maintaining and \npreserving the necessary climate of political tranquility to enable \nthe talks between the Turkish and Cypriot communities to be \nsuccessful.\nWe also wish to express our concern over the continued war between \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq. This international conflict \nhas demonstrated the impotence of the United Nations. Had we not \nknown that the Security Council had discussed the matter and that the \nSecretariat had made renewed efforts to resolve the dispute by \npeaceful means, we would say that the entire machinery set up by the \nCharter to end international disputes was a dead letter. How much \nlonger will war between those two nations continue without the \ninternational community stopping it? The conduct of those two \ncountries has undoubtedly increased scepticism about the Organization.\nAfghanistan continues to be a source of tension for the international \ncommunity. So long as the Afghan people is unable to determine its \nown future, free from the flagrant intervention represented by the \npresence of almost 100,000 Soviet soldiers, in violation of the most \nbasic principles of the Charter, there will be no just political \nsolution.\nThat situation has its counterpart in the occupation of Kampuchea by \nVietnamese troops, which has harmed the peace efforts in the entire \nregion of South-east Asia. An agreement to end this abnormal state of \naffairs should be sought in the light of the tenets of the Charter. \nThe withdrawal of foreign troops is a prerequisite, because the \nUnited Nations was created precisely to prevent such gross violations \nof international peace and security.\nEl Salvador condemns in the strongest terms racial discrimination, \nwhich has become the normal practice in the Government of South \nAfrica. The world's conscience has condemned apartheid which is the \nantithesis of humanism. Therefore, cannot be reconciled with the \nvalues of equity and harmonious coexistence. It is a link in the \nchain of causes of the intermittent outbursts of violence which have \nbeen manifestations of protest and rebelliousness against a clearly \nunjust state of affairs. That is why we shall continue to co-operate \nin the United Nations efforts to bring South Africa to respect the \nuniversally accepted standards of the Charter.\nThe other question affecting southern Africa is related to South \nAfrica's behavior in Namibia. Through the United Nations, the \ninternational community has promoted a framework for a solution by \nwhich Namibia may attain its independence. To date South Africa has \nbeen able, through subterfuge, to undermine a political settlement, \nthus continuing its illegal occupation of the territory. What is \nmore, the territory has been used to launch continuous acts of \naggression. Therefore, efforts should be redoubled to remove \nobstacles and bring about the prompt liberation of the people of \nNamibia, thus eliminating another source of tension which is \npoisoning international, including East-West, relations.\nAt the global level, the United Nations will continue to be an \nappropriate instrument for dealing with crises and ending conflicts, \nif we collectively renew our faith in it. But its institutional \nmachinery should not be .abused by diverting it towards propaganda, \nfor the benefit of sectarian interests, in the knowledge that such \naction would be aimed not at the solution of problems but, rather, at \na temporary effect on public opinion.\nNevertheless, the threat to the United Nations as an institution is \neven greater when it is given competence in the domestic affairs of \nStates, simply because these issues are linked with ideological \ntrends. In that case, the possible influence of the Organization \nwould be an obstacle to overcoming problems whose only solution \nshould lie, because of its character and nature, in the hands of the \npeople of the country, which knows its own situation better than \nanyone. The artificiality of giving an international character to \nnational situations clashes with the essential principle of the \nself-determination of peoples. I do not need to say that in giving \nsuch situations that artificial character the interventionist \ninterests at work violate the principle of non-intervention in the \ninternal or external affairs of other States.\nI turn to another matter-the Third United Nations Conference on the \nLaw of the Sea. It has been an exercise in patient negotiation in an \nattempt to reconcile very varied interests. For that reason alone, it \nis logical to say that no State could be completely satisfied. How \nfar have legitimate expectations been expressed in the final text \nwhich has now been adopted? In our view that is the question which \nall States are asking themselves. On their answer will depend the \nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, an international \ninstrument governing the norms and laws of the seas, including the \nsea-bed. The vote on 30 April this year shows that this international \ninstrument commands wide acceptance.\nPeace and development: these are two key words. Economic conflicts, \nsuch as the North-South confrontation affect international relations \njust as the hotbeds of political tension do. In that context, we all \nknow that the question of global negotiations was reexamined by the \nGeneral Assembly at its eleventh special session, just as it was at \nthe thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth sessions, without progress being \nmade. ' I do not believe that we should waste time by futilely \napportioning blame for the lack of progress. Rather, we must \nemphasize the need to break out of this impasse, which has hurt \neconomic relations between developed and developing countries so much.\nThe great family of the Americas has so far this year given two \nexceptional examples of solidarity, to which I wish to refer because \nof the great significance of joint, simultaneous action which \npresages the better days of which the Liberator Simon Bolivar dreamt. \nI refer, in chronological order, to the valuable and emotional-but \nnone the less objective-backing which El Salvador's process of \ndemocratization received from the overwhelming majority of brother \ncountries of Latin America, gathered at a meeting of the Organization \nof American States in Castries, Saint Lucia. Thanks largely to that \nsupport, the elections of 28 March this year were transformed from \nideals into reality.\nThe other demonstration of hemispheric solidarity was on behalf of \nthe sister Republic of Argentina, arising out of the stubborn \npersistence of an obsolete colonialism. I am referring to the \nMalvinas Islands. My Government supports Argentina's aspirations to \nachieve full exercise of its sovereignty over the islands, on the \nbasis not only of hemispheric solidarity and of law, but also on the \nbasis of the principles contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 \n(XV). In keeping with these principles, El Salvador has supported, \nstill supports and will continue to support the process of \ndecolonization everywhere in the world. In reaffirming its commitment \nto peace, El Salvador urges the parties involved to seek the means \navailable through international law to put an end to the dispute, in \nparticular by recourse to negotiation.\nToday we celebrate the discovery of America. Irrespective of \npolemics, legends or the myths of \\\"popular history\\\" concerning who \nwas the first navigator to sight American coasts and where he came \nfrom, what is certain is that Columbus and Spain represent a symbol: \nthe symbol of the faith and the value of a man, the symbol of the \nfaith and the value of a kingdom.\nLike the peoples of bygone days, the peoples of today are witness to \nincredible feats, which are not unworthy of the great epics recorded \nand transmitted by history.\nHowever, to our shame, the peoples today, just as those of bygone \ndays, continue to witness remnants of colonialism that defy the trend \nof history, provocations, hegemonism, aggression and exploitation. \nWhile it is true that mankind has made prodigious technological \nadvances in its organization, procedures, aspirations and psychology, \nthere yet remains something akin to that mankind which once lived in \ncaves.\nIt is imperative for us to bring technological development into line \nwith social development, and vice versa. It is imperative for us to \nbreak away from that absurd contradiction of a human race that has \nnot changed much since the Stone Age, with a technology that takes \nthe elements of war into outer space. It is imperative for us, for \nmankind, to recognize the false steps that are taking us to the edge \nof the abyss. It is imperative for us all to remember that the \nvictories of peace are nobler and more desirable than the victories \nof war.\n"

        "file_text": "\nI should like on behalf of the Government of the Gambia and my entire \ndelegation to express warm congratulations to Mr. Hollai on his \naccession to the high office of President of the General Assembly at \nthis session. His broad diplomatic experience and his distinguished \nprofessional record admirably equip him to preside over the affairs \nof the Assembly, and my delegation has every confidence in his \nability to guide the deliberations of the thirty-seventh session to a \nsuccessful and effective conclusion. May I take this opportunity to \npay a tribute to his distinguished predecessor, Mr. Kittani of the \nfraternal Republic of Iraq, who with untiring dedication and \ncommitment discharged the responsibilities conferred upon him at the \nthirty-sixth session. I wish also to congratulate the fifth \nSecretary-General, Mr. Perez da Cuellar, on his elevation to his \nimportant position and to welcome him to the first regular session of \nthe General Assembly that he has attended in his new capacity. In the \nsuccessive crises that have beset the world community in recent \nmonths the Secretary- General has been indefatigable in his efforts \nto promote the cause of peace, to which the United Nations is \ndedicated. This formal dedication notwithstanding, and in spite of \nthe sacred principles to which all signatories to the Charter of the \nUnited Nations have pledged their solemn commitment, the evolution of \nthe international political situation in the past year suggests that \nthe cause of peace has not been uppermost in our collective mind. \nInstead, tensions have smouldered and proliferated, and on too many \noccasions erupted into armed conflict. The thirty-seventh session of \nthe General Assembly is therefore commencing its important work at a \ntime of acute and widespread crisis ominously reminiscent of that \ndark era which preceded the global cataclysm of 1939 to 1945, from \nwhose ashes the Organization emerged. The state of crisis confronting \nthe international community is epitomized by the grave situation \nwhich has continued to prevail in southern Africa in stubborn \ndefiance of international public opinion. Through the policy of \napartheid, which has been rightly condemned as a crime against \nhumanity, South Africa has succeeded in institutionalizing racial \ndiscrimination on a scale unique in history. Under that odious system \nsome 20 million non-whites are routinely and systematically denied \neven the most fundamental of human freedoms. In recent years the \nSouth African authorities have attempted to convince the \ninternational community that, in spite of the overwhelming evidence \nto the contrary, they are both willing and able to introduce gradual \nthough meaningful reform. However, as has been demonstrated by the \nfanfare of publicity surrounding the establishment of a Presidential \nAdvisory Council, on which the black population is not even \nrepresented, change is not in the nature of the beast. The absence of \nany constitutional provision for peaceful change has compelled the \noppressed black population to resort to armed struggle. At this point \nI wish to reaffirm my Government's unwavering solidarity with the \nAfrican population of that tortured land in its legitimate struggle \nto gain those rights we consider to be inalienable. In this \nconnection my delegation wishes to pay a particular tribute to and to \nexpress its unequivocal support for the African National Congress and \nthe Pan Africanist Congress in their just and heroic struggle for \nfreedom, justice and human dignity. The international community and \nthe United Nations in particular face another grave challenge in \nNamibia, the Territory originally entrusted to South Africa under a \nLeague of Nations Mandate in 1919. Disregarding the formal revocation \nof this Mandate in 1966, the Pretoria regime has by unilateral \ndecision extended its jurisdiction and administration over the \nTerritory, whose vast mineral resources it continues, with the \ncollaboration of foreign economic interests, to exploit for its own \nuse. At the same time it has transformed Namibia into a forward base \nfor repeated acts of aggression against independent African States in \nthe region.\nIn spite of the clear consensus within the international community, \nthe competent organ of the United Nations, the Security Council, has \nbeen unable to apply the appropriate measures spelled out in Chapter \nVII of the Charter. Predictably, such indulgence, far from \nencouraging South Africa to comply with international norms, has \ninstead prompted further breaches of international peace and \nsecurity. As a result, the independent nations of the region, from \nneighbouring Angola to the far flung Seychelles islands, have become \npermanent targets of the racist regime and are subjected daily to \nsubversion, infiltration and open invasion by South Africa. In March \n1978 the Namibian people, in a commendable demonstration of \nstatesmanship and compromise, endorsed through their sole and \nauthentic representative, SWAPO, the settlement plan formulated by \nthe Western contact group. The plan was subsequently accepted by \nSouth Africa and adopted by the Security Council under its resolution \n435 (1978). Since that time, however, no progress has been made \ntowards the independence of Namibia. Instead, South Africa has \ninvented one pretext after another to delay its withdrawal from this \nillegally occupied Territory. The latest of these manoeuvres is the \ncurrent attempt to link the independence of Namibia to certain \nextraneous factors. South Africa's continued intransigence is a \ndirect affront to the authority of the United Nations and further \nundermines the credibility of the Organization. Any modification of \nthe existing framework of negotiation would gravely compromise the \nauthority of the Security Council. In this regard the position of the \nGovernment of the Gambia remains that resolution 435 (1978) \nconstitutes the sole and immutable basis for the independence of \nNamibia. The situation in southern Africa is matched only by the \ngrave situation in the Middle East, which has now escalated to \ncritical proportions with dire implications for international peace \nand security. Here, too, the United Nations faces an important and \nhistoric challenge. Although the will of the international community \nhas been clearly articulated in the successive resolutions of the \nAssembly, recognizing and reaffirming the inalienable rights of the \nsons and daughters of Palestine to self-determination and independent \nstatehood, no progress has been made towards the achievement of these \nbasic freedoms. In the occupied territories, the Palestinian \npopulation remains subjected to a campaign of systematic repression, \nunder which the most peaceful protests are met with brute force. This \ncampaign, which has spared neither school-children nor the elderly, \nattained epidemic proportions in March of this year. In June of this \nyear the international community witnessed with indignation and \nrevulsion the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the latest episode in the \nseemingly endless saga of Israeli aggression. My Government \nreiterates its condemnation of this criminal invasion, which not only \nviolates the most fundamental principles of the Charter and \ninternational law, but will remain for years a blot on the conscience \nof the civilized world. Ignoring the successive resolutions of the \nSecurity Council and the General Assembly calling for Israel's \nwithdrawal to the internationally recognized borders of Lebanon, the \ninvading army continued its relentless advance through Lebanon. The \nbloody Israeli advance culminated in the ten-week siege of the \ncapital, Beirut, during which the civilian population was subjected \nto a veritable holocaust. I wish at this juncture to express the \ntotal solidarity of the Government and people of the Gambia with the \ncourageous struggle of the Palestinian people, under the heroic \nleadership of its sole and authentic representative, the PLO. Still \nreeling from the surrealistic horror of this murderous siege, the \nworld community has reacted with outrage and disbelief to the recent \nSabra and Shatila massacres, in which more than 1,500 Palestinian \ncivilians, mainly women and children, were murdered in cold blood. \nThe Gambia strongly and unequivocally condemns these genocidal \natrocities and urges a full investigation into the organization and \nexecution of this crime against humanity, in accordance with General \nAssembly resolution ES-7/8, adopted at the seventh emergency special \nsession, devoted to the question of Palestine. Despite the global \nconsensus on the futility of armed force to resolve disputes, the \nshadow of war continues to darken the horizon on every continent. The \nsecond special session of the General Assembly devoted to \ndisarmament, in which legitimately high hopes were placed, proved a \nmajor disappointment. Although successive government leaders and \nplenipotentiaries expressed unanimous awareness of and concern for \nthe grave dangers which the accelerating arms race and the \never-increasing threat of a nuclear apocalypse pose for the future of \nmankind, the Assembly was unable, after five weeks of deliberation, \nto agree upon a comprehensive programme of disarmament. The \nramifications of this diplomatic failure extend far beyond the \nconfines of this hallowed building. They are symptomatic of a more \nglobal malaise. This phenomenon is characterized most notably by the \nabsence of the necessary political will to renounce the use of force \nin international disputes in favour of peaceful negotiation. Indeed, \nwith disturbing frequency the established framework and procedure for \nthe peaceful settlement of disputes have been bypassed, while nations \nhave resorted to brute force to achieve political objectives. The \ndispute over the Falkland Islands, which culminated in a full-scale \nwar with catastrophic consequences for both parties to the conflict, \nis a classic example of this syndrome. Pursuant to the provisions of \nthe Charter on self-determination and the non-use of force in the \nsettlement of disputes, the position of the Gambia regarding this \ndispute is that the status of the Falkland Islands should be \npeacefully determined on the basis of the freely expressed wishes of \nthe inhabitants of the territory. In the Persian Gulf, meanwhile, the \nfratricidal conflict between two Islamic States has raged for too \nlong, inflicting considerable loss of lives and immeasurable damage \nto property, not to mention the staggering financial costs of the war \nitself, now estimated to have exceeded $30 billion. As a member of \nthe Mediation Committee established by the Organization of the \nIslamic Conference, my Government has since 1980 participated \nactively in a number of initiatives aimed at achieving a settlement \nof this most regrettable dispute. Unfortunately, these assiduous \nefforts have not yet borne fruit. The Security Council has meanwhile \nissued repeated calls for a cessation of hostilities, in favour of \nnegotiations. It is the earnest hope of my delegation that the \nconflicting parties may respond positively to the most recent of \nthese appeals, launched only last week under resolution 522 (1982). \nIn the same region, the illegal occupation of Afghanistan by some \n100,000 foreign troops has persisted, in violation of the cardinal \nprinciples of self- determination and non-intervention, and in \ndefiance of the clear will of the international community in general \nand the Moslem world in particular. Loyal to their tradition of \nmilitant resistance to foreign domination, which stretches back in \nhistory to the era of the Persian Empire, the Afghan people have \nengaged in the heroic defence of their homeland from the new invader. \nThe hostilities have, however, precipitated the mass exodus of some 2 \nmillion Afghans who have sought refuge in neighbouring Pakistan, \nplacing an intolerable strain upon the economy of that country. The \nGambia has been following and wishes to commend the efforts of the \nSecretary-General's Personal Representative for Afghanistan, Mr. \nDiego Cordovez, aimed at a political settlement of the situation in \nAfghanistan. In this connection, my Government cautiously welcomes \nthe \\\"package of understandings\\\" which is reported to have emerged \nfrom his most recent consultations with the interested parties. In \nSouth-East Asia, the protracted occupation of Kampuchea by 200,000 \nforeign troops continues to deprive the Khmer people of its \ninalienable right to self-determination. The presence and operations \nof this army of occupation have forced an estimated 250,000 Khmers to \ndie into neighbouring Thailand. In addition, the ongoing hostilities \nbetween nationalist forces and the army of occupation have repeatedly \nspilled across the Thai-Kampuchea frontier. In view of the \nconsiderable tension which this has created on the border, the \ncontinued incursions into Thailand by foreign troops stationed in \nKampuchea clearly pose a grave threat to regional peace and security. \nMy Government wishes meanwhile to register its support for the \nestablishment on 22 June 1982 of the Coalition Government of \nDemocratic Kampuchea, under the presidency of Prince Norodom \nSihanouk. It is our considered view that this crystallization of the \nvarious Khmer nationalist tendencies will make an important \ncontribution towards the re-establishment of Kampuchea's \nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. This is the \nsinister course along which the international political situation has \nevolved over the past year. During this period of acute and \nprotracted crisis which has shaken the community of nations to its \nfoundations, the Gambia has striven consistently to promote peace, \nunderstanding and cooperation between States, both at the regional \nand international levels. Soon after the Gambia became independent in \n1965, in recognition of the geo-ethnic and cultural ties that bind \nour two countries and peoples, the Gambia and Senegal signed a Treaty \nof Association within whose framework a Senegal-Gambian Secretariat \nwas established to promote economic and socio-cultural co-operation \nbetween the two countries. The agreement establishing the Senegambia \nConfederation, signed by the Presidents of the two countries on 17 \nDecember 1981, evolved from the close and mutually beneficial \nco-operation which has always characterized relations between the \nGambia and Senegal, since the Gambia attained nationhood. The \ninstruments by which the respective Parliaments of the two sister \nStates have ratified this Agreement have already been deposited with \nthe Secretary- General of the United Nations, and some of the \nprotocols for the implementation of the Agreement have been signed \nand ratified. It is our fervent hope that this significant step in \nthe bilateral co-operation between the Gambia and Senegal will serve \nas a shining example for other African nations to emulate in our \ndrive towards a united Africa. In the face of the unjust conditions \nin which the present international economic system operates, the \nadoption of the International Development Strategy for the Third \nUnited Nations Development Decade did not only usher in a new era of \nhope for developing countries; it represents, in my delegation's \nview, an important milestone in the relations between developed and \ndeveloping countries as it incorporates, in terms of structural and \ninstitutional changes, the concept of interdependence between North \nand South. However, the alarming rate at which the world economy \ncontinues to deteriorate, the widening wealth-gap between developed \nand developing countries and the little progress that has so far been \nachieved in the establishment of the new international economic \norder, constitute ample testimony to the fact that our partners in \nthe North have still to summon the political will fundamental to the \nimplementation and success of the Strategy. With regard to trade and \ndevelopment, notwithstanding the progress achieved in this area \nwithin the framework of UNCTAD, including the Agreement Establishing \nthe Common Fund for Commodities which is still not fully operational, \nand the adoption of rules to regulate restrictive business practices, \ndeveloping countries continue to contend with the serious effects of \nspiralling world-wide inflation, inequitable terms of trade and \nphenomenal recession, as well as escalating protectionist measures in \nindustrialized countries directed mainly against the finished \nproducts exported by developing countries. We have, therefore, been \npersistent in our call for the adoption by developed countries of \nmore liberal trade policies and the dismantling of artificial trade \nbarriers, so as to allow goods exported by developing countries \ngreater access to the markets of developed countries. The sixth \nsession of UNCTAD once again provides the international community \nwith another opportunity for effective action permanently to stem \nthese imbalances and we fervently hope that no effort will be spared \ntowards the attainment of this objective. The urgent need to \nrestructure the international monetary system so as to increase its \nresponsiveness to the needs and development problems of developing \ncountries not only poses a formidable challenge to the North-South \ndialogue but also constitutes one of the main stumbling-blocks to the \nlaunching of the global negotiations. The prevailing international \nmonetary system established at Bretton Woods after the Second World \nWar and prior to the \\\"wind of change\\\" catered exclusively to the \ninterests of the industrialized countries without taking due \ncognizance of the needs of developing countries, the majority of \nwhich had not yet become independent. It is no wonder, therefore, \nthat the developing countries continue to demand, albeit \nunsuccessfully, that the international monetary institutions be \ndemocratized and redesigned with a view to promoting the economic and \nsocial progress of developing countries in the interests of both \nNorth and South. Indeed, in a number of positive ways, the \nInternational Meeting on Co-operation and Development, held at Cancun \nin 1981 could not have been more timely. The developing countries, \nand the Independent Commission on International Development Issues, \nunder the chairmanship of Willy Brandt, which proposed it, had hoped \nthat agreement would be reached at the Cancun meeting on the \nlaunching of the global round, thereby breaking the North-South \nstalemate and demonstrating the international community's commitment \nto the resolution of the multifarious problems impeding the economic \ndevelopment of developing countries. Regrettably, the disappointing \nconclusions of the Cancun meeting dealt another shattering blow to \nthe aspirations of developing countries, as some developed countries \nrepresented at the meeting were simply unprepared to endorse the \nproposals which constitute the central theme of the global \nnegotiations\u00f3the restructuring of the international monetary system, \nraw materials, and United Nations targets for official development \nassistance. It is now an established fact that industrialization is a \nsine qua non for the accelerated development of developing countries. \nRegrettably, however, the attainment of the objective of 25 per cent \nof world industrial output by the turn of the century set for \ndeveloping countries in the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action on \nIndustrial Development and Co-operation is far from being realized, \nsince the share of the developing countries in world industrial \nproduction is only 12 per cent. It is equally disappointing that only \n$15 million has so far been pledged to the United Nations Industrial \nDevelopment Fund as compared to the desired level of $50 million. The \nlow level of contribution to the Fund makes it virtually impossible \nfor UNIDO to expand its programmes and activities to a level that \nwould enhance the industrialization efforts of developing countries. \nThe Industrial Development Board, at its sixteenth session again \nunderlined the slow rate of industrial growth in the third world, \nespecially in Africa, and recommended among other things the \nstrengthening of UNIDO's activities, in particular in areas relating \nto the transfer of industrial technologies, and in the exchange of \nexperience gained in the establishment of industrial infrastructures, \nto energy-related industrial technology and industrial development, \nand to management training. In this connection, the proposal by UNIDO \nto establish an international bank for industrial development is \ncertainly a welcome initiative. Provided that, following its establishment, \nthe bank is accorded the needed support in terms of capital and \nresource availability on an assured basis, it should contribute \nsignificantly to promoting industrial growth in the third world. \nLargely because of the lack of enthusiasm and political will on the \npart of developed countries, developments in the field of science and \ntechnology have been equally disappointing in terms of the slow \nimplementation of the Vienna Programme of Action on Science and \nTechnology for Development. Contributions to the United Nations \nInterim Fund for Science and Technology for Development amounted to \nonly $50 million instead of the target of $250 million envisaged in \nthe Programme of Action adopted at Vienna. One cannot overemphasize \nthe importance of the operational plan for the implementation of the \nVienna Programme and of the comprehensive recommendations contained \nin the report of the Intergovernmental Group on the United Nations \nFinancing System for Science and Technology for Development. The \nIntergovernmental Committee on Science and Technology for Development \nshould therefore exert every effort to finalize negotiations on these \nrecommendations and on the International Code of Conduct on the \nTransfer of Technology. The energy problem continues to constitute a \nmajor factor in the present world economic crisis. The phenomenal \nincrease in oil prices over the past eight years makes it urgently \nnecessary to adopt a comprehensive world energy policy and to promote \nthe expansion and diversification of conventional and \nnon-conventional energy sources. It was with this in view and with \nthe intention of seeking measures to deal with the persistent oil \ncrisis and the attendant serious problems it poses to international \neconomic development that the United Nations Conference on New and \nRenewable Sources of Energy was convened at Nairobi in August 1981. \nThe Conference adopted the Nairobi Programme of Action for the \nDevelopment and Utilization of New and Renewable Sources of Energy \ndesigned to ensure a sustained supply of energy from both \nconventional and non-conventional sources, including small-scale \nrural projects, the development of indigenous energy sources and \nresearch into new and renewable energy technologies. The World Bank \nhas already estimated that on an annual basis oil-importing \ndeveloping countries would need a minimum of $50 billion to develop \ntheir domestic energy resources. In this connection, the Government \nof the Gambia welcomes the proposed World Bank energy affiliate to \nfinance energy development in developing countries and trusts that \nthe proposal will materialize in the very near future. We attach \nequal importance to the work of the intergovernmental Committee on \nthe Development and Utilization of New and Renewable Sources of \nEnergy, established to mobilize the volume of resources needed for \nthe implementation of the Nairobi Programme of Action and look \nforward to the successful accomplishment of its important task. The \nproblem of hunger and malnutrition today constitutes the most serious \nand fundamental problem that developing countries are confronted \nwith. The food situation in the majority of developing countries has \nbecome absolutely intolerable, particularly in Africa, where, because \nof severe and prolonged drought conditions in the Sahel, the \nsituation has reached alarming proportions. This situation has been \nfurther exacerbated by the international community's failure to reach \neither the minimum target of 10 million tons of grain per year \nestablished under the Food Aid Convention of 1980 or the minimum \ntarget of 500,000 tons of grain to stock the International Emergency \nFood Reserve. The need for a substantial increase in contributions to \nthe World Food Programme has never been more urgent, and the \ninternational community should, as a matter of urgency, exert every \neffort, not only towards meeting the targets envisaged in the Food \nAid Convention and for the International Emergency Food Reserve, but \nalso towards implementing the FAO Five-Point Plan of Action on World \nFood Security.\\\" Equally important is the replenishment of the \nresources of the International Fund for Agricultural Development to \nenable the Fund to maintain and even expand its efforts to promote \nincreased food production and strengthen the agricultural \ninfrastructure of developing countries. The decision of the \nInternational Monetary Fund to establish a food window to assist \nlow-income countries in correcting the imbalance of their balance of \npayments resulting from cereal imports is certainly a step in the \nright direction. Notwithstanding that, concerted efforts should also \nbe made towards recycling the substantial food surpluses in the \ndeveloped countries. The declining level of concessional resources \navailable for multilateral operational activities is a source of \nserious concern to the Gambian Government. In the case of UNDP, for \nexample, the financial commitments made so far have fallen far short \nof the minimum average annual growth of 14 per cent in voluntary \ncontributions envisaged for the third programming cycle, 1982 to \n1986. The Administrator of UNDP revealed a few days ago in a \nstatement at the 4th meeting of the Second Committee that for the \nfirst year of the cycle, the Programme will not even have sufficient \nresources to enable it to deliver up to 60 per cent of the indicative \nplanning figures envisaged in decision 80/30 of the UNDP Governing \nCouncil. Indeed, the entire United Nations development system is \nlumbered with the same bleak prospects of resource availability and, \nunless there is a dramatic about tum, the devastating effects of the \nwaning resource prospects on the operational activities of the United \nNations development system will hardly bear contemplation. It is \nparticularly disturbing that following the adoption of the \nSubstantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least \nDeveloped Countries in Paris last year, the good will and enthusiasm \nso amply demonstrated in Paris is yet to be matched by firm \ncommitments in terms of resources for the early implementation of the \nSubstantial New Programme of Action. Today, we are living in a world \nin which some of the most basic needs for survival are virtually \nnon-existent for the majority of mankind as chronic poverty and \nsqualor become increasingly prevalent. For those of us from the least \ndeveloped countries, which constitute the world's poorest sector, the \nsituation has become absolutely unbearable. It is hardly necessary to \nremind the international community that the problems of poverty \nconstitute the greatest threat to international peace and security. \nLet us, therefore, through unity of action, guarantee our collective \nsurvival by giving practical expression to our solemn pledge to the \nOrganization to mould a more assured and acceptable future for \nmankind. In our pursuit of this crucial objective, I pledge the total \nsupport and co- operation of the Government and people of the Gambia.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I join the previous speakers in extending to you, on \nbehalf of my Government, our congratulations on your election as \nPresident of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. My \ncongratulations also go to your predecessor for the exemplary manner \nin which he conducted the proceedings of the last session. This \nsession of the General Assembly is convening at a time when the very \nfoundations of international peace, stability and prosperity are \nbeing assailed by global disharmony and serious economic crisis. \nHardly a day goes by without our attention being drawn to a new and \nterrible flashpoint where reason and negotiation yield to rash and \nprecipitous conflicts under arms. Border wars rage, and nations parry \nand thrust over the negotiating table with all too little concern for \nthe consequences of their inability to compromise. On a different \nplane, where the stakes are much higher and the destructive \ncapabilities terrifyingly lethal the super Powers have yet again \nfailed to secure any meaningful agreement on nuclear arms limitation. \nThe impunity with which nations flout the Charter, too, gives rise to \nour fears that true and lasting peace Is an impossible dream. As a \nsmall country, far removed from these areas of conflict, Papua New \nGuinea has no illusions about its position in the scheme of things. \nHowever, we feel obligated to draw the Assembly's attention to the \nperspective we hold of the deterioration of relations between \ncountries. Our concern also extends to the growing disparity between \nthe industrial and non industrial countries. We are therefore \ncompelled to express our concern at the indifference shown by \nindustrial countries in procrastinating in the implementation of \nsuccessive economic summits dealing with the world economic order.\n423\nPapua New Guinea believes that removing the threat of armed conflict \nand establishing procedures designed to assist the economic \nimprovement of poor nations are the two issues requiring the urgent \nattention of the General Assembly. These are not new issues in the \nGeneral Assembly's agenda. They have in fact been debated many times \nboth here and in other international to rums. Regrettably, on each \noccasion, no satisfactory solution has been reached. My Government \nbelieves that the time is now overdue for all of us to make some real \nprogress on these crucial issues. Instituting reforms to correct \nthese anomalies will require a degree of strength and unity of \npurpose which has so far eluded the Assembly. My Government therefore \nhopes that at this session the Assembly will distinguish itself by \nfinding common ground where these and other issues of global concern \ncan be resolved. I now wish to address myself to those specific \nissues that my Government considers appropriate for debate in this \nforum. My Government continues to consider colonialism an anachronism \nof our times. We fully share the view that dependent and Non Self \nGoverning Territories must be given the opportunity to exercise their \ninalienable right to self determination and independence as \nstipulated in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960. Papua \nNew Guinea, like other independent Pacific island countries, is \nparticularly concerned with the remaining dependent Territories of \nthe Pacific region. Since Papua New Guinea became independent seven \nyears ago, we have been obliged to support independence for our \nPacific island neighbors. Our resolve in this respect today is \nundiminished. We shall continue to ensure that the colonial era in \nthe Pacific region comes to an end. We note with satisfaction the \nrecent developments within New Caledonia resulting in greater \nparticipation of the Melanesian people in the Council of Government. \nWe commend the French Government on the reforms which are aimed at \nachieving greater political, economic and social benefits for the \nindigenous Melanesian population. We trust that this is an integral \npart of an evolutionary process which will eventually lead New \nCaledonia to plan its own destiny towards independence. Hence, \npleased as we are at the progress made so far, we cannot be fully \ncontent until we see the emergence of an independent New Caledonia. \nThese views were echoed at the South Pacific Forum meeting in August. \nWe urged the French Government to work closely with the Kanak people \nof New Caledonia in formulating a political programme for a peaceful \ntransition to independence. We also hope that other French \nTerritories in the Pacific are given equal opportunities to determine \ntheir own future.\n\nI also wish to state that Papua New Guinea cannot be indifferent if \nthe Micronesian people of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands \nare denied their right to decide their own future. We acknowledge the \nefforts that are being made by the United States Government to place \nbefore the people of Micronesia a range of options which will include \na plebiscite to enable them to determine their own future. To deny \nthem these options would be contrary to the principles of the Charter \nof the United Nations and the spirit of the Trusteeship. Who is \nbetter able to decide whether the Micronesian people are ready for \nself determination than the Micronesians themselves? Over the past \nfew years we have witnessed the resurgence of a particularly \ndeplorable world wide phenomenon. I speak here of the tendency of \ncountries in recent times totally to disregard the principles of \nsovereignty and independence of other States by pursuing blatant acts \nof aggression and interference. It is indeed disheartening to note \nthat those same States, which have representatives at the Assembly, \nfreely abuse the principles of the Charter. The use of superior \neconomic and military strength to invade small countries for the \npurpose of securing spheres of influence is a matter of the utmost \nconcern to my Government.\nA prime example was Viet Nam's invasion of Kampuchea in late 1978, \nand its installation of a puppet regime. The Kampuchean people have \nsuffered intolerably; thousands have been killed and others have fled \nto neighboring and far away countries to seek sanctuary. Together \nwith other concerned countries, Papua New Guinea supported \ninitiatives to bring about a peaceful solution to the problem of \nKampuchea. We actively participated in the International Conference \non Kampuchea held here last year. 13. Last year Papua New Guinea, \nalong with the Association of South East Asian Nations and many \nStates Members of the United Nations, adopted a declaration which \nadvocated a negotiated settlement of the problem of Kampuchea. Viet \nNam's continued rejection of these calls has necessitated the recent \nformation of a Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. We \nconsider this development a positive move and therefore pledge our \nsupport, together with the member States of ASEAN, in welcoming the \nformation of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. The \nAfghanistan issue is somewhat analogous to the Kampuchea issue. Papua \nNew Guinea has opposed and will continue to oppose the foreign \noccupation of Afghanistan. We note with regret that the Soviet Union \nhas not responded to Genera! Assembly resolution 36/34, calling for \nthe immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of foreign troops \nfrom Afghanistan. We believe that the situation in Afghanistan cannot \nbe normalized as long as foreign troops are present in that country.\n\nWhile taking note of the second special session of the General \nAssembly devoted to disarmament this year, we are dismayed that there \nhas been no real effort to reduce the manufacturing and stockpiling \nof trade in both conventional and nuclear weapons. My Government, \nnevertheless, commends the efforts of the Committee on Disarmament to \ncurb the arms race. While we have not succeeded in effecting a \ncomprehensive reduction in arms, the fact that both bilateral and \nmultilateral disarmament measures exist in the form of treaties and \nconventions provides some hope for optimism. There is, however, a \ngreat danger in the belief that armaments are causes of war. Arms do \nnot decide to go to war; it is human decisions that put them to war. \nArms control alone cannot remove the possibility of war, but arms \ncontrol backed by political will can prevent war and contribute to \npeace and security. Another alarming aspect of the arms race is the \nexpansion in nuclear weaponry. For a number of years now one of the \nmajor tasks of the United Nations has been to promote the peaceful \nuse of nuclear energy while attempting to deter its military \napplication. In spite of those efforts, however, nations still find \nreason to develop nuclear weapons. Like our neighbors in the South \nPacific, we are increasingly alarmed at the continued testing of \nnuclear weapons in the region by outside Powers. At this year's \nmeeting of the South Pacific Forum, the Pacific island leaders again \nstrongly condemned France for its nuclear activities in our region \nand called for an immediate halt to them. Furthermore, the Forum \ncalled on those States with nuclear capability not to store or dump \nnuclear wastes in the Pacific. We object to the long  term effects of \nnuclear experimentation, which could adversely affect the lives and \nthe welfare of our people. It is against this background that Papua \nNew Guinea is totally opposed to nuclear testing and to the dumping \nof nuclear wastes in the region. For many sessions now the Assembly \nhas adopted resolutions condemning South Africa and seeking to \neliminate its abhorrent policy of Papua New Guinea finds it difficult \nto understand why some members of this body continue to condone the \nactions of a regime which has persistently spumed United Nations \nresolutions and yet continue to support South Africa indirectly \nthrough trade and other relations. I make particular reference here \nto those countries which saw fit to veto a Security Council draft \nresolution in April 1981 requesting Members of the United Nations to \nimpose comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against South Africa. \nTheir actions in this respect are indicative of the indifference of \nsome Members of this world body who profess to be guardians of the \nrights and dignity of mankind. It is this kind of hypocrisy that \nprovides reason for the Pretoria Government to continue pursuing its \nrepugnant racist policies. The attitude so far displayed by these \ncountries evokes no optimism concerning the total abolition. My \ndelegation looks forward to the time when all Members of the \nOrganization can sincerely and effectively impose trade and economic \nsanctions against South Africa. When that time comes, and my \nGovernment hopes it will come soon, it will be a triumphant \nvindication of the human values which have been totally repudiated by \nthe South African Government.\n\nIt would be remiss of me to bypass Namibia at this juncture. Papua \nNew Guinea has supported and will continue to support United Nations \nefforts to accord Namibia the right to free itself from its \nsubservient role to South Africa. We shall continue to press for an \nearly and peaceful settlement to this long standing question, as \nprovided for in Security Council resolutions 435 (1978) and 439 \n(1978). We find consolation in the efforts of the contact group of \nWestern States. However, we strongly urge all concerned speedily to \nfacilitate a durable solution for Namibia's independence. The Middle \nEast issue will continue to be of grave concern if the recent and \nunfortunate events in Lebanon are not properly resolved. These events \nhave surely undermined the efforts of the parties concerned to find a \nlasting solution to the problems of the sovereign State of Lebanon. \nWe are particularly concerned that Israel's action has led to the \nmassacre and undue suffering of hundreds of innocent Lebanese \ncivilians and Palestinian refugees in west Beirut. We abhor such \naction, irrespective of whoever is responsible. Although we \nacknowledge Israel's right to exist and thus to defend its political \nand territorial integrity, Papua New Guinea also firmly believes that \nthis longstanding crisis can never be resolved without acknowledging \nthe Palestinians' right to have their own State. Papua New Guinea \nrecognizes that right and will support any initiatives that are aimed \nat convening a conference on Palestine as a means to finding a \nlasting settlement to the Middle East situation. After many years of \nprotracted negotiations, my Government was happy to welcome the \nadoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in \nApril this year. We, however, remain disappointed that certain \ncountries sought to alter some fundamental provisions of the \nConvention. I feel obliged to remind those countries that the \nprovisions in question are there for the benefit of mankind. My \nGovernment is especially concerned that the United States has decided \nnot to become a party to the Convention when it is opened for \nsignature. Papua New Guinea's concern stems from the fact that key \nprovisions within the Convention relating to sea bed mining may not \nbe effectively implemented, white some industrial countries \npossessing sea bed mining technology fail to support the Convention. \nPapua New Guinea trusts and urges other industrial States to support \nthe Convention as the principal treaty governing the exploitation of \nresources of the world's oceans. The single most important issue \nfacing the world community today is the current global economic \nrecession, especially the adverse impact it has had on the economic \nand social well being of all nations. Against the background of the \ncurrent world economic crisis, Papua New Guinea joins other nations \nin recognizing that co operation at the international level is \nurgently requested in order to arrest and improve the deteriorating \neconomic situation. We are aware that the world economy has suffered \nover the past decade from problems arising from inflation, high \ninterest rates, exchange rate instability, deteriorating terms of \ntrade in commodities, rising unemployment, slow growth and \nprotectionism. Because of the general downturn in economic growth, \nindustrial countries have had to apply so called safeguard measures \nin order to cope with their own domestic pressures. Thus we have seen \nsubstantial falls in the industrial countries' demands for non \nindustrial country products, the proliferation of tariff and non \ntariff barriers and a general drift towards protectionism. In \naddition there has been, a substantial reduction m the flow of \nofficial aid and development finance to developing countries. Trade \nbarriers in various forms have effectively curtailed markets for non \nindustrial country exports Most of the restrictions have been \nconcentrated on manufactured products, although agricultural products \nhave been subjected to similar restrictions as well. As most of the \nbarriers to trade exist outside international rules, efforts to limit \ntheir restrictive and trade distorting effects have never been \nsuccessful. We in the Pacific have suffered because of a serious drop \nin the demand for those agricultural commodities upon which we are so \ndependent, such as copra, cocoa, palm oil, fish and timber. Our. \nsmall Pacific economies often rely for survival on the income from \njust one or two of these primary products Marginal changes in the \nvolume and price of agricultural imports from industrial countries \nresult in plummeting prices for non industrial countries like ours. \nAt this point I must pay a tribute to the efforts of the European \nEconomic Community to compensate its associated African, Caribbean \nand Pacific countries for drops m export earnings. Papua New Guinea \nhas recently benefited from this STABEX scheme, Stabilization System \nfor Export Earnings, and is due to receive additional loan and grant \nfinance. This assistance is certainly appreciated, but let us all not \nforget that relatively small loans can only be partial compensation \nfor the much larger drops in export earnings we have been forced to \nbear. STABEX though welcome, is merely a palliative. We must all \nstill strive for a new international economic order in which the \nsmall producers are not forced to bear a disproportionate share of \nthe sacrifices all have to make during times of economic recession. \nPapua New Guinea, like many other countries, is experiencing dramatic \nfalls in foreign exchange earnings. Consequently, like other \ncountries, it has been forced with very serious balance of payments \ndifficulties and problems of debt servicing. Both industrial and non \nindustrial countries have a responsibility to help revitalize and \nrearrange the current economic order. Economic recovery depends upon \na number of factors, such as the elimination of trade barriers and \nthe elimination of other barriers that restrict trade growth. In \nthis\\\" regard, we urge GATT at the next ministerial meeting and UNCTAD \nat the sixth session to establish effective proposals for economic \nrecovery. There is one other area of concern to my Government. This \nis in regard to the way in which quotas are distributed under current \ninternational commodity agreements. During the recent meetings of the \nInternational Coffee Organization in London, for example, it was \nquite evident that the major coffee producing nations used their \neconomic power to increase. their quotas, to the detriment of smaller \nproducers like my own country. Papua New Guinea would like to see a \nfairer, a more equitable distribution of quotas so that justice not \nonly is done but is seen to be done. There are many problems that \nbeset our world today. Although I have only touched on some of them, \na!! of them need to be solved, and solve them we must. To do this, \nhowever, we need one another's shoulders to carry the burden jointly. \nBut to do this effectively we need the political will to do it, a \nfactor which is required if most of our collective endeavors are to \nsucceed now and in the future. My delegation Relieves that it is \npointless discussing what can be done unless we first establish that \nthere is a collective will to do it. Only then can we hope to create \na world order in which States can strive to live together in peace, \nstability and prosperity.\n"

We are certain \nthat, given your diplomatic skill, wisdom and \neven-handedness, you will provide excellent \nleadership for the work before us. Also, we wish \nto congratulate Mr. Kittani for the skill and \ntact with which he presided over the tasks of the \nsessions of the General Assembly held throughout \nthis particularly difficult year. We extend \nspecial recognition to the Secretary-General for \nhis outstanding efforts in the short, yet \ntroubled, period in which he has held his post.\n237.\tIn this general discussion, it is \ncustomary to review the most important \ndevelopments on the international scene. Year \nafter year, we deplore\u2014almost ritualistically\u2014new \nand old problems that threaten international \npeace and security. But this year, a new and \nexceedingly grave threat has aggravated the \nsituation. I refer specifically to the threat to \nworld peace and security represented by the \nfatalistic resignation by ever-growing numbers of \npeople and, in particular, by Governments, in the \nface of genocide, hunger and misery, and even in \nthe face of the possibility of a nuclear \nholocaust.\n238.\tConfronted with the most tense and \nfragile international situation since 1945, at \nthis session the General Assembly is called upon \nto reflect most profoundly. The persistence of \nold sources of tension and the emergence of new \nones, in addition to symptoms that the current \nstructures for maintaining stability are becoming \nworn out, lead us to the inescapable conclusion \nthat the pre-conditions for peace do not exist. \nIndeed, there can be no peace if the vast \nmajority of the inhabitants of this planet are \nwithout bread, education, decent housing, \nsecurity and political rights. There can be no \npeace without justice. There can be no peace \nwhile certain countries cling to outmoded systems \nof domination and dependence and stubbornly \nendeavour to prevent third world countries at all \ncosts from adopting measures they consider \nimperative and necessary to overcome \nunderdevelopment and want in the exercise of \ntheir right to self-determination and \nindependence. Peace is impossible, so long as the \npowerful maintain their arrogant stance of \ndemanding that developing countries act in \naccordance with imperial interests and in \ndetriment to the interests of their own peoples.\n239.\tHow can there be peace when 40 per cent \nof the third world population is denied the right \nto read and write? How can there be peace when \nthe vast majority of mankind is struggling to \novercome hunger and misery t while a tiny \nminority invests enormous resources in weapons to \nbe used against those demanding justice?\n240.\tHow can we not acknowledge that we are \nfacing the most serious economic crisis since the \ngreat depression of the 1930s, with world per \ncapita income not making the slightest advance \nsince 1981 and with the prospect of a decline in \n1982? How can there be peace while countries and \nentire continents are fighting not simply for \neconomic growth but for mere survival? Our \ncountries are calling for a new economic order \nwherein the developed countries do not correct \ntheir own problems of stagnation, inflation and \nunemployment at the expense of the developing \nworld.\n241.\tIn this setting Latin America has felt \nthe need to lay the groundwork for a strategy for \nindependence and security. At the eighth regular \nmeeting of the Council of the Latin American \nEconomic System, held this past August in \nCaracas, our countries reasserted the sovereign \nright of all nations to adopt their own path in \nthe economic, social and political fields in \npeace and free from pressure, aggression and \nexternal threats.\n242.\tIn Managua, the seventeenth Regional \nConference for Latin America of FAO also urged \nthe creation of security machinery in terms of \nfoodstuffs in order to decrease the vulnerability \nof Latin American and Caribbean nations with \nregard to one or several industrialized \ncountries. And, in Toronto, on the occasion of \nthe Joint Meeting of the International Monetary \nFund and the World Bank, our country, on behalf \nof Latin America, the Philippines and Spain, \nvoiced its opposition to intervention by certain \ninstitutions in the system of economic \norganization of countries in need of assistance. \nWarning was given of the dangers involved in the \nsetting of more and more conditions, in the \nrising cost of credit and in the threat contained \nin the questioning of the very importance of \ninternational co-operation.\n243.\tWith regard to international \nco-operation, we wish to go on record as voicing \nconcern at the tendency of some developed \ncountries not to abide by the commitments that \nthey have undertaken vis-a-vis UNDP, thus making \nthe progress of important projects already under \nway much more difficult.\n244.\tJust as indicative of the current \nindifference to mankind's vital interests is the \nimpudence of those that try to hide the \nconsequences of nuclear conflict. Illogically, \nthey try to make us believe that such a conflict \ncould be confined to a given geographical area. \nIt has reached the point where the world's most \nformidable military Power is proclaiming that \nthere are issues more important than peace and \nthat force is a legitimate instrument in \nattaining its objectives of domination and \npolitical hegemony.\n245.\tThis reckless policy of the current \nUnited States Administration has made its own \ncitizens and the peoples of the world contemplate \nthe danger of a nuclear confrontation. In this \ncontext, it should not surprise us that the \nanti-nuclear movement has attained such massive \nand broad dimensions\u2014even in the United States \nitself\u2014although this outcry, as has unfortunately \nbecome the rule, is not reflected in decisions of \nGovernments, as evidenced by the paltry results \nof the recent second special session devoted to \ndisarmament.\n246.\tJust a few months ago Latin America \nsuffered colonialist military aggression by an \nextra-continental Power, which threatens the \nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of a sister \nnation. We refer, of course, to the British \ninvasion of the Malvinas Islands, the true origin \nof which can be found in the United Kingdom's \nstubborn attempt to perpetuate an anachronistic \ncolonial situation on our continent. The \naggression against the Republic of Argentina was \npossible only thanks to the military, economic \nand political support that the United States \nsupplied to the aggressor nation\u2014support which \nastonished Latin Americans, support that unmasked \nthe United States conception of the reciprocal \ndefence treaties and the true motives that led \nthe United States to sign them.\n247.\tIn numerous General Assembly resolutions \nand resolutions of other United Nations bodies it \nhas been said in clear-cut terms that the \nMalvinas issue is a colonial one that must be \nresolved. Twenty Latin American foreign ministers \nrequested that this situation be discussed at \nthis session of the Assembly, because they wanted \nto make it absolutely clear that the cause of the \nMalvinas Islands is also the cause of Latin \nAmerica, and that a resumption of negotiations \nleading to a peaceful resolution of the conflict \non the basis of United Nations resolutions is \nimperative.\n248.\tThe principle of solidarity compels us to \nunite with our African brothers and sisters in \nthe defence of Namibia's right to independence. \nWe reject all the manoeuvres aimed at creating a \npuppet Government in Namibia. We demand full \nimplementation of Security Council resolution 435 \n(1978) and the recognition of SWAPO as the sole \nlegitimate representative of the heroic people of \nNamibia. We denounce the campaign launched by the \nReagan Administration to deprive Angola of its \ninalienable right of self-defence and to the \nassistance it needs to repel South Africa's \nattacks. We are certain that neither this policy \nof Mack-mail nor the stationing of thousands of \nracist troops along Angola's frontier, nor the \nattempts to destabilize the front-line States, \nespecially Mozambique, nor the use of mercenaries \nto overthrow Governments, as happened in \nSeychelles, can weaken the clear determination of \nthose peoples to defend their sovereignty and to \nensure sovereignty for Namibia.\n249.\tWe condemn the aggressive policy of the \nracist regime of South Africa against \nneighbouring States, a policy which is the \nlogical outgrowth of its own criminal apartheid \nsystem. We reaffirm what our non-aligned movement \nhas stated on numerous occasions, namely, that \nthere can be no peace, stability and security in \nsouthern Africa until the oppressive and illegal \napartheid regime is totally eradicated. We are as \none in solidarity with the labour leaders \nimprisoned and condemned to death by the \ndiabolical racist regime, in flagrant violation \nof the most elementary human rights. The United \nNations must step up its campaign to prevent them \nfrom being executed and to win their release.\n250. The entire world has witnessed the brutal \naggression of which the Republic of Lebanon has \nbeen the victim, and in which atrocities \ncomparable only to the \\\"final solution\\\" policy \npursued by the Nazi regime were committed. It is \nappropriate to recall, in such circumstances, \nthat Hitler's Germany started that catastrophe \nwith its policy of territorial expansionism, \nwhich was followed by the mass extermination of \nhuman beings, and that one of its principal \nvictims was the Jewish people itself. Today, to \nthe world's consternation, the leaders of those \nwho survived genocide and the concentration camps \nare to be found promoting acts of genocide and \nbuilding concentration camps with the objective \nof exterminating the heroic Palestinian people.\n25l. The horrors which have occurred in the \nPalestinian refugee camps, the indiscriminate \nmassacring of the civilian population of Beirut \nand the denial of people's most elementary legal \nrights led the Government Junta of National \nReconstruction of Nicaragua to break the only \nremaining link we still had with Israel, that is, \nthe fiction of diplomatic relations, all genuine \nties having been severed upon the triumph of our \nRevolution. It was the least Nicaragua could do \nto express its categorical repudiation and total \nnon-recognition of the Zionist regime and at the \nsame time its militant support for the \nPalestinian combatants and their sole legitimate \nrepresentative, the PLO, and the long-suffering \npeople of Lebanon.\n252.\tWe feel it necessary to denounce, \nmoreover, the open complicity of a great Power in \nthe barbarism unleashed by the Zionist forces in \nLebanon. That Power gave the Zionist regime its \nfull political, military and economic support, \nthus ensuring that the crimes committed would go \nunpunished and, which is even more shameful, \nsystematically blocked the Security Council's \nefforts to restore peace, proclaiming that it \nalone was capable of controlling the monster \nwhich it had itself encouraged and which it had \nalways defended.\n253.\tThose events demonstrate clearly that the \nproblem of the Middle East can be resolved only \nby recognizing the inalienable rights of the \nPalestinian people, including the right to \nself-determination, to return to their homeland \nand to set up their own State. The international \ncommunity must step up its efforts to prevent the \npolicy of force and occupation practised by \nIsrael from prevailing in that area of the world, \na policy which could have the fatal corollary of \nthe physical extermination of the Palestinian \npeople. Equally evident is the fact that the \nMiddle East crisis will be capable of solution \nonly when the United States abandons its policy \nof protecting those guilty of crime, terrorism \nand genocide and stops thwarting United Nations \nefforts, in particular those of the \nSecretary-General and the Security Council, to \ncarry out the mandate set forth in the Charter.\n254.\tSpeaking as a member of the non-aligned \nmovement and as a revolutionary nation, we wish \nto voice our solidarity with all the countries \nand peoples fighting to win or to preserve their \nindependence: with the people of Cyprus, seeking \nto exercise their right to defend the sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of the nation; with \nGrenada and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, defending \ntheir sovereignty against imperialism; with the \nsister Republic of Cuba demanding the return of \nillegally occupied Guantanamo \u2014and we condemn in \nthe strongest possible terms the blockade and \nconstant threats against that country. We join \nthe brother people and Government of Panama in \ntheir just demand that the Torrijos-Carter \ntreaties be implemented.\n255.\tWe rejoice with the people of Bolivia \nover their nation's return to legality and \ndemocracy. We extend our solidarity to the people \nof Puerto Rico and support their right to \nindependence and self-determination in accordance \nwith General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), \nrecalling the fact that the problem facing the \nPuerto Rican people but that it is, rather, a \nmatter that concerns Latin America, to which \nPuerto Rico is an undeniable part. We support the \nKorean people's just struggle for the peaceful \nand democratic reunification of their nation free \nfrom foreign intervention.\n256.\tNicaragua reaffirms its support of the \nappeal issued by the non-aligned movement with \nregard to Western Sahara for the parties \nconcerned to enter into negotiations immediately \nin order to reach a just and lasting \nsolution\u2014that conflict in keeping with the \nprovisions of resolution 1514 (XV) and the \nprinciples of our movement, with the decisions \nadopted by the OAU and with the principles of the \nCharter.\n257.\tWe welcome the efforts made by the States \nof South-East Asia to begin a dialogue leading to \nthe re-establishment of peace and stability in \nthat region. We welcome as well the positions and \nappeals with regard to South-West Asia adopted by \nthe non-aligned movement at the Conference of \nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned \nCountries at New Delhi.\n258.\tThe worsening of the international \nsituation cannot be separated from the grave \ncrisis affecting the Organization. That is why we \nwelcome the frankness with which the \nSecretary-General in his report on the work of \nthe Organization acknowledges that the United \nNations is being ignored by some countries, and \nwe support the recommendations he makes aimed at \nstrengthening the Organization and, in \nparticular, at strengthening the authority of the \nSecurity Council to prevent conflicts and \nrevitalize the system of international security. \nIn this connection, it is worth stressing that \nthe use of the veto to thwart the condemnation of \nterror, aggression and genocide must no longer be \ntolerated, so that being in Washington's good \ngraces is not interpreted as a green light to \nviolate the fundamental principles of the Charter \nand the most basic norms of law.\n259.\tIt should be a matter of profound concern \nto the international community that a permanent \nmember of the Security Council tends to turn \nincreasingly to the veto in detriment to the just \nproposals for peace advanced, with a lofty sense \nof responsibility, by Governments in the most \ntroubled regions of the world. In specific terms, \nwe wish to refer to the Reagan Administration's \ndecision to veto the draft resolution regarding \nCentral America submitted by Panama and Guyana on \n2 April of this year, a draft resolution that \nconfined itself simply to reaffirming the \nillegality of the use of force or the threat of \nforce in relations between States and that called \nfor dialogue between all parties concerned.\n260.\tNicaragua believes there is no \njustification whatsoever for the Reagan \nAdministration's attitude towards our country and \nthe Central American region. We deem it absurd to \nportray us as a threat to the United States for \nhaving chosen, in the exercise of our sovereign \nrights, an independent political path within the \nframework of the most scrupulous non-alignment. \nIt is even more absurd to try to blame Nicaragua \nfor all the problems Central American countries \nare enduring, problems whose origins and true \ncauses can be found solely and exclusively in the \nconstant postponement of appropriate solutions. \nThis is a situation the peoples of Central \nAmerica seem unwilling to go on tolerating \nindefinitely, despite the fact that the United \nStates continues to oppose any changes that might \nresult in greater independence for the States of \nCentral America.\n261.\tWe have stressed\u2014and we do so here once \nagain\u2014that the Nicaraguan Government genuinely \ndesires an understanding with the United States \nthat would make it possible substantially to \nimprove the relations between our two States on \nthe basis of mutual respect, non-intervention in \ninternal affairs and, above all, on the basis of \nsovereign equality, independence and \nself-determination\u2014principles that constitute the \nfoundation of peace and stability in the world \nand that are found throughout the Charter.\n262.\tGuided by our unshakeable devotion to \npeace, we have presented to the Reagan \nAdministration a number of different approaches \nfor initiating dialogue, reiterating time and \nagain our invitation to hold high-level meetings \nbetween representatives of our States in the hope \nof avoiding the putting into effect of the \nthreats of the use offence against Nicaragua.\n263.\tUnfortunately, the response of the United \nStates Government to date has been to attempt to \nimpose upon us its rigid East-West outlook, a \ncombination of economic pressures, accusations \nand threats culminating in the financing of \ncovert destabilizing activities and the open use \nof its territory for the training of \ncounter-revolutionary forces and for the \npreparation of actions of a criminal nature \nagainst Nicaragua. The financial and \norganizational assistance the Reagan \nAdministration is lending the enemies of our \npeople has led to an increase in terrorist acts \nand armed assaults on our national territory and \nto a substantial increase in the weaponry, \npersonnel and organization provided to the \ncounter-revolutionary forces. Those forces have \nbeen supplied with sophisticated means of warfare \nused solely by professional armies\u2014such as those \nfound in the wake of the evidenced blowing up and \nsabotaging of two strategic bridges near the \nborder with Honduras and as evidenced by the use \nof armed aircraft in attempts to destroy our only \noil refinery and the fuel stores located at the \nport of Corinto on the Pacific coast. To round \nout this distressing picture, we cannot avoid \nmentioning the presence of United States warships \nin our territorial waters, the overflights of spy \nplanes and the holding of joint military \nmanoeuvres with the Honduran army near our \nborders.\n264.\tGuided by our firm determination to \nconsolidate peace in our region, our Government \nhas taken part in and promoted the search for \nsolutions which would permit an understanding \namong the Central American countries, to which we \nare united by bonds so strong that no foreign \nPower, no matter how powerful it may be, could \never permanently impair them.\n265.\tIn this regard I should like to recall \nthe far-reaching importance which the meeting of \nforeign ministers, held in San Jose, Costa Rica, \non 14 and 15 March 1980, had for Central American \nunity. As the Declaration adopted at the meeting \nputs it, it was motivated by the conviction that \ndirect and frank dialogue between the countries \nof the Central American isthmus was the best way \nto review the regional situation in the \npolitical, economic and social fields, as the \nmost appropriate means of adopting positions to \nbenefit the peoples of Central America. The first \npoint in the 1980 San Jose Declaration affirms \nthat the peaceful and harmonious coexistence of \nthe States in the region requires respect for the \ndifferent political systems, for the right to \nself-determination and the right to resolve \ninternal affairs in accordance with each nation's \nhistorical development.\n266.\tAnother important agreement adopted at \nthat meeting was the inclusion of the sister \nrepublic of Panama as an integral part of Central \nAmerica, along with the institutionalization of \nthe meetings of the Foreign Ministers of the \narea, which are to be held regularly three times \na year.\n267.\tMore recently, during my visit to \nTegucigalpa in April of this year the Honduran \nMinister for External Relations, Edgardo Paz \nBarnica, informed me that he would immediately \ncall a meeting of the foreign ministers of the \nregion\u2014an initiative which Nicaragua welcomed \nwithout delay or reservations. I committed myself \nto attending, and to supporting the inclusion in \nthe agenda of that meeting of the six points \ncontained in a peace proposal which the Foreign \nMinister of Honduras said he wanted to submit for \nconsideration to the foreign ministers of \nGuatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, \nCosta Rica and Panama.\n268.\tSurprisingly, six months after our \nconversation \u2014in other words, in this month of \nOctober\u2014bypassing the still-valid agreements of \nthe Declaration of Central American Foreign \nMinisters of 1980, another meeting of Foreign \nMinisters was called, also in Costa Rica, \npromoted by the United States, from which certain \nCentral American States were excluded. This \nexclusion violated the agreements adopted \npreviously by the region's Foreign Ministers, \nhence this meeting can be regarded only as an \nunimportant and marginal event in terms of its \ncontent, and as going against our peoples' \ngenuine interests of peace, stability and \ndevelopment.\n269.\tCentral America, for the reasons we have \nalready outlined, finds itself in the midst of \ngreat political upheavals, exacerbated by grave \neconomic problems. Nevertheless, as pointed out \nin the joint letter sent by the Presidents of \nMexico and Venezuela to the Co-ordinator of the \nNicaraguan Government Junta of National \nReconstruction, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, and to \nthe President of Honduras, Roberto Suazo Cordoba, \nit is undeniable that the most critical situation \nfacing the region the most serious problem, is \nthe dangerous deterioration of relations between \nHonduras and Nicaragua, which could result in a \nconflict of unforeseeable proportions.\n270.\tThe attitude adopted by the United States \nGovernment, which must be denounced, has \ndecisively influenced powerful sectors of the \nHonduran army, which are providing ample \nassistance to the counterrevolutionary forces, \npermitting the use of Honduran territory as a \nbase for military operations to attack towns and \nposts along the Nicaraguan border, as well as the \nsupply of weapons, infrastructure, and logistical \nsupport, tolerating the provocations and attacks \nby soldiers of that country's army, and are even \ngoing so far as to sign specific agreements with \nthe United States on the basis of which the \nUnited States Government has increased its \nmilitary aid to Honduras, financing the \nreconstruction of airports and military bases, \nmultiplying the number of its advisers, and \nreserving the right to use these and other bases \nand military infrastructure in Honduras. It is \nobvious that this policy is giving rise to a \ndangerous spiral of war in Central America. It \nencourages the most aggressive sectors of \nHonduras and other countries of the region, who \nrecklessly brag in public about their military \nability to defeat Nicaragua and openly call for \nforeign intervention against our country,\n271.\tThese military preparations, which amount \nto a prelude to the much-advertised assault on \nNicaragua, were recently denounced by the former \nCommander of the Honduran Public Security Force, \nColonel Leonidas Torres Arias, and this week by \nthe Mayor of Puerto Lempira, Marcial Colemann, \nwho told news agencies that an unprecedented \ninvasion of Nicaragua was approaching and that \nPuerto Lempira, his own city, would be the \norganizational centre for the invasion. He \nreported that the counter-revolutionaries there \nwere being supplied by a Hercules aircraft of the \nUnited States Air Force. He also stated that \nthere was a warehouse in Puerto Lempira which was \nfull of weapons that local residents could see, \nand that there was evidence of \ncounter-revolutionary camps from which a silent \ninvasion of our country had already begun.\n272.\tNotwithstanding these irrefutable facts, \nan elaborate diplomatic and propaganda campaign \nis under way to defame Nicaragua and portray us \nas a country opposed to all dialogue, when the \ntruth is that it is the people of Nicaragua who \nare being attacked and it is Honduras that \nsystematically refuses to take part in a dialogue \nat the highest level to find solutions to \nbilateral problems. It is possible that this \nreluctance stems from a recognition of the fact \nthat our problems with Honduras\u2014a brother nation \nwith which we have close-knit ties\u2014are really \nproblems with the United States, since the Reagan \nAdministration conscious of how absurd and \ncounter-productive a direct confrontation with \nNicaragua would be\u2014the United States so big and \nwe so small\u2014has chosen Honduras as the ideal \ncountry from which to attack us with the foolish \naim of destabilizing us and overthrowing our \nGovernment. It forgets that this objective is \nimpossible to attain in the light of our people's \nmonolithic unity and our determination to defend \nand consolidate the achievements we have gained \nat such a high cost.\n273.\tFrom September of last year to September \nof this year our country has endured \napproximately 143 attacks from Honduras. We have \ndetected some 23 infiltrations of \ncounter-revolutionary military groups and units. \nThere have been 10 violations of and incidents in \nour territorial waters. A11 of that has left a \npainful toll of more than 150 Nicaraguans killed, \n30 missing and incalculable material damage, \nwhich forced our Government at one point to \nevacuate the civilian population in the frontier \nregion, which had become a veritable \nscorched-earth battlefield.\n274.\tWithin the framework of its many peace \ninitiatives, Nicaragua promoted the meeting \nbetween the heads of State of Honduras and \nNicaragua, at the El Guasaule border post on 13 \nMay we have repeatedly requested a meeting \nbetween the army leaders of both States, \nsomething agreed Co at El Guasaule; this past \nApril I travelled to Tegucigalpa to talk with the \nForeign Minister, Mr. Paz Barnica and present him \nwith a seven-point peace plan, later rejected by \nHonduras down to the last detail; we worked for \nthe meeting between the chiefs of staff of the \nrespective armed forces, held this past May at \nthe La Fraternidad border post\u2014as a result of the \nagreements obtained at the La Fraternidad \nmeeting, the only meeting that has actually been \nheld was between the heads of the naval forces of \nour countries in the port of Corinto.\n275.\tThe rapid deterioration of the situation \nalong the border and the systematic refusal of \nHonduras to offer the viable solutions urgently \nneeded in accordance with the existing situation \nled Nicaragua to make yet another effort and on 6 \nAugust we extended an invitation to the President \nof Honduras to meet in Managua with the \nCo-ordinator of the Government Junta of National \nReconstruction of Nicaragua. It was made known \nunofficially that such a meeting would require a \nprior meeting of Foreign Ministers. On 24 August \nI sent an invitation to the Honduran Minister for \nExternal Relations for us to meet in Managua in \nearly September, an invitation I renewed on 4 \nOctober, asking him to set the date. The Honduran \nresponse to both invitations was that an \nexcessive work-load made any commitments \nimpossible now. Under these circumstances, the \nGovernments of Mexico and Venezuela launched \ntheir very worthwhile peace initiative, which \nNicaragua immediately welcomed and which we were \nmost pleased to accept, but which Honduras has, \nunfortunately, rejected on the grounds of having \nmatters of a higher priority to deal with at \npresent.\n276.\tFully aware of the delicate situation \nexisting in Central America, Nicaragua has \nredoubled its efforts and will continue to do all \nthat is humanly possible in order to obtain a \npeaceful settlement, through dialogue, of the \nmatter of the critical relations with the United \nStates and Honduras, as we have turned the \nstruggle for peace into the guiding principle of \nall we do in the political realm. Nicaragua seeks \nonly to live in peace, to move forward with the \nprocess of our material and spiritual \nreconstruction within the most absolute respect \nfor the principles of the Charter and of \nnon-alignment.\n"

        "file_text": "My delegation wishes to associate itself with the compliments paid to \nyou, Mr. President, on your election to your high office, and we \npledge to you our continued co operation. We would also like to \nacknowledge with satisfaction the outstanding leadership of your \npredecessor in office. I would like to place on record my \nGovernment's satisfaction with the excellent work being done by the \nSecretary General during his first year in office. We wish to assure \nhim of our continued support. We extend to him our compliments and \nendorse his forthright and incisive views on the major issues \nconfronting this planet and on the role of the United Nations in the \nefforts to resolve the problems that we share as a result of our \ninseparable humanity. He has highlighted not only the problems, but \nthe structural weaknesses of the Organization in tackling those \nproblems. In our view, the United Nations must, as a matter of \nurgency, address both dimensions if all of humanity is to have even a \nchance.\nIn the Secretary General's report on the work of the Organization he \nalluded to the failure of the collective security system of the \nLeague of Nations. It will be recalled that concurrently with the \nfailure of the League of Nations the world suffered an unprecedented \neconomic depression which in many ways contributed to the upheaval of \nthe Second World War.\nIt has been noted that the only thing we learn from history is that \nwe do not learn from history. How true that is. The present world \npolitical and economic situation, which I need not reiterate before \nthe Assembly, and the inability of the United Nations to deal \neffectively with issues pertaining thereto, bear an unnerving \nresemblance to the events that ushered in the Second World War.\nWhile my country, Fiji, in the peaceful South Pacific Ocean, is \nthousands of miles away from the Middle East, our commitment to world \npeace led to our direct involvement in United Nations efforts to \nbring peace and stability to the area. Of particular concern to my \nGovernment has been the recent resurgence of war in the unfortunate \ncountry of Lebanon. The resultant massacres of Palestinian men, women \nand children is a matter  to be deplored by all. My Government has \nalready condemned all those that were directly or indirectly involved \nin the killings. The problem of Lebanon is part of the overall \nproblem of the Middle East J which has defied solution for more than \nthree decades. In the mean time, new elements have been injected into \nthe conflict and this has made peace in the area even more elusive.\nMy delegation continues to support the principles set forth in \nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) as a basis for \npeace in the region. It is also imperative that the aspirations of \nthe Palestinian people to a homeland be realized, and that the rights \nof all States, including that of Israel, to live within recognized \nboundaries be acknowledged.\nMy country has always advocated the peaceful resolution of all \ndisputes through dialogue and negotiations. It was in this spirit \nthat my Government agreed to contribute peace keeping forces to \nUNIFIL in 1978. In the same spirit, Fiji decided to contribute troops \nto the multinational forces and observers last year in order to \nfurther the peace agreement between Egypt and Israel that led to the \nreturn of the Sinai.\nThe cost of the contribution to UNIFIL has been particularly \nburdensome for a small country such as ours. For the past four years \nour ability to maintain our troops in Lebanon has been seriously \nundermined by the accumulated arrears of reimbursements, which amount \nto millions of dollars. It is our earnest hope that all Member States \nwill meet their obligations and pay the assessed contributions \npromptly so that reimbursements at the agreed levels can be made to \nparticipants in UNIFIL without delay.\nNo one can deny that UNIFIL has proved its usefulness, but for peace \nkeeping forces to be effective it is essential that they have both a \nclear mandate and the co operation, respect and support of all Member \nStates and, more particularly, of the immediate parties to the \ndisputes. This, regrettably, has not always been the case in Lebanon.\nThe situation in the Asian region has remained the same. Foreign \narmed intervention and occupation continue in Afghanistan and \nKampuchea. In both cases the majority of United Nations Members have \ntaken an unequivocal stand, to which we subscribe. This international \nconcern will continue until the foreign forces are unconditionally \nwithdrawn. Only then will the freedom of their people and the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of those countries be restored.\nWith respect to Kampuchea, the recent initiatives that have brought \nthe resistance groups into a coalition provide a better basis for a \nnegotiated and peaceful solution of the problem in that country. We \nhope that there will be a more positive response to this important \ndevelopment.\nThe vexed question of the peaceful reunification of Korea remains \nwith us. However, we regard the recent proposal by South Korea as an \nimportant step towards reconciliation. It is our hope that a unified \nKorea will soon become a reality.\nIn the field of disarmament very little has been achieved. All we \nhear of are new initiatives or the breakdown of talks. The recent \nspecial session of the General Assembly on disarmament was no \nexception. If anything, the arms race has been escalated. The goal is \nno longer to establish deterrent forces, but rather, as one of the \nsuper Powers has stated recently from this rostrum, to achieve armed \nsuperiority and maintain it. We must pause to think of the logical \nconsequences of such a course and where the super Powers are leading \nus all. There appears to be no limit to man's quest for self \ndestruction.\nIt is more urgent than ever that, as a first step, the international \ncommunity agree to the total prohibition of nuclear weapon testing. \nFiji supports this proposal, as well as efforts to conclude a \ncomprehensive test ban treaty. In this regard, it urges the \nresumption of the trilateral talks.\nWe in the South Pacific find ourselves a direct victim of the arms \nrace. One major Power continues its nuclear testing in the Pacific, \nin total disregard of the protests of the peoples and the Governments \nin the region. These tests, conducted by France on small atolls, pose \ngreat hazards to the marine environment in the region. No one can say \nwith certainty what the effect of those tests may be in the future.\nLast August the heads of Governments of the South Pacific countries, \nwho met in Rotorua, New Zealand, once again condemned those tests and \nurged their immediate cessation. They also expressed their opposition \nto the dumping of nuclear wastes in the Pacific. We hope that those \ncalls will not go unheeded.\nSince its inception the Organization has played an important role in \nthe field of decolonization. As a member of the Special Committee on \nthe Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on \nthe Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples over \nthe past 12 years, Fiji has seen the decolonization process evolve \nfurther. Apart from Namibia, the African continent is liberated. But \nthere are still other dependent Territories in other parts of the \nworld. Some of these are in the Pacific, and we note with interest \nthat this process of evolution is beginning to take place in \nTerritories such as New Caledonia. In this connection the leaders of \nthe countries of the South Pacific Forum find reassuring the \ndetermination of the French Government to introduce important reforms \nin that Territory Y these reforms are followed through, they should \neventually lead to self determination and independence with the full \nparticipation of its indigenous population. We welcome this important \ndevelopment.\nAfter years of arduous negotiation, the Third United Nations \nConference on the Law of the Sea adopted in April this year a \ncomprehensive Convention dealing with all uses of the sea. It is a \npity that, because of a few delegations, this important milestone in \nrecent history could not be reached by consensus. But this cannot \ndetract from the significance of the achievement, given the vastness, \nimportance and complexity of  the subject matter, the conflicting \ninterests of States and the difficulty of working out an \ninternational regime for the sea bed beyond national jurisdiction \ncapable of equitably balancing the interests of developed and \ndeveloping countries.\nFor Fiji and similar small island countries the Convention \nconsolidates their inherent rights to the resources in their \nsurrounding seas. It was therefore not surprising that the heads of \nGovernment of the South Pacific countries, at a recent meeting, \nunanimously welcomed the adoption of the Convention and urged all \nStates to sign and ratify it. Indeed, my Prime Minister observed that \nit was an historic act and a milestone in international negotiations. \nFiji, which participated actively in the negotiations, looks forward \nto signing the Final Act in Jamaica this year.\nThe world economy is beset by severe problems. The industrialized \ncountries are facing continuing recession and heavy unemployment. \nEnough interest rates have tended to decline recently, they have been \nat unprecedentedly high levels in the past two years. Commodity \nprices are at their lowest levels and the volume of international \ntrade has virtually ceased to grow. Global interdependence is such \nthat the prosperity of the developing countries is dependent on the \nperformance of the industrialized countries. The recession in the \nindustrialized countries, therefore, has a profound impact on the \neconomies of the developing countries. Many developing countries \nwhich are already struggling with large debt repayments have had \ntheir problems exacerbated by high interest payments, adverse trends \nin the terms of trade and depressed export volumes.\nThe conditions of weak demand and high unemployment in the \nindustrialized countries have led to an increasing tendency towards \nprotectionism. In particular, there has been an expanding commitment \nin developed countries to protect agriculture through high tariffs, \nvariable import levies or variable export subsidies. As a result, \nthere is hardly a major agricultural product in which developed \ncountries compete with developing countries for which the world \nmarket is not undermined or distorted by subsidized exports or \nconcessional sales from surplus stocks of developed countries. In \nsome cases, as a consequence of rising agricultural protection, \ncountries which were once large importers have become large \nsubsidized exporters. International commodity agreements are rendered \nuseless by large scale dumping.\nA case in point is that of sugar. In 1981, for instance, the European \nEconomic Community became the world's second largest exporter of \nsugar, after Cuba. Ironically, it is the developing countries, which \ncannot afford large scale competitive subsidization of major exports, \nthat are forced to adjust\nIn the present world economic climate the plight of the small island \ncountries such as Fiji is a difficult one. They are vulnerable. Their \neconomies are highly susceptible to external economic influences \nbeyond their control. Fiji's expert base is Harrow, with sugar and \ntourism the two major foreign exchange earners, accounting for the \nmajor part of total foreign exchange receipts.\nThe unpredictable and harsh impact of external developments has \nbrought a number of small island economies face to face with \nprecarious financial situations. Their efforts to develop and \ndiversify their economies have been dealt severe blows by adverse \nworld economic developments, such as the oil crisis, high rates of \ninterest, protectionism and drying pools of multilateral and \nbilateral loans. The smallness of island economics and their high \ndependence on international trade leave these countries limited \npolicy options for solving the problems of low income,, high \nunemployment and balance of payments deficits.\nIn a period when global arrangements Car trade liberalization have \nnot made progress, my Government finds at least two limited \narrangements of particular interest, the first being the Lome \nConvention between the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and the European \nCommunity, and the second the South Pacific Regional Trade and Co \noperation Agreement between the small island countries in the South \nPacific and Australia and New Zealand. The Lome Convention also \nguarantees access to part of our vital sugar exports into the \nEuropean Community. Under SPARTEC A, certain products from the island \ncountries enjoy preferential access to Australian and New Zealand \nmarkets. Both these arrangements have provided considerable economic \nbenefits to the developing countries concerned and are examples of \nthe kind of schemes required under the North South economic dialogue. \nAs a member of the Governing Council of UNDP, Fiji is concerned about \nthe general decline in the resources available to UNDP. The numerous \nprojects supported by UNDP in many developing countries and the \nincreasing number of requests regularly made for such assistance \namply demonstrate the significant role being played by UNDP. It is to \nbe hoped that Member States, both donors and recipients, will make \nextra efforts to build up the resources of UNDP so that it can meet \nthe demands on it.\nThese and many other issues of international concern, on which \nprevious speakers have addressed the Assembly so eloquently, have \nbecome the stumbling blocks in the efforts to achieve a peaceful and \nsecure world. They have to be resolved, and this world body cannot \nabdicate this responsibility. Like others, my delegation knows only \ntoo well the magnitude of this responsibility. The task before the \nUnited Nations in ensuring peace and security in the world and in \npromoting development is not an easy one. We represent an \norganization in which diversity is the norm rather than the \nexception. However, many of the achievements that we as an \norganization have registered and hope to continue to register have \nbeen and remain possible only through a commonality of purpose, \naccommodation of differences and understanding. The issues before us \nat this session of the General Assembly reflect this diversity and \ncall for much greater understanding than has been demonstrated in the \npast.\nI wish to conclude my statement by drawing to the attention of the \ninternational community the plight of the very small communities \nmicro States, as they are called most of which are islands. I do not \npretend to be a spokesman for them, but it is clear that their \nspecial needs are not being adequately addressed and that so far as \nthe United Nations is concerned such countries, including my own, \nappear to be nobody's baby.\nThe economic situation to which I referred earlier, which is so well \nknown to representatives, bears particularly harshly on small, \nscattered communities. Their fragile economies are often tied to a \nsingle crop and they are susceptible to natural disasters. These are \nthe harsh realities of their daily existence. We experience major \ndisadvantages as we try to modernize, and find ourselves caught in \nvicious circles in our interaction with larger, more powerful \ncountries. For example, it is not relevant to use per capita income \nas an index of our status. Its use inevitably denies us access to \nconcessionary finance with which to advance our development. Those of \nus that make a little headway through our own efforts appear to be \npenalized for doing so. It is as if whenever we think we are making \nends meet someone moves the ends.\nThere is no point in preaching to us that we should pull ourselves up \nby our own bootstraps when , those who give that advice keep standing \non our hands.\nYet let us not abandon hope. Huxley's  Brave New World  may not have \nanticipated a world in which islands come closer to center stage, but \nthat world is not far off. For the first time in human history, small \nStates are finding themselves expanded almost overnight as their \njurisdiction encompasses millions of square miles of ocean. How to \nutilize\nthat space, how to explore and exploit it to improve the lives of our \npeople and, indeed, all mankind, poses a challenge that we cannot \nface alone. No longer will the development models of the 1930s and \n1960s, based on large land masses, as inAfrica, Asia or Latin \nAmerica, distract or delude us.\nI do not imply that islands will soon be the inheritors of untold \nwealth or that all our problems will be overcome. My point is that \nthe day is dawning when a new order of importance must be attached to \nus, our needs and our potentials, for in that process interdependence \nitself will be made more manifest and achieve a real meaning beyond \ntoday's fashionable rhetoric.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, I should like to begin my statement by \nextending to you our sincere congratulations on \nyour election to the presidency of this session. \nThis is a fitting tribute to your country and to \nyou personally. We are gratified to note that, at \nthis crucial time when the United Nations is \nbeing put to severe tests by ever-escalating \ntension and conflicts, as well as increasing \neconomic problems, the membership of the \nOrganization has entrusted a conscientious and \nable statesman with the task of steering us \nthrough this difficult course. I should also like \nto pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. \nKittani, who presided over the thirty-sixth \nsession of the General Assembly with efficiency, \ndignity and wisdom. We have noted with \nappreciation the commendable efforts continually \nexpended by the Secretary-General in reasserting \nthe authority of the Organization and putting it \nto the service of nations in time of conflict. In \nextending a formal welcome and hearty \ncongratulations to him on his election to the \npost, I pledge my country's fullest co-operation \nwith him in the years to come.\nSince the last session, the international \ncommunity, particularly the Organization, has \nbeen confronted with trying times and challenging \nissues. The world watched in horror at the damage \nin Lebanon. We stood helpless as the conflict in \nthe Falkland Islands (Malvinas) degenerated into \narmed confrontation and took its toll. There is \nalmost a subtle sense of resignation as\tcontinues \nto devise the most brutal means of subjugating \nthe people in South Africa. The Namibian people \ncontinue to be condemned to racist South Africa's \nillegal occupation and colonialism. And an end to \nthe sad Iranian-Iraqi war continues to elude us.\nWe are at present witnessing one of the most \ndisturbing periods in the post-war era. The \ndelicate balance so painstakingly fashioned over \nthe many years through the process of \ninternational dialogue and detente is giving way \nto tension and confrontation. The procedures for \nthe settlement of disputes which were so \nlaboriously created have almost lost their \ninfluence over the trend of international \nrelations. Today tension prevails in all areas of \nthe world. Confrontation and outright resort to \nforce become common means of settling disputes. \nThe fundamental question is whether peace and \nsecurity can be maintained in an environment \nwhere there is genuine concern that recourse to \nlawlessness will go unpunished by the \ninternational community or, at worst, be received \nwith acquiescence by Members of the Organization.\nThe politics of force, so reminiscent of the \ncold- war era, seem to be creeping back, thus \npoisoning the international political atmosphere. \nAs a consequence, the global consensus that had \nevolved regarding various problems in the world, \nstands to be brushed aside by this resurgence of \ncold-war politics. In various parts of the world, \nperennial problems have continued to be resistant \nto solutions and new crisis situations have \nemerged.\nPeace is a deliberate process. To achieve peace, \nwe must embark on a clear, deliberate and \ndetermined road in the search for solutions to \nthe existing conflicts and look into viable means \nof averting those that are simmering. But we \ncannot do so unless our resolve is definite and \nour determination unflinching. We cannot do so \nunless we remain faithful to the ideals of the \nCharter and are willing to give it a chance to \nwork. For Member States will be defeating the \nvery purpose of their signatures to the Charter \nif, on the one hand, they extol its ideals and, \non the other, pursue policies aimed at \nundermining it.\nconstitutes constant aggression against the \npeople of South Africa and a serious threat to \ninternational peace and security. It is a fact \nthat apartheid is not invincible. But the \nstruggle for its elimination is frustrated by the \ndirect or indirect support the regime receives \nfrom some Members of the Organization. These \nMembers, none the less, increase their \nco-operation with and support for that regime. We \nneed not recount the number of times the \ninternational community has been preventedfrom \ntaking action by the use of the veto. We need not \nremind the Assembly that the issue of \ncomprehensive sanctions against that regime \nremains frozen, solely because of the \nunwillingness of some permanent members of the \nSecurity Council to consider it seriously. We \nneed not spell out all the areas of economic and \npolitical, as well as military, co-operation.\nRegrettably, these obstacles placed on the path \nof the freedom struggle in South Africa have the \neffect of reinforcing the apartheid regime and \nmaking it even more insensitive to reason and \nmore defiant of world opinion. The overall effect \nis to block the peaceful means towards the \nelimination of the scourge of . When peaceful \navenues are thus blocked, the freedom fighters \nare left with no other option but to resort to \narmed resistance. The message which comes out \nloud and clear from the land of\nis that the people of that unhappy land are \nprepared to make supreme sacrifices for their \nfreedom and for their dignity. In concert with \nthe rest of Africa, we reaffirm our support for \nand solidarity with the South African people and \nwe reiterate our conviction that the \ninternational community can make an important \ncontribution to that struggle if it shoulders its \nproper responsibility and institutes appropriate \nmeasures.\nToday, almost two decades after this body \nterminated the Mandate of South Africa and \nassumed direct responsibility for the Territory, \nthe people of Namibia continue to be deprived of \ntheir most basic human rights It is indeed a sad \ncommentary on the efficacy of the United Nations \nthat Namibia should continue to be subjected to \nracism, colonialism and human suffering. The \ncontinued illegal occupation of that \ninternational Territory by South Africa is a \nflagrant violation of international law and \nconstitutes an affront to world conscience and to \nthe fundamental dignity of mankind.\nThe\tregime has a unique record of flouting \ninternational opinion. Inside Namibia it has \nunleashed a reign of terror against the people of \nthe international Territory and particularly \nagainst the leadership and the heroic combatants \nof the South West Africa People's Organization. \nThe regime has also been busy propping up \ninternal surrogates in an attempt to facilitate \nthe imposition of a neo-colonial solution to the \nproblem.\nOn the other hand, South Africa has been engaged \nin a systematic campaign of destabilization of \nthe neighboring African States. Using the \ninternational Territory of Namibia as a launching \npad, it has repeatedly committed blatant acts of \naggression against the People's Republic of \nAngola and, in the process, has inflicted damage \nand destruction to life and property. Women and \nchildren and other innocent civilians have been \nits constant victims and for more than one year \nnow it has occupied parts of southern Angola, \nnotwithstanding the international outcry and \ncondemnation. Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe \nhave also been subjected to aggression while the \napartheid regime has continued its pressures on \nBotswana and subversion against the Kingdom of \nLesotho. A part of its conspiracy against these \nAfrican States, South Africa has been training, \nfinancing and equipping mercenaries to cause \ninstability in some of them. All these acts \nconstitute a clear threat to the security and \nstability of the region, with dangerous \nimplications for international peace and \nsecurity. They can be ignored only at our \ncollective peril.\nNegotiations on the question of Namibia have \nbecome a saga of disappointment and frustration. \nWhenever there were prospects for a light at the \nend of the tunnel, those prospects were shattered \nby the introduction of new and unreasonable \ndemands in the negotiating process. While we have \nbeen engaged in the negotiations aimed at \nsecuring a peaceful settlement to the Namibian \nquestion, we have maintained that: first, \nSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978) remains \nthe basis for achieving independence for Namibia \nand thus there is a need to have it implemented \nwithout delay; secondly, the Western contact \ngroup, at whose diplomatic initiative the plan \nfor the independence of Namibia was originally \nconceived and which possesses considerable \nleverage over South Africa, has a duty to see to \nit that the plan is implemented; and thirdly, the \ncentral role of the Organization in working for \nthe independence of the Territory must be \nunderlined.\nOver the last few months the front-line States, \nSWAPO and Nigeria have been engaged in \nconstructive consultations with the Western \ncontact group regarding the implementation of \nresolution 435 (1978). We regret that, although \nsome progress has been made, some issues remain \noutstanding. But the main obstacle remains the \nintransigence of the South African regime and \nthis defiance by the South African authorities is \nregrettably assisted by the introduction into the \nnegotiating process of an extraneous issue.\nIt is thus a matter of deep regret that a non- \nissue should be made to pose as a difficulty. The \nattempt to link the independence of Namibia with \nthe withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola poses \na serious danger of derailing the entire \nexercise. The fact that this concept of linkage \nis now euphemistically called parallelism does \nnot in any way change the substance of that \npolicy. We have made it clear that this issue is \nagainst the letter and the spirit of Security \nCouncil resolution 435 (1978) and constitutes \ninterference in the internal affairs of a \nsovereign State. This position was reiterated by \nthe heads of State and Government of the \nfront-line States and by the President of SWAPO \nin their communique issued at the?? summit in \nLusaka on 4 September this year. When we consider \nthe painstaking efforts that have been made by \nall concerned with a view to achieving a \nnegotiated solution to this seemingly intractable \nproblem, it would be very sad indeed if these \nefforts were eventually to crumble because of an \ninsistence on injecting into negotiations an \nissue which is totally alien to resolution 435 \n(1978). We are, in connection, gratified by the \nclear statement made by the Foreign Minister of \nFrance, Mr. Claude Chey\u00eds son; in his press \nconference in Dar-es-Salaam yesterday, he made it \nvery clear that France rejects the issue of \nlinkage,\nFreedom and independence for peoples and \ncountries are principles we hold sacrosanct. It \nis in consonance with this policy that we have \nsupported and shall continue to support the right \nof the people of Western Sahara to \nself-determination and independence. It is a \nright which is engrained in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations and that of the Organization of \nAfrican Unity\tThus while we search for a \nsolution to the problem of Western Sahara, my \ncountry will continue to be guided by its \ncommitment to these principles.\nAnother tragic example of the powerlessness of \nthe international community is the situation in \nLebanon. The ongoing tragedy, with its \nimplications for the sovereignty and integrity of \na nation and the elementary human rights of the \nLebanese and Palestinian people, is threatening \nto lead the entire region down the path of total \nconflagration. The Israeli occupation of Lebanon, \nthe brutal war Israel has perpetrated against the \nPalestinians, the siege of Beirut and the \ndreadful massacres at Sabra and Shatila are a \nclear demonstration of the dangerously \ndeteriorating situation in the area. Israel has \ninvaded and continues to occupy the territory of \na sovereign Member of the Organization. It bears \nresponsibility for the murder of innocent \nPalestinian women and children. Perhaps one \ncannot adequately express in words the suffering, \ntorment and the humiliation which the surviving \npeople are being subjected to under Israeli \noccupation.\nWe pay homage to the Lebanese and the Palestinian \npeople for their heroism and steadfastness. We \nhonor their monumental sacrifices, made in the \ncause of preserving their dignity and in the \nfight for what is right and just. We also pay a \ntribute to the Palestine Liberation Organization, \nwhich in a time of such profound crisis has \ndemonstrated outstanding courage and \nstatesmanship.\nTanzania reiterates its firm belief that the \nrestoration of peace and security will come about \nnot through policies of military adventurism on \nthe part of Israel, but through the promotion of \nthe fundamental attributes of peace. A genuine \nand lasting peace hinges upon the enjoyment by \nthe Palestinian people of their inalienable right \nto self-determination, including the right to \nestablish an independent state of their own. The \nacquisition of territory by force is \ninadmissible, and hence Israel must withdraw from \nall the occupied territories. In consonance with \nthat principle it must equally be underlined that \nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of all States in the area is a \nnecessary condition for the attainment of a \ngenuine, viable and lasting solution to the \nproblem.\n\n\nThe war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of \nIran continues to be a matter of great concern to \nmy country. We regret the fact that the two non- \naligned neighbors are still engulfed in a \nseemingly unending war which has already claimed \nheavy casualties and has led to appalling \ndevastation, of property. My country has actively \nsupported, and will continue to support, the \nmediations efforts of the United Nations, the \nnon-aligned movement and the Organization of the \nIslamic Conference, as well as those of \nindividual countries which have sought to find a \nspeedy, peaceful and lasting resolution of the \nconflict. In that connection, we note with \nappreciation the considerable efforts expended by \nthe current Chairman of the non-aligned movement. \nThus, we once more renew our appeal to the \nparties to the conflict through negotiations to \nbring about an end to the current conflict.\nLast year we expressed optimism over the \nsituation in Cyprus. The momentum which has been \ninjected into the intercommunal talks with the \nsubmission of comprehensive proposals \nencompassing both the territorial and \nconstitutional aspects of the problem seems, \nunfortunately, to have lapsed. The persistence of \nthis problem continues to plunge that tormented \ncountry into deeper division. My delegation will \ncontinue to support the efforts to promote \ndialogue and to search for a political framework \nwithin which the problem can be settled. We \nremain hopeful that the parties to the conflict \nwill demonstrate a genuine willingness to \nco-operate fully with the representatives of the \nSecretary-General in evolving a mutually \nacceptable framework for bringing the tragedy to \nan end through the restoration of that country's \nunity and territorial integrity, as well as \nthrough the preservation of its sovereignty, \nindependence and non-alignment.\nTanzania supports the noble efforts of the Korean \npeople towards the peaceful reunification of \ntheir country. At the same time we firmly believe \nthat the withdrawal of all foreign troops from \nthe area would be a significant step towards \nushering in a dialogue between the two parts of \nKorea, aimed at eventually bringing about \npeaceful reunification.\nBoth in Afghanistan and Kampuchea, there must be \nconcerted efforts on our part to settle the \noutstanding problems on the basis of respect for \nthe principles of sovereignty,, territorial \nintegrity and nonintervention in the internal \naffairs of those States, to do this, however, \nthere must be a willingness on the part of \neveryone to evolve a political framework within \nwhich these problems can be solved. For our part, \nwe shall continue to support initiatives which \nare aimed at finding a political path to their \nfinal settlement.\nWe view with deep disappointment the sterility of \nthe many disarmament negotiations which have so \nfar taken place. The second special session on \ndisarmament was particularly disappointing. It \nreflected the trend away from a serious pursuit \nof disarmament. The arms race, far from being \ncurbed, has been given a new and powerful \nimpetus. The politics of force are threatening to \ndestroy the fragile fabric of detente as \npreparations for war continue without let. \nWeapons are being perfected and new and more \nsophisticated ones roll from the assembly lines. \nMilitary budgets are at a record high. Notions of \nlimited nuclear war and of so-called enhanced \nsecurity through nuclear superiority seem to be \nworking to undermine the basic climate of \nsearching for peace through disarmament which has \nall this time been the cornerstone of all the \nnegotiations. In sum, the spectre of a holocaust \nhaunts the world as the international situation \ncreates the possibility of an international \nconflagration.\nThe politics of power have dangerously made \ncountries prisoners of their own perceived sense \nof insecurity, which has in tum fuelled the race \nfor more armaments. A new and courageous approach \nis needed to get out of this vicious circle. In \nthat exercise, priority should be given to \nnuclear disarmament, for nuclear weapons pose the \nmost immediate threat to the very survival of \nmankind.\nThe Indian Ocean is close to our continent of \nAfrica, and the Assembly, more than 10 years ago, \nadopted the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a \nZone of Peace to rid that area of military \nrivalry. But events are going in the exact \nopposite direction. The Indian Ocean is being \nfurther militarized by rival Powers. Contrary to \nthe desire of the littoral and hinterland States \nfor peace and security in the area, new foreign \nmilitary bases are being established and nuclear \nwarships and other weaponry are being introduced \ninto the area. The ever-increasing foreign \nmilitary presence and the rivalry of the great \nPowers put the peace of the countries in the \nIndian Ocean region further in jeopardy. We have \nalso witnessed the regrettable obstruction by \ncertain Powers of the holding of the Conference \non the Indian Ocean. That situation calls for \naction. We therefore believe that, now more than \never, the Conference on the Indian Ocean is \nnecessary.\nTo an impoverished people, peace and security \nmeans more food, shelter and security from the \nscourge of economic underdevelopment. Because the \narms race fritters away so much of the scarce \nresources and manpower while the majority of the \npeople of the world live in abject poverty and \nmisery may delegation sees those two elements as \ninextricably linked: linked, on the one hand, by \nthe coexistence between lavish expenditure on \narmaments and the need for economic development; \nand, on the other hand, by the insecurity created \nby those armaments and that caused by economic \nhopelessness.\nIn considering this close interrelationship \nbetween disarmament and development, therefore, \nthe need to ensure that disarmament makes viable \ncontributions to the social and economic \ndevelopment of the developing countries, and \nparticularly to the establishment of the new \ninternational economic order, is an imperative \none.\nAll States Members of the United Nations do \nrecognize the gravity of the deepening world \neconomic crisis. Short-term measures adopted by \ncertain developed countries in attempts to \nstimulate global economic recovery have failed to \nbring about the desired results. The crucial need \nto adopt a more realistic approach in order to \neliminate the structural disequilibrium which \ncharacterizes the existing inequitable \ninternational economic system is becoming self- \nevident.\t.\nAlthough the impact of the deteriorating world \neconomic situation is increasingly being felt by \nthe developed countries, it is the developing \ncountries which continue to bear the brunt of \nthis crisis because of the vulnerability of their \npoor economies to the unfavorable external \nconditions. These conditions, which are \nthemselves structural in character, are made even \nworse by the unilateral adjustment measures \nadopted by some developed countries without due \nregard to their negative impact f*n the economies \nof the developing countries. Thus, for example, \nthe protectionist measures against the raw \nmaterials and manufactured goods exported by the \ndeveloping countries have led to a continued \ndeterioration in the terms of trade of the \ndeveloping countries. Many developing countries \nare having severe balance-of-payments problems. \nYet the international monetary and financial \ninstitutions created to deal with such problems \nhave proved insensitive to the development needs \nof the third world.\nInterdependence among nations can be of mutual \nbenefit to all countries only if we also \nrecognize imperative need to act collectively in \nour search for appropriate solutions to the \nglobal economic problems. But the international \ncommunity is not inking in its recognition of the \nneed for collective action on those problems. \nThrough numerous resolutions and declarations, \nthe Assembly has repeatedly appealed to all \nMembers of the Organization to engage in \nmeaningful negotiations with a view to \nimplementing the goals and objectives of the new \ninternational economic order. General Assembly \nresolution 34/138, on the launching of global \nnegotiations relating to international economic \nco-operation for development, still offers the \nbest framework for the comprehensive,coherent and \nintegrated treatment of the interrelated issues \nin the field of raw materials, energy, trade, \ndevelopment, money and finance.\nEven at the risk of appearing repetitive, it \nshould be stressed that what has been lacking is \nthe necessary political will, particularly on the \npart of certain developed countries, to translate \nthe desires of the international community into \nconcrete action. And it is disappointing to note \nthat some developed countries still insist on \ncertain conditions which continue to delay the \nlaunching of these much-desired global \nnegotiations. We wish, therefore, to express our \nsincere hope that all Member States represented \nhere will rededicate their efforts at this \ncurrent session to facilitating the launching of \nthe global negotiations without further delay. \nTowards this objective my delegation pledges its \nfull co-operation. We firmly believe that it is \nonly through dialogue and negotiation that \nnations can find commonly acceptable solutions to \ntheir common problems, for the benefit of all the \npeoples of the world.\nThere has been hardly any field in recent history \nwhere so many interests have been involved, where \nsuch interests have been so much at variance with \none another and where reconciliation has been so \ncomplex a pursuit as the law to govern the oceans \nand seas of the world. If, therefore, there is \none contemporary example of what the world \ncommunity of nations can achieve through \ncollective endeavors when such efforts are \ncoupled with political will and a determination \nto succeed, it is the just-concluded United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nNobody has been, or could be, fully satisfied \nwith it. It is, after all, the product of \ngive-and-take. Indeed, many of us believe that \nmore justice could have been done. That \nnotwithstanding, we are confident that the \nConvention constitutes an adequate basis for the \npromotion of justice in the use of the oceans and \na commendable step in the establishment of the \nnew international economic order. We join those \nwho have called for its signature and \nratification and therefore entry into force as \nsoon as possible. So historic an achievement is \ntoo momentous to waste, and the consequences of a \nfault would inevitably be too grave for all of us.\nIt is evident that none of the problems facing \nhumanity are completely beyond solution. The \nissue is not whether a solution is possible or \nnot. Rather, it is how much longer these problems \ncan wait to be solved\u2014whether time is still on \nour side. Some problems constitute merely a \nthreat to the well-being of man; some prolong \nsuffering: and others are leading us to \nself-destruction. Our choices are not very many. \nBut the decisions are ours, and the power to \nexercise our will is also ours. But time is not \nindefinitely on our side.\n"

        "file_text": "The multiplicity of the problems with which the United Nations has to \ncontend is clearly reflective of its universality. Yet in the 37 \nyears of its existence the Organization has shed light unto many. \nWithin this forum, great hopes have been realized, misery and despair \nhave been averted and a new generation of man has been moulded a \ngeneration that recognizes the value of diplomatic intercourse over \nthe perils and degradation of warfare. It would not be wrong, \ntherefore, to suggest that the current worsening international \nclimate, characterized by grave economic imbalances and world wide \npolitical turmoil, presents but simple trials which this world body \ncan readily contain. I trust that our unity of purpose, bold \ndetermination and serene statesmanship will help us through the heavy \nagenda ahead of us. In congratulating the President on his election \nto preside at this session, I should like also to assure him and the \nother officers of the Assembly of my delegation's firm support and co \noperation. We are convinced that, as a distinguished statesman of the \nHungarian People's Republic, he will be able to steer our \ndeliberations to a successful conclusion. Permit me to congratulate \nthe President of the thirty sixth session, Mr. Kittani, who \ndischarged his obligations honourably. Since this is the first \nregular session of the General Assembly at which we have the benefit \nof the services of the new Secretary General, I should like to \ncongratulate Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his elevation to the high office \nof guardian of international law and order and mentor to the world's \nleaders. To him we have entrusted for the next five years the future \nof the United stations. We are convinced that, as the son of a third \nworld country, he is better able than anybody else to articulate the \nconcerns and aspirations of the developing world. It is also fitting \nat this stage warmly to thank his predecessor, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who \nsteered the Organization through many a difficult time over the past \n10 years. The success of the United Nations during those 10 years is \nclearly demonstrated in the; increase in the membership of the \nOrganization, the marked decline in the suffering of the South East \nAsian refugees and the high priority accorded by the United Nations \nto various international problems. Regrettably, there have been \nsetbacks in the operation of the Organization, as evidenced in the \ncase of Namibia. One of the primary goals of the founding fathers of \nthe Organization is nearing achievement. I refer to the \ndecolonization agenda. While many countries have gained independence \nin the years since the founding of the United Nations, we are still \nwaiting for Namibia to accede to independence. Namibia is a test case \nwhich should give the United Nations the image of an international \narbiter. If it does not, the United Nations continues to be \ncharacterized by cynics everywhere as a connotation of uselessness \nand inaction. When the glorious day of independence finally arrived \nin Namibia, a sad chapter in the struggle of a people to rid itself \nof foreign domination will be closed. TM world has witnessed the \nworst defiance of international opinion as South Africa has employed \none subterfuge after another to delay the attainment of independence \nby the people of Namibia. We are heartened by the fact that progress \nhas been made on this issue in recent months, but we find it highly \ndisturbing that the withdrawal of South African troops from Namibia \nis being linked with the withdrawal of Cuban troops from the People's \nRepublic of Angola. No one can question the right of any sovereign \nState to determine its internal affairs, including its sovereign \nright to seek technical and military assistance from any friendly \ncountry. The presence of Cuban personnel in Angola is an extraneous \nissue which should not delay Namibia's independence. In any case, it \nhas always been our stand that South Africa will delay the \nindependence of Namibia until such time as it may get a Government \namenable to dictates. One of the ploys it is using to delay Namibia's \nindependence is setting conditions such as the present one. That \ncondition is unnecessary and uncalled for, and it negates the \nsovereignty of Angola.\nThe numerous obstacles which have been placed in the way of a \npeaceful settlement of the Namibian issue have delayed the solution \nof this problem. I have to express in the Assembly the genuine fear \nof my Government that if this issue is made so drag on indefinitely, \nit may bring about the very thing that everybody has been trying to \navoid for the last five years turning southern Africa into a constant \nhotbed of tension and a new arena of East West conflict. The \nPresident of the thirty sixth session of the Assembly, Mr. Kittani, \npresided over the second special session devoted to disarmament, in \nJune July this year. That second global attempt to give disarmament a \nspecial place in this grim catalogue of the ills that afflict mankind \nclearly reflects the threat of universal annihilation that is posed \nby the unprecedented arms build up. That is why we have to express \nopenly our disappointment that the session failed to produce any \nresults. The world political situation remains tense; old rivalries \nhave reemerged; the prospects of peace and tranquility have been \ndiminished and the probability of war has been enhanced. In this \ndecade of the 1980s we are facing a critical nation in which man's \nlust for peace is being replaced by a lust fbr war. The world order, \non both the political and the economic front, continues to manifest \nsigns of decline and impending collapse. This point is all the more \npoignant at this time when we are witnessing a resurgence of big \nPower rivalry and a dangerous tendency to assume that superior force \nis the final arbiter in international relations. This dangerous trend \nin the conduct of foreign policy must be arrested before it is too \nlate. Lesotho will continue to participate in all efforts aimed at \nbringing about a global consensus on the vital issues of \ninternational peace and security, disarmament and the new \ninternational economic order, on the basis of the principles of the \nCharter of the United Nations. Lesotho, as a member of the non \naligned movement, places a high premium on international respect for \nthe independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. We \nare therefore alarmed at the increasing readiness of States to use \nforce to safeguard their proclaimed interests or to assert \nterritorial claims, without any regard for the interests of other \nStates, especially the weak and defenseless ones. I cannot comment on \nthe current international political situation without touching on \nrecent events in Lebanon, especially the human tragedies that have \nunfolded in that war torn land. We witnessed earlier the brutal siege \nof west Beirut by Israeli forces. No sooner had the siege been lifted \nthan a succession of tragedies began to befall the people of Lebanon \nand the Palestinian refugees. The world learned with shock and dismay \nof the dastardly assassination of President elect Jashir Gemayel, \nonly to witness a few days later an even greater human tragedy and \nspectacle the massacre of Palestinian civilians in the refugee camps \nof Sabra and Shatila. Those unfortunate events have irrevocably \nplaced the Palestinian issue at the centre of Middle East politics \nand have once and fbr all crystallized its central position in all \npeace efforts. The question of Palestinian rights and Palestinian \nself determination cannot be treated merely as a political issue, the \nsolution of which is subject to Israel's security requirements. It is \nan issue which has brought untold suffering upon the Palestinian \npeople. They have suffered the degradation of displacement and the \nsqualor of refugee camps in foreign countries. Today they have \nsuffered a tragedy which invokes the deepest human emotions and \ndisturbs the conscience and moral values of mankind. The Palestinian \nissue has come to symbolize, in our time, the ills and deficiencies \nwhich plague international diplomacy. We have maintained all along \nthat the Palestinian issue is the crux of the Middle East problem. We \ndo not need further massacres of Palestinian refugees to be reminded \nthat the issue of Palestinian self  determination is the crucial item \non the agenda of peace in the Middle East. It is about time Israel \nlearned that its security lies not in the dispersal of the \nPalestinian people and in war but in peace. Lesotho does not condone \nthe breach of peace in the Middle East and southern Africa, nor does \nit countenance with complicity the presence of foreign troops in \nKampuchea and Afghanistan. We are fully aware of the complex \npolitical and military relationships in South East Asia and South \nWest Asia, and particularly the strategic interests of foreign Powers \nin those vital areas. In our humble view, the issue of peace in those \nareas does not depend solely on Viet Nam's willingness to withdraw \nits troops from Kampuchea and on Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan; \nit depends also on an overall recognition of the security \nrequirements of each and every State in those regions. Another focal \npoint of tension is the Korean peninsula. We renew our call for \nresumption of dialogue, without pre conditions or external \ninterference, between the two parts of Korea so as to bring about a \npeaceful reunification of that artificially divided land. I also wish \nto repeat the well known position of Lesotho on the question of the \nFalkland Islands. The Falk larders should be allowed to determine \ntheir own future in accordance with their inalienable right to self \ndetermination as stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations and \nGeneral Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). The history of the human race \nis replete with international efforts to accord man his rightful \nplace within the community of free nations. Over the past three \ndecades in particular, the international community has witnessed a \nsuccession of attempts to codify legal instruments aimed at the \npromotion and protection of the basic rights of man. Ironically, \nworld wide reports of flagrant and persistent violations of the \nsanctity of the human person continue to filter into the already \nheavy agenda of the United Nations. This is clearly reflective of \nman's reluctance to conform deeds to words. In this respect, we \napplaud once more the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights \nadopted at the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State \nand Government of the OAU. Significantly, the Charter draws attention \nto the distinctive nature of African values and morals, and also \nprovides fbr the respective duties and responsibilities of \nindividuals and groups to their communities. Lesotho is at present \nengaged in moves to incorporate the provisions of the African Charter \non Human and Peoples' Rights into our municipal law. History will be \nmade in Kingston, Jamaica, when the United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the. Sea is opened for signature in December. This will be the \nculmination of nine years of patient negotiations and a firm \ndetermination to accord land locked States access to the sear whose \nresources are the common heritage of all. It is to be hoped that once \nit comes into force good will will prevail upon the international \ncommunity to make the Convention a success. My Government is \nsatisfied that UNDP has played a very important role in the transfer \nof assistance from the developed to the developing countries, and its \nimportance in this role has all the more increased, as revealed by \nits latest reports. We also take cognizance of the interest UNDP \nshows in the least developed countries. We, therefore, wish to pledge \nour confidence in the manner in which the Administrator is handling \nthe affairs of UNDP, and we give him the assurance of our co \noperation. We are aware that his task during the current cycle will \nbe made more difficult by the fact that resource prospects for the \nperiod are gloomy and far from promising. However, we have reason to \nbelieve that the newly created Inter sessional Committee of the Whole \nwill soon come up with specific proposals for recovery in the short \nterm and for the longer term to secure predictability, continuity and \nassurance in the funding of the Programme. The developing countries \nrecognize that they are, in the first instance, responsible for their \nown economic and social development and that external aid should only \nbe supplementary. They accept that the economic challenges of the \nfuture demand a complete elimination of unhealthy competition among \nthem. At the same time, they are aware of their individual \nlimitations. It is for these reasons that the idea of economic co \noperation among developing countries is increasingly gaining ground. \nWe, therefore, entirely support the Lagos Plan of Action for the \nImplementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development \nof Africa, whose future projections are geared towards economic \nintegration of Africa by the year 2000. We recognize that ECA is \nengaged in consolidating sub regional plans and strategies towards \nthe noble goal of economic integration. We support the \nrecommendations of the Joint Inspection Unit on the reorganization of \nECA recognizing the role of multinational programming and operational \ncentres. We applaud the signature last year of the Preferential Trade \nArea Agreement for east and southern Africa in Lusaka, Zambia. The \nsignificance of the PTA is seen in particular in its scope, spanning \nas it does some 7.2 million square kilometres with a population of \nabout 140 million people. For our part, having overcome domestic \nlimitations imposed on us by our geography y Lesotho ratified the PTA \nAgreement in March 1982. We view the PTA as a right step towards the \nbasic restructuring of the economic base of our continent. As the \nExecutive Secretary of ECA, Mr. Adebayo Adedeji, said at the December \nmeeting to launch the PTA, we see our continent as a boat in which \nthere is less to eat, where poverty and degradation is the plight of \nthe average person, a boat which may sink before long unless all \nhands are on deck and a will to survive and eventually thrive \nmanifests itself. This will to survive has been adequately \narticulated within the PTA and the Southern African Development Co \nordination Conference. This will to survive is further lucidly \nelaborated in the Lagos Plan of Action, which maps out Africa's \neconomic strategy to the year 2000. We are, however, far from \nrealizing the fact that the search for a universally acceptable \nformula of self reliance through the process of global negotiations \nhas not yet been achieved. We are concerned about the continuing \nhesitation by some developed countries and we urge that an agreement \nbe reached to launch global negotiations not later than January 1983. \nWith respect to the special economic assistance programme for \nLesotho, I am proud to announce that the generous response of the \ninternational community to the request for special economic \nassistance for Lesotho has been most encouraging and has permitted \nthe implementation of a substantial portion of the programme. Some of \nthe projects have been fully funded and others have been financed in \npart as revealed in the report of the Secretary General. On behalf of \nthe Basotho nation, the Lesotho Government and myself, I wish \nsincerely to thank all donor countries and regional and \nintergovernmental organizations, as well as United Nations bodies and \nagencies for the assistance rendered under the special economic \nassistance programme for Lesotho. They can all be assured that good \nuse has been made and will continue to be made of their \ncontributions. We urge to be donor countries to continue to respond \nto the appeal made in the report just mentioned. The complexity of \nthe geo political situation, of which we are an integral part, hardly \npermits us the equanimity to consider Lesotho's political and socio \neconomic problems without reference to the conditions which prevail \nin South Africa. The Assembly will have noticed that stability in \nSouth Africa is becoming more illusory and that the prospects of \neventual racial accommodation are dimmer. At no time since the \ndoctrine of apartheid became a way of life in South Africa has the \nGovernment of that country faced as great an assault on their racial \npolicies as it does now. Within South Africa itself signs of \nconfrontation manifest themselves from all sectors of social life. \nPretoria faces opposition from students, church leaders and sections \nof the white population, and the Nationalist laager itself is in \nterrible disarray. In our strong and vociferous opposition to as \nrepeatedly stated in the past, we proceed from the moral position \nthat apartheid is dangerous, not only for South Africa itself but \nalso for its immediate neighbours and civilized humanity as a whole. \nWe seek not to preach to South Africa regarding the objectionable \ntenets of its domestic policies, but we respond to a moral demand \nwhich we can only ignore at our own peril. We have to call \ncontinuously on South Africa to abandon the disastrous path of \napartheid, which leads to the dead end of racial confrontation, a \nprospect too ghastly to contemplate. Lesotho will not watch silently \nwhile the stage is being set for a confrontation which would reduce \nsouthern Africa to ashes. For us the impending disaster with which \napartheid threatens southern Africa is as real and as terrifying as \nthe grim prospect of a nuclear holocaust hovering over mankind today. \nBecause of our geographical location within the borders of South \nAfrica, we cannot contemplate the prospect of violence and \ndestruction in that country with composure. Our primary \nresponsibility is to ensure the survival of our nation in peace and \ntranquility. Even when the writing is on the wall and clear fbr South \nAfrica to read, the authorities in Pretoria continue to tinker with \nthe problem. The recently proposed constitutional dispensation for \nColourgds and Indians is a political force. It is meant to appease \npublic opinion while it shows the seeds of conflict and tribal \npolarization. It is intended to put up a fa\u00e7ade of political change, \nto hoodwink world public opinion and to lessen pressure from abroad, \nthus creating a breathing space for the Apartheid policies, which \nhave apparently run their course and outlived their usefulness to the \nSouth African regime. This constitutional arrangement completely \nignores and circumvents the rights and legitimate aspirations of the \nblack South Africans that constitute the overwhelming majority of the \npeople of South Africa. It seeks to isolate the Coloureds and the \nIndians from the mainstream of the political struggle inside South \nAfrica by turning them into allies of apartheid without giving them \nany tangible benefits from such an unwholesome association. Finally I \nshould like to thank all those Member States that have stood by us \nduring our moments of great difficulty and all those that have \nhastened to assure us of their solidarity in times of great trial. \nThe OAU, in particular, through the Secretary  General, Mr. Kodjo, \nhas been a true custodian of the principles and purposes which guided \nthe founding fathers of the OAU. He has tirelessly kept the situation \nin Lesotho under constant surveillance, an act which has assured us \nthat our plight in southern Africa is a matter of grave concern to \nthe community of free nations. This awareness has given us courage to \nlook forward with determination to a future in which southern Africa \nwill be rid of all racial discrimination and segregation. Lesotho \noffers its firm pledge to contribute towards the evolution of a \nsouthern Africa of peace, prosperity, tranquility and respect fbr the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of all States in the region. We \ncall upon South Africa sincerely to offer a similar undertaking.\n"

        "file_text": "203.\tThe delegation of the newly independent \nCentral American and Caribbean nation of Belize \nhas listened with great interest to the various \nstatements made in the general debate during the \npast two weeks. We have heard Presidents and \nPrime Ministers, heads of governments and \nMinisters for Foreign Affairs from rich and \npowerful nations, poorer and less powerful \nStates, and even the poorest and least powerful \namong us, relate their perceptions of the state \nof the world today, their blueprints for a better \nworld, and even their anguish and agony at their \ninability to mandate the necessary changes. One \nperception is clear to our delegation: it is that \nwe are witnessing in the world today a crisis \nsituation of a political and economic nature \nalmost unparalleled in the history of the \nOrganization. But in the face of this bleak \nprognosis, the delegation of Belize shares the \noptimism of our distinguished Secretary-General \nthat \\\"we now have potentially better means to \nsolve many of the major problems facing humanity \nthan ever before\\\".\n204.\tIn recognition of this great potential of \nthe United Nations to be an instrument for the \npreservation of peace, stability and security in \nthese troubled times, one of the first acts of \nindependent statehood made by the Government of \nBelize on Independence Day, 21 September 1981, \nwas to apply for membership of the United Nations.\n205.\tThe delegation of Belize is pleased to be \nable to congratulate you, Sir, on your unanimous \nelection to the high office of President of the \nthirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. \nYou represent a country, Hungary, that has been \nsteadfast in its support of Belize's right to \nexist as an independent nation on its own \nterritory-for which Belizeans will always be \ngrateful. We also pay a tribute to Mr. Kittani of \nIraq for his mastery as President of the \nthirty-sixth session. He presided when Belize was \nfirst admitted to the Organization and we hold Mm \nin high esteem. The delegation of Belize also \ntaxes this opportunity to congratulate our \nbrother Latin American. Javier Perez de Cuellar, \non his appointment as Secretary-General. His \nclear-minded and level-headed approach to the \njob, as evidenced in his first report on the work \nof the Organization, encourages us to believe \nthat he will be able to prod the Organization on \nto achieve its lofty goals.\n206.\tWe in Belize share with the \nSecretary-General his profound concern for the \nneed to strengthen to the fullest the mechanisms \nof the United Nations for the maintenance of \npeace and security. Our path to freedom and \nindependence, with the co-operation and support \nof the United Nations, is an example of the value \nof concerted action by peace-loving nations, it \nis therefore of vital importance to Belize, and \nindeed to most countries, that the system of \ncollective security continue to be given \npractical and effective application.\n207.\tOur foreign policy is rooted in certain \ncardinal principles of international behaviour: \nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of \nStates; the inalienable right of peoples to \nself-determination; and the strict observance of \nthe non-use of force in the settlement of \ninternational disputes. Most of the conflicts, \ninjustices and tension that beset us today spring \nfrom flagrant and continuing disregard of these \nimportant rules.\n208.\tThe barbarity of Sabra and Shatila that \nfills the world with revulsion should not be the \nprice exacted from the Palestinian people for \ntheir legitimate right to live in their own State \nwithin secure boundaries. Our delegation puts on \nrecord Belize's condemnation and revulsion at the \ncold-blooded massacre of innocent civilians in \nLebanon. We record our support for the right of \nthe people of Palestine to determine their own \ndestiny and to establish their own homeland in \ntheir own State within defined and secure \nboundaries. We also support the right of Israel \nto exist a\u00a7 a State with its security guaranteed.\n209.\tThe constant attacks on the humanity of \nthe Mack peoples of southern Africa by Pretoria's \nracist regime and its continued occupation of \nNamibia and harassment of neighbouring African \nStates are affronts to civilized conscience. We \nrecord our condemnation of the apartheid policies \nof the racist regime of South Africa, and our \nsupport for the right of the black majority in \nsouthern Africa to determine the governance of \ntheir territory.\n210.\tThe senseless war between Iraq and the \nIslamic Republic of Iran, the Soviet occupation \nof Afghanistan, military conflict in the South \nAtlantic, turmoil and destabilization in Central \nAmerica and the Caribbean -the list goes on. All \nof those are possible because we ignore the norms \nof international behaviour to which we all pay \nlip service.\n211.\tWe support the implementation of the \nrelevant United Nations resolutions concerning \nAfghanistan with full respect for the \nindependence, sovereignty and non-aligned status \nof that country.\n212.\tBelize also endorses the position of the \nnon-aligned movement in respect of Western Sahara \nand appeals to the parties to initiate \nnegotiations in order to obtain a fair and \nlasting solution of the conflict in Western \nSahara in accordance with the principles of \nGeneral Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), the \ndecisions of the OAU and the principles of the \nnon-aligned movement.\n213.\tWe look forward to the solution of the \nproblem of the people of East Timor with due \nregard to the principle of self-determination.\n214.\tThe outbreak of hostilities earlier this \nyear in the South Atlantic between Argentina and \nthe United Kingdom was a cause of grave concern \nto Belize. Consistent with our principles, we \nunequivocally reject the use of force in \nattempting to settle this dispute. Belize calls \nfor a formal end to hostilities and for the \nnegotiation of a peaceful settlement in \naccordance with the relevant United Nations \nresolutions, and with the participation and good \noffices of the Secretary-General.\n213. War, and the consequences of war, must \nalways remind us that the use of force is never a \npermanent solution to a dispute.\n216. In our own region of Central America and the \nCaribbean, the struggle for peace and freedom and \nthe struggle for development are clearly linked. \nThe social unrest and tension in this part of the \nworld are, in many ways, products of a long \nhistory of exploitation and abuses of human \nrights, aggravated by external pressures and \ndisregard of the principles of non-intervention \nand non-interference.\n217 Although we in Belize have embarked on \npolicies and practices designed to prevent \nexploitation and abuse, we are not unaffected by \nthe problems of the, region. It is incumbent on \nus to strive resolutely for regional harmony \nbased on mutual respect, and for the elementary \ndemocratic right of a people to shape their own \ndestiny.\n218. In this context, Belize welcomes the \ninitiative of President Lopez Portillo of Mexico \nand President Herrera Campins of Venezuela to \nbring peace to the region by way of a political \nsolution. We also endorse the decision of the \nnon-aligned movement to convene an extraordinary \nministerial meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau \nin Managua, Nicaragua, from 10 to 14 January 1983.\n219.\tBecause Belize shares the view that \ndirect dialogue among democratic countries is an \nappropriate mechanism for reviewing the situation \nin their region, and seeking solutions to common \nproblems, the Mme Minister of Belize, Mr. George \nPrice, met in San Jose, Costa Rica, on 4 October \nwith representatives of Colombia, El Salvador, \nthe United States of America, Honduras, Jamaica, \nCosta Rica and the Dominican Republic.\n220.\tBelize subscribed to the final \ndeclaration of San Jose which stressed support \nfor the principles of representative, pluralistic \nand participatory democracy, and concern about \nthe serious deterioration of the present \ninternational economic order and international \nfinancial system.\n221.\tThe San Jose meeting declared its \nconviction that in order to promote regional \npeace and stability, it is necessary to support \ndomestic political understanding that will lead \nto the establishment of democratic, pluralistic \nand participatory systems. Such understanding \nwould lead to absolute respect for delimited and \ndemarcated borders in accordance with existing \ntreaties, compliance with which is the proper way \nto prevent border disputes and incidents, \nobserving, whenever applicable, traditional lines \nof jurisdiction.\n222.\tThe meeting in San Jose also declared \nrespect for the independence and territorial \nintegrity of States, rejection of threats or the \nuse of force to settle conflicts, a halt to the \narms race, and the elimination, on the basis of \nfull and effective reciprocity, of the external \nfactors which hamper the consolidation of a \nstable and lasting peace.\n223.\tBelize, for its part, continues to extend \nthe hand of friendship, and an attitude of good \nneighbourliness to the Republic of Guatemala. As \ntwo sovereign nations, which must inevitably live \ntogether with shared borders, we are optimistic \nthat, together, we can work out areas of \nco-operation for our mutual benefit. We stand \nready to take steps to resolve, peacefully, a \ncontroversy born in another century. Belize must, \nhowever, insist on respect for its independence, \nsovereignty, territorial integrity, and \nnon-aligned character.\n224.\tThe refusal, to date, of the Republic of \nGuatemala to recognize the reality of Belize \nwithin its long-established and traditional \nborders, is in open defiance of-and shows a \ncontemptuous disregard for-the overwhelming \nsupport we have received from States Members of \nthe United Nations. For the Republic of Guatemala \nto assert that they have \\\"legitimate rights over \nthe territory of Belize\\\" is to reveal a blatant \nexpansionist policy devoid of any legal, \nhistorical, or political merit.\n225.\tNo part of the territory that is Belize \nhas ever been possessed or occupied by Guatemala. \nBelize belongs to the Belizeans. The peace-loving \nand democratic people of Belize know this. Our \nother neighbours in Central America and the \nCaribbean affirm it. The world, through the \nUnited Nations, recognizes the sovereign, \nindependent nation of Belize.\n226.\tWe reiterate our commitment to find a \npeaceful resolution of differences with the \nRepublic of Guatemala for the mutual benefit of \nour two peoples. But the territorial integrity of \nBelize cannot be sacrificed as a \\\"quick fix\\\" \nsolution. Rather, we seek a permanent and lasting \npeace with all our neighbours-a peace based on \nmutual trust and respect, conducive to the \ncontinuing development of all our peoples.\n227.\tIn this same spirit Belize supports our \nsister Caribbean Latin American nation of Guyana \nin its efforts to preserve its territorial \nintegrity, and calls on the parties to seek a \npeaceful solution through an acceptable \ninternational forum.\n228.\tIf there has emerged one clear consensus \nin international thinking today, it is that the \nworld is plunging into economic disorder; that \nthe international financial system urgently \nrequires overhauling.\n229.\tMore and more men and women who want to \nwork cannot find jobs. Trade is slowing down to a \ntrickle. Commodity prices are falling rapidly \nexchange rates are unstable and the level of \ninvestments is very low. These conditions cause \nhavoc among the poorer nations. Added to this, \ncruel protective trade barriers deny us a market \nfor our products. The costs of servicing external \ndebts keep soaring, and speculation runs rampant \nand uncontrolled in the financial markets.\n230.\tIn the face of all this, is it any wonder \nthen that the economic struggle for poor \ncountries like Belize is one of sheer survival?\n231.\tThe richer, developed and industrialized \ncountries are not encouraging the development of \nthe exports of the developing countries, by their \nrefusal to pay just prices for our commodities, \nwhich in the long run would lead to a healthy \nexpansion of international trade for the benefit \nof all. Instead, they prefer to finance the \nimports of the third world with loans on \nexorbitant terms. We are now reaping the bitter \nharvest of this unenlightened policy.\n232.\tMany third world countries had a higher \nrate of growth, but it was artificial, because it \nresulted in an unprecedented increase in their \ndebt burdens. The inevitable consequences now \naffect us all. Even those countries which had the \ncourage to practice good husbandry and fiscal \nresponsibility are victims of this unjust \neconomic system, which has created the phenomenon \nof a liquidity crisis and a slow-down in \ninvestments. In a situation such as this, no one \ncan win; all will suffer. And because of our \nvulnerability, the small, poor, developing \ncountries suffer most. Common sense and simple \nequity demand a change. The cry for a new \ninternational economic order can only be stifled \nat the risk of total economic chaos.\n233.\tWe appeal to the industrialized world to \nimplement bold and effective initiatives to \nstrengthen the economic recovery efforts of our \ncountries. We recognize the co-operation of the \nUnited States Government in approving President \nReagan's Caribbean Basin Initiative, and hope \nthat the measure is a first step in a wider \neconomic co-operation effort. We also applaud the \neconomic co-operation and assistance efforts by \nthe Nassau Group of countries in this \nhemisphere-Canada, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela.\n234. Belize notes with great satisfaction that \nafter 14 years of difficult negotiation the \nUnited Nations has finally adopted the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This \nConvention, which has attracted almost universal \nsupport, is perhaps the single most important \nexample in recent times of the possibilities for \nco-operation in an enterprise designed for a \nbetter future. It gives us hope that we shall \nfind other formulas for co-operation in other \nspheres of human endeavour. And what better place \nto devise such formulas than the United Nations?\n233. The delegation of Belize feels that the \nCharter of the United Nations holds the key to \nthe mechanisms to create a better world. The will \nto use the machinery of the Charter must be \nconsciously strengthened. For this reason, we \nsupport the recommendation of the \nSecretary-General that a meeting of the Security \nCouncil be held at the highest level \\\"to make a \nserious effort to reinforce the protective and \npre-emptive ring of collective security which \nshould be our common shelter and the most \nimportant task of the United Nations\\\". Indeed, \nthe United Nations remains the last best hope for \nmankind.\n"

We \nwish him every success in the exercise of his lofty responsibilities. \nMay I also reaffirm to Mr. Kittani, our deep appreciation for the \ndignified and clear-sighted manner in which he acquitted himself of \nhis mandate during the thirty-sixth session of the Assembly. May I \nfurther reiterate to the Secretary-General our most sincere \nappreciation for his tireless efforts in seeking the most appropriate \nsolutions to the grave problems which the international community \nfaces.\n184.\tThe thirty-seventh session is being held at a very critical \ntime, since the international situation has deteriorated seriously to \nthe point of gravely threatening the survival of a certain number of \npeoples.\n\n185.\tEvery year we all come to participate in the annual session \nof the general Assembly; a torrent of speeches is heard, support for \nthe noble principles of freedom, peace, justice, democracy, \nsolidarity, development and co-operation is reaffirmed by every one \nof us, but, unfortunately, the application of these ideas stops for \nsome among us as soon as we leave the United Nations Headquarters.\n\n186.\tRepeatedly, and from this very rostrum, we have expressed our \nprofound concern because of the progressive deterioration in the \ninternational situation and because of its disastrous consequences \nfor all of mankind. We cannot, nor should we conceal our great \nanguish at seeing the impotence, the resignation or the abdication of \nthe competent international bodies when faced with the proliferation \nof hotbeds of tension, which are deliberately and dangerously kindled \nby imperialist Powers, and in particular by the present United States \nAdministration.\n\n187.\tNo one here should ignore the causes and agents which are \nresponsible for so sombre a picture. We wonder how long peoples and \nGovernments which love peace and justice will have to wait for the \nadequate existing United Nations organs firmly to shoulder their \nresponsibilities and take really effective measures -which are \navailable to them-with respect to the Governments of certain Western \nPowers, in order to put an end to: the flagrant violations of the \nfundamental principles of the Charter; continuance of colonial wars, \nand the promoting of aggressions of every kind, directly or \nindirectly against States which adopt independent and progressive \npositions; the economic plundering of underdeveloped countries and \nthe persistent prevention of a gradual reduction in the ever-widening \ngap between the rich developed countries, and the poor underdeveloped \ncountries; the imposition of military bases in every comer of the \nworld, generally maintained against the will of the peoples; the \ninsistence on hampering the serious efforts made by the socialist \ncountries and progressive and democratic forces to achieve detente, \ngeneral  and complete disarmament, the global prohibition of the \nmanufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction, in particular \nnuclear, biological and chemical weapons, including the neutron bomb; \nthe accelerated rise of military budgets and expenditures stimulated \nby an escalation in the arms race, so that these astronomical amounts \nof money might be judiciously devoted to the economic and social \ndevelopment of the underdeveloped countries; and the systematic \nmanoeuvres designed to counter the establishment of a new \ninternational economic order, as advocated by the movement of \nnon-aligned countries.\n\n188.\tFaced with this alarming situation, which obviously endangers \nthe future of peoples, and faced with the growing tragedy endured by \nmillions of human beings, who are still deprived of their freedom and \nthe right to choose their own destiny, lacking in the ways and means \nto fight against servitude, humiliation, tyranny, wretchedness, \nfamine, ignorance and disease, we feel compelled to repeat, who bears \nthe grave responsibility, in the first place, for such a \ndeterioration in the international situation? As we see it, it is the \npresent United States Administration, and certain of its allies and \nagents, or preferred instruments which, bear this responsibility: the \nracist and Fascist regimes of Pretoria and Tel Aviv.\n\n189.\tWe see it this way because of the firm conviction of the \nGovernment of the People's Republic of Angola that no country that \nwas socialist, progressive or loved peace and justice has taken or \nwill take initiatives to promote hotbeds of tension, to unleash a \nnuclear war or use other weapons of mass destruction, because the \nsurvival of mankind, international peace and security, the \nindependence of peoples and peaceful coexistence are for them a \nprimary principle and objective.\n\n190.\tWorld problems which seriously affect peace, security, \ndevelopment, freedom and independence require considerable efforts \nfrom the international community as a whole and a global response \nthat has due regard forth fact that each people has the right freely \nto choose its own political, economic, social and cultural system, \nwithout intimidation or pressures; that it is the right of every \npeople to be in charge of its own national riches and to exploit them \nfor its own benefit; that it is the right of every people to reject \nany form of subordination to and dependence on any source, and any \ninterference or pressure, political, economic or military.\n\n191.\tThere is no denying that in the present situation detente, \ngeneral and complete disarmament, the nuclear threat and the arms \nrace are the major concerns of countries that love peace and justice. \nIn this respect, may we recall that the position of Angola has been \nclearly defined once again during the second special session of the \nGeneral Assembly devoted to disarmament, so we need not repeat it \nhere.\n\n192.\tSince the People's Republic of Angola is a geopolitical \ncomponent of the African continent, it is legitimate for the \nGovernment of Angola to give primary attention to African problems, \nin particular to those of southern Africa, in view of the grave \nimplications for the region and for the world.\n\n193.\tFor some 20 years many relevant resolutions have been adopted \nby the United Nations, the OAU and the non-aligned movement, \nrecognizing, on the one hand, the right of the Namibian people to \nself-determination and independence and, on the other hand, \ndenouncing or firmly condemning the illegal occupation of Namibia by \nthe criminal South African regime.\n\n194.\tDirectly confronted with threats, aggression and armed \ninvasion by the racist and terrorist Pretoria regime since 1975, the \nPeople's Republic of Angola expects from the international community \na decisive commitment in line with the requirements of our time,, so \nthat the problem of Namibia may be finally settled and so that the \npeople of Angola may, for its part, be able to expel the racist \ninvaders, to respond to future aggression and to ensure the defence \nof its national Sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n195.\tWhat is the situation today? As we nil know, the contact \ngroup submitted to SWAPO, the frontline States and to Nigeria in \nOctober 1981 a plan of action that includes three phases; first, the \nadoption\n\nby the end of January of 1982 of the so-called constitutional \nprinciples by the concerned and interested parties, principles which \nare to be included in the future, constitution, of Namibia; secondly, \napproval by the end of March by the Security Council of the \ncomposition and size of the United Nations troop contingent, and \nresolution of the question of the United. Nations  impartiality \nraised by the Pretoria regime; thirdly, implementation, starting in \nApril, of the United Nations plan in accordance with Security Council \nresolution 435 (1978), containing four fundamental aspects: a \ncease-fire; the gradual reduction of South African troops to 1,500 \nmen; stationing of United Nations troops in Namibia; and free and \nfair elections.\n\n196.\tSince the first meetings with the contact group -and quite \noutside its framework and mission-the United States delegation has \nasked for bilateral contacts with the Angolan authorities and has \nbegun to try to link the presence of the Cuban internationalist \nforces in the People's Republic of Angola to the negotiating process \nfor the independence of Namibia. This has always been firmly rejected \nby the Government of Angola, in view of the absurdity of such a \nlinkage which, in fact, ill conceals the obsession or paranoia of the \nUnited States Administration about the stationing of the Cuban \ninternationalist forces in the People's Republic of Angola.\n\n197.\tIn view of the deadlock in the negotiations on the first \nphase, because of the electoral system proposed by the contact group, \nand since the presence of Cuban forces in the People's Republic of \nAngola has become the subject of a slanderous and hostile campaign by \nthe United States Administration which is shamelessly seeking at all \ncosts to link that presence to the process of the independence of \nNamibia-directly, or through the racist South African regime, which \nhas become its sounding board-as an additional means of preventing \nthe implementation of the resolutions which the United Nations has \nalready adopted, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the People's \nRepublic of Angola and of the Republic of Cuba, on behalf of their \nrespective Governments, prepared and signed a joint declaration on 4 \nFebruary 1982, with which all the Members of this international body \nare fully familiar.\n\n198.\tIt is therefore fitting to recall that, at the end of the \nmonth of August 1981, at a lunch offered to the foreign press \naccredited in South Africa, and at the very moment when a large-scale \naggression was being perpetrated against the People's Republic of \nAngola, the South African Prime Minister declared that the Cubans \nrepresent no threat to South Africa and that South Africa does not \nregard the withdrawal of the Cubans from Angola as a prior condition \nto the peaceful solution of the Namibian question.\n\n199.\tNevertheless, it is surprising but significant that a certain \nnumber of those who express their concern about the presence of the \nCuban internationalist forces in the People's Republic of Angola show \nno such concern in respect of the illegal occupation for more than a \nyear of a part of the territory of Angola by the racist and Fascist \nSouth African troops. What moral can be drawn from that?\n200.\tAnd yet, in the course of these last nine months, the South \nAfrican army has carried out 580 reconnaissance flights, 18 air \nbombardments, 96 landings of troops from helicopters and several \nsabotage and reprisal actions against the civilian population. The \nAngolan armed forces have suffered 31 dead, 65 wounded and 38 \nmissing, while the enemy forces have suffered 39 dead. Seven South \nAfrican aircraft and three helicopters have been shot down.\n\n201.\tThus we believe that the following positions of principle \nmust be borne in mind.\n\n202.\tFirst, the joint Angolan-Cuban declaration states solemnly \nand unambiguously that the intention is gradually to withdraw the \nCuban internationalist forces stationed on Angolan territory.\n\n203.\tSecondly, on 23 April 1976, a month after expelling the South \nAfrican troops, the Angolan and Cuban Governments agreed on a \nprogramme progressively to reduce those forces and, in less than a \nyear, the Cuban military contingent was reduced by more than one \nthird. Towards the middle of 1979 the two Governments once again \ndecided to implement another programme for the gradual reduction of \nthe Cuban forces. Nevertheless, those two programmes had to be \nsuspended at a certain point because of the growing number and scope \nof South African armed aggression against the provinces of Cunene and \nHuila. It should be emphasized that the Angolan and Cuban Governments \nspontaneously took the initiative to implement those programmes. Ho \nGovernment -including that of the United States of America- and no \ninternational organization dared to propose or demand that we do so. \nHow is one then to understand the sickly insistence of the United \nStates Administration on this subject and its inability to realize \nthat such an attitude is a gross and inadmissible interference in the \ninternal affairs of an independent and sovereign country?\n\n204.\tThirdly, in that same joint declaration we stated that when \nthe Governments of Angola and Cuba so decide, the withdrawal of Cuban \nforces stationed on Angolan territory will be carried out by a \nsovereign decision of the Government of the People's Republic of \nAngola when there is no further possibility of aggression or armed \ninvasion and, in that connection, the Government of Cuba reiterated \nthat it will unreservedly respect any decision taken by the sovereign \nGovernment of the People's Republic of Angola concerning the \nwithdrawal of those forces. Once again we solemnly reaffirm before \nthe Assembly what our intentions are.\n\n205.\tFurthermore, in the course of these last three months, \nAmerican representatives in the contact group have been making a very \nspecial effort to spread optimism about the results already achieved \nin the negotiations that have been going on in New York since the \nmonth of June. In fact that is a false and ill-intentioned optimism. \nIt is false, because the electoral system has not yet been defined, \nthe  final composition of the United Nations forces has not yet been \ndecided, and the cease-fire between SWAPO and the Pretoria regime, \nwhich will constitute the essential point of departure for the \nimplementation of the United Nations plan, in accordance with \nSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978), seem to us to be far from \nbeing anticipated\n\nor applied. It is ill-intentioned in that the American Administration \nhas started a manoeuvre to attribute to the People's Republic of \nAngola responsibility for the delay of, or even for preventing, a \nswift and adequate solution of the process of independence for \nNamibia owing to the position of the Government of Angola regarding \nlinkage and the withdrawal of the Cuban internationalist forces. In \npoint of fact, this manoeuvre constitutes an escape hatch for those \nwho are or will be the ones really responsible for such a situation.\n\n206.\tThus, since the position of the Government of Angola is a \nlegitimate one the heads of State and Government of the front-line \nStates meeting at Lusaka on 4 September 1982:\n\n  ... noted with indignation that a new element has been introduced by \nthe United States of America in seeking to link the negotiations for \nthe independence of Namibia to the withdrawal of Cuban forces from \nAngora. In this respect, the Summit emphasized without any ambiguity \nthe importance of separating the decolonization process of Namibia \nfrom the stationing of Cuban forces in Angola. The insistence on \nmaintaining this linkage is contrary to the spirit and the letter of \n[Security Council] resolution 435 (1978) and can only hamper the \nnegotiating process. Furthermore, this insistence constitutes \ninterference in Angola's internal affairs. In this context, they \nexpressed their complete support for the Angolan position on the \nquestion, which is clearly defined in the joint declaration of the \nGovernments of the People's Republic of Angola and of the Republic of \nCuba, of 4 February 1982. Accordingly, they rejected any attempt to \nmake the People's Republic of Angola responsible for any delay in the \nprompt conclusion of the negotiations on the independence of Namibia. \nThey strongly condemned the aggression and invasion of Angola by \nSouth African forces and demanded that the Pretoria regime cease all \nacts of aggression and withdraw its troops from Angola.\n\n207.\tA similar position was taken during the Third Conference of \nHeads of State of the People's Republic of Angola, the Republic of \nCape Verde, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, the People's Republic of \nMozambique and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, \nwhich was held in the capital of Cape Verde on 21 and 22 September \n1982.\n\n208.\tMay I be allowed to remind the Assembly of the enormous \nsacrifices which the heroic people of Angola has already made and the \nextremely high price it is paying in thousands of lost human lives \nand material damage amounting to more than $7.5 billion.\n\n209.\tI should like once again to remind the Assembly of the \nproposal made at the thirty-first session by the Angolan Government \nfor consideration by the general  Assembly, that an international \nfund for the national reconstruction of Angola be established, \namounting to approximately $300 million. It is sad to note that so \njust a proposal has not received the least attention from this world \nbody, despite the fact that in its resolution 475 (1980) the Security \nCouncil requested  Member States urgently to extend all necessary \nassistance to the People's\nRepublic of Angola and the other front-line States,  and called for \n'the payment by South Africa of full and adequate compensation to the \nPeople's Republic of Angola for the damage to life ard property \nresulting from these acts of aggression.  May we renew our hopes that \nthis bitter cry will be heard?\n\n210. Everyone knows that in South Africa the internal situation is \nprogressively deteriorating as the conflicts within the hideous \nregime and the ruling party grow worse, and the valiant fighters of \nthe African National Congress [ANC] steadfastly and heroically carry \nout political and military; their efforts are recognized even by the \nPretoria regime, and this has led to an escalation of threats and \naggression, as well as an increasing use of mercenary forces and \nbandit groups-trained, financed, organized and commanded by South \nAfrica-against the People's Republic of Mozambique. It has also led \nto acts of aggression perpetrated against the Republics of Zimbabwe \nand Zambia 2nd the Kingdom of Lesotho. All States Members of the \nUnited Nations should firmly condemn these actions and should stand \nin active solidarity with the ANC and the front-line States.\n\n21L With regard to Western Sahara, we reiterate our unflinching \nsolidarity with the heroic Sahraoui people, which, under the \nleadership of its sole authentic representative, the POLISARIO Front, \nis victoriously pursuing its armed struggle against Moroccan \noccupation to recover full independence and territorial integrity. We \nwelcome the admission of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic to the \nOAU, and we reiterate our conviction that there trust be direct \nnegotiations between the two conflicting parties in the search for a \npolitical solution.\n\n212.\tWith regard to the temporary difficulties now being \nexperienced by the OAU, we consider that any problems that might \naffect us should be discussed by us alone, within our continental \norganization, and without any interference from outside Africa, as \nhas been noted. The fact that the thirty-eighth ordinary session of \nthe Council of Ministers of the OAU, held at Addis Ababa in February \n1982, and the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State \nand Government of the OAU, at Tripoli, held in August 1982, were \nobstructed is a part of the strategy of American imperialism and some \nof its allies aimed at subjugating or paralysing international bodies \nwhich play an active role in the struggle for the political and \neconomic independence of peoples. We are absolutely convinced that \nthis momentary crisis will soon be overcome.\n\n213.\tWe are deeply moved by the bloody events in Lebanon. The \nbrutal armed invasion carried out by the racist and fascist Tel Aviv \nregime, with the full and shameful connivance of the United States \nAdministration and the inadmissible passivity of certain Arab States; \nthe genocide of Palestinians and Lebanese in west Beirut; and the \nmassacre, the carnage, at Sabra and Shatila: these can never be \nforgotten, and call for our strongest condemnation and an appropriate \nresponse in due course.\n\n214.\tWe are firmly convinced that the Palestinian people and its \nsole legitimate representative, the PLO, will resume the fight after \nhaving, by their heroic resistance during the fierce battles of those \n73 historic days, won the respect andadmiration of all those who \nstand with the peoples struggling for their independence. We reaffirm \nour unswerving solidarity with the Palestinian people and the PLO as \nthey carry on their struggle to recover their usurped homeland and to \nestablish an independent State there.\n\n215.\tAfter seven years of Indonesian military occupation, the \npeople of East Timor, under the leadership of its vanguard \norganization and legitimate representative, the Frente Revolucionaria \nde Timor Leste Independente, continues its heroic resistance, in \nspite of the lack of solidarity on the part of some countries of the \nnon-aligned movement. Those countries should identify themselves with \nthe struggle of the people of East Timor, out of respect for the \nfundamental principles of non-alignment.\n\n216.\tThe inability of the Indonesian army to stamp out the armed \nliberation struggle of the people of East Timor clearly shows that \npeople's rejection of integrate into or annexation by Indonesia of \nits homeland. The 35,000 Indonesian soldiers present there, recourse \nto helicopter-borne forces to try to destroy the fighting forces of \nFRETILIN, which control 70 per cent of the national territory, the \nterror and famine imposed on the people of East Timor -will all fail \nto thwart the nationalist feelings of that people or its resolve to \nfight. Yet more than 200,000 persons have been massacred by the \ntroops of a self-styled non-aligned country which never fought \nagainst the former administering Power, Portugal, during the colonial \nperiod.\n\n217.\tThe Indonesian troops, and thus the Indonesian Government, \nare today carrying out an appalling genocide, through physical \nliquidation, cultural repression, deportation, and repopulation with \nthousands of Javanese citizens. But there are the beginnings of \nresistance in the Indonesian army against participating in operations \naimed at eliminating the patriots of East Timor. This is proved by \nthe recent refusal to act of two battalions, which are today isolated \non one of the islands of the country.\n\n218.\tIt only needed Portugal to shirk its responsibilities towards \nthe people of East Timor by not proceeding to the transfer of power \nto the FRETILIN leaders for Indonesia to invade and militarily occupy \npart of East Timor and the outskirts of the capital, where its \nmilitary contingents had established themselves.\n\n219.\tEver since the thirtieth session of the general Assembly the \nOrganization has been expressing deep concern over the situation \nobtaining in East Timor as a result of the intervention of Indonesian \narmed forces and has been requesting the Indonesian Government to \nwithdraw without delay its forces from the Territory in order to \nenable the people of East Timor freely to exercise their right to \nself-determination and independence, as provided in general Assembly \nresolution 3485 (XXX). Security Council resolutions 384 (1975) and \n389 (1976) once again call on the Indonesian Government to withdraw \nits forces from the Territory forthwith. Resolution 36/50, adopted at \nthe thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly, reaffirms the same \nprinciples and makes the same requests. The Indonesian Government, \nhowever, shows no sign of willingness to respect United Nations \ndecisions. It is therefore imperative that States Members of the \nUnited Nations, in particular those which are members of the \nnon-aligned movement, do not endorse the brutal annexation of East \nTimor to Indonesia, a country which does not even respect our \nresolutions.\n\n220.\tBearing in mind that the Government of Portugal seems to wish \nto resume its responsibilities as the former administering Power in \norder to bring the tragedy of the people of East Timor to the \nattention of the international community, we wish to express \nencouragement for the request of the Government of Portugal aimed at \nsatisfying the legitimate aspirations of the people of the Democratic \nRepublic of East Timor.\n\n221.\tWith regard to developments in the situation in the \nDemocratic Republic of Afghanistan, in the People's Republic of \nKampuchea, in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and in the \nRepublic of Cyprus, we reaffirm our active solidarity with those \npeoples in their respective causes and our support for the positions \nof their Governments in the quest for just and appropriate solutions.\n\n222.\tWith regard to Latin America, we reaffirm our militant \nsolidarity with the Salvadorian people and with its legitimate \nrepresentatives, the Revolutionary Democratic Front and the Farabundo \nMarti National Liberation Front in their just struggles against the \npresent regime in El Salvador, and we heartily welcome the victories \nthey have already won.\n\n223.\tWe wish to reaffirm our solidarity with the Cuban people in \ntheir revolution. We support their efforts to overcome the \nconsequences of the criminal economic boycott imposed by American \nimperialism, in flagrant violation of human rights, and we denounce \nthe aggression and the threats against the Cuban people. We welcome \nalso the revolutionary process of the peoples of Nicaragua and \nGrenada and their determination to face the serious threats that hang \nover them. We also reaffirm our active solidarity with the Puerto \nRican people and denounce the imperialist manoeuvres which, by means \nof despicable political and economic pressures, have prevented the \ninclusion of the question of Puerto Rico in the agenda.\n\n224.\tNo one is unaware of the fact that the Security Council and \nGeneral Assembly as well as the OAU have already adopted several \nresolutions on mercenarism, condemning the activities of mercenaries, \ntheir recruitment and their use for the purpose of destabilizing \nactions in underdeveloped countries, particularly on the African \ncontinent. While it is true that a Convention for the Elimination of \nMercenarism in Africa has already been adopted by the OAU-and the \nPeople's Republic of Angola, which has suffered and continues to \nsuffer the misdeeds of mercenaries, is proud of the important \ncontribution it made to that Convention-it is imperative, none the \nless, for the General Assembly to adopt as soon as possible an \ninternational convention prohibiting the recruitment, use, financing \nand training of mercenaries and the provision of transit facilities \nto them. Indeed, we hope that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of \nan International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing \nand Training of Mercenaries, established under general  Assembly \nresolution 35/48, will fulfil its mandate and that such a convention \nwith finally be adopted.\n\n225.\tNext month the Angolan people will celebrate the seventh \nanniversary of the proclamation of the People's Republic of Angola, \nunder the dynamic and visionary leadership of Comrade Jose Eduardo \ndos Santos, President of the MPLA-Labour Party and President of the \nRepublic. Important results have already been achieved in \nconsolidating the Angolan revolutionary process, in setting up the \nstructures of the party, in strengthening national unity and defence \nand in laying the foundations for a socialist society in the People's \nRepublic of Angola.\n\n226.\tUnfortunately, however, the Angolan Government has had to \ndevote most of its human and material resources to the defence of its \nnational sovereignty and territorial integrity, because of the \ncontinuous acts of aggression by the racist and Fascist regime of \nPretoria. This has seriously affected the economic and social \ndevelopment we had planned, but if we are to attain that paramount \ngoal the undeclared war against us must be brought to an end. We need \npeace, and we dare to hope that that peace so fervently desired by \nthe Angolan people will be attained in the coming year.\n\n227.\tThe struggle continues. Victory is certain.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, first of all, Sir, to convey to you, on behalf of the \nItalian Government and on my own behalf, most sincere congratulations \non your election as President of the thirty- seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly. We are pleased that this honour has been conferred \non the representative of a nation with such great traditions. Your \nvast experience of the workings of the United Nations is a guarantee \nof the successful performance of the delicate task entrusted to you.\n102.\tI should also like to express our sincere gratitude to your \npredecessor, Mr. Kittani, who fulfilled the mandate entrusted to him \nby the General Assembly last year at a particularly challenging time \nfor the Organization with great dedication and skill.\nThe deep appreciation of the Italian Government, and my own \nappreciation, also goes to the new Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de \nCuellar, who, in nine months since he took office, has so completely \nfulfilled the hopes placed in him. A worthy representative of the \nillustrious Latin American legal tradition, and particularly the \nPeruvian school of international law, he has tackled the difficulties \nwhich the Organization has had to overcome in this period of his term \nof office with wisdom, equanimity and, above all, a keen sense of \njustice. In his search for the road to peace, in his indefatigable \nchampioning of negotiated solutions and in his firm defence of the \nprinciples of the Charter, the Secretary-General has had and will \ncontinue to have the full support of the Italian Government.\n103.\tThe international situation during the past year has been \ngrowing steadily worse: hotbeds of tension, sometimes turning into \nviolent struggles and wars -with immense losses of human life and \nacute suffering-have, in fact, constituted threats to the peace and \nsecurity of the world.\n104.\tThe United Nations is all too often faced with serious \nrestraints. Even in its most committed actions, it seems unable to \nfulfil the expectation that it should not only be the forum of major \ninternational debates but also the institution capable of acting \neffectively to prevent or to extinguish conflicts. This must not \ndiscourage us. It is the specific duty of us all-in taking note of \nthis disquieting reality-to analyse in depth, with proper realism, \nthe causes of these limitations, and to give careful but dynamic \nconsideration to the most effective means of enhancing the role of \nthe Organization which, in an international situation characterized \nby an increase in hotbeds of war, is finding it hard to promote a \nmore equitable international order and is often powerless to prevent \nviolations of the peoples' sovereignty, of freedoms and of human \nrights.\n105.\tIn suggesting this I am fully mindful of the recent detailed \nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization. The \nideas underlying this report naturally elicit a deeply felt and \npositive response from my country.\n106.\tIn fact, we share, on the whole, the perceptive evaluations \nhe has made of the causes most frequently responsible for the limited \neffectiveness of United Nations action. In particular the slow \nrecourse of Member States to the mechanisms provided for in the \nCharter and the failure to adapt national policies to the specific \nprovisions of the resolutions adopted, especially those adopted \nunanimously, are in our opinion most often and most directly \nresponsible for the failure of United Nations action.\n107.\tEven though it was signed 37 years ago, the Charter still \nprovides means for prompt and effective action in order both to \nprevent international crises from arising-before situations have \ncrystallized, sometimes irreversibly-and to ensure the rapid return \nto a state of normalcy in the areas concerned.\n108.\tIt is therefore not outside but fully within the Charter that \nthe study I just mentioned would seek ways of restoring active \nvitality and decisive effectiveness to the Organization. Such a \nconscientious analysis could, in our opinion, give rise to a more \nbinding system of collective security, the most solid foundations of \nwhich would be constituted by greater understanding among Member \nStates in general and, in particular, those with seats on the \nSecurity Council.\n109.\tIn fact, only the United Nations, constituted and \nconsolidated around an ethical and normative system of peaceful and \ncivilized international coexistence, can point out the difficult but \nnecessary course, not based on the mere reality of the balance of \nforces but guaranteed by the rule of law and by considerations of \njustice. It is to this goal that our common efforts must be directed, \nbenefiting from the growing maturity of conscience evident on all \nsides, and not forgetting that the initial and the most concrete \nmeans of expressing our will for peace is constituted by a balanced \nreduction of nuclear and conventional armaments.\n110.\tItaly is convinced that the way to peace is to be found \nprimarily through development. Hence the need to allow each country \nto pursue the development course best suited to its own requirements, \nwhile respecting its own traditions, and to participate adequately in \nthe global world process of production and distribution of goods.\n111.\tThe recent Toronto meetings marked a positive stage within \nthe framework of the North-South dialogue. My country, together with \nother members of the European Community, has made a concrete effort \nto solve the problem of financing the sixth replenishment of the \nInternational Development Association (IDA) and thus to guarantee \nadequate aid flows. The understanding concerning the start of \nnegotiations for the further financing of the seventh replenishment \nof IDA also constitutes a major advance. The problem of the Eight \nGeneral Review of the International Monetary Fund [IMF] Quotas, even \nif not finally resolved at Toronto, now appears in a more favourable \nlight as a result of the agreements reached there on the \nconsideration of increased quotas, which we favour.\n112.\tBut solution of these and other problems regarding relations \nbetween industrialized and emerging countries requires a more \nrational and adequate negotiating framework. That is why we remain \nconvinced of the urgent need to initiate the global negotiating \nprocess. The important developments of the last few months, as \nreflected in the submission of the draft resolution by the developing \ncountries and in the results of the June Versailles Economic Summit, \nshould induce us to take the present opportunity to reach an \nagreement. More important than the excessive refinement of the text \nof a resolution is the setting in motion of a negotiating mechanism \nand to begin, together, the global study of North-South relations \nwith a view to their improvement and development.\n113.\tOn the basis of these assumptions, as well as for other \nidealistic and humanitarian reasons, my country has decided to make a \nparticular effort in appropriating, for the three-year period \n1981-1983, some $4 billion for development co-operation, \nnotwithstanding the considerable economic difficulties which we, too, \nare facing.\nIn this context ample priority will be given by Italy to assistance \nto the less developed countries, particularly in the agro-industrial \nsector. In April of this year a high-level technical meeting was held \nin Rome, in preparation for a subsequent meeting at the political \nlevel, to discuss in depth the problems of hunger m the world. That \nmeeting showed that there was broad agreement on the most suitable \nand effective, as well as the most modem, means of action to combat \nthat scourge. The purpose of this initiative launched by Italy at the \nOttawa Economic Summit meeting of industrialized countries in July \n1981 was to promote a set of joint initiatives while broader \ndiscussions would develop in the framework of global negotiations.\n118.\tI would also recall that my country has reached agreement \nwith UNICEF and WHO on a five-year programme, 1982 to 1986, involving \n$100 million that will help to reduce infant mortality in 15 \ndeveloping countries.\n119.\tI should also like to mention the outline agreement signed in \nWashington with the World Bank, whereby the Italian Government will \nmake available to that institution-inaddition to the regular \ncontributions already made by Italy-a sum of approximately $400 \nmillion in assistance loans and grants over a three-year period.\n120.\tThe last specific action, in chronological order, by Italy is \nthe initiative, in collaboration with FAO, to alleviate the food \nproblem in eight countries of the Sahel. Altogether this programme \nwill cost $500 million, to be provided entirely by my country, over a \nperiod of five to seven years.\n121.\tWith these initiatives Italy intends to carry out, in the \nimmediate future, an even more organic policy of co-operation, in \ncollaboration with United Nations agencies and programmes, based on a \nrealistic and effective strategy for action that will directly and \nfully involve the developing countries themselves as partners. \nSouth-South relations, in which we see the prospect of concrete and \nsubstantial developments in the years to come, should also be \nencouraged.\n\n122.\tItaly will continue to provide financial support for the \ngrowth of the developing countries with a view to attaining even \nbefore the end of the decade the goal of assigning 0.7 per cent of \nthe gross national product to development, in accordance with the \nInternational Development Strategy for the Third United Nations \nDevelopment Decade.\n\n123.\tThe creation of a better international order presupposes the \ncommitment of all States-whatever political-institutional pattern \nthey follow, in keeping with their respective needs and traditions-to \nrespect human rights, which represent the highest value that our \nsociety is required to protect.\n\n124.\tThese are the beliefs of Italy, a nation that can speak in \nthe name of its ancient traditions as well as its active and highly \ndedicated present. It has known 3,000 years of history, difficulties, \ndisputes and wars, but in the Mediterranean region, from which I \ncome, in the course of encounters and, admittedly, clashes between \ndifferent civilizations originating in three great continents, there \nhas been growing consideration for the values of the human being, his \nrights and his freedom everywhere in the world, and we are proud of \nthat fact.\n\n125.\tHowever, it is in this very area of age-old civilization that \nin the last few weeks human rights have been totally ignored and \ntrampled underfoot. The images of the tragic events in Lebanon are \nstill vividly and horrifyingly impressed on our minds. Following the \nassassination of President-elect Bashir Gemayel and the entry of \nIsraeli troops into west Beirut, in flagrant violation of Israel's \ncommitments, there was a tragic increase in violence. In connection \nwith the Sabra and Shatila camps one of the most bitter pages in \nrecent history was written. It revolts the conscience of the world \nand it arouses feelings of indignation and the strongest condemnation \nagainst those directly and indirectly responsible for the slaughter, \nas well as feelings of pity for the innocent and helpless victims. \nThis is a lesson which should induce everyone to reflect on the \ninhuman and monstrous consequences which await those who repeatedly \ntake the path of violence.\n\n126.\tSince in too many areas there is still a disturbing \ndiscrepancy between theoretical affirmation of principles and their \nconcrete application in regard to human rights, Italy deems it \nessential that the United Nations be enabled to have a more direct \nand incisive impact on the work of verifying effective respect for \nsuch principles. The lack of a suitable and prompt response to the \nintolerable defiance inherent in the persistence, and indeed the \nspread, of flagrant and serious violations in many countries is \nhighly damaging to the prestige of the United Nations.\n\n127.\tWe certainly do not consider that an organizational \nadjustment is an adequate response to one of the most serious \nproblems of our time, the solution of which depends on the ever \nincreasing maturity of our common sensitivity and on the courage, \nnever clouded by opportunism, to denounce any violation of human \nrights.\n\n128.\tOn East-West relations, Italy continues to pursue a firm, \nresponsible policy and is therefore always ready to take part in a \nconstructive dialogue. Detente must be preserved and indeed given a \nnew impetus. Italy is convinced that there is no alternative; \ntherefore, wherever possible, it works with the utmost commitment for \nthe fruitful resumption of the process of detente. Sometimes more \nrecent and very serious events may make us forget or may divert our \nattention from the events which have most affected the increase in \ntension between East and West and are decisive elements in the \ndisquieting international situation facing us today.\n\n129.\tIn view of its gravity, the Afghan problem must continue to \nbe a focal point of our debate at the thirty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly and for United Nations action in general. Three \nyears have now elapsed since the Soviet invasion, but the resistance \nof the proud Afghan people to a regime imposed from outside is \nstronger than ever. The tragic odyssey of those long-suffering \npeople, great numbers of whom have been forced to leave their \nhomeland and seek refuge in neighbouring countries, troubles us \nprofoundly. We have to note with deep regret that there has still \nbeen no response to the appeals and the constructive proposals made \nby the General Assembly, the non-aligned movement, the countries of \nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and the countries of the \nEuropean Community with a view to the restitution of the right of the \nAfghan people to self-determination and the re-establishment of that \ncountry's traditional status as a an independent, neutral and \nnon-aligned State. Therefore we fully support continued pursuit of \nthe Secretary-General's initiative concerning tripartite negotiations \nin Geneva.\n\n130.\tThe Polish problem, not only because it is being enacted only \na few hundred kilometres from our borders but also because it \ninvolves our culture, affects us directly as Italians and Europeans \nconcerned with the construction of an open Europe committed to human \nrights, peace and progress. The Italian Government and Italian public \nopinion is deeply concerned about the drama of the Polish nation, \nwhose courageous search for valid and autonomous forms of renewal has \nbeen violently interrupted.\n\n131.\tUnfortunately even the most recent events confirm that there \nhas been no significant development in that area, which is still the \nscene of a series of challenges to the Polish people's aspiration to \nfreedom, ranging from the persistence of martial law to arbitrary \narrests, and contacts between the Government and the bodies most \nrepresentative of the people have not been resumed. Only a resumption \nof dialogue and the participation of all the vital forces of the \nnation can give the support of a consensus to economic revival and \nsocial peace.\n\n132.\tBut the situation in Poland is not the only obstacle to the \nprocess of detente, the momentum of which unfortunately diminished \nfollowing the signing of the Final Act of Helsinki. Serious blows \nhave been struck at the foundations of world peace by changes in the \nbalance of forces to the advantage of the East. These balances must \nbe restored. That is the firm resolve of my Government. Italy is \nready in this context to make its full contribution to the study and \nsolution of the problems deriving, above all, from the accumulation \nof all kinds of armaments, often in excess of any reasonable or \nlegitimate national security need. In that spirit and in expectation \nof general and complete disarmament under strict international \ncontrol, my country participated with hope and commitment in the \nsecond special session of the General Assembly devoted to \ndisarmament. We are not taking a sceptical view of that session. We \nmerely say that efforts should be continued and intensified.\n\n133.\tIn this connection, I should like to confirm that my country \nconsiders that the solution must be sought in the direction of the \nzero option, with the aim of ensuring the total elimination by both \nthe Soviet Union and the United States of the lethal and \ndestabilizing medium-range missile systems. Also, as regards the \nstrategic arms reduction talks, Italy is determined to make its own \ncontribution both in the framework of Atlantic consultations and \nthrough appropriate bilateral channels with the two Powers involved.\n\n134.\tWhile recognizing the objective difficulties in arriving in \nthe near future at a verifiable treaty on the comprehensive \nprohibition of nuclear tests, I confirm that my country attaches \nparamount importance to that objective. However, we must not neglect \nthe very serious issue of chemical weapons. Italy is also committed \nto progress in negotiations on the subject of conventional weapons, \nparticularly as regards initiatives aimed at limiting and reducing \ninternational transfers of that type of weapon.\n\n135.\tThe crisis in the process of detente unfortunately had \nnegative repercussions on the follow-up meeting to the Conference on \nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe, held in Madrid, which after \nthree postponements was approaching a positive outcome. Our concern \nfor safeguarding the process of that Conference, because of its \nworld-wide as well as European importance, led us to agree to a \nfurther postponement until the beginning of November, which is now \nclose. We hope that the General Assembly will encourage the European \ncountries to create, in keeping with the provisions of the Final Act \nof Helsinki, the necessary conditions for the proceedings to be \nresumed and to move towards a positive conclusion.\n\n136.\tUnfortunately, the persistence and aggravation of focal \npoints of tension in many parts of the world inevitably cause serious \napprehension among the entire international community. The Minister \nfor Foreign Affairs of Denmark, in his capacity as current President \nof the European Community, expressed here, at the 8th meeting, the \nanxiety which we all feel over the world situation and identified and \ncommented in depth and with lucidity on those international problems \nwhich, because of their gravity, must be brought to the attention of \nthe Assembly.\n\n137.\tI am thinking first of all of the Middle East, an area of \ntraditional and direct responsibility for my country, situated as it \nis in the centre of the Mediterranean region. A moral and political \njudgement on the recent tragic events in Lebanon is not enough. There \nmust be concrete action if this vicious circle is to be broken. Aware \nof this fact, Italy made direct efforts with a view to the adoption \nby the United Nations of measures to deal urgently with that \nsituation. A first important step was the strengthening of the United \nNations observer contingent, decided upon by the Security Council in \nits resolution 521 (1982).\n\n138.\tIn view of the gravity and urgency of the situation and \nbearing in mind the fact that the consultations held by the \nSecretary-General had shown that it would be difficult to reach \nagreement quickly on the deployment of an international force, and \nalso in response to appeals received, Italy decided to take the \ninitiative in ensuring the speedy reconstitution, together with the \nUnited States and France, of the multinational force for Beirut, \nwhich will act with United Nations observers upon the formal request \nof the Lebanese Government and in conformity with the objectives of \nresolution 521 (1982).\n\n139.\tFollowing wing the most dramatic phase of the crisis, it will \nbe necessary to proceed rapidly to the complete withdrawal of Israeli \ntroops and all other foreign forces stationed in Lebanon against the \nwishes of the lawful authorities of the country, so that the Lebanese \nGovernment can exercise its authority fully over the entire national \nterritory. Only thus will Lebanon be able once more to become an \nelement of stability in the region.\n\n140.\tWe must, however, never lose sight of the comprehensive peace \nsettlement that we have long advocated, both on behalf of Italy and \nin the context of the European approach to the problems of the Middle \nEast, as the sole solution capable of bringing lasting stability to \nthe entire region. This can be achieved only by seeking an equitable \nsolution to the long-standing Arab-Israeli conflict, giving equal \nweight to Israel's right to be recognized and accepted by its neighbours \nand to exist within secure and guaranteed boundaries and to the right \nof the Palestinians to see the fulfilment of their national \naspirations. We are thus more convinced than ever of the need to \nfacilitate a start to negotiations that can involve all the leading \nprotagonists in the Middle East conflict. It is particularly \nnecessary that the Israelis and Palestinians should be able to move \nbeyond the logic of confrontation and violence and become aware of \nthe existing realities in the area as a prerequisite for reciprocal \nrecognition, even if it is conditional.\n\n141.\tItaly looks with interest and appreciation to the \npossibilities of a breakthrough and the important pronouncements in \nthe recent statements made by the President of the United States, \nwhich contain more specific details regarding a solution to the \nPalestinian problem and give greater prominence to that problem in \nthe general context of the Middle East question.\n\n142.\tThe leaders of the Arab countries, meeting at Fez a few days \nago, on the commendable initiative of the King of Morocco, put \nforward interesting new ideas based on the Fahd plan, ideas which we \nappreciate and which suggest a high degree of restored unity in the \nArab world based on positions which are not extreme but in fact show \na trend towards a certain negotiating flexibility.\n\n143.\tIt must be noted that in the Arab world, Egypt -even at the \ncost of isolation-has set a good example, which certainly gives it a \nprominent role in those developments. I should like also to mention \nthe contribution made by Jordan to this greater search for negotiated \nsolutions.\n\n144.\tRecent statements by the leadership of the PLO -which, in \nItaly's view, continues to be a key factor in future peace \nnegotiations-statements endorsed by Arafat himself at a meeting I had \nwith him some days ago in Rome, show signs of an increased awareness \non the Palestinian side. We hope that this development in the \nPalestinian position, which we have duly noted, will be further \nconsolidated so that in the occupied territories it will be possible \nto make progress towards the establishment of a Palestinian homeland \nthrough the exercise of a free choice by the Palestinians of their \nown destiny made in full awareness of the realities of the area and \nthe importance of gradualism. This means abandoning any attempt to \ndispute Israel's existence or to threaten its security. We are \nconvinced that the time has come for Israel also to show \ndetermination to enter a new phase of negotiations and peaceful \nsettlement, rejecting the alternatives of confrontation and military \naction.\n\n145.\tItaly views also with great apprehension the continuation of \nthe tragic and disastrous conflict between Iraq and Iran. We are \naware of the appalling suffering and destruction which the war has \nbrought to the two warring countries and we intend to act in all \nsuitable forums in an endeavour to expedite a peaceful solution to \nthe conflict, in conformity with the relevant resolutions of the \nSecurity Council and in line with the statement issued by the 10 \nmembers of the European Community on 24 May 1982.\n\n146.\tClose to the area of the Middle East, in the Near East, there \nis another crisis-in Cyprus, more limited but for us Mediterraneans a \nsource of serious concern. On 2 July 1982 I visited that island in \norder to contribute to a speedy solution to the Cyprus problem. That \nvisit afforded a useful opportunity for closer study of the \nindividual aspects of this question with a view to ascertaining what \nconcrete openings could be discerned in the long-standing \nintercommunal talks. It also provided an opportunity to reiterate \nItaly's readiness to assist the Secretary-General and his \nrepresentative in Nicosia in their difficult task of mediation in the \nnegotiations between the two Cypriot communities; their dialogue is \nuseful in itself because it serves to release much tension. The \npositive change in climate in Greek-Turkish relations could also \nfacilitate rapprochement in the positions of the two sides in Cyprus.\n\n147.\tAlso in connection with the efforts made to create suitable \nconditions in the Mediterranean for peaceful and profitable \ncollaboration between all the coastal States, we should mention the \ninterest with which the Italian Government views Malta and the \nconsolidation of its position as a neutral nation, whose development \nalong lines of genuine non-alignment we welcome and sincerely \nencourage.\n\n148.\tThere is another region, the Horn of Africa, with which my \ncountry has strong ties and which unfortunately has not yet overcome \nthe serious crisis affecting it. Our commitment to the development of \nthese peoples, both bilateral and multilateral, is growing and in \nfact we feel that such development is the basic problem to surmount. \nWe feel also that, in a spirit of mutual respect and consideration \nfor the principles established by the Organization of African Unity \n[(241/], collaboration and negotiation constitute the means for \novercoming the present crisis in the Horn of Africa. However, in \nrecent months we have seen a further violation of frontiers-this time \nto the detriment of Somalia-which is most worrying and which still \npersists. Everyone must shoulder his responsibilities and an end must \nbe put to those acts of war.\n\n149.\tTo the south on the African continent, despite South African \nmilitary initiatives in Angola, which we firmly condemn, efforts to \npave the way for Namibia's independence as provided for by the United \nNations have advanced considerably, although too slowly since 1982 is \nalmost at its end and that goal has not yet been attained. We hope \nthat the necessary trust between the parties will grow during this \nfinal stage and serve, among other things, to protect southern Africa \nfrom the impact of world tension.\n\n150.\tThe region of the South Atlantic has also been troubled by a \nserious armed conflict in recent months. Ever since the outbreak of \nthe Anglo-Argentine crisis in the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), Italy \nhas actively endeavoured to avoid any deterioration of that \nsituation-or at any rate to limit its negative consequences- in close \ncontact with the Governments of the members of the European \nCommunity, with the United States and with many Latin American \ncountries, which have similarly attempted to divert the crisis \ntowards a peaceful solution.\n\n151.\tI recently visited Latin America in the hope that, while \ntaking account of my country's position in the course of the \nconflict, Italy or I myself could help to restore, in the common \ninterest relations between South America and the European Community.\nIt is our firm belief that relations, co-operation and understanding \nbetween the countries of Europe and Latin America, which are linked \nby common ties of culture, language and civilization, are essential \nfor world equilibrium.\n\n152.\tWith regard to the specific problem of the Falkland Islands \n(Malvinas), Italy's position has been to condemn the act of \naggression; it has been and remains in favour of a resumption of the \ndialogue between London and Buenos Aires, naturally without any \npre-conditions concerning the subject under dispute, within the \nframework of the United Nations and with the possibility of recourse \nto the good offices of the Secretary-General.\n\n153.\tAnother region of the world of concern to our country is \nCentral America, where, to the local causes of the crisis-found in \nthe age-old but currently unacceptable conditions of cultural, \nsocial, political and economic deprivation in which the people are \nliving-have been added recently, following inadmissible foreign \ninterference, the consequences of East-West rivalry.\n\n154.\tFor our part, we believe that every effort should be made to \ntake the uphill path to peace and, consequently, we are in favour of \nmultilateral and bilateral initiatives in this direction, as well as \nof the assistance programmes thus far implemented to help the \ncountries of the region, to which we hope that the European Community \ncan also contribute.\n\n155.\tWith regard to Asia, the situation in Kampuchea, another \nindependent and non-aligned country that has fallen victim to \nmilitary occupation, continues to interfere with the development of \nrelations among Asian peoples. My Government considers that the \nsolution of this crisis must be based on the emergence of a \nsovereign, independent and neutral Kampuchea with a politically \nrepresentative Government free from any military presence.\n\n156.\tAlso in the context of Asia, I should also like to recall \nthat, unfortunately, the Korean question remains unresolved. The \nItalian Government would welcome the initiation of a dialogue between \nthe two States aimed at arriving at an agreement guaranteeing \npeaceful coexistence with a view to the reunification of the \npeninsula.\n\n157.\tThe peoples consider that the United Nations should \neventually become the parliament of concord, peace and co-operation. \nThat is a most noble undertaking, but certainly a very difficult one. \nWe, the States Members of the United Nations, wiser through the \npainful experiences of our past, which dictate prudent farsightedness \nand a responsible imagination on our part, must not dash their hopes.\n\n158.\tI have already indicated that the current panorama of \ninternational society is very far from reflecting the great ideals of \nthe San Francisco Charter and that the way in which the machinery it \nprovided is being used is far from satisfactory. My country is \nconvinced that, apart from other ways and means we should explore to \nremedy that situation, we can take a significant step forward through \nmore intensive action in the main geographical areas, where it is \npossible to confront problems and relax tensions in the light of the \nCharter, but also within the framework of common historical \ntraditions and common economic and social realities.\n\n159.\tIt is on the basis of this conviction that Italy, along with \nthe nine other countries of Western Europe, is committed to the \nconstruction of a great economic and political community ready to \ncollaborate with all peoples and capable of being an important factor \nfor balance and progress in the international society-a community \nthat wishes to participate fully in the universal dialogue for which \nthe present forum is the United Nations.\n\n160.\tWith the immediate prospect of new Members, of ever-closer \nand interlocking ties between the countries of the Community and of \nthe strengthening of those ties already existing between them and \ngroups of countries of other continents, as exemplified by the Lome \nConvention, we see how fundamentally important integration effort of \nour peoples is to the realization of those higher ideals enshrined in \nthe principles of the Charter.\n\n161.\tDespite the difficulties it encountered, and precisely \nbecause of its inherent evolutionary potential, the European \nCommunity has during the past 25 years succeeded in giving fuller \nexpression on the old continent and throughout the world to the \nprofound sense of equality, freedom and justice of the Europeans and \nto their desire for a constant constructive dialogue with all \npeoples. This opening on the world is the comer-stone of the \nCommunity's international action.\n\n162.\tFor those reasons, we view with great satisfaction and \ninterest the parallel development in other major areas in various \ncontinents of organizations which deal at the regional level with \ndifficult and often contentious international questions, and which \nare united in their assessments and decisions by an awareness of \nshared common interests.\n\n163.\tAction based on peace, justice and the well-being of peoples \nwhich is harmonized at the regional level always has its natural and \npreferred epicentre in the United Nations. The time is ripe for the \ndevelopment of active solidarity capable of enabling the United \nNations to work effectively to translate the progress of the times \ninto human terms and to organize properly the vast new potential of \ncivilization and technology.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to express on behalf of \nthe delegation of the United Arab Emirates our \nwarmest congratulations to Mr, Hollai on his \nelection to the presidency of the current session \nof the General Assembly. I am confident that his \nlong experience in the field of international \nrelations will be a positive factor in directing \nour deliberations and work towards the goals we \nhave gathered here to achieve. I should also like \nto express our greatest appreciation for the \ntireless efforts of his predecessor, Mr. Kittani, \nto reconcile various points of view and to search \nfor satisfactory solutions to numerous problems \nbrought before the Assembly at the previous \nsession and the special and emergency sessions. I \nfurther wish to express my deep gratitude to the \nSecretary-General for his continued efforts to \nstrengthen the foundations and principles on \nwhich the United Nations was established. I \nappreciate his sound analysis of the obstacles \nfacing the United Nations, along with his serious \nattempt to strengthen the ability of the \nOrganization to perform its tasks as well as to \nsolve international problems.\n55.\tThe Secretary-General has pointed out in \nhis report on the work of the Organization the \ndifficulties that the United Nations is facing in \nplaying its role effectively and decisively, \nparticularly with regard to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, since it \nrepresents an ideal forum in the conduct of \nnegotiations for peaceful settlement of \ninternational disputes. In this connection, I \nfully agree with the unequivocal reference in the \nreport that for our most urgent goal is to \nreconstruct the Charter concept of collective \naction for peace and security so as to render the \nUnited Nations more capable of carrying out its \nprimary function. It is incumbent upon all \nGovernment to commit themselves to that sound \napproach, without which the logic of force will \nprevail and States, especially the smaller ones, \nwill consequently be exposed to only dangers that \nthreaten their security, safety and territorial \nintegrity. This situation is not a myth; rather, \nit is a fact and it is sharply and tragically \nrepresented in the area of the Middle East, \nspecifically in a Lebanon in agony.\n56.\tThe events in Lebanon have underscored \nthe fact that the method of force and fait \naccomplis to which Israel resorts cannot achieve \nsecurity and stability. The question of Palestine \nstands clearly before the international community \nin spite of the attempts by the Tel Aviv leaders \nto emasculate it with their military machine. \nObviously the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the \ncontinued Israeli occupation of Lebanese \nterritory both reflect the quagmire into which \nIsrael's employment of its military might to \ncover up its political failure and international \nisolation have led it.\n57. The United Arab Emirates, as a peace-loving \nArab State, expresses its revulsion at and strong \ncondemnation of the ugly massacre perpetrated \nagainst the Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila \ncamps by the Zionist occupation forces. It \nappeals to all Member States, and especially to \nthe great Powers, to take serious action to stop \nIsraeli aggression against the Lebanese and \nPalestinian peoples and to work for the immediate \nand international withdrawal of the Israeli \nforces of aggression from all Lebanese territory, \nM order to preserve Lebanon's independence and \nterritorial integrity and accordance with \nresolutions of the Security Council and other \ninternational bodies.\n58. In this connection, I cannot fail to stress \nthe responsibility of the United States of \nAmerica as a sponsor of and partner in the \nconclusion of the agreement that led to the \nevacuation of the Palestinian fighters from \nBeirut and the guaranteed the safety of the \nPalestinian in the refugee camps as well as the \ncivilian potation of West Beirut. Any reliance \non the part of the United State, of America would \nconstitute a violation of Us political, \ncontractual and moral obligations. We ask the \nUnited States to do its utmost, based on its \nobligations in this regard, to prevent the \nrecurrence of crimes such as those committed in \nLebanon, crimes unprecedented in contemporary to \nforce Israel to withdraw unconfidently from \nLebanese territory.\n59.\tThe PLO emergence from an unequal war \nvictorious in its perseverance, flexibility and \nability to negotiate from a position of right and \nits responsiveness to international resolutions \ndemonstrate its desire to reach a just and \npeaceful solution unlike Israel, which has proved \nthat it is an aggressive entity that does not \nrespect international resolutions, norms or \nrules. The PLO emerged from the conflict more \ndetermined than ever to restore the legitimate \nrights of the Palestinian people, despite the \nIsraeli illusion that its war in Lebanon would \ndestroy the Palestinian people and hence the \nPalestinian cause.\n60.\tThe shameful Israeli policies and \npractices reflected in its flagrant defiance of \nUnited Nations resolutions and its use of armed \nviolence to attain illegal goals call for the \nreconsideration of its membership in the United \nNations. Israel has unequivocally demonstrated, \nby the heinous massacre it committed in Lebanon \nand by its continued inhuman and illegal \npractices in the occupied Arab territories, that \nit is a Member that is neither able nor willing \nto carry out its elementary obligations of \nmembership under the Charter. Its membership in \nthe United Nations and all other international \norganizations should therefore be reconsidered.\n61.\tPresident Reagan's initiative for peace \nin the Middle East represents progress in the \nAmerican position, however, we hope that this \nposition can evolve positively towards the \nrecognition of the rights of the Palestinian \npeople and their legitimate representative, the \nPLO, so that the Palestinian people may exercise \ntheir national rights to self-determination and \nthe establishment of an independent State. In \norder to attain this objective, which is based on \nthe noble purposes and principles enshrined in \nthe Charter, I urge the United States Government \nto reconsider its military and political support \nof Israel. Recent events have confirmed that such \nsupport is the backbone of Israel's arrogance, \nintransigence, continued aggression against the \nArab people, especially the Palestinian and \nLebanese peoples, and rejection of all peace \ninitiatives.\n62.\tMy delegation reaffirms that the just \nsolution of  Middle East problem lies in \nsolving the Palestinian question on the basis of \nthe following principles; first, complete and \nunconditional Israeli withdrawal from all the \noccupied Arab territories, including Holy \nJerusalem; secondly, enabling Palestinian people \nto exercise their inalienable rights, including \ntheir right to return to their homeland, to \nself-determination, to national independence and \nto full sovereignty through the establishment of \nan independent State on their national soil and, \nthirdly, participation on an equal footing of the \nPLO, the sole legitimate representative of the \nPalestinian people, in any endeavors, efforts or \nconferences to settle this question. The \nconclusions reached at the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference underscore the principles that \ndetermine the just and comprehensive framework \nfor the solution of the Palestinian question.\n63.\tIsrael's rejection of the proposed \noptions, whether advanced by the Arabs or by \nothers, is nothing more than blackmail and an \nattempt to influence the current trend of \ninternational thinking. The comprehensive Arab \npeace plan, which is based on international \nlegitimacy, forces the world to face its \nimperative responsibilities for attaining a just \npeace in the region. The plan does not address \nitself to any particular international party; \nrather, it addresses all peace-loving parties by \nassigning a highly important role to the \nOrganization and to the members of the Security \nCouncil in supervising the guarantees for peace.\n64.\tMy country is concerned about the war \nbetween Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran \nthat broke out over two years ago and that is \ndraining the human, military and economic \nresources of both countries. Moreover, that war \nthreatens the security and stability of the Gulf \nregion, which is of world-wide strategic and \neconomic importance. The continuation of this war \ndoes not serve the interest of either country or \nof the international community. In this \nconnection, my country commends the concrete \nresponse of Iraq with regard to ending the war in \nthe interest of both countries and of the region \nas well, and particularly the withdrawal of its \nforces to the international borders. That \ninitiative won the appreciation of the \ninternational community as a step towards rapidly \nending the conflict. We also commend the efforts \nmade by the Secretary-General of the United \nNations, by the Organization of the Islamic \nConference and by the non-aligned movement, as \nwell as all the other international efforts made \nto restore peace and work for conciliation \nbetween those two Moslem countries and to \nestablish new foundations for relations between \nthem on the basis of peace, good-neighborliness \nand mutual respect, which are conducive to the \nwelfare and safety of the region. We hope that \nIran will respond to these initiatives designed \nto end the bloodshed and achieve peace in the \nregion.\n65.\tIn recent decades the Indian Ocean region \nhas been a centre of rivalry among the great \nPowers bent on establishing spheres of influence; \nthat is due to its economic and strategic \nimportance. As a State which is adjacent to that \nocean we are deeply concerned about the continued \nescalation of tension in the area. We support \nGeneral Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI), the \nDeclaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of \nPeace. In that regard, we cannot but express o r \nregret that the attitude of some States has led \nto the postponement of the international \nconference which had been scheduled to be \nconvened :n Sri Lanka in 1981 for the purpose of \nadopting the measures necessary for the \nimplementation, particularly by the \nsuper-Powers, of that Declaration\n66.\tThe continued presence of foreign forces \nin Afghanistan, despite the numerous appeals made \nby the United Nations and other organizations for \nthe immediate withdrawal of foreign forces, is \npreventing the Afghan people from choosing its \nGovernment by means of free elections: a choice \nwhich it must be able to make without the least \nforeign interference.\n67.\tThat military presence jeopardizes the \nindependence, sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of that country as a non-aligned State. \nThe Government of my country has repeatedly \ncondemned the foreign intervention in Afghanistan \nas a flagrant violation of the Charter and as an \nact of aggression against human rights and the \nfreedom of peoples. We affirm that there should \nbe a comprehensive political solution based on \nfull respect for Afghanistan's independence, \nsovereignty, territorial integrity and \nnon-aligned status.\n68.\tWith regard to Cyprus, it seems to us \nthat the holding of negotiations between the two \ncommunities constitutes one of the fundamental \nconditions for reaching a just settlement of the \ncrisis which that State is experiencing. In this \nconnection, the United Nations should continue, \nthrough the Secretary- General, its efforts to \nhelp the two c <n unities reach some \nunderstanding and to provide conditions which \nwould be conducive to the restoration of peace.\n69.\tSince its inception, the United Nations \nhas worked to secure respect of the right of all \npeoples to self-determination and independence in \naccordance with their hopes, aspirations and \ninterests. Although most peoples of the world \nhave gained their independence, some Territories \nare still under colonial domination, notably in \nsouthern Africa, where the Government of South \nAfrica persists in its racist policy \nnotwithstanding the international condemna-tion \nof that policy as a crime against humanity. The \ndenial to the people of South Africa of the \nability to exercise their fundamental right of \nself-determination constitutes a violation of \nthe most important principles of the Charter and \nof United Nations resolutions, as well as a grave \nchallenge to the international community.\n70.\tThe continued economic, military and \npolitical co-operation which that racialist \nregime receives from certain States Members of \nthe United Nations is what encourages it in its \nintransigence. My Government considers Security \nCouncil resolution 435 (1978) to be the soundest \nframework for the resolution of the question of \nNamibia. It reaffirms the basic responsibility \ntowards that Territory which the United Nations \nhas held since the termination of the South \nAfrican Mandate in 1966. The Security Council \nshould impose sanctions on South Africa and adopt \nthe necessary measures envisaged in Chapter VII \nof the Charter.\n71.\tMy delegation affirms its support for the \nlegitimate struggle waged by the South West \nAfrica People's Organization [SWAPO] for \nself-determination and independence for the \nNamibian people. It strongly condemns the \nrepeated acts of aggression carried out by South \nAfrica against neighbouring States.\n72.\tThe deterioration of the climate of \nconfidence in international relations has led to \nthe continuation of the arms race, which \nconstitutes a serious threat to the whole human \nrace. Despite the declaration of the First \nDisarmament Decade, and the Programme of Action \nadopted by the tenth special session of the \nGeneral Assembly, the first devoted to \ndisarmament, little progress has been made in \nthis field because of the absence of political \nwill on the part of the big Powers. The failure \nof the recent disarmament session is clear \nevidence of that fact.\n73.\tWe believe the , while disarmament may be \nthe concern of all States, the responsibility for \nhalting the arms race falls primarily on the \nshoulders of the big Powers, which are the ones \nproducing nuclear and other weapons of mass \ndestruction. The declarations by the United \nNations of nuclear-free zones represent a \nsignificant contribution to the creation of a \nclimate of peace and security in the world. The \npossession of nuclear weapons by States which do \nnot respect the norms of international behavior \nand the provisions of international conventions, \nand which violate the United Nations resolutions, \ntruly constitutes a serious threat to \ninternational peace and security. General and \ncomplete disarmament under international control \nremains a prerequisite for a general atmosphere \nof confidence, for reducing the dangers of \ntension in the world, and for the removal of the \nobstacles to channeling huge material resources \ninto economic and social development, for the \npurpose of attaining prosperity and better living \nconditions for all mankind.\n74.\tThe results achieved at the Third United \nNations Conference on the Law of the Sea during \nits last session held in April at United Nations \nHeadquarters here in New York, namely, the \napproval by the overwhelming majority of the \nStates of the world of the consolidated text of \nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea/ which sets \nforth a comprehensive legal system for the \npeaceful exploitation of the seas for various \npurposes, especially maritime and economic \nones\u00f3was the product of a comprehensive \ncompromise which harmonized differing interests \nand points of view in the light of the principle \nof the for common heritage of mankind ' adopted \nby the United Nations many years ago. The success \nattained may be attributed to the United Nations, \nwhich endorsed the call to hold the Conference: \nto the Secretary-General, who sponsored it \nthroughout its many sessions over several years; \nand to effective participation in the Conference, \nparticularly by the Group of 77, which exerted \ncommendable efforts in favor of conciliation.\n75.\tNoting with deep concern the extent of \nthe deterioration of the world economy, my \ncountry considers that it is necessary to \nreconsider the existing international economic \norder so as to make it more just and equitable, \nin the interest of humanity. The world economy is \nstill confronted with problems regarding economic \ngrowth, international trade, and the continuing \nrise in the rates of inflation and unemployment. \nTherefore, international co-operation should be \nstrengthened and arduous efforts should be \nexerted to cope with this deteriorating situation \nwhich threatens not only the developing \ncountries, but also the economies of the \nindustrialized States, since the world has become \nclosely interdependent in the various political, \neconomic and social fields. The inter-related \nnature of the world's economic problems calls \nfor total rather than partial solutions. The \nindustrialized States should be aware of this \nfact and should effectively contribute to \nreforming the current world financial and \neconomic order. They should also favorably \nconsider the proposals made by the developing \ncountries, which hope for a further positive \ncontribution to the development of their \neconomies, which suffer from continued recession, \nstagnation and balance-of-payments deficits. \nCo-operation among developing countries in \nsolving these problems should be considered as a \nsupplement rather than an alternative to \nco-operation between the North and the South. It \ndoes not relieve the industrialized States of \ntheir responsibilities and duties towards the \ndeveloping countries. Such responsibilities \nrequire that the industrialized States adjust the \npolicies currently controlling commodity and \nservice markets, with a view to presenting \nlong-term solutions which give special attention \nto strengthening food security.\n76.\tAs a third world country, the United Arab \nEmirates requires various resources to develop \nits economy and to provide for the welfare of its \npeople, yet it plays a concrete role in extending \nassistance to other third world countries through \nthe financial mechanisms that it has established \nfor that purpose. Most notable among these \nmechanisms are the Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab \nEconomic Development, created in 1971 to provide \nforeign assistance, in addition to assistance for \ndevelopment from other sources, such as the \nSpecial Fund of the Organization of Petroleum \nExporting Countries, the Arab Fund for Economic \nand Social Development, and the Arab Bank for \nAfrican Development.\n77.\tMy country fully recognizes that the hope \nof solutions to the various international \nfinancial and economic problems lies in the \ncredibility of a constructive North-South \ndialogue. The positive response of the \nparticipants in the June Versailles Economic \nSummit to the proposals made by the Group of 77 \nis an encouraging factor. We hope that the \nVersailles group will respond quickly to the \nproposals recently submitted by the Group of 77, \nwhich are considered a great concession, made to \nfacilitate the progress of those negotiations. \nThe present condition of the world economy makes \nmore necessary than ever before the restructuring \nby the international community of the \nfundamental factors which control economic and \nsocial progress throughout the world and \nespecially the development of the States of the \nthird world.\n78.\tDespite this gloomy international \npicture, I stress my country's full confidence in \nthe ideals and principles of the Charter as an \nideal framework for permanent consultation and \ndialogue to resolve the problems of the world by \npeaceful means. In this connection, I should like \nto urge the United Nations to do its utmost to \nplay the fundamental role assigned to it by the \nCharter and to create conditions conducive to \npeace, harmony, progress and prosperity for all \nnations.\n"

        "file_text": "This session of the General Assembly of the United Nations is being \nheld at a time of acute international tensions and a world economic \ncrisis of singular gravity. The entire international community is \nfacing numerous problems which require from us as government \nofficials a critical analysis conducive to appropriate solutions \nbeing sought in the higher interest of international peace and \nsecurity as well as for the prosperity of our peoples and nations. In \norder to achieve those noble objectives, it is more than ever \nessential that the Members of the Organization scrupulously honor the \nobligations that they have assumed under the Charter. The whole world \nunanimously deplores the inability of the United Nations to resolve \nthe major problems of our day, but what we do not denounce enough is \nthe fact that such weakness on the part of the United Nations is the \nimmediate consequence of the lack of political will of each of its \nMembers to behave in accordance with the principles and purposes of \nthe Charter. This is why our delegation unreservedly supports the \nhighly intelligent recommendations made by the Secretary-General in \nhis report on the work of the Organization as regards strengthening \nits role and especially the action of the Security Council for \nmaintaining international peace and security.\n$49\nBy electing Mr. Hollai President of its thirty- seventh session, the \nGeneral Assembly affirmed its trust in his outstanding qualities as a \ndiplomat and experienced statesman. In so doing it crowned his long \ncareer, which has been basically directed towards international \nrelations. My delegation, confident in his ability to conduct the \nwork of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly \nsuccessfully, extends its warm congratulations to him and assures him \nof its full co-operation in his difficult but exalting \nresponsibilities. I should like also to express the esteem and \nappreciation of my delegation to Mr. Kittani, his predecessor, who \naccomplished his noble work with courage and dignity in spite of the \ncomplexity of the tragic events that have shaken the world throughout \nthe past year. Lastly, it is an agreeable duty for me to pay a \nwell-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General for his tireless and \nmost commendable efforts during the first year of his term of office \nin attempting to find peaceful solutions to the disputes that divide \ncertain Member States. He may be assured of the readiness of the \nGovernment of Chad to help him in his future work for world peace and \ndevelopment.\nBefore briefly expressing my delegation's position on certain \nimportant items of the agenda of the present session, I should like, \nas the representative of a country which has been the subject of \nconversation internationally in recent years because of the long and \ntragic situation of war that it has experienced, to outline the \nsituation now prevailing in Chad.\nWhile it is true that peace in Chad was restored only at the cost of \ngreat sacrifices, it is equally true that the tragedy endured for \nalmost 20 years by our people was not without cause. War is never a \nmatter of fate. In order better to grasp the true dimensions of the \npeace and security restored by the people of Chad last 7 June, it \nwould be useful for me to outline briefly the internal and external \ncauses of the tragedy experienced by my country.\nThe first major people's revolt in Chad after independence dates back \nto 1965. It was a genuinely national revolt, directed against an \noppressive system imposed from outside. Through that war for national \nliberation, directed by the National Liberation Front, which \ncourageously faced the neo-colonial troops and other expeditionary \nbodies, there were many people of Chad who saw their loved ones fall, \ntheir villages bumed and their homes plundered. Many were also forced \ninto exile. The regime of the day, which had become anachronistic and \ndictatorial, supported as it was by troops from the former \nmetropolitan country, in 1975 fell victim to its own mistake of \nattempting to impose itself on our people against their will. Thus \nits own army seized power from it. Unfortunately, the hopes raised \nwere soon disappointed.\nInstead of offering the people of Chad dialogue and reconciliation, \nthe military junta in tarn committed the same mistakes and \nbloodthirsty acts as the former regime. Defying the six-month \ncease-fire that had been unilaterally declared by the National \nLiberation Front, whose Armed Forces of the North are the patriotic \nbranch, the junta maintained a policy of repression and neo-colonial \nwar. It was only in 1978 that the military regime, undermined by its \nnotorious inability to meet internal and external challenges, \naccepted, for tactical reasons, the historic compromise of the \nKhartoum agreement. That was the first time since the popular \nuprisings of 1965 that an agreement frankly set forth the different \nproblems of Chad and proposed comprehensive and lasting solutions.\nA/37/PV.30\nThe implementation of the basic charter that emerged from the \nKhartoum agreement would have spared our people a great deal of \nsuffering. Unfortunately, however, that charter was interpreted in \ndifferent ways, which quickly led to a governmental crisis. Despite \nthe twofold proposal of the Armed Forces of the North, to consult \nlawyers of internationally recognized competence if problems of a \nlegal nature arose, or to amend the charter if the problem was of a \npolitical nature; despite our people's desire for peace as expressed \nin many demonstrations-yes, despite all that, part of the \nneo-colonial army, mobilized along personal, tribal, religious and \nregional lines, took the dangerous step, on 12 February of opening \nfire on students whose only fault was that to call for the peaceful \nand immediate implementation of the basic charter. The results of \nthat war are known to all of us: massacre of the civilian population \nand a breakdown of trust among the regional components of our people; \nabove all, that war opened the door for additional interference by \nforeign forces.\nSupported by our people, and without external support, the Armed \nForces of the North emerged victorious from that trial. The balance \nof power was in our favor. None the less, Comrade Hissein Habre \nstated that there were neither victors nor vanquished and that it \nwould be possible for the people of Chad to reach an understanding \namong themselves-but without foreign interference. We therefore \nproposed to the other components the Kano-1 meeting in order to widen \nthe power base by including all people of Chad who would participate \nin genuine reconciliation.\nIn spite of the Kano agreements, which called on all neighboring \nStates not to interfere in the internal affairs of Chad, certain \nPowers, sensing that they were losing ground on the Chad political \nchessboard, hastily formed armed factions along ethnic lines and that \nwould serve their own interests. Unfortunately, at the Kano-11 \nmeeting we failed in our patriotic attempt to remove some of our \nbrothers from external domination; thus we were composed of H \npolitical-military factions when we met in Lagos in August 1979.\nIn spite of our conviction about the anti-national character of \ncertain political-military factions, we nevertheless agreed to sign \nthe Lagos agreement. That agreement reiterated the call to all \nneighboring States not to interfere in Chad's internal affairs. An \nimportant point in that agreement was the establishment of a \nconsensus Government, whose term of office was set as 18 months, with \nthe task of preparing free elections and completing the work of \nnational reconciliation. The President of that Government would \ntherefore have no personal powers.\nIn flagrant violation of the provisions of the Lagos agreement, a \nneighboring country and other foreign Powers openly intervened in our \naffairs. Despite our determination to avoid war and in spite of the \nmediation offered by eminent national and foreign personalities, \ncertain factions, feeling strong because of their external support, \nunleashed the war of 21 March. By attacking elements of the Armed \nForces of the North, the nucleus of the integrated national army \nenvisaged in the Lagos agreement, that coalition brought about the \nstart of another war-one which was certainly the deadliest and the \nlongest that our people has had to endure. After nine months of \nnational resistance, in the face of what became a plot to recolonize \nChad, which met with a staunch resistance with the exclusive support \nof our people, on 15 December 1980 we undertook tactical withdrawal \nin order to spare our people from genocide and to deal in an \nappropriate manner with the occupier's overwhelming superiority in \nweaponry.\nAs the occupying forces established themselves on our territory, the \nnational and international public realized their real intentions and \nthose of the coalition. At the same time, the patriotic struggle \ncontinued with a resolve matched only by our love for our homeland \nand our dedication to the universal values of freedom and dignity. It \nwas in that context that the enemy was to begin the withdrawal of its \ntroops. We then unilaterally and immediately decreed a cease-fire, \nwith no prior conditions. Our desire for peace led us to give \nunreserved support to the resolutions of the Organization of African \nUnity of 11 February 1982. It was that same desire for dialogue and \npeace which governed the rate at which we advanced on the capital. \nFor more than four months we intentionally delayed taking the \ncapital, in the sole hope of softening the belligerent attitude of \nour brothers. It was that same desire for peace and dialogue among \nthe Chad people that underlay the successive visits of Comrade \nHissein Habre to Gabon and Zaire, after the N'Djamena meeting.\nToday once again, before the Assembly, we affirm our attachment to \nthe spirit of dialogue, without bitterness or ulterior motives. We \nsolemnly invite all our brothers, including the former officials, to \nreflect on the wise words of Comrade Hissein Habre:\n\\\"Let us bury the recriminations of unwarranted, unjustifiable and \nsterile hatred; let us exercise restraint and still our emotions; let \nus arm ourselves with common sense and reason; let us work for the \nbenefit of the homeland and the people, and let us respond to its \nhopes of peace and unity, rather than attempt to bind the people to \nour whims.\\\"\nAnd we invite them to return to Chad, as many have already done, for \nthe sake of peace and reconstruction.\nAlthough this outline has been lengthy, we believe it was necessary \nin order to provide an accurate picture of the dynamics of war in \nwhose grip Chad so recently found itself.\nFor the first time since 1978, a single administration effectively \ncontrols the 14 sub-divisions of our country. This is also the first \ntime since 1965 that security has prevailed throughout our national \nterritory. We are gratified to affirm before the Assembly that peace \nand security have been achieved following a long patriotic struggle \nand that they remain our constant objective.\nThe people of Chad remain touched by the sympathy expressed towards \nour cause by fraternal African peoples and all people of good will. \nHence, we should like to express our deep gratitude to the African \nheads of State for their selfless contribution and especially to the \nfounding President of the Togolese People's Assembly, General \nGnassigbe Eyadema who, at the risk of his life, went in the midst of \nwar to N'Djamena to attempt to obtain a cease-fire. We also extend \nour thanks to our great pan-African organization, the Organization of \nAfrican Unity.\nThese achievements are and will remain fragile and could at any time \nbe lost if Chad's neighboring and other countries do not stop from \ninterfering in our internal affairs by encouraging the people of Chad \nto rekindle the flames of war. We would therefore recall that States \nare duty bound to respect the principles inscribed in the Charter of \nthe United Nations and that of the OAU, in particular, the principles \nof non-interference in the internal affairs of others, respect for \nterritorial integrity, national independence and the non-acquisition \nof territories by Aarce.\nAfter the restoration of peace and the beginning of national \nreconciliation, a Council of State was established in order to \nguarantee the continuity of the State and the management of the \naffairs of the country. A Government will be formed on the basis of \nconsultations which are now under way. It will have as its task the \ncompletion of reconciliation among all the people of Chad, a start on \nthe work of national reconstruction and the creation of favorable \nconditions for the establishment of democratic institutions.\nPeace and security do not suffice to guarantee genuine stability in a \ncountry if they are not supported by action for socio-economic \ndevelopment. Chad, already disadvantaged by its situation as a \nland-locked country, has suffered from a dislocated economy since \nindependence. The combined effects of drought and war have worsened \nits already alarming economic situation. In fact, at this very moment \nthe country is devastated, most public and social buildings have been \ndestroyed, our economic and highways infrastructure is in a state of \ncomplete disrepair, communications with other countries are almost \nnon-existent, hospitals and schools lack staff and equipment, people \nin certain regions are dying of hunger and the massive return of \nrefugees is posing a problem as regards their resettlement and \nrehabilitation; and the list goes on.\nChad intends to maintain friendly relations with other countries \nwhich are mutually beneficial, but without infringing upon its \nfreedom of judgment and action. By the same token, we reaffirm our \nfirm attachment to the principles of the immutability of frontiers \nbequeathed by colonization and of the settlement of disputes by \npeaceful means. It is in this spirit that Comrade Hissein Habre \nreaffirmed in his statement to the nation of 18 June that:\n\\\"Our international relations are guided by the relevant principles of \nthe Charter of the United Nations and that of the OAU: \nnon-interference and mutually advantageous and reciprocally friendly \ncooperation; positive and dynamic non-alignment which in no way \nexcludes our taking a position on various subjects of international \ninterest; the implacable struggle against hegemony, whatever its \nsource and active solidarity with all neighboring countries. We \nfirmly state that Chad will never be a base for subversion or \naggression against fraternal neighboring countries'\nFor several years now constant conflicts have marked the relations \namong States Members of the Organization; recourse to the threat or \nuse of force, political, diplomatic, economic and military pressures \nare common currency. This has led the Secretary- General in his \nreport on the work of the Organization to state: \\\"We are perilously \nnear to a new international anarchy\\\".\nThese acts of insecurity are leading to the proliferation of hotbeds \nof crisis the world over. This applies especially to the question of \nWestern Sahara, the situation in southern Africa, the problem of the \nMiddle East and conflicts in Asia.\nThe problem of Western Sahara has become an alarming one for the \ninternational community and especially for Africa. My country has \ncontinually called for a peaceful solution to this problem in \naccordance with the relevant resolutions of the OAU and of the United \nNations, and in particular in accordance with the decisions adopted \nat the eighteenth session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and \nGovernment at Nairobi in June 1981.\nIn southern Africa, our major concern remains the establishment of \ngenuine freedom. We must restore dignity to our African brothers who \nare suffering in Namibia and Azania, the last bastions of the most \nblatant form of colonialism. As regards the Namibian problem, the \ninternational community is aware today that the South African regime \ndoes not understand the language of dialogue, but rather that of \nforce. The racist regime in Pretoria and its allies do not wish to \nlet go of Namibia, but to continue to exploit the wealth of that \nTerritory. That racist regime could not have adopted such an arrogant \nattitude or have rejected the determination of the international \ncommunity had it not relied on the assistance and support of its \nallies.\nWe reaffirm our steadfast support for the South West Africa People's \nOrganization, the authentic representative of the Namibian people, \nand call for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 \n(1978) in order to establish a cease-fire and proceed to free \nelections. We urge the countries which continue their economic, \ncultural, military and nuclear co-operation with the racist regime of \nSouth Africa to put an end to these relations and to cooperate \nsincerely with the United Nations so as to achieve a rapid solution \nto the Namibian problem.\nIn South Africa itself, the racists stick to their policy of \nsegregation in its most demeaning form, thereby perpetuating the \ngreatest scourge of mankind. My delegation cannot fail to reiterate \nits condemnation of that hateful system. It also condemns the \naggression against and invasion of the People's Republic of Angola, \nas well as the constant violation of the territories of other \nfront-line States by racist troops.\nThe crisis which is unsettling the Horn of Africa is not likely to \nfoster unity and cohesion in our continent but, rather, to perpetuate \npermanent tension. We venture to hope that the two fraternal \ncountries will finally come to the negotiating table to find a \npeaceful solution to their dispute.\nAs regards the situation in the Middle East, many initiatives have \nbeen undertaken by the international community, but unfortunately \nthey have not been followed up in a promising way because of the \nwarlike attitude of the State of Israel. Everyone is convinced that \nthe outcome of this conflict, which has been of concern to peoples \nwho cherish peace and freedom for more than a quarter of a century, \nrests on the implementation of the resolutions of the Organization. \nThis involves the evacuation by the Jewish State of ail Arab and \nPalestinian territories which it occupies; the exercise by the \nPalestinian people of its inalienable rights to self-determination \nand the establishment of an independent and sovereign State in its \nown homeland; the recognition of the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization as the sole representative of the Palestinian people; \nrecognition of and respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity \nand political independence of each State in the region and the right \nof each State to live in peace within internationally recognized \nborders.\nMy delegation condemns the invasion of Lebanon by Israel and the \nabominable massacre of Palestinian civilians in Sabra and Shatila. \nThe international community is duty bound to apply sanctions against \nIsrael under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran, two \nneighboring Islamic countries, has already caused considerable losses \nin human life and material damage. In principle we reject any \nrecourse to violence in solving a dispute which might arise between \nStates and this is why my delegation reiterates here its appeal to \nthe two parties for a cease-fire and for a peaceful solution to the \nproblem. Consequently, we support the ongoing initiative within the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and other initiatives which \nmight help to bring about peace in that region.\nIn Asia, the problems of Afghanistan and Kampuchea continue to be a \nsource of concern to us. The continuation of the situations in those \ntwo countries and their regional and international effects emphasize \nthe urgent need for peaceful solutions that could restore internal \nand regional peace. Such solutions necessarily involve the withdrawal \nof foreign troops, and strict respect for the independence and \nterritorial integrity of those countries, and a settlement allowing \nthe two peoples to determine their own fate in full sovereignty.\nSimilarly, regarding Korea, we support the principle of the peaceful \nreunification of the two parts of the country, without external \ninterference, and the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Korean \npeninsula.\nAnother political question merits comment-disarmament. The second \nspecial session of the General Assembly on that question, which \nopened in a spirit of euphoria, has somewhat dashed the hopes placed \nin it, inasmuch as its work has not led to any tangible results; \nhowever, it Las en Ale J not only Member States, international \norganizations, governmental and non-governmental organizations, but \nalso the public to become fully aware of 4he danger inherent in the \npossession of nuclear and chemical weapons and, consequently, of the \nabsolute necessity to freeze them immediately and gradually destroy \nthem. Enormous resources, both human and financial, would thereby be \nfreed and could be devoted to development.\nFortunately, since dialogue between the major Powers has not ceased, \nmy delegation remains convinced that wisdom will prevail over any \nnegative considerations that could lead the world into a nuclear \nholocaust, which would spare no one.\nThe world is living in a state of expectation, but the margin for \noptimism is a thin one, especially because other phenomena of \ndomination and destabilization of small countries, such as the use of \nmercenaries, continue to develop. Indeed, in recent years there has \nbeen a renewal of acts of aggression by mercenaries and other \nirregular elements against countries attempting to enjoy political \nsovereignty and independence. Their activities are threatening \ninternational peace and security in the same way as armed conflicts \nbetween countries. The people of Chad has suffered firsthand the \neffects of those activities. That is why we urge the Committee on the \nDrafting of an International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, \nFinancing and Training of Mercenaries to conclude its work and \nproduce a convention very soon.\nDevelopment questions are also of concern to the Organization and \nhave been since its creation, and the struggle against the inequity \nof the international economic system is part and parcel of the \nstruggle the international community must wage. Indeed, here we are \nin the middle of the Third United Nations Development Decade and \nstill uncertain about our future. The problems which the developing \ncountries have to face are increasing even though it is true that no \nefforts have been spared to find a solution-for example, the fifth \nsession of UNCTAD, the sixth and seventh special sessions of the \nGeneral Assembly, the creation of UNIDO to promote the industrial \ndevelopment of States, and many other initiatives.\nIn spite of efforts to ensure our development and in spite of the \nlevels of international negotiation, the gap continues to widen \nbetween the economies of the developed countries and those of the \ndeveloping countries.\nThe ills of international economic relations are more structural than \ncyclical. They include the increased deficit in the balance of \npayments of the poor countries, the continual deterioration in the \nterms of trade, ever growing inflation, rigid and unfavorable \nconditions for the transfer of technology, which are compounded by \nobstacles and limitations imposed on access by developing countries \nto international financial markets.\nWe must add to those the vicissitudes of nature for some of these \ncountries, such as Chad-landlocked, insular, prone to drought, and so \non. To be sure, not everything is so negative, as shown by the \nadoption in April of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \nSea.' But there is a serious degeneration of the very spirit which \nshould guide the new concept of international economic co-operation. \nThat widens even further the gap between North and South-a source of \npolitical instability the world over. For that reason my delegation \nrecalls that the gradual establishment of a new economic order \nrequires, first, the democratization of international relations, \nwhich necessitates the overhauling and strengthening of international \ninstitutions. It would be desirable for the developed countries to \npractice policies compatible with the interests of the developing \ncountries. That means the abandonment, to whatever degree, of the \ncurrent tendency based only on solution of internal problems.\nThe delegation of Chad draws the attention of the Assembly to \ndecisions and resolutions the Organization has adopted in favor of \ngeographically disadvantaged countries. These countries have great \nneeds and would like both national and international financial \ninstitutions to pay particular attention to them. We believe that the \nInternational Development Strategy for the Third United Nations \nDevelopment Decade should stimulate development in the third world. \nTo do that, it is high time that we reformed the structures of the \ncurrent economic system flowing from a global and integral approach \nto problems of the world economy with the participation of the whole \ninternational community.\nCertainly, the international community has not been unaware of these \ndifficulties. It has shown its concern for our people since 1979. \nThus, the General Assembly has adopted many resolutions on emergency \naid and reconstruction assistance; the most recent -resolution 36/210 \nadopted in 1981-requests the Secretary-General to organize a pledging \nconference on assistance to Chad. In that connection, during my stay \nin New York I have had talks with the representative of the current \nChairman of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government, the \nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Kenya, with the Secretary-General of \nthe United Nations and with the Administrator of UNDP, to whom I have \nexpressed the earnest desire of my country to see that conference \ntake place before the end of this year. We are confident that the \nSecretary-General will organize this conference in which we hope to \nsee the largest possible participation by lenders and international \norganizations. To that end, we repeat our appeal to the international \ncommunity for emergency assistance to Chad and for effective \nparticipation by lenders in the conference.\nChad seeks only to live in peace and understanding with all countries \nthat love peace and justice, in particular with its neighbors. It is \nin this spirit that we wish to refer here to a situation that has \nbeen of concern to the people of Chad since 1973, namely, the \noccupation of a part of our territory by a neighboring country, which \noccupation we have constantly condemned. This problem has already \nbeen raised in the OAU and the General Assembly and the Security \nCouncil of the United Nations, and we still hope to see it solved \npeacefully. As soon as they entered N'Djamena, the Armed Forces of \nthe North and the Council of State got in direct and indirect contact \nwith that neighboring country, so as to create at the very outset \ndetente between the two countries so that our two peoples might live \nin a climate of peace. In spite of our readiness for dialogue we are \nbound to note the silence on the other side; more serious still, \nthere has been glaring interference.\nThat was the message that I wished to impart to the Assembly, on \nbehalf of my delegation. As representatives must have noted, owing to \nthe special situation prevailing in our country, we have spoken at \nsome length to state the concerns of our people. Our people has \nsuffered too much from war and should now be entitled to lasting \npeace and its development with the assistance of friendly countries \nand the international community, to which we affirm that peace and \nsecurity have been restored in Chad.\nBefore concluding, we should like to repeat our appeal to the \ninternational community to help us effectively in the true battle \nthat we intend henceforth to wage, that is, the reconstruction and \ndevelopment of Chad.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, on behalf of the Government and \npeople of Sierra Leone, I would offer Mr. Hollai \nwarm felicitations on his unanimous election as \nPresident of this thirty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly and express my delegation's \nconfidence that under his able guidance the \nsession will be a successful one. We are aware of \nhis distinguished record as Deputy Minister for \nForeign Affairs of his country, and we have no \ndoubt that his experience adequately equips him \nfor the posi\u00action he has now been called upon to \nassume.\n135.\tI would also express my delegation's \ngratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Kittani, for \nhis efforts and contributions at the last session \nof the Assembly.\n136.\tThis is the first opportunity I have had \nper\u00acsonally and publicly to congratulate Mr. \nPerez de Cueliar on his election to the high and \nexacting office of Secretary-General. Of course, \nthe Government of Sierra Leone communicated its \nfelicitations and good wishes through the usual \nchannels immediately after his election.\n137.\tThe United Nations was founded on the \nashes of global destruction which made man \nresolve that force would never again be used save \nin the collective defense of our common good. \nRegrettably, over the years we have strayed from \nthe goals and ideals that inspired the efforts \nculminating in the founding of the United \nNations, a fact which has contributed to the \nincreasing and heightening of global tension and \ninsecurity on an unprecedented scale, and we have \nfailed to establish the scheme for collective \nsecurity planned by the founding fathers of the \nOrganization.\n138. Today there is a recrudescence of resort to \nunilateral force by States. This is in total \ndisregard of the scheme and provisions of the \nCharter and the Organization. As a consequence \nthe world today faces a massive betrayal of \nfaith, whether it be in the problems of divided \nnations, the situation in Southeast Asia, \nNamibia's accession to independence, or \nrecognition and affirmation of the inalienable \nright to self-determination of the Palestinian \npeople. States or groups of States increasingly \nresort to special arrange\u00acments in total \ndisregard of the collective pledge we made 37 \nyears ago \\\"to save succeeding generations from \nthe scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime \nhas brought untold sorrow to mankind\\\".\n139.\tThis phenomenon manifests itself today in \nan unprecedented global arms race wherein nations \nlarge and small pursue the elusive goal of \nnational security in the strength of national \narms. This goal has so far proved illusory, and \nafter two special sessions of the General \nAssembly devoted to the question of disarma\u00acment, \nit remains illusory.\n140.\tIt is this need for the reaffirmation of \nfaith in the basic principles and ideals that \ngave birth to the Organization that has impelled \nthe Government of Sierra Leone to seek the \ninclusion in the agenda of the thirty-seventh \nsession of the Assembly of an item entitled \n\\\"Implementation of the collective security \nprovisions of the Charter of the United Nations \nfor the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity\\\". This is both an exercise in practical \nutility and a reaffirma\u00action of faith. On the one \nhand, it will demonstrate to those who are minded \nto resort to unilateral force that the rest of us \ncan and will stand up to them; on the other, it \nis a reaffirmation of our faith that only in our \ncollective security and its maintenance and \npursuit lies our individual safety and salvation. \nPerhaps at this stage it is timely to recall that \nit was the failure of the international community \nin another era to observe these imperatives that \nresulted in the demise of the League of Nations. \nWe do not want to reap another harvest of failure \nin the United Nations.\n141.\tIndeed, we feel at one with the cri de \ncaeur of the Secretary-General when he bemoans, \nin his report on the work of the Organization, \nthe fact that the procedures and methods \ncollectively agreed upon are blithely ignored and \nset aside in pursuit of national parochial \ninterests when it comes to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. We support histimely \ncall for measures to strengthen the integrity and \ncredibility of the Organization and to restore \nits effectiveness.\n142.\tIt is for that reason that I want to \ncommend to the Assembly's attention and \nconsideration the modest proposal of the \nGovernment of Sierra Leone.\n143.\tThis year has certainly been a \nparticularly chilling one for the forces of \ninternational peace and co-operation. We have \nwitnessed, in succession, a retreat in the ranks \nof two important international organizations that \ntogether complement the endeavors of the United \nNations in strengthening the delicate fabric of \ninternational peace and security. I refer to the \nseeming paralysis affecting the OAU and the \nnon-aligned movement, which this year had caused \nto abandon their important meetings because of \ndif\u00acferences among their members.\n144.\tIn the case of the non-aligned movement, \nthe regrettable war between Iran and Iraq\u2014two \nimportant members of the movement\u2014forced it to \npostpone the Seventh Conference of Heads of State \nor Government of Non-Aligned Countries, which was \nto have been held in Baghdad this year. Happily, \nthe resilience of the members of the non-aligned \nmovement and their dedication to the ideals and \nprinciples of peace have enabled them to agree on \nNew Delhi as a new venue. For this, the \nGovernment of Sierra Leone wishes in advance to \nexpress its appreciation to the Government and \npeople of India for their readiness to serve as \nhost to that important meeting in the fine and \nhistorical tradition of India as a defender of \nthe values of the non-aligned movement.\n145.\tWe can only hope that these developments \nwill have brought home to the two warring \ncountries of Iran and Iraq the inescapable and \ncompelling necessity to bring their hostilities \nto a speedy end.\n146.\tIn the case of the OAU, it is evidently \nthe admission to membership in that organization \nof the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic that has \npre\u00accipitated the crisis. It should be realized \nthat this is an issue on which there are strong \nand deep-seated feelings among members of the \nOAU. That is why the Government of Sierra Leone, \nwhich only recently had the exacting but \nrewarding task of serving as Chairman of the OAU \nAssembly of Heads of State and Government, \nbelieves that through patient and con\u00acstructive \ndialogue and respect for the rights and \nposi\u00actions of the parties to the Western Sahara \nquestion, coupled with the determination of every \nAfrican country, we can and should make the OAU \nfunctional again.\n147.\tIn that connection, Mr. Siaka Stevens, \nPresident of the Republic of Sierra Leone, \nrecently addressed certain modest proposals to \nthe current Chairman of the OAU Assembly, \nPresident Daniel Arap Moi of the Republic of \nKenya, in order to reactivate the orga\u00acnization \nso as to enable it to continue its work, \ncomplementary to that of the United Nations, of \nadvancing the frontiers of peace and co-operation.\n148.\tA review of the politic:' landscape of \nour world infuses the observer with nothing but \ndeep gloom and foreboding, accentuating the \nextent to which we have strayed from the path we \ncharted for ourselves some 37 years ago. \nPersistent violations of the basic principles of \ninternational relations have led to foreign \naggression and occupation, domination and \ninterference in the internal affairs of States. \nIndeed, never before in recorded history has the \nincidence of violence and the readiness to resort \nto violence been so high as it is in our time. We \nare witnesses to ugly scenes of political \nrivalry, needless violence, social injustice and \na steady, inexorable degradation of human values.\n149.\tIt was with shock and dismay that we \nreceived the news of the massacre in the refugee \ncamps of Shatila and Sabm in Lebanon of innocent \nand defenseless Palestinian men, women and \nchildren whose only crime was to hunger for a \nState of their own. These atrocities have rightly \noffended and revolted the con\u00acscience of \nright-thinking men and women throughout the world.\n150.\tThe state of affairs in the Middle East \nis a classic manifestation of that betrayal of \nfaith I referred to earlier and a further \ndemonstration of the extent to which we have \nstrayed from the goals we set ourselves \nsometimes. In 1947, it may be recalled, the \nAssembly adopted resolution 181 (II), positing \nthe partitioning of Palestine into both a Jewish \nentity and a Palestinian entity. That measure, \nthough it smacked of usurpation to the Arab \npopulation of Palestine at the time, was none the \nless a visionary and humanitarian act by the rest \nof the international community, under the shadow \nof the gruesome spectacle of Auschwitz, Treblinka \nand Dachau, to provide a homeland for an ancient, \ngifted and much-maligned people. Thus was the \nState of Israel created with the imprimatur of \nthe interna\u00actional community. Today, what do we \nsee? Arrogance, self-righteous defiance, even a \ndenial of faith and the human stirrings of the \nemotions that made Israel itself possible. The \nrest of the world is not against the State and \npeople of Israel, but against the obdurate, \ninflex\u00acible, short-sighted and misguided policies \nof the present Israeli leadership.\n151.\tThe present Israeli authorities, against \nmassive international public opinion, have \ncontinued on their dangerous course of presenting \nthe world with various faits accomplis\u2014with the \nannexation of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights and \nthe extension of Israeli settle\u00acments on the West \nBank and the Gaza Strip. Those are measures which \nthe Government of Sierra Leone totally rejects; I \nreiterate its condemnation.\n152.\tRecent activities, by way of proposals to \nfind a solution to the Middle East problem, will \nbe enriched, be more acceptable and prove \nenduring if they are particularly faithful to the \nspirit of resolution 181 (II): namely, the need \nto have in Palestine both an Israeli State and a \nState for the Palestinians, both together, with \nother States in the area, living in peace and \nsecurity. It is in that spirit that we welcome \nthe recent proposals by Arab leaders at the \nTwelfth Arab Summit Conference in Fez.\n153.\tThere is no magic formula for a solution \nto the Middle East problem; this, we submit, is \nthe key to the problem, and a solution is not so \nimpossible to achieve. AH that is required is \nvision, courage and flexibility on the part of \nIsrael, for Israel cannot claim the right to live \nand deny that right to the Palestinians.\n154.\tWe take this opportunity to proffer to \nthe Government and people of Lebanon our deep \nsympathy on the loss of lives and destruction to \nproperty it has been their lot to endure through \nhistorical and geographical circumstances, \nresulting directly from the lack of a \nsatisfactory settlement to the Palestinian \nproblem. And while we wish the new Government of \nLebanon well, in the hope that it will \nconsolidate the national unity of that country, \nwe want to emphasize the necessity to preserve \nand observe the independence, sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of Lebanon\u2014and this applies \nparticularly to Israel\u2014 and to reiterate our \nrejection and condemnation of Israel's recent \nactivities in Lebanon, especially in Beirut.\n155.\tStill on the subject of the Middle East, \nthe situation in the Gulf continues to give cause \nfor con\u00accern. The Iranian-Iraqi conflict has \nintensified since the last session of the \nAssembly. We have witnessed another massive \noffensive recently by both parties to the \nconflict, in the mistaken belief that one side \ncan impose its will by force of arms on the \nother. We renew our call on both parties to \nharken to the summons of peace by the \ninternational community, in various forums, and \nto arrive at a lasting soluhon to their problems.\n156.\tA return to normalcy is yet to be \nachieved in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. This is \nbecause respect for and observance of the \nprinciples and purposes of the Organization are \nstill to be achieved. We are con\u00accerned over the \ninhuman conditions prevailing in those countries, \nresulting in the exodus of peaceful citizens to \nneighbouring States to seek refuge, a situation \nthat has created in its wake, enormous social and \neconomic problems for those countries. We \nreiterate cur belief that it is the \nimprescriptible right of the people of Afghanistan \nand Kampuchea to work out their own destinies \nwithout let or hindrance by foreign inter\u00acvention \nor domination.\n157.\tMy Government is concerned about the \nproblem of divided nations, for we believe that a \npeople can only realize its fullest potential in \nunity and peace. It is in that spirit, therefore, \nthat the Government of Sierra Leone looks forward \nto the resumption of nego\u00actiations aimed at a \npeaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. \nFor we believe that in unity the valiant and \nhistoric people of the Korean peninsula will have \ngreater contributions to make to our world in the \nsearch for solutions to our problems.\n158.\tIn the same vein, we hope that now that \nthe intercommunal talks on Cyprus have resumed, \nand at an accelerated pace, there will soon \nemerge a formula for peace acceptable to both \nsides and in consonance with the territorial \nintegrity and independence of Cyprus. We urge all \nthose who can contribute to helping this process \nto do whatever they can to ensure its progress.\n159.\tEven as we talk about the problems of \ndivided nations, we are still confronted with \npeoples yearning to be free. A particular \nresponsibility of the Organi\u00aczation in this \nregard is the accession of the people and \nTerritory of Namibia to independence. When the \nSecurity Council adopted resolution 435 (1978), \nwe thought that we were on the eve of Namibia's \ninde\u00acpendence; but today, four years later, the \nprocess seems to be caught in the welter of \nnegotiations that quite frankly do not have \nanything to do with the problem. The linkage of \nthe presence of Cuban troops in Angola to the \nissue of Namibia's independence is, in our view, \nextraneous and quite unrelated to the issue of \nself-determination for the Territory of Namibia \nand the cessation of South Africa's illegal \noccupa\u00action thereof. This is all the more evident \nwhen it is recalled that almost from its \ninception the United Nations has been concerned \nabout the fate of the Terri\u00actory of Namibia, even \nlong before Angola's indepen\u00acdence and well \nbefore the advent of Cuban troops therein.\n160.\tRegrettably, the process of Namibia's \naccession to independence is, at one turn or the \nother, attended by delay, vacillation, \nsubterfuge, and sometimes even plain double talk. \nIt is the view of the Government of Sierra Leone \nthat Security Council resolution 435 (1978) \nremains the sole basis for the accession of \nNamibia to independence. Therefore, to bring in \nthe question of the presence of foreign troops in \nneigh\u00acbouring territories is to us but a further \nbetrayal of the goals which the authors of \nresolution 435 (1978) themselves postulated in \nthe highest organ of the Organization.\n161.\tThis is also, sadly, a further \nmanifestation of the departure from the goals we \nset ourselves which often compounds the problems \nof our world. Namibia must be free. We therefore \nwant to take this oppor\u00actunity to urge all States \nMembers of the United Nations, especially the \nauthors of resolution 435 (1978), to help us and \nthemselves keep faith with our common pledge to \nensure that Namibia achieves inde\u00acpendence \nwithout further delay. Enough is enough.\n162.\tIn South Africa itself the racist \nPretoria regime pursues with reckless abandon its \npolicy of disregard for the revulsion felt by the \nrest of the international community at the \nabomination that is apartheid. The black majority \nof the inhabitants of that unhappy country \ncontinue to be denied in the daily round of their \nlives their very essence and dignity as human \nbeings, simply on the score of the pigmentation \nof their skin. We have heard about recent moves \neven by the very practitioners and proponents of \nto temper its rigors and harshness. But the \nabsurdity of the exercise explains its lukewarm \nreception, even by its supposed beneficiaries. I \nrefer here to the so- called constitutional \nproposals for power-sharing by Indians and \nso-called Coloureds in a presidential council is \na system which represents the negation of man's \nhumanity and cannot be modified but must be \nwholly extirpated. In defiance of world public \nopinion, the Pretoria regime continues to constitute \na threat to international peace and security. \nToday we stand helpless while the independent \nneigh\u00acbouring States fall victim to South \nAfrica's predatory activities, acts of \naggression, sabotage and destabilization.\n163.\tMoreover, in furtherance of these \ndespicable policies, South Africa resorts to \nbrutal methods of political assassination, even \nagainst victims who take refuge from it in \nneighbouring countries.\n164.\tSuch activities cannot be allowed to go \non unchallenged and unchecked. We therefore call \nfor the comprehensive application of the \nprovisions of Chap\u00acter VII of the Charter, to \nremove the threat to interna\u00actional peace and \nsecurity that South Africa represents. For, \nwithout doubt, to allow South Africa to continue \nwith abandon its depredations represents a \nfurther betrayal of that collective pledge we \nmade to \\\"reaffirm faith in fundamental human \nrights, in the dignity and worth of the human \nperson, in the equal rights of men and women\\\".\n165.\tEven as the world is faced with a \ndepressing and deteriorating political climate, \nwe can draw no comfort from the burning economic \nproblems which all coun\u00actries, developed and \ndeveloping, are going through. It is clear that \nthe developing countries, by virtue of the \nfragility of their economic structures, have had \nto contend to a more serious degree with the \ndevastating and far-reaching effects of global \neconomic tremors. Evidence of this has come out \nwith forceful emphasis and candor in successive \nreports on the current world economic situation \nby development and finan\u00accial institutions.\n166.\tFor most, if not all developing \ncountries, the prevailing economic circumstances \ncan be referred to as a nightmare from which they \ncannot escape without immediate substantial \nassistance. Stagnant, and in some cases \ndeclining, economic growth, low productivity, \npoor and diminishing returns for in\u00accreasing \nexport of their raw materials, high interest \nrates, diminishing financial flows from bilateral \nand multilateral sources, intolerable debt \nburdens running at some $600 billion and the cost \nof servicing this burden are fetters on an \neconomic wheel that is gradually grinding to a \nhalt in the third world, con\u00acdemning thereby two \nthirds of our world to a life of misery and \nsqualor.\n167.\tLet it be recalled that one of the \npurposes and principles of the United Nations is \nthat it should be a centre for the harmonization \nof the actions of nations in the achievement of \ninternational co-operation for the solution of \nvarious problems, particularly of an economic \nnature. This explains the relentless efforts \nwithin the halls and organs of the Organization \nto ensure the establishment of a new \ninternational eco\u00acnomic order.\n168.\tWhen, three years ago, by General \nAssembly resolution 34/138, it was decided to \nlaunch the global round of negotiations, high \nhopes and expectations were aroused in the \nmajority of mankind that at last the real \nproblems of the world in such crucial areas as \nmoney and finance, trade and development and \nnatural resources and energy were about to be \ngrappled with in a meaningful and constructive \nmanner and within a more comprehensive framework \nof mutual interests, underscoring the aspirations \nof both rich and poor nations.\n169.\tUnfortunately, those hopes and \nexpectations have so far not been realized, even \nthough at the International Meeting on \nCo-operation and Develop\u00acment at Cancun last year \ncommitments were made at the highest political \nlevel by a cross-section of the international \ncommunity. We wish to emphasize here and now our \nearnest belief that it is time that the global \nnegotiations were got under way.\n170.\tWe appeal to and urge all countries not \nto allow short-term and ephemeral national \ninterests to spoil the chances of these global \nnegotiations. My coun\u00actry, for its part, is ready \nand willing to do everything in its power to \npromote understanding and co-operation between \nall nations, North and South, East and West, in \norder to contribute towards the establishment of \na new and just international economic order from \nwhich all countries, developed and developing, will \nassuredly stand to benefit.\n171.\tAs the sixth session of UNCTAD \napproaches, ft is our earnest hope that Member \nStates will work towards conducting meaningful \nexchanges in that forum and the adoption of \neffective decisions that will enhance our \ncollective well-being. We have no doubt that the \nagenda which has been adopted will render such \ndiscourse possible.\n172.\tOn behalf of the delegation of Sierra \nLeone I take this opportunity to thank the \nGovernment and people of the Socialist Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia for generously agreeing to \nhost that session.\n173.\tWith regard to the forthcoming \nministerial ses\u00acsion of GATT, it is my \ndelegation's firm belief that that organization \ncan serve as an effective instrument of economic \nadvancements and as a catalyst for interna\u00actional \ntrade, particularly in the developing countries. \nWe therefore hope that the forthcoming session \nwill give positive consideration to such topical \nissues as protectionism and structural \nadjustment, preferential trade treatment and \ntrade in commodities, with the aim of finding \nmore acceptable and just solutions to these \nproblems. My country will endeavor to play its \nown part in this respect.\n174.\tOne of the most urgent problems requiring \nsolution, particularly in Africa, is related to \nthe produc\u00action of adequate, secure and sustained \nfood supplies for that continent's growing \npopulation and the development of agriculture in \ngeneral. It is significant that, while the world \nfood situation is generally said to have taken a \nturn for the better, the only exception in this \nhappy trend is Africa. No one can deny the will \nand readiness of all African countries to find \nsolu\u00actions to their food and agricultural \ndifficulties. However, with the greatest number \nof poor and least developed countries, Africa \ncannot succeed in doing this alone without \nsufficient aid from the international community. \nWith an annual population growth estimated at 2.5 \nper cent, a decline in food production of 1.2 per \ncent in the 1970s and an even worse projec\u00action \nfor the 1980s, Africa and the international \ncom\u00acmunity will be required to mobilize \ntremendous resources in order to arrive at \nsolutions commensurate with the seriousness of \nthe issue and the magnitude of the task.\n175.\tOne common denominator in all the \neconomic issues I have highlighted is the need to \ntranslate our avowed commitment to the principles \nof interna\u00actional co-operation and development \ninto practical measures to make such co-operation \nmeaningful and productive. In this connection, my \nGovernment has noted with considerable \ndisappointment the downward trend in the flow of \nfinancial resources, both bilateral and \nmultilateral, particularly over the last few \nyears, to development agencies such as the World \nBank and UNDP.\n176.\tThis tendency weakens the effectiveness \nof those bodies, on which many developing \ncountries depend for supplementary resources in \ntheir struggle for survival and social and \neconomic progress. Further, it puts in doubt the \nwell-accepted norm of friendly multilateral \nco-operation, the linchpin of which has, over the \nyears, been the provision of financial grants and \nconcessionary loans by the developed to the \ndeveloping countries, not out of charity but out \nof enlightened self-interest, based on our \ninterde\u00acpendence.\nt44\n177.\tThe role which agencies like UNDP, FAO, \nthe International Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment and the World Bank, to name but a \nfew, are playing in the fight against poverty, \nmalnutrition, ignorance and the omnibus problems \nof underdevelopment, cannot be over-emphasized. \nIt therefore behoves all nations, big and small, \nin a position to do so to reawaken in themselves \nthat spirit of internationalism which for a long \ntime characterized the ideals of international \nco\u00acoperation and adopt measures that will \nstrengthen the fabric of United Nations agencies \nfor co-operation for development, and at the same \ntime give true meaning to the noble concept of \nfriendly relations among nations.\n178.\tMy delegation considers it appropriate to \nhigh\u00aclight once again the crucial role which we \nbelieve multilateral financial institutions such \nas the Interna\u00actional Monetary Fund [IMF] and the \nWorld Bank and their affiliated agencies can play \nin the establish\u00acment of social justice and \ninternational peace and security, given the right \nkind of understanding and appreciation of all the \nissues at stake in their bid to help developing \ncountries.\n179.\tHowever, it seems somewhat unreasonable \nto suggest that the only way to cure the ills of \ndeveloping nations, which by nature and often \nbecause of factors outside their control are \nweak, is to administer to them medicinal doses \nwhich have more debilitating and sometimes \ndestructive effects. It is therefore our candid \nhope that these institutions will continue to \nreview their policies and practices towards \ncountries which stand in need of their aid, with \nparticular reference to the individual \ncircumstances and situa\u00actions peculiar to these \ncountries.\n180.\tA review of the world economic situation \nwould not be complete without reference to some \nof the issues which are of immense importance for \nthe acceleration of growth, not only in the \ndeveloping countries but in the world as a whole. \nThe international community, including the \nspecialized agencies of the United Nations system \nand non governmental orga\u00acnizations, should be \nunrelenting in their search for practical \nsolutions in the fields of health, science and \ntechnology for development, the environment, \nindustrialization, new and renewable sources of \nenergy, population control, and development and \neconomic co-operation among developing countries.\n181.\tIt is gratifying to note that all these \nquestions appear as items on the agenda of this \nsession. We hope that they will be attended by \nfree, fair and frank exchanges in the interest of \nrestructuring and revi\u00actalizing the global \neconomy to our collective benefit.\n182.\tAt the 10th meeting of the thirty-sixth \nsession I acknowledged that some time ago the \nAssembly had, with wisdom, recognized the need to \ngive par\u00acticular attention to the most \neconomically dis\u00acadvantaged States in the \ninternational community, which have come to be \nknown euphemistically as the least-developed \ncountries. The prospects of these States, even in \nthe midst of booming prosperity in other parts of \nthe world, became at best uncertain and their \nvery survival precarious. It is most depressing \nand self-defeating to acknowledge that the number \nof such States continues to increase, whatever \nthe criteria applied. I am forced to report that \nin Sierra Leone our economic situation has \nworsened, the purchasing power of our exports has \nprogressively diminished and there has been, in \nreal terms, a reversal against us in both the \nterms and the balance of our trade with our \ntrading partners. All this made it necessary for \nthe Economic and Social Council to take a long \nhard look at cur situation and, in its resolution \n1982/41, to recommend that Sierra Leone be \nclassified as a least-developed country. I want \nto take this opportunity here, if I may, to \ncommend the Council's recommendation for approval \nat the appropriate time, and to express the hope \nthat, given the resilience of the Sierra Leonean \npeople, coupled with the concerted efforts of \ntheir Government and with the co-operation of the \ninternational community, this classification may \nbe only temporary.\n183.\tAfter some eight years of negotiations, \nwe note with satisfaction that the Third United \nNations Con-ference on the Law of the Sea will it \nis hoped, be brought safe home to harbor this \nyear with the meeting of plenipotentiaries to \nsign the Convention on the Law of the Sea.^ This \ndocument, which has been painstakingly \nnegotiated, represents a new order for the oceans \nand reassuringly demonstrates that with \nco-operation and goodwill the United Nations can \nand, indeed, should be the centre for harmonizing \nthe actions of nations in the rationalization of \nthe rules and procedures that should govern the \nmanagement, exploitation and use not only of this \nimportant aspect of our environment, but of other \nfacets of our lives as well.\n184.\tThe successful completion of this venture has not \nonly enhanced the reality of international \nco-operation, but it should also\u2014and rightly \nso\u2014advance the prospects for global co-operation \nin other vital areas of our one world. It is in \nthis spirit that we would reiterate our appeal to \nthe Government of the United States to stay with \nthe rest of the international com\u00acmunity and to \napprove this important instrument.\n185.\tIn the face of the unhappy world \npolitical and economic situation in which we find \nourselves today, all nations\u2014large and small, \nrich and poor\u2014are indissolubly linked. It is now \ntherefore more pressing than ever before that we \nanswer the summons to international peace and \nco-operation in its various aspects. In this \nventure, all the nations of the world should \nreaffirm their resolve to adhere to the spirit \nand essence of the United Nations. When all is \nsaid and done, the United Nations symbolizes \nmankind's efforts at pursuing a better world \norder. The path to the attainment of that goal \nhas often been rugged, tedious and sometimes \nalmost impassable. Never-theless, mankind has \nbeen persistent in its endeavors to pursue \nundaunted, within this edifice, its quest for \npeace, security and economic well-being. For we \nrealize that it is only within the United Nations \nthat we all, together, can hope to achieve a \npeaceful and affluent world. For its part, the \nGovernment of Sierra Leone, here and now, pledges \nitself anew to uphold the principles and \nobjectives of the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my privilege to extend to Mr. Hollai the \nwarm congratulations of the delegation of Burma \non his unanimous election to his high office and \nto assure him of our support and co-operation in \nthe discharge of his responsibilities. We are \nmost fortunate in having the advantage of his \nwisdom and expended, and we are confident that he \nwill guide the deliberations of the Assembly with \nthe tenacity and resourcefulness which the \nnumerous tasks before us require. Next we wish to \nexpress our deep appreciation to the former \nPresident, Mr.  Kittani, for the distinguished \nmanner in which he conducted the proceedings of \nthe last session of the Assembly and his vigorous \nefforts to bring it to a successful conclusion.\n\n165.\tThe international climate in which the \nAssembly is meeting is rife with tensions and \nacute world problems. From whatever angle the \npresent world situation is viewed, there is no \ndenying that we are facing a time of serious \nupheavals in almost all spheres of international \nrelations. The disconcerting features are evident \nin the political overtones of the declining trend \nand the rising tensions in great-Power relations; \nin the economic overtones of a deepening world \nrecession, with conflicting interests ensuing \namong nations in racial cleavage and the revival \nof old historical quarrels in regional \nrelationships; and the increasing acts of \nterrorism afflicting human life and international \norder. Taken together, these adverse \nmanifestations potentially endanger international \npeace, stability and security.\n\n166.\tThe bewildering complexity of issues \nburdening the world of today are mirrored in the \nvariety of agenda items to which the Assembly \nwill direct itself. Some of the most important \nissues have been with us for many years and have \nbecome aggravated with the passage of time. The \nUnited Nations today faces far more intractable \nchallenges than could ever have been foreseen at \nthe time of its founding. The concomitant \nincrease in the number of conferences\u2022, bodies \nand institutions is also straining the human and \nfinancial capacity of the Organization. The \ndilemma besetting the Assembly is how to \nreconcile the ever widening scope of activities \nand responses demanded of the Organization with \nan annual budget that must be kept within the \nfinancial limits of what the membership as a \nwhole can reasonably be expected to accept and to \nbear.\n\n167. The delegation of Burma does not propose to \ndwell at length on the host of issues before the \nGeneral Assembly at its thirty-seventh session. \nWe shall focus our attention on the principal \npolitical and economic questions which we \nconsider to be the current realities of the \nhighly difficult and dangerous world situation in \nwhich we live.\n\n168. The international quest for disarmament is \nstill an unfulfilled aspiration of the world \ncommunity. Paradoxically, while there is now a \nswelling international drive for disarmament, the \narms race has surged ahead on a scale unknown \nbefore, increasing the already enormous outlays \nfor destructive purposes. Whatever the \ncircumstances, the crucial problem of how to \nbring about disarmament remains. To our \nunderstanding, there are only two ways of \nachieving disarmament-by mutual agreement or by \nunilateral action. But the present policy of \npositions of strength and its reliance on \nsuperior destructive power as the ultimate \ndeciding factor constitutes a psychological \nroad-block to both processes. We say this because \nif one adversary decides to arm heavily the other \nwill invariably do likewise. Thus weapons \nthemselves add to fear and mistrust and become \nthe greatest obstacle to any headway on \ndisarmament and arms control.\n\n169.\tAll  this leads one  to conclude  that \nthere  are dim prospects of success for agreement \nunless a suit-able atmosphere of confidence and \ntrust can be nurtured to bring about enough \nmutual understanding to enable both sides to make \nthe requisite concessions and compromises.\n\n170. The central arms-control doctrine being \nexercised today is that of stabilized nuclear \ndeterrence, where each side refrains from attack \nfor fear of mutual annihilation. Deterrence has \nits use thus far prevented the outbreak of \nanother world war. However, stabilized deterrence \nwill not stop the arms race. Mutual effort to \nmaintain deterrence leads to a steady spread of \nnuclear weapons. International tension and fear \nremain high without the prospect of disarmament.\n\n171. Clearly, this is not compatible with the \nuniversal view that there is an urgent need to \nfind a solution to the dilemma of nuclear \nweapons. Unless things take a more sensible turn, \nit seems that man is doomed to live in harrowing \nuncertainty as to what the future will bring. \nThus, the status quo is not only not good enough. \nit cannot in fact endure, for the human system \ncannot for long put up with the persistent, \nconstant pressure which the status quo imposes \nupon it.\n\n172. It is self-evident to all that no one can \nexpect to win the arms race. As we see it, the \nonly sensible recourse for those engaged in that \nperilous venture is to call for a halt and decide \nto agree on a sequence of processes leading to \nreduction of their nuclear arsenals. In order to \nmitigate the danger of a nuclear war erupting, \neither by miscalculation or by accident. we hope \nthat the two leading nuclear Powers will sustain \nthe recent resumption of their bilateral con(acts \non strategic nuclear arms and assert sufficient \npolitical wi1l to ensure the success of their \ndiscussions. Divergences may be very sharp at \npresent, but there can be no progress anywhere on \nthe arms control front until the two leading \nnuclear Powers agree on what to do about their \nstrategic arms.\n\n173. As rapidly as the situation permits, those \nbearing the main responsibility for the arms race \nmust begin the critical transition from \ndeterrence to disarmament, for it soon may be \nbeyond the reach of efforts to initiate the \nprocess. The main ground for advocating this is \nthat, ultimately, it offers the only hope of the \ncontinuance of human survival.\n\n174.\tDevelopments in the Middle East this year \ntook a dramatic turn for the worse. Tension \nsharpened and escalated fighting led to direct \nmilitary intervention in Lebanon. The policy and \npractice of sending a punitive expedition of such \nformidable strength can only be deplored. The \naction constitutes a flagrant violation of the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon \nand is yet another example of the use and abuse \nof force. It is abundantly clear that such \nactions are completely at variance with the norms \nof conduct in international relations and cannot \naugur well for the future. The position of the \ndelegation of Burma remains one of serious \nconcern.\n\n175.\tNobody who has followed the situation in \nLebanon could fail to be shaken by the \nremorseless violence, the heavy toll in human \nlives and the suffering that resulted from the \nrecent conflict in that country. The general \ncontours of the Middle East situation may have \nchanged somewhat, but that does not alter the \nfact that there is an urgent need for an overall \nsettlement in the region. It is equally clear \nthat the prospects for peace in the Middle East \nare not likely to become brighter until the \nPalestinian question is resolved to the \nsatisfaction of all concerned. It accounts for \nvirtually all the problems of the Middle East and \nwill remain a weight on the world's con-science.\n\n176.\tAt this point, I should like to reiterate \nthe support of the delegation of Burma for the \nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political \nindependence of Lebanon within its \ninternationally recognized boundaries and for the \nfull implementation of all Security Council \nresolutions in that regard.\n\n177.\tAs we see it, the two problems-that of \nthe Middle East and that of Palestine-are \ninextricably intertwined. Consequently, any \nsearch for a political settlement must \nnecessarily encompass both questions, rather than \ndealing with one to the neglect of the other. \nThis means that only the method of seeking a \ncomprehensive solution with the full association \nof all interested parties can lead to the \npossibility of achieving a durable peace in the \nMiddle East.\n\n178.\tThe Assembly has been struggling with the \nMiddle East and Palestinian questions for many, \nmany years. The main obstacle to the resolution \nof the many issues involved is the extreme \nantagonism of the parties concerned and the \nrefusal of either party-Israel or the \nPalestinians-to recognize each other's existence \nand to acknowledge the mutual right to statehood. \nThis is making very difficult any constructive \nand fruitful negotiations towards a solution that \nwould be in the interest of all parties \nconcerned, for lasting peace in the Middle East. \nThe positions of the parties to the conflict \nbeing what they are at present-implacable \nhostility on the one side and impetuous \nbelligerence on the other there are few signs of \nany willingness by either side to be the first to \nbreak the impasse. We take the view that there is \nno option but for the parties to coexist. That \ncannot happen without a change of heart on the \npart of all those at present involved.\n\n179.\tThe delegation of Burma does not \nunder-estimate the highly emotional and complex \npolitical questions of the Middle East. None the \nless, we are of the view that this long-standing \nconflict cannot be settled by force, but only by \nnegotiations. Realism demands that the parties to \nthe conflict learn to put up with each other, for \nthere is no other way to make relations more \nhumane, more peaceful and more secure. The road \nof negotiations may be a long and tedious one. \nGiven the will, however, there is no problem in \nthe world, no matter how intractable, which \ncannot be solved by negotiations and without loss \nof honour by either side.\n\n180.\tThe world community became seized of the \nissues of Kampuchea and Afghanistan at the \nbeginning of the 1980s. The unresolved situations \nin both countries continue to undermine the \ndevelopment of good-neighbourly and co-operative \nrelations in their respective re2ions.\n\n181.\tThe delegation of Burma has had occasion \nat previous sessions of the General Assembly to \nvoice its regret and deep concern over the \noccurrence of armed intervention, which obviously \ncannot be justified or condoned, in both \nsituations. Our approach to both situations and \nto their solution is based on our firm and \nconsistent support for the principles of\n\nthe Charter of the United Nations, which upholds \nin unequivocal terms respect for the sovereignty, \nterritorial integrity and political independence \nof States as cardinal principles to be \nscrupulously observed in international relations \namong States. The Charter outlaws the threat or \nuse of force in inter-national relations in any \nmanner inconsistent with the purposes of the \nUnited Nations. It strictly enjoins all States to \nsettle their international disputes by peaceful \nmeans and to refrain from intervening in any \nmanner whatsoever in matters within the \njuris-diction of any State.\n\n\n182.\tBurma believes that only scrupulous \nrespect for those principles by all States, both \nin word and deed, would make it possible to \npromote the progressive establishment of and \nuniversal respect for the rule of law.\n\n183.\tAny violation of those principles, \ndirectly or indirectly, in whatever guise or \nunder whatever pretext, deals a grievous blow to \nmankind's hope for a peaceful and just world \norder. By the same token, whenever and wherever a \nPower-big or small-resorts to armed force in \ncontravention of those principles, the inevitable \nresult is their serious weakening and erosion, \ncreating conditions with far-reaching \nimplications which are of concern to all \ncountries everywhere.\n\n184. It was in this spirit that the delegation of \nBurma gave its support to the resolutions of the \nGeneral Assembly which called for the withdrawal \n'or' 'all foreign troops from Kampuchea and \nAfghanistan and for\\\" strict observance by outside \nPowers of the principles of non-interference and \nnon-intervention. All those conditions are \nnecessary to enable the peoples of Kampuchea and \nAfghanistan freely to exercise their will and \ndetermine their own destiny.\n\n185.\tAs the internal and external \ncircumstances in Kampuchea and Afghanistan \ndevelop, we hope that the leaders of those \ncountries will be able to master their conflicts \nand to find a peaceful way to a political \nsolution and national reconciliation.\n\n186.\tThe  independence  of  Namibia, \nenvisaged  in Security Council resolution .435 \n.(1978), is long over-due. Since the United \nNations plan embodied in the resolution had the \nacceptance, in principle, of all parties to the \ndispute, we believed that Namibia's struggle for \nfreedom had entered its final stage. But over the \nfollowing years the pathway to Namibia's \nindependence meandered between hope and \nfrustration, the principal obstacle being South \nAfrica's attitude of intransigence. Meanwhile, \nSouth Africa's escalation of military activities \nagainst the front-line States has only added to \nthe political impasse and the worsening situation \nin southern Africa. The latest reports on \ncontinuing efforts at negotiations indicate that \nthere are somewhat improved prospects for a \nNamibian settlement. We hope that that \nimprovement will continue and not break down as \nin the past. Until a definite date is fixed for \nthe implementation\n\nof resolution 435 (1978) the outlook for \nNamibia's independence will continue to remain \nhighly uncertain.\n\n181. The delegation of Burma reaffirms its \nsupport for the Namibian people's inalienable \nright to freedom, independence and territorial \nintegrity, including Walvls Bay, under the \nleadership of SWAPO. We look for-ward to the \nimplementation at the earliest opportunity of the \nUnited Nations plan granting Namibian \nindependence.\n\n188. We welcome the adoption by the Third United \nNations Conference on the Law\u2022 of the Sea of the \nUnited Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea6 \nwhich establishes an international regime on an \naspects of the uses of the sea. The major portion \nof the rules have long been applied in practice \nas norms of customary law and have acquired full \nvalidity with the new Convention. It is a package \narrived at by carefully balanced and painful \ncompromises, over nine years of hard work and \nhighly complex negotiations, in order to achieve \nwide acceptance. To allow it to go overboard \nwould mean that no order would prevail on the \nseas and that a universally acceptable \nmodification would never again be attainable.\n\n189. International relations as a whole are \nexacerbated as a result of the prolonged crisis \nin the world economy. The forecasts made by the \nprimary financial and trade organizations of the \nworld are not at all encouraging. They foretell \nan ever widening gap between rich and poor \nnations resulting from the slackening of economic \ngrowth, lessening cash aid flows for development, \ndeclining world trade resulting from \nprotectionism, and prolonged monetary \ninstability. Both inflation and unemployment have \nbecome priority issues to be grappled with before \nthe world can be pulled out of the present \ncrisis. In facing up the situation the best \nintentions and the most dedicated efforts of us \ncan be frustrated if we do not succeed in \novercoming these economic setbacks afflicting the \nworld economy.\n\n190. The consequences of the disarray\\\" in the \nWorld economy are being felt in all sectors of \ninternational economic life. No country is immune \nfrom their disruptive effects. The impact upon \nthe developed countries has taken the form of \nslower growth, widening payments deficits and \nrising inflation and unemployment rates. These \ncountries are tending increasingly to solve their \nproblems by way of protectionism, reducing their \npayments deficits and tightening money policies \nto arrest inflation. We would hope that, in \nputting their economies in order, the developed \ncountries would d\\l so with as little harm to the \ndeveloping countries as possible. .\n\n191.\tApart from encountering the same \nproblems, the developing countries are  faced \nwith worsening terms of trade, declining demand \nfor primary commodities and mounting debt burdens \ncaused by rising interest rates.\n\n192.\tAll of this indicates that there is a \ncomplex interplay of economic forces influencing \nboth developed and developing countries. The \nconclusion would be that the problems of the \nworld economy and of the international economic \nrelations are common problems which require joint \naction by developed and developing countries. \nClearly, the situation calls for an untiring \neffort to work out a basis of co-operation. \nReconciling the conflicting needs and desires of \nthe minority, developed countries, and the \nmajority, developing countries, will also call \nfor much tolerance and good will. As we see it, \nthere is no other way. In the con-temporary world \neconomic development has become a matter for \ninternational co-operation and this requires a \nmeeting of minds between countries in all stages \nof development.\n\n193. Another requirement is that of solvil1g \ncertain structural discrepancies in the world \neconomy. so that it can result in a more rational \nand equitable economic system than the present \none. It is a path we had hoped could be begun \nwith the launching of global negotiations, to put \nrelations between developed and developing \ncountries on anew, constructive foundation that \nwould be realistic, equitable and lasting. That \nthis has not yet taken place is a matter of \nconsider-able disappointment for the developing \nworld. Such a process could only begin if all \nsides could be influenced to adopt a less rigid \nattitude and to come together in a spirit of \nmutual need and mutual responsibility.\n\n194. The delegation of Burma believes that the \npath of confrontation) or negotiations rooted in \nany adversary psychosis, cannot lead us out of \nthe present uncertainty and impasse. \nStatesmanship of the highest order, good will, \nreasonableness;\\\" and, above \u2022an., realism on all \nsides are required for the building of bridges \ntowards global negotiations. The world's economic \nproblems are of a structural nature and can, \ntherefore, only be resolved within the entirety \nof international economic relations.\n\n195. We make these comments simply by way of \nemphasizing what seem to us to be the salient \nfeatures of the current world situation and its \nproblems. There is no doubt that international \nrelations in their-entirety are in deep crisis.\\\" \nWe express the hope that this session will prove \nfruitful and will signify an important step \ntowards forward movement on many of the issues \nwhich have been at a standstill. The bounden duty \nof us all is to meet this challenge.\n"

        "file_text": "In this last quarter of the twentieth century, \nthe world is beset by upheavals which bode no \ngood. We are seeing a major deployment of arms, \nto such an extent that a wise man of Africa \nrightly said that today the weapons of death are \ngreater than those employed to ensure the \nsurvival of humanity. Palestinian and Lebanese \npeoples have been massacred by Israel, and the \nracist\tregime in South Africa constitutes a \ncontinuing challenge to humanity at large, \ncommitting ever-increasing acts of arrogance and \ndestruction against the front-line States. One's \nthoughts turn naturally to this painful question \nfor the universal conscience: is there still hope \nof speaking of peace in a world of hatred?\n180.\tAs you are aware, Sir, you have acceded \nto the post of President of the thirty-seventh \nsession of the Assembly at a critical moment for \nhumanity. The United Nations was created to \nmaintain and strengthen world peace, but today \nthat peace is threatened more than ever. Thus we \nfully understand the complexity of your task. \nYour country, Hungary, has more than once \nexperienced the complexity of events; therefore \nwe are confident that your out-standing qualities \nas a seasoned diplomat, combined with your \nexperience, drawn from the age-old history of \nyour country, are assets that will enable you to \nguide our work, by calming passions, and creating \nthe calm atmosphere essential to our \ndeliberations. It is therefore, my agreeable duty \nto extend to you, both in my personal capacity \nand on behalf of the delegation of Togo, my \nheartfelt congratulations on your election to the \npresidency of the thirty-seventh session of the \nAssembly.\n181.\tYour predecessor, Mr. President, did not \nhave an easy task. With rare distinction, he rose \nabove the general confusion and took a high \nstance in presiding over the deliberations, both \nthose of the thirty-sixth session and those of \nthe special session held during the course of his \nmandate. We extend to him our heartfelt \ncongratulations.\n182.\tWe have all benefited from the unflagging \nconcern of the Secretary-General, who, throughout \nalmost a year in office, has been an able \nhelmsman, a year in which our ship has crossed \nsome storm- tossed seas. In his report he \nhighlighted with characteristic sincerity the \ncauses of those storms which threatened the \nexistence of our States and our Organization. He \ndeserves all our congratulations and thanks.\n183.\tThe key word which describes the \ninternational political situation this year is \n\\\"storm\\\". Can we still talk of peace when daily \nlife is beset by war, assassination, kidnapping \nand persecution? One cannot ask that question \nwithout anguish, without despairing of the future \nfor peace in the world.\n184.\tWithout being an evangelist, one has a \nclear impression that most of the conditions \nlisted in the Apocalypse are now present. Not a \nday goes by without the teleprinters clattering \nout dispatches announcing the cold-blooded murder \nof innocent bystanders, or the explosion of a \nbomb which has destroyed apartment buildings at \ndawn while everyone was asleep or raids by racist \nPowers to destroy the already fragile economic \ninfrastructures of developing countries, or the \noutbreak of what is in fact war in this or that \ncountry; the list is very long.\n185.\tInvariably we return to the same \nquestion: should we despair of the world at this \ntumultuous end of the twentieth century? In other \nwords, is the peace so necessary to the union and \nsolidarity of peoples still possible? An \nexamination of the various crises which afflict \nthe world show that it is important to ask \nourselves that agonizing question.\n186.\tAt the international level, the world \neconomic crisis has reached a stage where an \nexplosion is possible at any moment. The \ndeveloping countries, emerging from the dark \nperiod of decolonization, started on bold \nprogrammes to revitalize their eco-nomies; but \nthen came the energy crisis; we still have the \naberrant system of the unequal trade; we still \nhave the absurd increase of interest rates \nleading to the constant growth of the \nindebtedness of the poor countries to others; \nthen there came the problem of the continual rise \nof the dollar, so that all their debts calculated \nin that currency are now quintupled, if not \nworse. Thus the efforts that they undertook have \nbeen cancelled out before having had any effect \non their standard of living, on health, or on the \nlevel of education of their populations, which \nremain the most deprived in the world.\n187.\tEven in the industrialized countries, the \nsituation is no more encouraging. The crisis has \nreached unforeseen proportions. Factories have \nbeen closed and over 10 per cent of the \npopulation is unemployed,\n188.\tIn the face of such a crisis, unless the \nworld takes care we will have the bitter surprise \nof living through another 1929; that is to say, a \nworld crash which will hurl countries, all \ncountries, into a cataclysm leading to a system \nrejected by mankind, one possibly worse than \nnazism, which grew out of the 1929 crisis. Will \nthe rich come to their senses? For in such a \ncrisis none will be spared. Let us stop talking \nof aid to the third world as if it were manna. \nThe rich countries, as they realize the danger of \na generalized crisis, must now understand that a \nglobal policy towards the developing coun-tries \nshould be their main concern today. That global \npolicy must be to raise the prices of raw \nmaterials, to stop any deterioration in the terms \nof trade, to do away with protectionist barriers \nin order to promote the trade of the developing \ncountries and to enhance industrial redeployment \nand the transfer of technology, because there can \nbe no viable development without \nindustrialization. In ensuring an equitable \ndistribution of the riches produced by the labour \nof all humanity, the rich countries will \nguarantee their own survival. But the danger \nwould be great for all if the rich want to cling \nto that selfish policy of every man for himself \nwhich has produced poverty next door and a flood \nof poverty-stricken people which breeds criminals \nwhose main concern is certainly not to guarantee \ntranquillity and peace for other people.\n189.\tThe industrialized world possesses the \ntechnology, whereas the young developing \ncountries have substantial natural resources. The \ndeveloped countries must know that it is the \ncomplementarity of the technology of their \ncountries and the raw materials of the third \nworld that will produce the balance necessary for \npeace in the world. If the rich manage to \nunderstand the need for this co-operation, then \nwe may venture to talk of the possibilities of \npeace in the world at the end of the twentieth \ncentury.\n190.\tUnfortunately, some States continue to \nthink that complementarity is synonymous with the \nsubjugation of the poorest to the richest of the \nearth and do not hesitate to use force to violate \nthe independence and territorial integrity of \nother States and to flout their fundamental \nfreedoms, disregarding the essential principles \ngoverning relations among nations and causing \nsituations of tension, wars and destruction of \nhuman lives.\n191.\tThus the tragedies suffered by the \npeoples of the Middle East leave mankind \nperplexed and very often, in view of the \nabsurdity of the massacres perpetrated by Israel, \nwe have no traction because we do not understand. \nIndeed, about half a century ago, Hitler, on the \nbasis of nazism, decided to annihilate part of \nmankind, the Jewish people. The nations of the \nentire world, to a man, rose to prevent the \nholocaust. And the Organization, through an \nhistoric vote, decided quite rightly that the \nJewish people was entitled to a homeland, We fail \nto understand how today the State of Israel can \nrefuse a homeland to another people, the \nPalestinian people; we cannot understand today \nhow the Jewish people can have decided to \nannihilate part of mankind, the Palestinian \npeople. Today, Beirut has been transformed by the \nGovernment of Israel into a place of \nextermination which oddly brings to mind certain \ncamps where the Jewish people were literally \nmassacred. Has that Government already forgotten \nthe horrors of Oradour and the extermination \nperpetrated at Auschwitz? It is enough to cause \nthe human conscience to despair. There Ss a \ndouble' standard, as has been quite rightly said \nby a famous French writer: \\\"Depending on whether \nyou are powerful or poor, the verdict of the \ncourt will make you white or black.\\\" The most \nelementary ethics seem not to exist for certain \npeople.\n192.\tTogo, for its pact, in view of the \ntragedy of the Middle East, has always supported \nand continue; to support the principle of \nnegotiation, so that all peoples of the region \ncan have a homeland, the only condition for \nguaranteeing peace and stability in the area.\n193.\tFrom time to time Israel talks of \nnegotiation, but negotiation requires several \nparties. If the side facing you is destroyed, \nthen you will be the only one at the negotiating \ntable and there can no longer be a question of \nnegotiation.\n194.\tThere can be no possible explanation for \nthe Beirut massacres. The Israeli population \nitself no longer understands its political \nleaders. The thousands of people killed were \ncivilians, women, children and the elderly. It \ncannot even be said that those who were massacred \nwere combatants. The pretext of terrorism used by \nTel Aviv can no longer be taken seriously. \nNazism, in wanting to exterminate the Jewish \npeople, succeeded only in giving that people the \nonly weapon left to it: terrorism. Prime Minister \nBegin has considerable experience of that and he \nwill certainly remember it. Today, the massacres \ncarried out against the Palestinian people have \ncompelled that people to scatter to the four \ncomers of the Middle East. By thus forcing the \nPalestinian people into a Diaspora, does the \nGovernment of Israel not see that it alone is \ncreating the conditions which force the \nPalestinian people to use the only weapon left to \nit, one used by the Jewish people to gain a place \nunder the sun, namely the weapon of terrorism? It \nis regrettable that the experience of nazism did \nnot serve as a lesson. The mention of nazism \nreminds us of the concentration camps and the \ncremation ovens and we believe that the peoples \nwho subscribed to the Charter had once and for \nall repudiated violence and killing as ways to \nsettle disputes among nations. Therefore our \nconscience is sorely troubled by the savage \nmassacres of Shatila and Sabra, since Israel was \none of those which acceded to the Charter of San \nFrancisco. Therefore, the Government and people \nof Togo join their voice in the general \ncondemnation of the crime of genocide and demand \nthat the responsibility of its perpetrators and \ntheir accomplices be brought to light.\n195.\tIn passing, we salute the memory of those \nmartyrs who fell to the cowardly vengeance of \nthose who believe that the Israeli invasion of \nforeign territories was the panacea for the \nproblem of the Middle East, whereas the reality \nof the Palestinian fact is more than ever \ncompelling.\n196.\tStill on the subject of the Middle East, \nwe note that two events have appeared recently \nwhich give us a glimmer of hope, notwithstanding \nthe intransigence of the Government of Israel. \nThe first was the acceptance by Yasser Arafat of \nthe United Nations resolutions on the problems \nof the Middle East in their entirety. At the same \ntime, the majority of the Arab countries are \nmoving progressively towards recognition of the \nState of Israel. These elements, curiously, \ninstead of being viewed by Tel Aviv as positive \ndata, were played down by them. In a process of \nbelligerence we must not always want to bring \nthe adversary to his knees before envisaging any \nnegotiation. History is full of telling examples: \nthe Allies, in 1918 as in 1945, did not demand \nthat Germany change its Constitution before any \npeace negotiations took place. The Allies \nnegotiated with Germany as it was and the \nfundamental law creating the Federal Republic of \nGermany, for example, was passed much later. It \nis odd to lay down as a pre-condition to any \nnegotiation on the Middle East a complete \nrenunciation by the protagonist of ail his \nprinciples, since the aim of negotiation is \nprecisely to obtain reciprocal renunciations of \npositions.\n197.\tThe second event which provides a glimmer of hope was the change in \nthe attitude of the United States with regard to \nthat part of the world. Its positive vote in the \nSecurity Council on resolution 521 (1982) on the \nLebanon massacre represents a meaningful dynamic \nelement. If these events can combine to create a \nsolution to the Middle East problem, then we may \nventure to say that it is not too rash to talk of \nthe possibility, however minimal, of peace in the \nMiddle East, which has suffered for more than 30 \nyears. The Palestine Liberation Organization \n[PLO], the legitimate representative of the \nPalestinian people, in committing itself behind \nits leader Yasser Arafat to the realistic process \nof peace, will once again furnish proof of its \nmaturity and acute sense of its responsibilities.\n198.\tCan we still speak of peace at the end of \nthe twentieth century while we witness what is \nhappening in South Africa and Namibia? Pretoria \ncontinues to defy humanity at large with \narrogance. By its dilatory manoeuvres Pretoria is \ndoing everything to hold up Namibia's \nindependence. Using the impunity it enjoys, the \nGovernment of South Africa is bent on \nsystematically destroying the already fragile \ninfrastructures of the independent countries of \nsouthern Africa. The repeated invasions of \nAngolan territory perpetrated by the racist \ntroops of South Africa, the raids against the \nterritory of Mozambique and infiltrations into \nZimbabwe, Botswana and other front-line countries \nconstitute genuine acts of provocation.\n199.\tThe experience of the independence of \nZimbabwe where the leaders of that country, \nafter a struggle to recover their freedom, \nmanaged to set up a multiracial regime and where \nZimbabweans co-exist whatever the colour of their \nskin, is proof that Africa is capable in Namibia, \ntoo, of facing its responsibilities in \naccordance with its maturity. Therefore the fears \nthat South Africa claims to have that in Namibia, \nunder the direction of SWAPO, a non-democratic \nregime might be established are only a manoeuvre \nthat does not fool anyone. Africa has already \ngiven proof of its ability to transcend ethnic \ndifferences. The majority of the Namibian people \nunder SWAPO is resolved to follow this \nirreversible current of history to establish \nState structures designed for harmonious \ncoexistence among the various social groups in \nthe country. Africa fights the apartheid system \nand gives daily proof of its determination to see \nthat system eliminated from the planet.\n200.\tIt is therefore odd that it is the \nchampions of apartheid who dare to voice fears \nabout the possibilities of coexistence among the \nvarious racial groups in Namibia. This is a \npretext\u00f3an ill-chosen one at that\u00f3which Pretoria \nis using to perpetuate its domination over \nNamibia. But the independence of that country is \ninevitable. Pretoria's prevarications can do \nnothing. Nothing will come of the South African \nGovernment's attempts to destabilize the \nfront-line States. The combined efforts of \nAfrica, assisted by the gracious understanding of \nthe international community, will hasten \nNamibia's independence. That is why we can state \nthat there is every hope that that country's \nindependence will become a reality soon. But the \nsooner that independence comes the greater the \nnumber of human lives that will be spared.\n201.\tThe agonizing question of whether we can \nstill hope for peace in this tormented world of \ntoday arises when we take a look at the present \nsituation in Chad. Fortunately for that country, \nwe can say: yes, today peace and reconciliation \nare possible in Chad.\n202.\tTogo would like to express its \nsatisfaction publicly that for the first time in \n17 years one can go to Chad without being greeted \nwith the gun-fire and explosions of the civil \nwar. The process of reconciliation has been \nstarted to the satisfaction of all. Since the \nwhich brought to the head of the State of Chad \nthe new President Hissein Habre in June 1982, the \ndesire of the leaders and political organizations \nin Chad has been made manifest\u00f3resolutely to \ncommit themselves to a process of reconciliation \nand peace. The late lamented Ahmat Acyl, former \nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the now defunct \nTransitional Government of National Union, had \nstated that he favoured the peace and \nreconciliation process advocated by President \nHabre. He even wrote a long letter about this to \nGeneral Gnassingbe Eyadema, as Chairman of the \nad Hoc Committee on Chad. The brutal death of \nAhmat Acyl did not permit him to see that \ninitiative through to the end. But today the \nsituation has been normalized throughout the \nterritory of Chad after the whole southern part \nof Chad rallied to that effort.\n203.\tIt is important that the international \ncommunity at large join in the ongoing process of \npeace and reconciliation in Chad, rather than \nengaging in rearguard action based on the \ndefence of unavowed interests which run counter \nto those of the people of Chad. We make an appeal \nto all States which cherish peace for them to do \nall they can to participate in this endeavour of \nnational reconstruction.\n204.\tThe Middle East and Africa are not the \nonly flash-points in the world, but it would be \nrash to attempt to review all conflict situations \nwhich contain the seeds of a general breakdown of \nworld peace. However, we should mention the \ntragedies of Afghanistan and Kampuchea where \npeople have been refused the right to \nself-determination. Togo hopes nevertheless that \nthe coalition Government which has just been \nestablished will finally bring to the people of \nKampuchea the peace for which it hopes.\n205.\tAt the beginning of July 1982 Togo was \nhost of the Governmental Conference of the Zone \nof Africa for the Support of the Independent \nPeaceful Reunification of Korea and we reaffirm \nour solidarity with the Korean people. Our \nGovernment supports the pro-posals made by the \ngreat leader Kim 11 Sung to form the Democratic \nConfederation of Korea. It is obvious that the \nKorean people as a whole wants to see the \nreunification of the country and is opposed to \nany attempt that would lead to a perpetuation of \nthe two Koreas.\n206.\tFinally, the Organization of African \nUnity [6Mt/] recently lived through some serious \nevents which have given rise to doubts as to its \nability to surmount the gravest crisis in its \nhistory. We believe that there also we can hope \nfor a solution to the OAU crisis for the sake of \nthe vitally needed world peace. Now combined \nevents\u00f3and not only the problems of the Sahraoui \nArab Republic\u00f3have given rise to a grave crisis \nwithin the OAU. We are convinced that African \nwisdom will finally triumph. Were the Sahraoui \nproblem the only one, the Committee on self- \ndetermination established by the OAU Assembly of \nHeads of State and Government could find a \nsolution which would enable the nineteenth \nsession of the OAU Assembly to take place.\n207.\tTogo is convinced that no African head of \nState wants to see the OAU break up, and that \nindeed no head of State of the international \ncommunity wants to see the OAU break up, because \nit has shown how much it can contribute to peace \nin the world. A crisis of growth after 20 years \nis quite normal and it should not frighten us.\n208.\tThere will always be crises in the \ninternational organizations. Indeed, my \ndelegation endorses the analysis of the \nSecretary-General about the causes of the \nineffectiveness of the Organization, and which \nexplains the crisis we are undergoing, which has \nunfortunately already broken out in the OAU.\n209.\tWhile we accept that the present OAU \ncrisis is one of growth which will enable it to \ngain further strength, we have serious doubts \nabout the future of the United Nations, which has \nbeen in existence for almost 40 years. It is not \nnormal that at this age the Organization should \ncontinue to see violated the fundamental \nprinciples to which States have freely \nsubscribed. It is not normal that resolutions and \ndecisions of the Organization be flouted. The \nprofound upheavals in today's international life \nhave arisen from these violations.\n210.\tIt is important that all States examine \ntheir conscience, not only about the principles \nof the Charter but also about the scope and \nimplementation of United Nations resolutions and \ndecisions.\n213.. My Government subscribes to the specific \nproposal contained in the Secretary-General's \nreport for a meeting of the Security Council at \nthe highest level to discuss the question of \nmeasures which might strengthen the effectiveness \nof the Organization. Togo has more than once \nshared its experience in the cause of peace, and \nhas participated in several mediation meetings; \nit is convinced that the Secretary-General's \nproposal can lead to action to enhance the \neffectiveness of the Organization.\n214.\tThis is the price to be paid for the \nmaintenance of peace in the world, and we need \nthat peace to build a just and equitable society. \nAs General Gnassingbe Byadema, the \nPresident-Founder of the Togo People's Party and \nPresident of the Republic, has stated: \\\"The \nTogolese people cherishes for itself and all \nnations a will for peace and progress. This peace \nmust be real and must lead to the effective \nemancipation of our various nations. \\\"That is why \nwe should like to make an appeal to the \ninternational community to combine all its \nefforts to build a world of peace, justice and \nfreedom.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Aus\u00actralian Government, Sir, I \ncongratulate you on your election to the \npresidency of the thirty seventh sessions of the \nGeneral Assembly. It gives me particular pleasure \nto pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, who \nhas shown great imagination and integrity in his \nfirst year in office.\n98.\tNo one can ignore the somber mood of the \nAssembly as it faces the critical issues of the \nday, particularly the terrible events of three \nweeks ago in Lebanon. Even in a world used to \nacts of violence, the Beirut massacres have \nnumbed and shocked us all Outrage, however \nstrongly worded and deeply felt, must appear \ninadequate to innocent non-com\u00acbatants whose \nunhappy history has been written in blood and \ntears. Australians share the view of civilized \nmen and women everywhere on the need for, and \nwelcome, a full and independent inquiry into \nthese appalling events.\n99.\tBeyond Beirut, however, there is a wider \ntragedy of 30 years and more of the Middle East \nconflict that inexcusably still defies resolution \nand clouds the future of the region. One can only \nhope that the events in Beirut will shock more \ncountries into a realization of the need for a \ncomprehensive settlement.\n100.\tAustralia has always been deeply \nconscious of the age-long suffering of the Jewish \npeople and their right to a homeland. We \nunderstand Israel's concern that it be able to \nlive in peace, free of terrorist attacks. \nRecognition of Israel's right to exist in peace \ncan, however, settle only one side of the Middle \nEast problem. Israel must also recognize the \nlegitimate rights of the Palestinians, rights \nwhich should include a homeland for the \nPalestinians alongside Israel. Israel, \npre-eminently among nations, should understand \nthe significance of a national homeland for a \ndispersed people.\n101.\tEqually important is the need for \nmovement from the Arab side. We recognize that \nthe proposals from the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference at Fez provided an implicit \nrecognition of Israel by calling for the Security \nCouncil to guarantee peace among all States of \nthe region. Why, however, cannot the implicit be \nmade explicit? All Arab nations should clearly \naccept what so far Egypt alone has accepted, \nnamely, that Israel has a right to exist in peace \nand security behind stable borders.\n102.\tSo the problem has two aspects. It will \nneed courage and imagination on both sides to \ndeal with it. Otherwise there will be no peace in \nthe Middle East\u2014 and the Middle East without \npeace will remain a threat to the peace of the \nworld.\n103.\tThe Middle East is only one area of \nconflict. Other crises in other areas seem to \narise with fright\u00acening frequency. It is only too \napparent that the international machinery \ndeveloped here in New York to contain and settle \nconflicts has not been working as it should. The \nfact is that some Member States, including \nAustralia, have had to go outside the United \nNations framework for alternative peace-keeping \narrangements. Examples are the Sinai \nMultinational Force and Observers, in which \nAustralia is a par\u00acticipant, and the current \ninternational force in Lebanon.\n104.\tIn an unusually candid report on the \nstate bf the United Nations, the \nSecretary-General has this year set out the \nconcerns so many of us feel about the present \nweaknesses in the Organization. We commend him \nfor doing so. The recent record is dismal. As the \nSecretary-General has observed, we are perilously \nnear to a new international anarchy.\n103. The Security Council, the primary organ for \nthe maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity, finds its resolutions routinely \nignored. Those provi\u00acsions of the Charter dealing \nwith collective action for peace and security \nhave been rendered ineffective. Too often Member \nStates have contrived to avoid bringing \nparticular problems to the Security Council, or \nto do so too late for the Council to have any \neffective impact. Distressingly, for many Member \nStates, the Council's writ hardly runs at all. \nAnd what applies to the Security Council applies \neven more in the General Assembly and other \norgans of the United Nations.\n106. All that, as the Secretary-General has aptly \nobserved, amounts to a crisis in the multilateral \napproach to resolving world problems, and to a \ncrisis of confidence in the United Nations \nitself. But we must not be overawed by the \nproblems. Their effects can be moderated if not \novercome. The Secretary- General himself has \nproposed a number of measures which could improve \nthe situation. Some of his propo\u00acsals, moreover, \ncould be realized immediately. That is the case, \nfor example, with his concern that there should \nbe more systematic use of the Security Council. \nThere is clearly a role for the Secretary-General \nhimself, acting within the terms of Article 99 of \nthe Charter, to bring potentially dangerous \nsituations to the attention of the Security \nCouncil. The Council itself should be able to \nmove more promptly into a dispute without, as the \nSecretary-General says, waiting for those \ndirectly involved to bring the dispute to its \natten\u00action. The Council and the Secretary-General \nacting together could do much to defuse \nsmouldering conflicts through, for example, the \nearly dispatch of fact-finding and good offices \nmissions. Such measures could con\u00acstitute a \ndiplomatic early warning system  designed to \nidentify and isolate disputes before they \ndegenerate into armed conflict.\n107. The Secretary-General has gone further; he \nhas urged the need for improving the collective \nsecurity provisions of the Charter provided under \nChapter VII. Specifically he has proposed\u2014and \nAustralia supports him\u2014that Member States should \nuse their collective influence to ensure respect \nfor decisions of the Security Council. In an \nideal situation Security Council peace\u00ackeeping \norders would be backed up by guarantees of \ncollective action, including guarantees by the \nper\u00acmanent members, to ensure compliance with all \ndeci\u00acsions of the Council.\n108. We recognize that these constructive ideas \nof the Secretary-General will be the subject of \nintensive scrutiny. They presuppose, as he says, \nat least a modicum of co-operation among the \npermanent members. It is the lack of that \nco-operation in the past which has so often \nfrustrated the work of the Council. But some such \nevolution along the lines the Secretary-General \nhas outlined is essential if the present drift is \nto be arrested.\n109. Not that the recent record has been all bad; \nwe should recall and reflect upon some of the \nsignifi\u00accant achievements of the United Nations. \nOne notable example is decolonization. The \nOrganization has made it possible for very many \npeoples to attain indepen\u00acdence and thereby make \ntheir own contribution to the international \ncommunity.\n110. There are today very few situations where \nnon-self-governing peoples have yet to exercise \ntheir right of self-determination. Namibia, \nhowever, remains on the agenda. The \nSecretary-General in his report on the work of \nthe Organization reflects a sense of cautious \noptimism about Namibia. Let us hope that that \noptimism is well placed. A peaceful solution to \nthis long-standing problem would clearly be a \nvery great achievement, if such a solution is \nworked out, it will owe much to the persistent \nefforts of the contact group and the front-line \nStates. Australia continues to stand ready to \ncontribute an engineering and head\u00acquarters unit \nof about 300 men to UNTAG to help oversee and \nsupervise the independence process.\n111.\tDecolonization is not the only area of \nUnited Nations success. There have been, and \ncontinue to be, considerable achievements in the \neconomic, social and technical fields\u2014so much so \nperhaps that we sometimes take these achievements \nfor granted. As a clearing-house for ideas and as \nan instrument for technical assistance and \nco-operation, the United Nations and its agencies \nhave fulfilled a unique and valuable role.\n112.\tIn the North-South area, too, there has \nbeen progress, although we have not yet achieved \nour ultimate goals. Australia shares what I take \nto be the general sense of disappointment at the \nfailure thus fhr to launch global negotiations. \nWe also share in the concern, so evident at the \nrecent meetings of IMF and World Bank in Toronto, \nabout what thefuture holds. Finding durable \nsolutions to the financial and economic problems \nbesetting the world has never been more urgent.\n113.\tOne major issue rightly causing growing \ncon\u00accern is the extent of the world's \nindebtedness. A par\u00acticularly disturbing aspect \nis the concentration in areas with limited \nability to service and repay bor\u00acrowings, the \ncost of which has in some cases tripled since the \ntime of the original loan.\n114.\tAustralia wants a break in the impasse in \nthe North-South dialogue. There is a need to \ngalvanize the kind of political will evident at \nthe Common\u00acwealth Heads of Government Meeting at \nMelbourne in September/October 1981, and at the \nInternational Meeting on Co-operation and \nDevelopment, at Cancun in October 1981. In both \ncases it was shown to be possible to break across \ntraditional North- South lines. Australia accepts \nthe North-South frame\u00acwork, and the developing \ncountry Group of 77 as a valid negotiating \npartner. But we also see merit in more flexible \nand open contacts across North-South lines as a \nmeans of bridging differences.\n115.\tThe benefits of such an approach were \ndemon\u00acstrated in the recent law of the sea \nnegotiations. It was a remarkable achievement for \na Conference of ISO countries to draft and reach \nconsensus on hun\u00acdreds of articles of new \ninternational treaty law. While the Convention on \nthe Law of the Sea perhaps never could have been \nentirely satisfactory to all parties, it \nrepresents a major step forward in the \ncodification of maritime law and in co-operation \nbetween nations. This experience shows that we \nmust not relax efforts to tackle the seemingly \ninsoluble as well as the apparently soluble.\n116.\tAmong present international economic \nprob\u00aclems none concerns the Australian Government \nmore than protectionism and restraints on trade. \nAustralia is acutely aware of the obstacles to \nprogress and of the entrenched national interest \nand rigidities which have to be overcome. The \nAustralian Government has promoted the concept of \ncollective reduction of protectionism by \nGovernments aimed at providing a stimulus to \nworld trade. The Australian proposal involves a \nstandstill on all trade-distorting assistance \nmeasures and, following the standstill, a gradual \nwind-back of this assistance. We intend to pursue \nthese proposals vigorously at the forthcoming \nGATT ministerial meeting and afterwards at the \nsixth session of UNCTAD.\n117.\tWhat distinguishes the Australian \napproach is that we are ready to commit ourselves \nto action along these lines\u2014provided that other \ncomparable countries do likewise. In other words, \nthe Australian Government, having considered the \nmatter, has already taken the decision that, if \nthe other major trading nations were to apply the \napproach we have outlined, or to attempt \nsomething like it, we would immediately join it.\n118.\tIt follows from what I have said that \nthis is an area which must be addressed \nmultilateral^ and in which States will inevitably \nbe looking to progressive, balanced global \nreductions in trade barriers, export subsidies \nand other trade-distorting measures as a \ncondition of their own participation. It is a \nfurther rationale for getting on with global \nnegotiations.\n119.\tNow is not the time for a detailed \nanalysis of the present difficulties in launching \nglobal negotia\u00actions, but a basis emerged from \nthe Versailles Eco\u00acnomic Summit. I interpreted \nthe Versailles language to mean: here is an \nopportunity to launch global negotiations now. If \nit is rejected, I believe it could be some time \nbefore we get another chance. Indeed, if the \ndebate is allowed to drift again into the details \nof what groups should be constituted here to \nhandle the talks, and thus what the agenda and \ndegree of decentralization should be, this will \namount to turning the clock back to a much \nearlier and more difficult phase in the \ndiscussions.\n120.\tAs in the North-South so in the \nhumanitarian area the United Nations has an \nimportant role to play. Here it can point to a \nnumber of significant achievements. In some cases \nresults have been attained only after arduous and \nlengthy negotiations. This has often obscured the \nsignificance of the ultimate result.\n121.\tThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nof 1948 and the two International Covenants on \nHuman Rights provide the world community with a \nset of standards for the protection of \nfundamental rights and freedoms. The adoption by \nthe General Assembly of the Declaration on the \nElimination of all Forms of Intolerance and of \nDiscrimination Based on Religion or Belief is a \nfurther step along this road. Working through the \nCommission on Human Rights, ILO and other \nrelevant bodies, the United Nations system has \nbeen able significantly to mitigate some of the \nworst breaches of human rights. Human rights in \nSouth Africa and countries such as Poland, the \nIslamic Republic of Iran and Guatemala have come \nunder increasing scrutiny. Australia will remain \nactive in these important areas.\n122.\tMeanwhile, new areas of humanitarian \nconcern are being considered. We have \nparticularly welcomed the recent emphasis on the \nprotection of indigenous populations. Australia \nwas active in encouraging the establishment by \nthe Economic and Social Council this year of a \nworking group on indigenous populations.\n123.\tYet another area, regrettably, of \nincreasing concern is the plight of refugees \nthroughout the world. The facts are stark: a \nworld refugee population of at least 8 million to \n10 miHion, an increasing number of other \ndisplaced persons and movements of peoples within \nregions in response to pressures of poverty or \ndeprivation. UNHCR has helped to cope with this \nhuge problem; success, however, has been mixed. \nUNHCR has assisted and continues to assist \nmillions of refugees and displaced persons, but \nit needs the assurance of a continuing mandate, \nnot a fixed-term mandate, and a vigorous pursuit \nof durable solutions, especially volun\u00actary \nrepatriation. It needs, too, a widened acceptance \nby the entire international community of the \nmoral obligation to provide at least temporary \nrefuge to those compelled to leave their own \ncountries. Australia proposed a code of conduct \nembodying this principle of temporary refuge in \nGeneva two years ago. We shall be pursuing the \ninitiative further in the Executive Committee of \nthe High Commissioner and at a later stage here \nin the General Assembly itself.\n124.\tFor many Governments and ordinary \ncitizens the second special session on \ndisarmament was a disappointment and its results \nlimited. Nevertheless Australia considers that \nthe session did help clear the air. It did \nestablish, if not a meeting of minds, a better \nunderstanding of the essential basis of mutual \ncon\u00acfidence if progress in arms control and \ndisarmament is to be realized. It showed that a \nbetter under\u00acstanding leading to an improvement \nin relations between East and West, essentially \nbetween the superpowers, is imperative if there \nis to be any significant progress in disarmament \nand, indeed, in other issues of strategic and \npolitical concern.\n123. I conclude by returning to the earlier theme \nof the role and promise of the United Nations. \nState\u00acments made in this debate already indicate \na sense of failure, frustration or disappointment \nfelt by many about the United Nations during the \ncourse of the year. While it may be argued that \npublicly held expectations of progress had been \ntoo high, it is undeniable that a serious crisis \nof pubic confidence now exists about the capacity \nof the United Nations to carry out some of its \nmost central) responsibilities.\n126.\tYet we must not turn away from the United \nNations in frustration. Each nation must actively \nlook for ways in which to strengthen public faith \nin the Organization and its potential capacity \nfor negotiation and conciliation. We need less \ndebate, less rhetoric and fewer resolutions; and \nmore constructive effort, more effective action \nto resolve the major issues, including those of \ndisarmament and development, which face us all. I \nhope that the Secretary-General's important and \ncourageous comments will help to change the \nattitude of Member States towards adopting more \nresponsible, more rational and more moderate \napproaches to the world community's problems. \nAustralia is ready to play its part.\n127.\tWe are a growing middle Power. White our \nhistorical links are with Europe, we are situated \nin the South-East Asian and South Pacific region. \nWe are thus a country with interests spanning \nboth the developing and the developed worlds. We \nsee our role as one of exercising a reasoned, \nresponsible and steady influence in the world \ncommunity. We have a strong and abiding belief in \nthe essential validity of the United Nations. The \nSecretary-General can count on Australia's \nsupport.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like to convey to you, on \nbehalf of the delegation of the Netherlands and \non my own behalf, my congratulations on your \nelection to the presidency of the thirty-seventh \nsession of the Assembly. I am convinced that your \nlong experience in United Nations affairs will \nenable you to shoulder the heavy \nresponsi\u00acbilities of your high office and to \nguide us in our deliberations.\n42.\tMuch will depend upon your wisdom, for \nthe Assembly convenes at a juncture marked by an \natmosphere of crisis in international affairs, as \nwell as a crisis in the multilateral approach to \ninternational affairs. Respect for and the use of \nmultilateral forums both within and outside the \nUnited Nation seem to be on the decline, while a \ntendency towards bilateralism and a preoccupation \nwith national prob\u00aclems are growing. We consider \nthis to be a disquieting development. In times of \ncrises such as those through which the world is \nnow passing, we, the Govern-ments and the States \nMembers of the United Nations, share a particular \nand common responsibility to see to it that this \ntrend is reversed and that co-operation among \nStates resumes its rightful place in \ninternational relations.\n43.\tThis session of the General Assembly owes \nmuch to the Secretary-General for the way in \nwhich he has put before us the central problem of \nthe Organiza\u00action's capacity to keep the peace \nand to serve as a forum for negotiations. I fully \nshare his anxiety and his disappointment about \nthe inability of the United Nations to live up to \nthe hopes the peoples of this world placed in it \nat its inception. I welcome his report on the \nwork of the Organization as an important signal \nto the international community and as a challenge \nto us all. We, for our part, will do our utmost \nto help him in his efforts to improve the \ncredibility and the effectiveness of the \nOrganization.\n44.\tTwo objectives which are fundamental to \nour mutual relations would, if properly pursued, \nmake the world a better place to live in for \neveryone. They are complementary and are \nintertwined in such a manner that the one cannot \nbe neglected without harming the other. Those \nobjectives are peace and security on the one hand \nand justice on the other.\n45.\tIt is sometimes argued that peace is the \nmost important of all. Indeed, would a major war \nin our nuclear age not be synonymous with the \nannihilation of our civilization or even of \nmankind itself? Peace is certainly a prerequisite \nfor the fulfillment of our aspirations, but we \nshould not forget that security is essential to \nthe process of peace. The principal organ of the \nUnited Nations concerned with peace is called the \nSecurity Council, not the Peace Council. Indeed, \none of the major challenges before us is to make \nour system of collective security work.\n46.\tStill, it is impossible to think of peace \nwithout at the same time thinking of justice, for \nthere will be neither lasting peace nor genuine \nsecurity without justice. Not only should \nrelations between States, peoples and individuals \nbe governed by it, but justice is also foremost \nin our minds when we come to think of such \nmatters as the eradication of poverty and the \npromotion of human rights.\n47.\tThere are a number of areas in the world \nwhere peace is at best precarious or where a \nbreach of the peace has already occurred. The \nmost conspicuous of those areas is the Middle \nEast, where\u2014notwith\u00acstanding the presence of a \nUnited Nations peace\u00ackeeping force\u2014a military \ninvasion took place only three months ago. I \nshall not repeat here what Mr. Ellemann-Jensen, \nof Denmark, speaking on behalf of the members of \nthe European Community, said so eloquently \nyesterday at the 8th meeting. Suffice it to say \nthat the Netherlands fully associates itself with \nhis condemnation of the invasion and with the \nindigna\u00action at the complete disregard for all \nthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council \nand the sorrow for the suffering caused to the \nmany\u2014too many\u2014victims.\n48.\tIn this connection I would pay a tribute \nto the memory of those who fell victim to the \nsenseless murder in the refugee camps of Beirut. \nAtrocities of this magnitude call for an \nauthoritative inquiry.\n49.\tWe cannot hope to find a durable solution \nto the problems of the Middle East unless such a \nsolution is based upon security and justice. \nThere is a clear need for all peoples in the \nregion to live within secure borders. We shall \nhave to keep in mind, however, that a line drawn \non the map cannot provide genuine security. \nBorders can be secure only if they are \nrecog\u00acnized by all concerned as part of a \ncomprehensive, just and lasting settlement. There \nwill have to be justice for all peoples: for \nthose who lack a national home, for those whose \nterritory is under foreign occupation and for \nthose whose State has yet to receive full \nrecognition.\n50.\tThe countries of the European Community \nhave repeatedly stressed the need to ensure both \nsecurity and justice for all peoples in the \nMiddle East. We therefore welcome President \nReagan's recent initiative as an important \nopportunity for peaceful progress to this end. I \nam equally happy to note that at Fez the Arab \nleaders expressed their readiness to work for the \nachievement of peace for all States in the \nregion. I sincerely hope that these statements \nwill pave the way for the negotiated settlement \nwhich has eluded us so far and for which there is \nno alternative but endless war.\n51.\tLet me turn for a moment to another area \nwhere peace has been regrettably absent for many \nyears now: Afghanistan. As a direct result of the \nSoviet invasion 3 [pillion people have left their \ncountry. We cannot but voice our indignation at \nthe repression which followed the occupation of \nthat unhappy, once non-aligned country. In order \nto control a population heroically fighting for \nits independence, 100,000 foreign troops are now \nstationed in Afghanistan. The intervention, which \nhas caused the Soviet Union serious loss of \nprestige, has had a profound impact on \ninternational relations. I note in this respect, \nfor instance, its very negative effect on efforts \nto convene a conference on the Indian Ocean.\n52.\tWe sincerely hope that it will be \npossible to arrive at a political solution to \nthis question, and we therefore fully support the \nefforts undertaken to that effect by the \nSecretary-General.\n53.\tAnother victim of aggression, Kampuchea, \nseems to be in a slightly better position than it \nwas in last year. Here various factions have been \nable to form a coalition under the chairmanship \nof His Royal High\u00acness Prince Sihanouk. It is our \nsincere hope that this development will make it \npossible for the resolutions of the General \nAssembly on Kampuchea to be carried out and that \nthere may be a better future around the comer for \nthat country, which has suffered so much during \nthe last five years. In this connection I should \nlike to express my country's appreciation for the \nefforts of a number of States in the region, in \npar\u00acticular the members of ASEAN which are \nplaying such a positive and effective role in \nfurthering the cause of peace.\n54.\tUnfortunately there are many other areas \nin the world where peace is precarious or where \nefforts to reach a permanent settlement have \nfailed so far. One such area is Korea, where, to \nmy mind, better use could be made of the \npossibilities for dialogue and negotiation.\n55.\tThere is another area, however, where \npeace has been in danger for quite some time now \nbut where there is hope for a settlement in the \nnot too distant future. I am thinking of Namibia. \nIf it were indeed possible to remove the \nremaining obstacles on the way to a just and \nlasting solution\u2014and, need\u00acless to say, that is \nwhat we are all looking forward to\u2014then the world \nwill have witnessed an encouraging example of \nwhat can be achieved by patient and careful \nmediation. In that case the United Nations and \nthe group of five Western States can be proud of \nhaving contributed to the accomplishment of \nindependence for the people of Namibia and for \nhaving brought peace and, one hopes, lasting \nstability to a region which has gone through such \na trying period. Let me only add at this stage, \nwhile negotiations are still continuing that the \nNetherlands will gladly be of assistance during \nthe transition.\n56.\tFinally, whilst I am on the subject of \npeace, I should like to say a few words about the \nSouth Atlantic. I do not intend to go deeply into \nthe matter for I can associate myself with what \nwas said yesterday on behalf of the European \nCommunity by my colleague from Denmark. Let me \nonly add that we are happy to note that the \nrecent grave events, in which force was used, \ncontrary to the principles of the Charter, \nespecially the principle of the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes, are now a thing of the \npast. The Netherlands continues to attach the \ngreatest importance to its rela\u00actions with the \ncountries of South America with which it has many \nties. Needless to say, we are looking forward to \na further strengthening of our relations with \nthose countries.\n57.\tThere will be no peace without security \nand there will be no security if the various arms \nraces taking place in the world are allowed to \ncontinue. It is sad to note, therefore, in \nparticular at a time when the need for concrete \nprogress is so great, that the results of the \nAssembly's second special session on disarmament \nwere so meager. We shall have to redouble our \nefforts in Geneva, so as to make up for lost \ntime. One way of doing this is to devise ways and \nmeans which would enable the Committee on \nDisarma\u00acment to carry out its mandate more \neffectively.\n58.\tOnly a few blocks away from the United \nNations Office at Geneva other negotiations are \ntaking place which are of crucial importance to \nus all. A success\u00acful outcome of the talks on the \nreduction of strategic arms, and, one hopes, the \nscrapping of an entire category of semi-strategic \nweapons, could have a decisive effect on arms \ncontrol at large, and on the security of a great \nnumber of nations present here in New York.\n59.\tWhile addressing the subject of security, \nI should like to make a few remarks on United \nNations peace-keeping operations. As members \nknow, the Nether\u00aclands has been, and still is, \nengaged in one of the major activities taking \nplace in this Held. UNIFIL, which includes a \nDutch battalion, fulfilled an important task in \nkeeping the peace in southern Lebanon\u2014for a \nnumber of years anyway. Also, some progress was \nmade toward the restoration of the authority of \nthe Lebanese Government in that part of the \ncountry. Apart from the humanitarian assistance \ngiven to the numerous refugees in recent months, \nthat has remained UNIFIL's main objective.\n60.\tHowever, the difference between \npeace-keeping and peace-enforcing and the \nlimitations under which peace-keeping forces \noperate and can be expected to operate have \nbecome painfully clear. Whenever one of the \nparties to a conflict shows a total disregard for \na force of this nature and applies massive \nmilitary pressure the United Nations presence is \nbound to lose much of its meaning.\n61.\tIt is impossible to speak of security \nwithout touching upon the Security Council. It is \nthe nucleus of the system of collective security \nwhich is at the very heart of this great \nOrganization of ours. A number of its resolutions \nhave acquired the status of generally recognized \ninternational instruments. I very much agree with \nthe Secretary-General that it is our common task \nto protect and enhance the effectiveness of the \nSecurity Council. I assure him that he may count \non our full support when he takes it upon himself \nto bring potentially dangerous situations to the \nattention of the Council, as indeed Article 99 of \nthe Charter invites him to do. Furthermore, the \n.Netherlands welcomes his intention to develop a \nwider and more systematic capacity for \nfact-finding in areas of potential conflict. The \nstrengthening of the fact-finding capa\u00acbility of \nthe Organization could be an important element in \nour efforts to maintain peace and security.\n62.\tOccasionally special circumstances have \nled nations to resort to peace-keeping operations \noutside the United Nations framework. This may \ngive cause for some concern. However, the \nmaintenance of peace and stability must sometimes \ntake precedence over considerations of an \ninstitutional nature. My country, for its part,has \na strong preference for participation in \npeace-keeping activities decided upon by the \nSecurity Council. The Netherlands will shortly \nprovide the Secretary-General with an updated \noffer for units to be made available for United \nNations service.\n63.\tPeace and security are not complete \nwithout justice. Therefore it is to justice that \nI shall devote the latter part of my speech. \nJustice has to do with the notion of the fair and \nequitable distribution of wealth and \ndecision-making power. It implies that relations \nbetween nations are based on respect for the \nprinciple of the equal rights and \nself-determination of peoples, and that citizens \nare treated in accordance with the dignity \ninherent in the human person. These basic rights \nlie at the root of the international community's \ncommitment to support processes aimed at self- \nreliance and to overcome poverty, in particular \nin the third world. Conceived in this way, \njustice assures the consent of individuals to the \nway in which they are governed and the consent of \nnations to the interna\u00actional order. Where \njustice is deficient that consent can at best be \npartial and there will be a constant danger to \npeace and security.\n64.\tLet me give an example, that of Poland, a \ncountry that was also referred to by Mr. \nElleman-Jensen when he spoke on behalf of the \nEuropean Community. Nine months ago the Polish \nauthorities, yielding to pressure from a powerful \nneighbor, decided to impose martial law, with \nensuing large-scale viola\u00actions of human rights. \nWe all know the result: con\u00actinuing turmoil, \nfollowed by increasing repression.\n65.\tAn important element in the search for \njustice is the promotion and protection of human \nrights, civil and political as well as economic, \nsocial and cultural. The fact that human rights \nhave become a generally recognized subject of \ninternational concern is one of the major \nachievements of the United Nations. My coun\u00actry's \napproach to human rights and to violation of \nthose rights, wherever and whenever they occur, \nis im\u00acpartial. We feel strongly that we should \nfight any abuse of those rights regardless of \nideological context or geographical area. In this \nconnection, let me just mention our anxiety about \ndevelopments in Iran and Viet Nam. In some \nCentral American countries, more\u00acover, we see a \nvicious circle of repression and rebellion, \nresulting in massive human suffering and a \nrapidly growing number of refugees.\n66.\tIn South Africa the constitutional and \npolitical system continues to be based on the \nhideous policy of The Netherlands remains \ncommitted, as it has always been, to doing \neverything in its power to help put an end to \nthat system, which is intolerable to the majority \nof the population and has been rejected by the \nentire international community.\n67.\tMore often than not when we discuss human \nrights we do soon a country-by-country basis. \nHow\u00acever, it is also possible to look at these \nissues in a thematic way. This method has proved \nto be of some value in the Commission on Human \nRights. One of its principal advantages is that \nit allows for a sys\u00actematic, world-wide approach \nto such disturbing phenomena as enforced \ndisappearances, mass exoduses, summary \nexecutions, torture, and the fate of people \nadvocating the implementation of interna\u00actionally \nagreed human rights instruments in their own \ncountries. This approach, which is certainly not \ndesigned to enable individual Governments to \nevade their responsibilities, has proved to be a \nworkable method in a number of cases, and one \nwhich could be further developed in the future. \nIn this connection, I should like to draw the \nattention of the Assembly to the practice of \nextra-legal executions as a means of political \npersecution. Some months ago Amnesty \nInternational organized in my country an \ninterna\u00actional conference on this intolerable \npractice, which seems to be on the increase.\n68.\tI think it cannot be denied that; on the \nwhole, the principles in the field of human \nrights are clear and that what is needed, first \nand foremost, %s implementa\u00action. Yet there \nremains a need for further refinement, if only to \ndefine the responsibilities of those who \ncontravene human rights and to assure for all \nothers, whether directly affected or not, the \nright to speak up and to act whenever such \ncontraventions take place. States and individuals \nhave both the right and the duty to play an \nactive role in furthering the cause of justice. \nThis explains our satisfaction at the adop\u00action \nof the Declaration on the Elimination of All \nForms of Intolerance #id of Discrimination Based \non Religion or belief by the Assembly last year \nafter 20 years of drafting. It also explains why \nwe look forward to the adoption of similar \ndocu\u00acments on medical ethics and on the \nprotection of all persons under any form of \ndetention or imprisonment, both of which are on \nthe agenda of this current session.\n69.\tThe Organisation has taken a variety of \ninitiatives directed towards the improvement of \nthe position of women and young people. As the \nend of the United Nations Decade for Women draws \nnearer, we should make even greater efforts to \nensure the realization of its principles and \nobjectives, namely, full and equal participation \nof women in development, in political life and in \nall social activities. We shall be successful \nonly to the extent that we can bring about a \nfunda\u00acmental change in prevailing attitudes and \nmentalities, which too often lead to \ndiscrimination against and, thus, to the \nsubordination of women in our societies. The \nNetherlands will participate fully in the \nimple-mentation of the Convention on the \nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination \nagainst Women.\n70.\tThe year in which the Decade for Women \nwill end, 1985, will be International Youth Year. \nWe attach great importance to the creation of \neffective channels of communication to involve \nthe youth of our countries in various United \nNations activities, such as those concerned with \ndisarmament, arms control, develop\u00acment \nco-operation and human rights.\n71.\tI need not stress the importance we \nattach to United Nations activities for refugees. \nDuring the past few years, the refugee problem \nhas reached staggering dimensions, particularly \nin the third world. Assiduous efforts are \nrequired to cope with this problem, and I can \nonly express the hope that Member States will \nprovide the United Nations High Com\u00acmissioner for \nRefugees with the assistance he so badly needs.\n72.\tFinally, there are people whose situation \nin some respects resembles that of refugees. They \nare the migrant workers, who are dependent upon \nthe state of the economy in their host countries. \nAs a result of the current stagnation, many of \nthem will end up as victims of double \nunemployment, both in the host country and at \nhome. This problem may well require our special \nattention in the years to come.\n73.\tToday, hunger is still a very real \nproblem for all too many people in a great number \nof countries. These people do not get a fair \nopportunity to earn their own living and to \nprovide themselves with the necessary food. \nMillions cannot fulfill their basic needs. There \nremains an intolerable discrepancy in living \nstandards, and in the opportunities to improve \nthem, between the industrialized and the \ndeveloping coun\u00actries. Underdevelopment and \npoverty are an integral part of the North-South \nproblem.\n74.\tJustice requires that a wide spectrum of \nmeasures be taken to promote the development of \nthe coun\u00actries of the South. I am thinking of \nmeasures in the field of sizeable and \nwell-defined development assis\u00actance programmes, \nmeasures of a structural nature to eliminate \nbottlenecks in the areas cf trade and invest\u00acment \nand in the financial and monetary sphere, and \nalso measures to promote the exploration, \nexploitation and 3ocal processing of commodities \nand the search for sources of energy.\n75.\tAll these activities are destined to \ncontribute to the growth of the developing \ncountries and to a better world- vide \ndistribution of income and resources. We believe \nthat we should make a common effort to explore \nways and means to improve the international \neconomic order.\n76.\tThere have been numerous efforts, in \nparticular within the United Nations, to bring \nthis about. Instru\u00acments for North-South \nco-operation, such as the strategies for the \nUnited Nations Development Decades, have been \ndevised. The implementation of such measures as \nthe 0.7 per cent aid target and the fight against \nprotectionism in trade are matters that must be \ntaken very seriously if justice is not to become \na hollow word. Non-implementation could, in its \neffects, be almost as bad as disregard for \nSecurity Council decisions. It is jeopardizing \nco-operation between North and South, and \nthreatening the United Nations as an organization \nwhose decisions are to be taken seriously.\n77.\tThose considerations have always guided \n'my country's approach to these questions. I am \nhappy to add that the Netherlands' development \nassistance has surpassed the 1 per cent mark.\n78.\tThe Netherlands had hoped that overall \neconomic co-operation based on interdependence \nand solidarity between North and South could by \nnow have been discussed at a new round of global \nnegotiations. Unfortunately, we have been too \noptimistic. We therefore urge all concerned to \nmake a serious effort to find an early solution \nto the few difficulties that are still \noutstanding. The world community is in urgent \nneed of a framework for dealing, in an \ninter-related way and at a high political level, \nwith the key issues that bedevil international \neconomic relations and hamper development in the \nthird world.\n79.\tIn the meantime, it is important that \nother nego\u00actiations dealing with specific problem \nareas be con\u00acducted in a constructive spirit. \nSolutions agreed in such negotiations should also \nbenefit those whose needs are greatest but who \nare not in a position to offer concessions. The \nnotion of the survival of the fittest is not \napplicable to relations between human beings or \nStates.\n80.\tIn a stormy and uncertain world, the \nUnited Nations is an essential institution for \nthe pursuit of the two overriding and closely \ninterconnected objectives for international \nco-operation: peace and justice. As the \nSecretary-General so rightly observed, it is all \ntoo easy to indulge in extreme and inflexible \npositions. But what can one hope to accomplish by \ngenerating rhetoric and intolerance? Instead let \nus try to respect each other's views and \npositions, thus paving the way for a more \nmeaningful dialogue.\n81.\tWith that in mind, I wish you, Mr. \nPresident, and all those assembled here today \nwisdom and good luck in the coming months. We \nshall need a lot of both if we are to make \nprogress towards the realization of the \nprinciples and purposes to which we are committed \nas Members of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "The people of Uganda have placed their hopes for world peace and \nsecurity in this Organization which was founded 37 years ago after \nthe most disastrous war this planet has ever known. The collective \ndetermination which the peoples of the United Nations expressed in \n1945 to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war must \nremain the fundamental objective of the Organization. I should like, \non behalf of the delegation of Uganda, to extend to the President our \nwarm congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of \nthe thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. His wide \ndiplomatic experience and his extensive knowledge of the United \nNations uniquely qualify him to discharge the onerous \nresponsibilities we have entrusted to him. Our satisfaction at his \nelection is all the greater because he hails from Hungary, a count y \nwith which Uganda enjoys very cordial relations. I take this \nopportunity to pay a most well  deserved tribute to his predecessor, \nMr. Ismat Kittani, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq. Mr. \nKittani presided over the various sessions held by the General \nAssembly during his term of office with exceptional skill, devotion \nand competence. We wish him well in all his future endeavors. I also \nwish, on this occasion, to pay a very warm tribute to our \ndistinguished Secretary General, who has worked hard, since his \nelection to that high office, with much courage and rare commitment, \nto restore and enhance the effectiveness of the Organization. We are \nmeeting here at a time when the question of Namibia is uppermost in \nour minds. We are asking more urgently than ever: when is Namibia \ngoing to be free? For how long will the present maneuvers to postpone \nthe day of independence for the people of Namibia? There is no need \nany more to recount the number of occasions on the long journey \ntowards Namibian independence when our hopes have been elevated only \nto have been crushed at every critical turn on the road. In the \ncourse of the last three months we have been treated to well \npublicized reports about substantial progress towards a negotiated \nsettlement. Today, however hard we focus our gaze on the distant \nprospects, we cannot see any real or concrete manifestations of a \nsettlement. Instead we are witnessing the injection of extraneous and \nirrelevant elements into the negotiations. We see no justification \nfor any linkage between Namibian independence and the presence of \nCuban military personnel in Angola. The former is a clear cut \ncolonial issue and has been treated as such by the United Nations and \nby the entire international community. The latter, on the other hand, \nis a bilateral arrangement, which is by no means unique, between two \nindependent, sovereign States. In any case, how can anyone forget \nthat the presence of Cuban military personnel in Angola was \noccasioned in the first instance by South African aggression against \nAngola. Moreover, these acts of aggression have continued unabated to \nthis very day. Even as we deliberate here today, South African troops \ncontinue to occupy the southern region of Angola. We challenge anyone \nto cite even a single instance of Angolan incursion into South \nAfrica, with or without Cuban military personnel. Those who are \ntouting the so called linkage are attempting to rewrite history. In \nspite of the obvious facts to the contrary they are seeking to create \na make believe world, a world in which the aggressor appears as the \nvictim and the real victim is projected as a threat to the aggressor. \nThis so called linkage is a very suspicious scheme indeed, one which \nwe find inadmissible and unacceptable. We want to state once again \nthat Security Council resolution 435 continues to be the only basis \nfor a negotiated settlement for Namibian independence. I wish to \nstress, moreover, the special political and moral responsibility \nwhich the five Western States bear in this matter. We urge them to \nadmit that responsibility and to bring to an immediate end South \nAfrica's intransigence and procrastination. We salute the people of \nNamibia, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's \nOrganization, their sole and authentic representative, for the heroic \nstruggle they continue to wage against the occupying Power, as well \nas for the exemplary statesmanship they have demonstrated throughout \nthe process of negotiations. In South Africa itself the situation has \ncontinued to deteriorate dramatically. The racist minority regime \ncontinues its oppression of the majority of the people with impunity. \nFreedom fighters have been given death sentences by the apartheid \ncourts. Trade union movements are being subjected to the most \nrepressive laws. Opponents of apartheid have been assassinated in \ndetention centers and in neighboring countries. Helpless women and \nchildren have been forcibly evacuated from their urban settlements \nand dumped like waste into remote and unproductive reserves. In a \nvain attempt to consolidate further the apartheid system and divide \nthe ranks of the oppressed, the Pretoria regime has tried to coopt \nsome sectors of the oppressed communities into the segregated power \nstructure, while that power structure continues to exclude the vast \nmajority of the people from any exercise of political or economic \npower. This transparent ploy of divide and rule, like the other ploys \nbefore it, is bound to fail. In addition to supporting the internal \nresistance which is gaining momentum every day, the international \ncommunity must spare no effort to isolate the racist minority regime. \nWe condemn those countries that continue to strengthen the system of \napartheid through their collaboration in the economic, military and \nnuclear fields. In this regard, we want to see the full and effective \nimplementation of Security Council resolution 418 on the arms embargo \nagainst the minority racist regime. We urge the Security Council to \nact with speed to block the existing loopholes in the arms embargo \nregime. We take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the front line \nStates for their relentless commitment to the cause of freedom and \njustice in southern Africa. We also reaffirm our solidarity with the \nliberation movements of South Africa in their just struggle to free \ntheir homeland from the grip of oppression. In particular, we salute \nthe African National Congress for its significant contribution in \nthis regard. We also take this opportunity to reaffirm our support \nfor the just struggle of the Sahraoui people under the leadership of \nPOLISARIO. In the Middle East the peoples of the region are today \nliving through a terrible nightmare, a nightmare which started with \nthe massive and unprovoked Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June this \nyear. Employing some of the most inhuman methods of mass destruction, \nsuch as cluster and phosphorous bombs, Israeli troops massacred \nthousands of Lebanese and Palestinians, the vast majority of whom \nwere innocent and defenseless civilians. Most recently we were deeply \nshocked by the massacre of Palestinian refugees in the Sabra and \nShatila camps in west Beirut. Israel's aggressive conduct can be \nexplained only in the context of its long standing designs on \nLebanon, namely the dismemberment of Lebanon and the control of the \nLitani River. We demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of \nIsraeli forces from Lebanon in accordance with the relevant \nresolutions of the Security Council and of the General Assembly. \nUganda continues to maintain that the core of the Middle East \nconflict is the question of Palestine. The Middle East cannot know \nany peace until the Palestinian people fully realize their right to \nself  determination and nationhood. The sooner Israel accepts this \nreality, the better for it and for all the communities of the region. \nAn American writer, I. F. Stone, expressed very well a universal \nconcern in an article which appeared in New York Journal of 19 July \n1982 under the title When Tel Aviv Was West Beirut when he stated: \nCan we Jews not recognize the image in our own mirrors? Can we not \nrespond to a kindred people being made homeless once again, first in \nPalestine, now in Lebanon? If a Jewish State in Palestine, why not a \nPalestinian State, too? Who betterthan we should understand \nPalestinian desperation and homelessness? It is in recognition of \nthis fact that Uganda reiterates its unflinching support for the \nPalestinian people and the Palestine Liberation Organization, their \nsole and legitimate representative. It is for the same reason that we \nwelcome and support the proposals adopted at the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference at Fez last month. In our view, those proposals are in \nfull conformity with the various resolutions of the General Assembly \nand the Security Council on the situation in the Middle East. On the \nquestion of Korea, Uganda has always supported the desire of the \nKorean people for the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. \nWe have always maintained that the division of Korea is an injustice \ncommitted against the Korean people through the mechanism of foreign \nintervention. That injustice must be remedied through an early and \npeaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula, free from external \ninterference. While we applaud the positive beginning ushered in by \nthe joint communique of 4 July 1972 we especially welcome the efforts \nof the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea wards \nthe peaceful reunification of Korea. The tragic war between the \nIslamic Republic of Iran and Iraq continues to be a matter of grave \nconcern to us. In our view, the continuation of that conflict is \nclearly not in the interests of either the Iranian or the Iraqi \npeople. We appeal once again to the parties in conflict to abandon \nthe path of war and settle their differences by peaceful means. \nUganda remains concerned about the unhappy situations in Cyprus, \nAfghanistan and Kampuchea, all of which call for negotiated political \nsolutions. The peoples of those countries must be allowed to \ndetermine their own destinies, free from any outside interference. We \nlive in an era in which advances in science and technology have \nplaced in our hands arsenals capable of destroying the world 30 times \nover. Even more ominous is the fact that we live in an era in which \nthe nations that possess those deadly weapons of destruction are \nshowing an increasing willingness to use them to wage limited and \nwinnable nuclear wars. Such talk, needless to say, is cause for grave \nconcern to all peace loving countries and peoples. Our concern has \nbeen heightened by the failure of the Assembly at the second special \nsession on disarmament to adopt concrete measures to eliminate the \ndangers of war, halt and reverse the arms race and adopt a \ncomprehensive programme for disarmament. The peoples of the world had \nplaced high hopes on the outcome of the session. The mammoth rally \nheld here in New York at the time of the session, as well as peace \ndemonstrations all over the world in favor of disarmament, were a \nclear message of international public indignation at the unbridled \narms race and in favor of peace. The failure to adopt concrete \nmeasures tor effective disarmament negotiations was therefore a deep \ndisappointment to all peace loving peoples the world over. Those who \ncontributed to that dismal outcome to the session must take full \nresponsibility for the consequences that may follow. We believe that \nthe deadlock in disarmament negotiations has and will continue to \nhave negative effects on other areas of international cooperation. It \nis therefore of the utmost importance this session of the General \nAssembly find ways and means of breaking the deadlock. In this \nregard, we urge the big Powers to exercise restraint and flexibility \nand to show the necessary political will so as to further the cause \nof peace. We are meeting in the aftermath of the Second United \nNations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer \nSpace, held at Vienna, 9 to 21 August, the report of which is before \nthe Assembly. The potential of outer space represents a valuable \ncommon heritage for mankind. Outer space offers yet another unique \nopportunity for mankind to explore new frontiers with a common \npurpose and for mutual benefit. In the view of my delegation, the \nexploration and exploitation of outer space should proceedon the \nbasis of a cooperative effort determined by an international set of \nbinding principles and rules. The pursuit of cooperative objectives \nand common benefits precludes the promotion of contradictory \ninterests. It is for this reason that my delegation is strongly \nopposed to the militarization of outer space. We urge strict \nadherence to the 1966 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities \nof States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the \nMoon and other Celestial Bodies. On the economic f. the situation is \nequally grave. The global economic crisis, which is characterized by \nrecession and rampant inflation, high interest rates and \nprotectionism in the developed countries on the one hand and a \nserious deterioration in the terms of trade and increasing external \nindebtedness of the developing countries, on the other hand, has \nreached alarming dimensions. The situation has been compounded by the \ndeadlock in international economic negotiations, the arms race and a \ndrastic decline in the transfer of real resources to the developing \ncountries. All those factors have combined to affect adversely the \nworld economy in general and the development of the developing \ncountries in particular. There has, in addition, been a sharp decline \nin the spirit of interdependence and in international cooperation \naimed at finding constructive solutions to present problems. The \nemphasis which is increasingly being given to bilateral arrangements \nby some developed countries at the expense of multilateral \ncooperation has gravely affected the operation of multilateral \nagencies and programmes such as UNDP, and the economies of the \ndeveloping countries. Under these circumstances, the launching of \nglobal negotiations remains one of the most important items on the \nagenda of the General Assembly. The hopes the international community \nhas placed in the General Assembly to ensure that the process of \ncorrecting the structural imbalances in the present world economy is \nembarked upon without any further delay must be realized. As we have \npreviously stated, our frustration has been increased by the glaring \nlack of progress in implementing the decisions unanimously adopted at \nthe sixth special session of the General Assembly, at which a solemn \ncommitment to work for the establishment of the new international \neconomic order was made by all of us. It was therefore with a deep \nsense of disappointment that we witnessed the failure at the thirty \nsixth session to break the impasse in the launching of global \nnegotiations. In this regard Uganda is of the view that General \nAssembly resolution 34/138 of 14 December 1979, which was accepted by \nthe international community as a whole, is the appropriate basis for \nlaunching the global negotiations. We appeal to those countries that \nare stalling to join the consensus on the need for an early launching \nof those negotiations. The present economic problems must not prevent \nus from charting a more stable and reliable path to meaningful \ninternational economic cooperation for development. If the global \nround of negotiations is not launched soon, we fear that there will \ncontinue to be increasing difficulties in other forthcoming \nnegotiations such as those at the sixth session of UNCTAD and the \nfourth session of UNIDO. Indeed, the success or failure of the thirty \nseventh session will be judged by whether or not we can generate \nadequate political will to bring about a breakthrough for the \nlaunching of global negotiations. As one of the least developed \ncountries, Uganda attaches great importance to the Substantial New \nProgramme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries \nadopted in Paris last year? for the purpose of arresting the economic \ndeterioration of the least developed countries. We believe that its \nspeedy and successful implementation requires a deeper sense of \ncommitment to substantial resource focus on the least developed \ncountries, especially on the part of the developed countries, \ninternational financial institutions and United Nations agencies. We \nare very concerned that no agreement has sofar been reached on the \ntwin critical issues of specific additional and adequate financial \ntargets for new and renewable sources of energy and the establishment \nof an energy affiliate of the World Bank. We hope, however, that the \nconsultative mechanism contained in the Rome compromise for the \nmobilization of finance and the transfer of technology to the \ndeveloping countries will receive the necessary international \nsupport. We have for a long time accepted that international measures \nof assistance are only supportive and cannot indeed, should not be a \nsubstitute for efforts by the developing counties themselves. In this \nregard we commend the efforts of the developing countries to \nimplement the Caracas Programme of Action. The seriousness with which \na number of Group of 77 sectorial meetings with regard to the \nimplementation of the Caracas Programme of Action have been \nundertaken is evidence that the spirit of Caracas continues to grow. \n39. Uganda remains committed to the strengthening of economic \ncooperation among developing countries as an essential component of \nthe new international economic order and as an effective means of \nenhancing the collective self reliance of the developing countries. \nIn Africa we are trying to foster economic cooperation under the \nLagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy \nfor Mie Economic Development of Africa. The international community \nshould assist Africa in its efforts to implement the Lagos Plan of \nAction, which we hope will in time secure the economic integration of \nthe continent. The year 1982 has been characterized by an increase in \narmed conflicts, escalation if the arms race, the persistence of \npotentially explosive territorial disputes; lingering colonialism and \nforeign interference and intervention. Unbridled big Power rivalry \nand the quest for spheres of dominance have continued to fuel the \nhotbeds of world tension. This increasing world tension has had a \nvery negative impact on the work of the United Nations. It is against \nthis background that we salute and commend the Secretary General for \nhis bold and refreshing report on the work of the Organization. As a \nmember of the Security Council, Uganda is familiar with the trend \nthat has led to the steady erosion of the Security Council's \nauthority and effectiveness. My delegation is of the view that the \nSecretary General's report deserves formal consideration by both the \nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, in order to work out \nconcrete measures to improve the effectiveness of the United Nations. \nUganda celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its independence last \nSaturday, 9 October 1982. In two weeks' time it will be 20 years \nsince Uganda was admitted as the one hundred and tenth Member of the \nUnited Nations. On this memorable occasion I should like to recall \nwhat the President of the Republic of Uganda A. Milton Obote, said \nfrom this rostrum at the seventeenth session 20 years ago with regard \nto the international situation: I am very conscious that Uganda joins \nthe Organization at a time when humanity is at the crossroads of \ndestiny, when great nations are re arming With the most devastating \nweapons ever known, when the world Organization and the world at \nlarge are ridden with ideological conflicts and the continuing \neffects of the cold war, and when vast resources that should be used \nfor the alleviation of human misery are being channeled into nuclear \narmaments. Today the world seems dark, but these darkening scenes, \nwe, as a new Member, pray, should not discourage us in the ability of \nthe Member nations present here to realize the shortcomings of this \nOrganization and to pledge their faith in its ability as the only \npositive hope for the restoration of sanity and peace among the \nnations of the world. Those remarks remain very pertinent today, \nindeed more so than in 1962. As we enter the third decade of our \nindependence. I wish to reaffirm, on behalf of the Government and \npeople of Uganda, our full commitment to the purposes and principles \nof the Charter of the United Nations and our faith in the ability of \nthe Organization to develop the capacity to save present and future \ngenerations from the scourge of war.\n"

        "file_text": "I have great pleasure, Sir, on behalf of the \nGovernment of Cape Verde, in carrying out the \npleasant duty of extending to you our warmest \ncongratulations on your election to the \npresidency of this thirty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly. Your well-known statesmanlike \nqualities and your experience in the diplomatic \narena are an earnest of the positive role which \nwe are confident you will play during your term \nof office. We wish to express to your \npredecessor, Mr. Kittani, our great appreciation \nof the manner in which he carried out the onerous \nduties involved in guiding the proceedings of the \nthirty-sixth session, which dealt with problems \ncrucial to the future of the world. We should \nlike to take this opportunity also to wish Mr. \nPerez de Cuellar every success in the performance \nof his difficult task and to express to him our \nappreciation of the efforts he has made since \ntaking office to reduce world tension, strengthen \nthe credibility of the Organization and \nconsolidate its foundations.\nThe decades which followed the founding of the \nUnited Nations may be described as decades of \nstruggle for the application of one of its \nfundamental principles: the right to \nself-determination and independence of colonized \ncountries and peoples. It has been a titanic \nstruggle, on the scale of whole continents, a \nstruggle of whose results the United Nations can \nwell be proud.\nThe present international situation, marked by a \nproliferation of sources of tension and armed \nconfrontation and also by a gradual return to \nforce as the primary instrument in international \nrelations, contains elements which pose a threat \nto peace and impede the economic and social \ndevelopment of peoples. The refusal to accept the \ninexorable evolution of international relations \ntowards the strengthening of the links of \neconomic interdependence between the various \nparts of the world and between different social \nand political systems is undeniably the outcome \nof the perpetuation of that situation. This \ninterdependence, which presupposes a global \neffort to overcome the existing condition of \ncrisis, cannot be said to be compatible with the \nspecific interests of a particular country or \ngroup of countries. More than ever before the \nmoral conscience of the peoples of the world \ndemands that relations of domination be replaced \nonce and for all by relations of co-operation, \nforce by dialogue and the risk of confrontation \nby stability, security in international relations \nand, finally, peace.\nThe Government of Cape Verde, for its part, is \nsparing no effort to ensure the achievement of \nthese objectives, not only because they are in \nkeeping with the wishes of the people of Cape \nVerde but also because it is convinced that to do \nso is in the interests of the whole of mankind \nand in accord with humanity's aspirations. The \nGovernment of Cape Verde therefore bases its \nactions on stubborn defense of the principles of \nnon-alignment and the Charter, the search for \nfruitful co-operation with all peace-loving \nnations and States which respect international \nlaw, the promotion of domestic economic and \nsocial development and the defense of all its \nprerogatives of sovereignty and independence of \nthought and action.\nThe African continent, which over the past few \ndecades has gradually found its way back to \nsovereignty and independence, is today in the \ngrip of profound upheavals due to the delicate \nstage in the evolution of its society and the \nemancipation of its peoples. Those upheavals, \nwhile reflecting an unshakeable will for change \nand a persistent effort to meet the requirements \nof the times, are nevertheless accompanied by \ninhibitions and uncertainties, indicating the \nlimits and weaknesses of this movement, which is \non the rise, which is in progress now and which \nshould allow Africa to develop its potential and \nguarantee its peoples the realization of their \nmost legitimate aspirations.\nThe economic crisis, which is particularly \naffecting our continent, has made political \ninstability more likely, and this undermines the \nbasis of coordinated and integrated economic \ndevelopment at the regional and sub-regional \nlevels. Situations of war or confrontation \nbetween States of the continent undermine \nconfidence between our peoples, jeopardize \nAfrican unity and facilitate external \ninterference, threatening our sovereignty and \nindependence, which were won at such cost.\nAmong the crucial problems affecting the southern \npart of the African continent, the question of \nNamibia and the persistence of apartheid in South \nAfrica have an important place, because of their \nimplications for Africa and for the world. In \nspite of the persistent efforts of the \ninternational community, reflected in the many \nSecurity Council resolutions and in the positions \ntaken by the non-aligned movement and by the \nOrganization of African Unity, Namibia continues \nto be occupied by South Africa. Recent \ninitiatives to promote the application of \nSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978) have \nencountered difficulties of all kinds, including \ndelaying tactics by South Africa, intended not \nonly to create conditions favorable to a \nconditional independence but also to destabilize \nneighboring sovereign States. We hope that the \ncurrent talks on the question will soon produce \nresults, finally permitting the Namibian people \nto be masters of their own destiny and to occupy \ntheir proper place in the Assembly.\nThe independence of Namibia is the collective \nresponsibility of all the States Members of the \nUnited Nations. We should therefore substantially \nincrease our support for the South West Africa \nPeople's Organization, for the valiant Namibian \nfreedom fighters and for the front-line \nStates\u2014particularly the People's Republic of \nAngola, which has spared no effort and has shrunk \nfrom no sacrifice\u2014so that our duty and \nresponsibility towards the Namibian people shall \nnot be thwarted by South Africa.\nThe final declaration of the recent conference of \nheads of State of Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea- \nBissau, Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe, \nheld in Praia, Cape Verde, on 21 and 22 September \nthis year, stated that making Namibia's \nindependence conditional on the withdrawal of \nCuban forces from Angola constituted flagrant \ninterference in the internal affairs of a State \nMember of the United Nations and was contrary to \nthe spirit and the letter of resolution 435 \n(1978). Similarly, destabilization measures taken \nagainst the front-line States, designed to deter \nthem from giving decisive support to the \nliberation of Namibia, undeniably reflect a \ndesire to perpetuate colonial domination over \nthat Territory.\nNo one can any longer doubt that South Africa is \ndirecting, financing and materially supporting a \nlarge-scale destabilization operation against the \nwhole southern region of the African continent, \nwith particular emphasis on the People's Republic \nof Angola and the People's Republic of \nMozambique. Since its independence in 1975 the \nPeople's Republic of Angola has never known \npeace. Its wish to bring about its development \nand its efforts to reconstruct the country have \nbeen systematically thwarted by the criminal \nactions of the troops of the South African racist \nregime, which have been invading and destroying \nthat country on various pretexts.\nWe flatly reject the avowed encouragement of, and \nsupport for, the armed gangs that operate on \nMozambique territory in order to create a climate \nof permanent instability. That action constitutes \na flagrant violation of the most elementary norms \ngoverning coexistence between nations.\nThe inhuman system of apartheid is becoming ever \nmore arrogant and aggressive. Acts repugnant to \nthe conscience of mankind continue to be carried \nout under it, and its constitutes an intolerable \ndefiance of the repeated decisions of, and \nconstant appeals from, the United Nations system.\nIn North Africa a fratricidal war is still going \non. Apart from its destruction of human life and \nproperty, it threatens, by its very scale, peace \nand security in the region. I am speaking of the \nconflict between the Sahraoui Arab Democratic \nRepublic and the Kingdom of Morocco. In spite of \nthe difficulties in resolving the conflict within \nthe framework of the OAU, the need to bring about \na cease-fire and to bring the two parties to the \nnegotiating table, in accordance with the \nrelevant resolutions of the OAU and the United \nNations, has become urgent. The fact that the \nSahraoui Arab Democratic Republic is today \nrecognized by almost a third of the members of \nthe international community shows the justice of \nits struggle and the international support \nenjoyed by the Sahraoui people.\nThe situation of the OAU today well illustrates \nthe dangers now threatening international \norganizations which serve as instruments for the \nliberation and emancipation of peoples. The \nparalysis of and the explosive situation in the \nOAU are reflections of the deliberate offensive \nundertaken by forces which are counting on \nsplitting Africa and thus weakening it, with the \nobvious goal of consolidating foreign interest in \nthe continent, strengthening the apartheid regime \nand impeding the consolidation of the \nindependence of African States.\nHowever, we are convinced that the moves at \npresent being undertaken will bring about a \nresumption of dialogue and the beginnings of a \nsolution which would preserve the cohesiveness \nand effectiveness of our continental \norganization, because the survival of the OAU is \nwithout any doubt of capital importance for all \nthe African States and peoples.\nThe problems that must be confronted by the OAU \nhave a varying impact, but they also have an \neffect on the collective security of mankind and \non other international organizations, including \nthe United Nations itself.\nWe note with apprehension the undesirable \ntendency to relegate the United Nations to a \nsecondary role in the resolution of conflicts and \nwhen it is a matter of defusing tensions which \nendanger world peace and security. Indeed, the \nresolutions and recommendations of the supreme \norgans of the Organization have been \nsystematically ignored; instead, what we have \nseen are accomplished and the use of force. Acts \nof this kind impede the just and final settlement \nof conflicts by keeping them latent, and this in \nturn makes them chronic and periodically \nexplosive. The United Nations and the principles \non which it is founded are the fruit of the \nundeniable moral progress of mankind and \ntherefore provide the appropriate and reliable \nframework for the just solutions of the conflicts \nwhich plague us.\nThe Secretary-General, in the thorough and \ncourageous report on the work of the \nOrganization, devoted a large part of his text to \nan assessment of the functioning of the \nOrganization and the denunciation of situations \nand attitudes which reduce its effectiveness. His \nanalysis should give considerable food for \nthought to all Member States which believe in the \nunique and irreplaceable role of the United \nNations in the defense and promotion of \ninternational peace and security. For small \ncountries like my own whose military capacity is \nmerely symbolic compared with the vast \ndestructive power accumulated by the great \nPowers, the effectiveness of and strict respect \nfor international law and United Nations \ndecisions are of vital importance, because our \nsurvival depends on recourse to dialogue to \nresolve conflicts between States.\nIn this sense, and in keeping with the concern \nexpressed by the Secretary-General in his report, \nmy Government supports all initiatives designed \nto strengthen the effectiveness of the United \nNations, which is the forum par\tfor concerted \nwork and collective action for the maintenance of \npeace and security.\nOver the past few months we have witnessed \nunprecedented exacerbation of the Middle East \ncrisis because of the aggression against and \noccupation of Lebanese territory, as well as the \nmassacre of civilians carried out by Israeli \ntroops in a vain attempt to drown the Palestinian \npeople in blood and crush their heroic \nresistance. We reaffirm our conviction that it \nwill be possible to reach a final solution only \nwhen Israel withdraws from all the Arab \nterritories occupied since 1967, including \nJerusalem, and with the participation of the PLO, \nthe sole legitimate representative of the \nPalestinian people, on an equal footing with all \nthe otherparties concerned, in all negotiations \non the solution of the Middle East problem.\nWe wish to pay a sincere tribute to the \nprogressive forces in Lebanon and the freedom \nfighters of the PLO. Through their heroism and \ntheir sense of dignity they have increased the \nstature of the Arab nation and proved, with the \nblood of its martyrs, t'<at peace in this region \nwill be possible only when the Palestinian people \nare able to exercise their inalienable national \nrights, including the right to establish their \nown State.\nThe United Nations, in keeping with the \ninitiatives of the non-aligned movement and the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference in \nparticular, should persist in its efforts to put \nan end to the Iraqi-Iranian war, promote the \nestablishment of peace and bring stability to \nthis area.\nSimilarly, in South-East Asia, efforts must be \nmade to establish a climate of peace and \ngood-neighborliness.\nIn East Timor the occupying Power has not \nsucceeded in stifling the aspirations of the \nMaubere people to independence and dignity. We \nremain convinced that the international community \ncannot tolerate a situation in which the politics \nof accommodation is raised to the status of law, \nand will assist the heroic people of East Timor \nin its struggle for self- determination and \nindependence, under the leadership of the Frente \nRevolucionaria de Timor Leste Independente, its \nsole legitimate representative.\nThe international community, and in particular \nPortugal, as administering Power, should continue \ntheir efforts to mobilize all possible resources \nto ensure that the Indonesian occupation forces \nwithdraw immediately from the Territory of East \nTimor. The international community should not \ntolerate a situation in which selfish interests \nand agreements replace honor, morality and law, \nthus denying by force of arms the political and \ncultural identity of a whole people which has \nproved that it is ready to make the supreme \nsacrifice to liberate its homeland.\nThe persistence of other crisis situations in the \nworld in no way contributes to the attainment of \nthe noble goals of the Organization in Cyprus, we \nstill await a solution which would preserve the \nrights of the two communities and the unity, \nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of that \nnon-aligned country.\nIn Afghanistan, respect for the right of the \nAfghan people freely to choose its own destiny \nshould promote the restoration of stability and \npermit that people to continue its work of \nbuilding a prosperous society.\nThe situation in the Indian Ocean region \ncontinues to arouse the greatest concern, \nparticularly among the coastal countries. \nEverything possible should be done within the \nUnited Nations to transform the Indian Ocean into \na zone of peace, in keeping with the aspirations \nof these countries and the wishes of the \ninternational community at large.\nSimilarly, the heroic Korean people has been \npersevering in its efforts to bring about the \npeaceful reunification of its country. To ensure \nthe exercise of this legitimate right concrete \nmeasures must be taken, in accordance with the \nprinciples and recommendations of the non-aligned \nmovement, in particular those concerning the \nreplacement of the armistice agreement by a peace \nagreement, non-interference in internal affairs \nand the complete withdrawal of foreign troops \nfrom Korean territory. We believe that these \nconditions must be met if the peaceful \nreunification of Korea is to be achieved and true \nnational unity established.\nIn Central America there continue to persist \nalarming situations which contradict the most \nelementary norms of international law and \nconstitute defiance of the objectives of the \nCharter.\nThe arms race, which is reactivating the policy \nof confrontation and tension, and which \nengendered the cold war, is undermining the \nprinciples laid down in the Charter and its noble \nideals of peace, justice and progress. At its \ntwelfth special session the General Assembly \nfound that the development of the situation since \n1978 had not met the hopes aroused at its tenth \nspecial session. Indeed the Programme of Action \ncontained in the Final Document of the Tenth \nSpecial Session of the General Assembly remains \nlargely unimplemented. Although some progress has \nbeen achieved in negotiations, we cannot but note \nthat the arms race, and in particular the nuclear \narms race, has assumed dangerous proportions, and \nmilitary expenditures have increased \nconsiderably. We subscribe whole-heartedly to the \nconclusions of the twelfth special session on \ndisarmament and support the comprehensive \nprogramme of disarmament drafted by the General \nAssembly at that session, which constitutes an \nimportant step towards general and complete \ndisarmament under international control.\n\nIf they are to be lasting, international peace \nand security cannot be built upon the \naccumulation of arms; nor can they be maintained \nthrough the precarious balance of deterrence or \ndoctrines based on strategic supremacy. We \ncontinue to believe that the creation of \nconditions favorable to disarmament and the \nstrengthening of peaceful coexistence, together \nwith a global development effort, are the key to \nthe collective security of the world.\nCape Verde, whose foreign policy is based on \nnon-alignment, will continue to work for the \nimplementation of the principles proclaimed by \nthe United Nations, an essential task of the \npresent time that is the responsibility and \nindeed the duty of all States represented here.\nThe various elements of the international \nsituation are so closely interconnected that a \nrealistic analysis of the present situation must \nbe global in nature. In any ease, the concept of \npeace cannot possibly be dissociated from the \nequality of nations, the independence and \nsovereignty of all States and the right to the \nsocial and economic development of the world's \npeoples.\nWe cannot claim to be working for peace in the \nworld as long as there are people living under \nsubhuman conditions. It is in this context that \nwe wish to express our concern at the evolution \nof the international economic situation marked by \na generalized crisis which further exacerbates \nthe present injustice of the international \neconomic order. Inflation, high interest rates, \nprotectionism, unemployment, the reduction and \nindeed the dislocation of economic growth and \neconomic activities are all factors that have a \ndangerous impact on developing countries.\nAlthough the present situation entails a serious \nrisk of driving the international economic system \ntowards uncontrollable imbalance, there are some \nwho see in this an additional reason not to \nembark on genuine negotiations, sartorially or \nglobally, with the developing countries and thus \ndisregard the interdependence of the economies of \nthe North and the South. Furthermore this fails \nto take account of the fact that collective \nsecurity can be achieved only through an adequate \nresponse to the unjust situation created by \ncurrent international economic relations and the \npersistence of a framework of economic relations \ndating from colonial times.\nNo one can remain indifferent to the \ninternational economic crisis\u2014certainly not those \nwho are suffering most severely from its effects \nand whose development has been severely thwarted \nby this crisis. That is why we note with \napprehension the delay in opening global \nnegotiations and implementing the International \nDevelopment Strategy for the Third United Nations \nDevelopment Decade. The wish of the developing \ncountries to start global negotiations in \naccordance with General Assembly resolution \n34/138, which was adopted by consensus, stems \nfrom the fact that for them these negotiations \nare by no means futile initiatives. On the \ncontrary, they have to be reflected in tangible \nresults, in an improvement of their standard of \nliving, particularly with regard to food, health, \neducation and culture and the restructuring of \ninternational economic relations.\nRecently we had occasion to note with great \nconcern the undermining of the conditions for the \nrealization of the objectives of international \neconomic cooperation for development. We should \nlike to stress particularly the relative decline \nin the level of contributions to financial \ninstitutions within the United Nations system, \nespecially UNDP, an agency that makes an \nimportant contribution to developing countries. \nIn this regard we would recall the recent appeal \nmade in the Final Declaration of the Foreign \nMinisters of the Group of 77 on the imperative \nneed to make a firm start on the strengthening of \nmultilateral economic co-operation.\nEconomic co-operation among developing countries \nis an important factor in international economic \nrelations. This co-operation, which cannot be \nviewed as an alternative to North-South \nco-operation, was strengthened by the meetings in \nArusha, Buenos Aires and, most recently, Caracas. \nWe welcome the additional momentum given to this \nco-operation through the Caracas Programme of \nAction and at subsequent meetings.\nOne year ago we expressed the wish that the last \nscheduled session for negotiations on the Third \nUnited Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea \nshould really be the final one. Today, after \nseveral years of difficult negotiation, the \nConference has succeeded in adopting the \nConvention it drafted. The adoption of the \nConvention by a great majority of countries is an \nimportant victory for the international community \nand also represents an important step towards the \nestablishnent of a new legal regime governing the \noceans.\nWe believe that the Convention protects the \ninterests of all countries and represents an \ninstrument of justice, peace, development and \nco-operation among States. Despite the complexity \nof the subject- matter and of the various \ninterests involved, the text of the Convention \nwas negotiated by consensus and is the result of \nthe balance that proved possible among the \ninterests of each and every one. That is why we \nhope that all countries will be able to sign the \nFinal Act and, if possible, sign the Convention \nitself at the session of the Conference that is \nscheduled for December.\nWe deplore any unilateral or multilateral \ninitiative aimed at exploiting the resources of \nthe sea-bed outside the framework negotiated at \nthe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of \nthe Sea.\nCape Verde belongs to the group of least \ndeveloped countries, which was the subject of the \nConference held last September in Paris. At that \nConference the Substantial New Programme of \nAction for the 1980s for the Least Developed \nCountries was adopted. We believe that the \nConference was a significant stage in the \ndifficult process of dialogue between the \ncountries of the North and of the South, and we \nwelcome the objectives set forth. The achievement \nof those objectives will be a response to the \nproblems facing the least developed countries, \nwhose economic situation has deteriorated in \ncomparison not only with the rich countries but \nalso with the developing countries.\nWe hope that the strengthening of selfish \nnationalism and the deterioration in \ninternational economic relations will not become \nserious obstacles to the implementation of the \ndecisions of the Paris Conference.\nCape Verde, with the support of UNDP and pursuant \nto the decisions of the Paris Conference, \norganized a round table with its partners in \ndevelopment from 21 to 23 June, at Praia. This \nmeeting helped not only to reconcile my country's \nneeds with what its partners could offer, but \nalso to explore procedures making possible a \ntangible improvement in the effectiveness of \nofficial development assistance for Cape Verde.\nThe head of Government of the Republic of Cape \nVerde, in opening the discussions at the round \ntable, established a framework for this work and \ndescribed our concept of development, in the \nfollowing terms:\n\\\"The option of development in independence and \ndignity is a strictly national option. We are \nsure that the people of Cape Verde alone can \nprovide the driving force for their own progress \nand we are determined to take up our self-imposed \ntask in a responsible and consistent manner.\n\\\"Nevertheless, in view of the scanty means \navailable to us for remedying our difficult \neconomic situation, it would be impossible for us \nto overcome our current problems and build a \nviable economy without the firm and programmed \nsupport of the international community.\n\\\"Accordingly, we do not perceive external aid \nmerely as a means of alleviating the tragic \nburden of the colonial legacy, or mitigating the \neffects of recurring crises, or binding our \nwounds in emergencies. We see it, at the present \nstage of our economic and social development, as \nsomething stable, programmed and rationalized, \nadjusted to the imperatives, arising from the \nprocess of establishing viable productive \nstructures for our country.\\\"\nIt is within this framework of mutual \nresponsibility, not to say collective \nresponsibility, that we believe that actions to \npermit our people to enjoy their right to food, \neducation, health and justice should find their \nproper place.\nConsequently Cape Verde attaches great importance \nto dialogue and co-operative efforts, with due \nrespect for the choice of each of us in resolving \nproblems connected with official development \nassistance which, in our view, must be \npredictable, guaranteed and adapted to the real \nneeds and development options of our country.\nWe think that the international community should \nconcern itself with improving the modalities of \nassistance, in order to facilitate disbursements \nand to make external aid a real support for the \nefforts of our peoples to transform the harsh \ncircumstances they have to overcome. Apart from \nthe adverse effects of the international economic \nsituation, Cape Verde must also deal with a \nseries of unfavorable circumstances, such as the \nlack of productive structures, and the existence \nof such natural handicaps as the fact of being an \nisland with a mountainous terrain and, above all, \ndrought, which this year again has left my \ncountry severely stricken and led to the loss of \nalmost all our crops.\nI should therefore like to take this opportunity \nto thank, on behalf of the Government and the \npeople of Cape Verde, all those who continue to \nhelp relieve the heavy burden of underdevelopment \ninherited from the colonial period and worsened \nby natural catastrophes.\nCape Verde attaches particular importance to the \nPermanent Inter-State Committee on Drought \nControl in the Sahel, of which the President of \nthe Republic of Cape Verde, Mr. Aristides \nPereira, is the current Chairman. The efforts of \nthe member countries of this Committee to fight \nagainst the scourge of drought are well known to \nthe international community. Nevertheless, we \nmust recognize that these efforts are not \nsufficient, in the light of the disastrous \neffects of natural catastrophes, particularly in \nterms of the steady deterioration of the soil of \na group of countries which are regarded as among \nthe most impoverished on our planet. Consequently \nwe are confident that the international community \nwill not neglect to strengthen its assistance to \nthe peoples of the Sahel, who are involved in an \narduous struggle to safeguard their food and \ntheir development.\nDespite the deadly conflicts, endless crises and \ncontinuing supply threats afflicting mankind, we \ncan see real progress in some areas. That fact, \ntogether with our confidence in man and in his \ncapacity to overcome his weaknesses, give us the \nhope and the conviction that the international \ncommunity will find ways and means of eliminating \nthe nuclear threat, transforming the system of \nunjust relations which prevails today in the \nworld, enabling the most impoverished to achieve \ntheir aspirations, and bringing peace and \nprogress with justice.\nIt is therefore a matter of urgency that the \nability of the United Nations to take action be \nstrengthened and that the implementation of its \ndecisions and recommendations by all Member \nStates be assured. Relations among peoples, based \non a new concept of moral, political and legal \nphenomena, will be increasingly in keeping with \nmankind's ambitions, will make a contribution to \nits emancipation and will guarantee the \never-growing role of the United Nations system. \nIn conclusion, we should like to express our hope \nthat the work of this thirty-seventh session will \nfulfil the expectations of the international \ncommunity, and especially of those whose right to \nlive in freedom and dignity has been infringed.\n"

We wish you \nand the Secretary- General full success in your \nresponsible work.\n92.\tThis is the second time in the last four \nmonths that we have met to consider developments \nthroughout the world and seek ways of joining \nforces as effectively as possible for the \nimplementation of the noble prin\u00acciples of the \nCharter. However, this time again it is with a \nfeeling of considerable concern that we are \nforced to note that the current international \nsituation con\u00actinues to be alarming and complex. \nWe are deeply convinced that this cooling of the \npolitical climate did not have to occur at all. \nThere are not nor can there be any rational \ngrounds for it. The policy of detente, after all, \nhas asserted itself as a clearly demonstrable \nhistoric achievement of nations.\n93.\tUnfortunately, for certain circles of \nimperialism and reaction the departure from such \na generally beneficial policy and attempts to \nreturn to the practices of the cold war have \nbecome virtually a line of policy. What \ninventions they manage to come up with Just as in \nthe years of the witch hunts, today, again, their \nagents are trying to resurrect the specter of \ncom\u00acmunism, looking for its long arm in \neverything bad; and, not unlike inquisitors, they \nare accusing the socialist countries of all the \ndeadly sins, with the absurd intention of getting \nthem to the stake reserved for heretics. They are \ndoing their utmost to disrupt the \nmilitary-strategic balance\u2014that basis of \nstability in today's world\u2014and to shift it to \ntheir benefit. They are constantly launching new \nrounds of the arms race.

They are \nusing methods of pressure, blackmail, force, \naggression, barbarity and genocide wherever \ncircumstances still permit them to do so.\n94.\tThe deterioration of the international \nsituation is therefore not the result of forces \nbeyond our control. It is determined by quite \nconcrete deeds of quite concrete Governments, h \nis consequently the duty of every Member of this \nworld Organization to do everything possible to \nsafeguard reliably and effec\u00actively the most \nfundamental human right\u2014the right to life. The \npossibilities in this respect are great and the \nwill of the peoples to live in peace is \nindefatigable. That is why the policy of detente, \nthanks to the deep and strong roots it has taken, \nespecially in Europe, can and must go on and must \ncontinue to bear fruit. This assertion is \nsupported by demonstrable facts.\n93. First, all the commitments embodied in the \nFinal Act of the Conference on Security and \nCo-operation in Europe, signed at Helsinki in \n1975, remain in force, and to their full extent. \nThey are in no sense archival documents, as some \nmight prefer. On the contrary, they continue to \nserve as a living code, tested in practice, and \nas a reliable compass for the policies of the \nmajority of European States.\n96.\tSecondly, important bilateral and \nmultilateral agreements are being carried out. \nThese form a time- tested international legal \nbasis which is an irreplace\u00acable factor in the \nconstruction of a peaceful Europe. Among them let \nus in particular recall the treaties concluded by \nthe Soviet Union, Poland, the German Democratic \nRepublic and Czechoslovakia with the Federal \nRepublic of Germany, and the four-Power Agreement \non West Berlin.\n97.\tThirdly, the political dialogue between \nEast and West continues in an effort to \nstrengthen the infra\u00acstructure of both European \nand international detente. The mechanisms \nestablished to seek a reduction of military \nconfrontation and to strengthen mutual \nunderstanding and confidence in the interest of \nmore reliable stability and security continue to \nfunction.\n98.\tFourthly, the wide-ranging and \ntime-tested mechanism of consultation on each \nother's positions, which at first sight sometimes \nare apparently irrecon\u00accilable, is being \nconsolidated and expanded in order to preserve \nand further activate the spirit and letter of the \nHelsinki Final Act.\n99.\tFifthly, despite all artificial obstacles \nand dis\u00accriminatory measures, Europe-wide \ncommercial and economic co-operation continues. \nThe implementation of the gas-pipeline contract, \nthe biggest project of this century tackling the \nenergy problems of Europe, is the latest example \nof that co-operation.\n100.\tSixthly, the dialogue in the fields of \nculture, education, information and human \ncontacts continues.\n101.\tSeventhly, the anti-war and anti-nuclear \nmove\u00acment is becoming a dynamic factor in the \nEuropean political climate.\n102.\tIt can thus be noted with satisfaction \nthat those who are trying to devalue detente have \nnot been successful and are not succeeding now. \nThis valuable asset can undoubtedly be further \nenhanced qualita\u00actively and expanded \ngeographically if responsible statesmen display \nsufficient political will to do so.\n103.\tThe great profitability of the policy of \ndetente and the fact that it is beneficial for \nall are, after all, best attested to by the \nexample of Europe, that obviously most stable \nregion of our uneasy planet. Thanks precisely to \ndetente, some remarkable and salubrious changes \nhave occurred in Central Europe, where \nCzechoslovakia is located, in that ancient \ncritical area which has been the epicenter of two \ndestructive world wars. Above all, there is a new \nawareness that, for the first time in European \nhistory, the peoples of our continent have seized \nthe historic opportunity of creating practical \nconditions for peace, security and peaceful \nco-operation, and have done so despite all \nexisting political, economic, philosophical and \nsocial differences.\n104.\tCzechoslovakia, too, has contributed its \nshare to the creation of this accomplishment, \nwhich histori\u00accally is completely new. As was \nalready observed at the Helsinki Conference by \nour President, Gustav Husak, it has helped to \ncreate an important element of stability which is \nin such sharp contrast to the pre-war history of \nconstant conflict and tension, in particular in \nthe central part of Europe.\n105.\tThe normalization achieved between \nCzecho\u00acslovakia and the Federal Republic of \nGermany and the continuing fruitful development \nof mutually advantageous relations based on it \nhave become an important factor in the system of \nEuropean security. This is true also with respect \nto the normalization of relations with Austria: \nsince pending questions have been resolved, a \nrich structure of mutual con\u00actacts, including \npolitical contacts at the highest level, has been \ncreated and peaceful co-operation on our \ncontinent has thus been strengthened. Our \ncom\u00acprehensive co-operation with Finland \nrepresents a logical implementation of the Final \nAct. Our joint search with France for new ways of \ndeveloping relations also offers hope. Our \nrelations with Greece, the Republic of Cyprus and \nLuxembourg are unde\u00acniably of benefit to detente.\n106.\tAfter many years of negotiations with \nother signatories to the Helsinki documents\u2014the \nUnited States and the United Kingdom\u2014negotiations \nbegan immediately after the Helsinki Conference, \nthe question of Czechoslovakia's monetary gold \nhas been resolved. Agreements were signed last \nJanuary between Czechoslovakia and the United \nStates and between Czechoslovakia and the United \nKingdom on compensation for claims and the \nsettlement of financial issues which had \nencumbered our relations with those countries \nsince the end of the Second World War. In \nFebruary part of the 18.4 ton gold treasure \nstolen during the occupation of Czechoslovakia by \nthe Hitlerites was returned by Washington and \nLondon to Prague. Thus one of the last \noutstanding issues remaining from the time of the \nSecond World War was resolved and a serious \nobstacle removed from the path to the \nnormalization of our relations, in particular \nwith the United States. In this, too, we see \nconfirmation of the fact that, given good will on \nboth sides, there are no insoluble problems.\n107.\tIn the past we have constantly pointed \nout the mutual benefits resulting from what we \nhave come to call the materialization of detente. \nThis is borne out by facts. Suffice it to mention \nthat there has been a more than six fold mutually \nbalanced increase in trade between the socialist \nand the capitalist States in the last 10 years. \nCzechoslovakia's share in this useful exchange \nwith advanced capitalist countries repre\u00acsented a \ntrade turnover last year of more than $6 billion.\n108.\tA similar picture is to be seen in \ncultural, educational and scientific contacts. We \nhave maintained from the very beginning that \nprogress in this field contributes to mutual \ncultural enrichment and growing mutual \nconfidence. The number of these projects places \nour country in the top ranks of the participants \nin the Helsinki Final Act. In the last 10 years \nour cultural exchanges have doubled in volume. \nLast year, for instance, this represented 100,000 \npersons\u201455,000 of them travelling from \nCzechoslovakia abroad and 45,000 foreigners \nvisiting Czechoslovakia on the basis of more than \n70 existing cultural agreements. We have been \norganizing numerous prestigious international \ncultural projects in our country, such as the \n\\\"Days of Culture\\\" of Finland, Belgium, Mexico and \nTunisia, or the recent successful \\\"Days of \nCulture of the Federal Republic of Germany in \nCzechoslovakia\\\"\u2014the first such project in the \nhistory of the two States\u2014or the \\\"Days of Culture \nof Austria in Czechoslovakia\\\" that are being \nprepared for next year. In this way we can say \nthat virtually every day the culture of some of \nthe Western participants in the Helsinki \nConference is present in Czechoslovakia. Of \ncourse, all those are but a few examples of the \nviability and future- oriented nature of the \npolicy of detente.\n109.\tIn the conditions of the nuclear age \nthere is no other reasonable alternative to \npeaceful coexistence in relations among States. \nThere can be no doubt about the truth of this \nconclusion. A return to the cold war, \nconfrontation or a flight from the nuclear threat \ninto stone age caves are certainly not Mason- \nable alternatives. This is the main motive of the \nsearch for answers to the key questions of today \nand tomorrow: How can war be eliminated from the \nlife of society? How can a nuclear catastrophe be \naverted? How can we assert and develop what we \nhave in common and not what divides us? After \nall, the high\u00acest values are at stake here, and \nHamlet's \\\"To be or not to be\\\" is appropriate, in \nthe sense of whether the most basic conditions \nnecessary for life on this planet will be \npreserved. In the historic answer to these \nquestions we must not admit a shadow of doubt. \nLet us therefore answer unequivocally, \ndefinitively and resolutely.\n110.\tAs was said from the rostrum of the \nAssembly at the twelfth special session, the \nsecond special session devoted to disarmament, \nthe preparation of a nuclear war must be stepped. \nWe therefore fully support the commitment made by \nthe Soviet Union not to be the first to use \nnuclear weapons, a commit\u00acment contained in the \nmessage of the highest Soviet representative, \nLeonid Ilyich Brezhnev, addressed to the Assembly \nat that recent session . We value this highly as \na truly historic deed which, if emulated by the \nother nuclear Powers, would free the world from \nthe danger of the use of nuclear weapons. It is \nthis attitude to nuclear war which we consider to \nbe a decisive criterion when judging the degree \nof responsibility with which individual States\u20144n \nparticular the countries in the North Atlantic \nTreaty organization [NATO] and, above all, the \nUnited States\u2014approach the safeguarding of \npeaceful life on our planet.\n111.\tAs for the allegation that this \nobligation ignores conventional weapons, let us \nrecall that it is precisely the authors of these \nobjections who from the very beginning have been \nblocking the conclusion of a world treaty on the \nnon-use of force in international relations, a \nproposal which has been on the negotiating table \nfor a number of years.\n112. Czechoslovakia is emphatically in favor of a \ncomplete and definitive liquidation of nuclear \nweapons, of eliminating without delay the causes \nof the development of new types and systems of \nsuch weapons. We are against their proliferation. \nFigura\u00actively speaking, to eliminate the causes \nand thus to eliminate in time the risk of \ndestabilizing the strategic situation means in \npractical terms to do away in the first place \nwith the testing of nuclear weapons. That is why \nwe welcome and fully support the proposal for the \nspeedy conclusion of a treaty on the complete and \ngeneral prohibition of nuclear weapon tests \nsub\u00acmitted from this rostrum several days ago by \nthe Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko. The \nconclusion of such a treaty would undoubtedly be \nfacilitated if all the nuclear Powers were now to \ndeclare a moratorium on all nuclear explosions, \nincluding peaceful ones.\n113.\tWe value equally highly yet another new \nSoviet proposal for invigorating the efforts of \nStates to eliminate the threat of nuclear war and \nsafeguard the secure development of nuclear \nenergy. The General Assembly should qualify the \ndeliberate destruction of a peaceful nuclear \nfacility, even if carried out with conventional \nweapons, as a nuclear attack and thus, in keeping \nwith the Declaration on the Prevention of Nuclear \nCatastrophe this would be qualified as the \ngravest crime against humanity.\n114.\tWe attach exceptional importance to the \nsuccessful conduct and positive outcome of \nSoviet- American negotiations on the limitation \nof nuclear weapons in Europe. As a central \nEuropean country directly threatened by \nexisting\u2014and even more so by the Pentagon's \nenvisaged\u2014nuclear missile systems for NATO we \nbelieve that it is necessary to follow up the \nsincere expressions of good will with which the \nSoviet Union has so significantly encouraged the \ntalks so far.\n115.\tWe hold the view that the question of \nwhether progress will be achieved in nuclear \ndisarmament and whether peace can thus be \nstrengthened depends largely on whether \nSoviet-American agreement is reached on the \nlimitation and reduction of strategic weapons. \nThat objective can be attained only on the basis \nof full respect for the principles of equality \nand equal security, while preserving everything \npositive that has already been achieved by the \ntwo sides in negotiations so far.\n116.\tWe are also profoundly disturbed by the \ndevel\u00acopment of binary and other types of \nchemical weapons of mass destruction, as well as \nby the unprecedented, plans of the United States \nfor their deployment in previously unheard-of \namounts to the west of the borders of our \nRepublic. The prompt achievement of a ban on \nthese dangerous weapons in the spirit of the \nSoviet draft of the basic provisions of a \ncon\u00acvention on the prohibition of the \ndevelopment, pro\u00acduction and stockpiling of \nchemical weapons and on their destruction is, in \nour opinion, one of the most urgent tasks of all.\n117.\tWe advocate the preparation without delay \nof a convention prohibiting the deployment of any \nweapons in outer space, and we fully support the \ndraft con\u00acvention submitted by the Soviet Union \nlast year/ Further, in the Geneva Committee on \nDisarmament, negotiations should be intensified \non other disar\u00acmament issues, including the \nprohibition of neutron and radiological weapons, \nand agreement should be reached on further \nconcrete measures of disarmament.\n118.\tSincere and fruitful co-operation among \nall States in the solution of disarmament \nquestions is today more necessary than ever \nbefore. We therefore believe that the consistent \nimplementation of the Declaration on \nInternational Co-operation for Disar\u00acmament, \nadopted on the initiative of my country at the \nthirty-fourth session of the General Assembly \nremains highly timely and relevant. It is a \ndocument which urges States to participate \nactively in disarmament negotiations and to do so \nconstructively, with initiative, to demonstrate a \nsincere political will to achieve tangible \nresults in such talks and, last but not least, to \nconduct those talks on the basis of strict \nrespect for the principle of equality and equal \nsecurity, to refrain from developing new trends \nin the arms race and not to misuse disarmament \nnegotiations as a screen behind which to add new \nspirals to the arms race.\n119.\tAs a direct participant in the Vienna \nTalks on Mutual Reduction of Forces, Armaments \nand Associated Measures in Central Europe, we \nhave literally a vital interest in their \nsuccessful progress and, above all, tangible \nresults. We believe that the best way to achieve \nprogress is to proceed without delay with the \ndrafting of the text of the agreement. We are \nconvinced that the proposal submitted by the \nsocialist countries last February provides an \nequitable basis for that task. We regret that our \nWestern part\u00acners are frustrating our efforts by \npersisting, even in their most recent proposal, \nin the old so-called asymmetrical model of \nreduction, which is motivated by an endeavor to \ngain considerable unilateral military advantages \nat the expense of the security of the Warsaw \nTreaty States.\n120.\tWe expect that the forthcoming resumed \nMadrid meeting of the Conference on Security and \nCo-operation in Europe will also have important \nthings to say with regard to the solution of the \nburning issues of disarmament and the reduction \nof the danger of military confrontation. We wish \nto emphasize from this rostrum our interest in \nthat meeting and our feeling that it should be \nconducted in the spirit of a constructive \ndialogue, should reaffirm the continuation of the \nprocess of detente and should reach a success\u00acful \nconclusion as soon as possible by adopting a \nsubstantive and balanced final document, \nincluding a mandate for the convening of a \nconference on confidence-building measures and \ndisarmament in Europe. We believe that a positive \nrole in that respect can be played by the \nconstructive proposals of the neutral and \nnon-aligned countries. We very much hope that the \nresults of the Madrid meeting will strengthen the \nprerequisites for the continuous expansion and \ncreative development of the European initiative \nin Helsinki.\n121.\tHowever, we wish to express our concern \nthat the success of the meeting is being \njeopardized\nby efforts to revive the policy of dealing with \nthe socialist countries from a position of \nstrength and of undermining the very foundations \nof East-West economic co-operation by \nheavy-handed and unscru\u00acpulous sanctions.\n122.\tWe have followed with great concern the \ndeterioration of the political climate in various \nhotbeds of tension. Czechoslovakia firmly \ndenounces the further manifestations of Israeli \naggression in the Middle East which are shielded \nby Washington's political, military and economic \nsupport within the framework of the agreement on \nso-called strategic co-operation.\n123.\tWe feel profoundly indignant at the gross \nintervention against Lebanon which culminated in \nthe recent gory massacre of Palestinian and \nLebanese civilians in west Beirut. As one of the \nmembers, along with Bolivia, Denmark, Panama and \nthe Philip\u00acpines, of the former United Nations \nCommission on Palestine which was established by \nresolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947 and which \nwas called upon to supervise the termination of \nthe British Mandate in Palestine and the \nestablishment of independent Arab and Jewish \nStates on its territory\u2014a resolution as yet \nregrettably unimplemented\u2014we state with the \nutmost clarity that Israel must immediately and \nunconditionally withdraw its troops beyond the \ninternationally recognized borders of Lebanon. \nThe sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and \npolitical independence of Lebanon must be \nstrictly respected, as is required by the \ndecision of the recently resumed seventh \nemergency special session of the General Assembly.\n124.\tAs for the overall solution to the \nsituation, the only possible way to a just and \nlasting peace in the Middle East is the \nconsistent observance of the prin\u00acciples which \ncorrespond to the general norms of international \nlaw and the relevant resolutions of the Security \nCouncil and the General Assembly. These demand \nthe return of all Arab territories occupied since \n1967, including east Jerusalem, the \nimplemen\u00actation of the inalienable right of the \nArab Palestinian people to self-determination and \nthe establishment of its own independent State on \nthe territory of Palestine, free from Israeli \noccupation, on the West Bank of the Jordan and in \nthe Gaza Strip, the safe\u00acguarding of the right of \nthe Palestinian people to return to their homes \nor to receive appropriate compensation for the \nproperty which they have abandoned, the \nsafeguarding of the right of all States in the \nregion to a secure and independent existence and \nto development, and the preparation and adoption \nof international safeguards for the settlement, \nwhich could be guaranteed by the permanent \nmembers of the Security Council or by the Council \nas a whole.\n125.\tWe note with satisfaction that this \nposition of ours is substantially in accord with \nthe conclusions of the Twelfth Arab Summit \nConference. These objectives, however, cannot be \nattained through the compromised Camp David \ndeals, but only by multilateral collective \nefforts, preferably by an international \nconference on the peaceful settlement of the \nsituation in the region, with the participation \nof all interested parties, including the PLO, the \nsole legitimate repre\u00acsentative of the Arab \npeople of Palestine.\n126.\tOur indignation continues to be aroused \nby the anachronism of the policy of apartheid, \nwhich has been repeatedly and unequivocally \ncondemned here, as well as by South Africa's \ncontinuing acts of armed aggression against \nAngola, Mozambique and other front-line States; \nand furthermore by the attempts to hamper, \nthrough neo-colonialist maneuvers, the \nsettle\u00acment of the question of Namibia on the \nbasis of the full implementation of the relevant \nUnited Nations resolutions. We express our \nsolidarity with the Namibian people in the \nstruggle they are waging under the leadership of \nSWAPO for self-determination and independence.\n127.\tThe proposals of the Government of the \nDemocratic Republic of Afghanistan for a \npolitical settlement of the situation around \nAfghanistan are viewed by us as a constructive \ncontribution to a peaceful settlement of the \nsituation in that region. We also highly value \nthe efforts undertaken in this respect by the \nSecretary-General. In addition, the set of \nproposals by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of \nthe People's Republic of Kampuchea, the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam and the Lao People's \nDemo\u00accratic Republic, including the initiative \nproposing the convening of an international \nconference to consider the situation in \nSouth-East Asia, constitute in our view an \nimportant step towards changing South-East Asia \ninto a region of peace, stability and \nco-operation.\n128.\tWe see the withdrawal of a part of the \nViet\u00acnamese troops from the People's Republic of \nKampu\u00acchea as an expression of good will and a \ndesire to resolve the situation in that region by \npeaceful means. We declare once again, most \nresolutely, that the seat in this Organization \nrightfully belongs to the legitimate \nrepresentatives of the People's Republic of \nKampuchea and to nobody else.\n129.\tFrom the very beginning we have held the \nview that the continuing senseless conflict \nbetween Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran can \nand must be terminated as soon as possible by \npeaceful meant with respect for the legitimate \nrights of both parties. We have on several \noccasions expressed our position on the matter to \nboth sides. We support the peace mediation \nefforts by the countries of the non-aligned \nmovement.\n130.\tWe hold unswervingly to the position that \nthe inalienable right of peoples to \nself-determination and to decide independently on \ntheir own fate must be fully respected in Central \nAmerica and the Caribbean region also. The \nthreats by American imperialism against Cuba, \nNicaragua, Grenada and other States of Central \nAmerica and the Caribbean, like the ruthless \nsuppression of the struggle of the patriotic \nforces in El Salvador, have no other result than \nthe exacerba\u00action of tension and the endangering \nof peace in those regions. We sympathize with the \nefforts of the Carib\u00acbean States to transform the \nregion into a zone of peace, independence and \ndevelopment.\n131.\tWe advocate the settlement of the \ndecoloniza\u00action problem which came to a head this \nyear in the South Atlantic\u2014by means of \nnegotiations on the basis of United Nations \nresolutions and of the deci\u00acsions adopted by the \nnon-aligned movement, parti\u00accularly the \nconclusions of the Ministerial Meeting of the \nCo-ordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned \nCountries, held from 31 May to 5 June 1982 at \nHavana .\n132.\tWe resolutely support the efforts of the \nGovern\u00acment of the People's Democratic Republic \nof Korea for the peaceful reunification of Korea \nand the with\u00acdrawal of United States troops from \nthe southern part of the country.\n133.\tWe continue to favor the solution of the \nquestion of Cyprus in the spirit of the \nwell-known United Nations resolutions on the \nsubject. That is the only way to ensure the \nrestoration of the sover\u00aceignty and territorial \nintegrity of the Republic of Cyprus, its \nindependence and non-aligned status.\n134.\tWe are in favor of settling existing \nconflicts peacefully and averting potential \nconflicts. In that context we support the Soviet \nproposals for negotiations on confidence-building \nmeasures in the Far East and the strengthening of \npeace and security in Asia and the Persian Gulf, \nand the proposal of the Mongolian People's \nRepublic for the conclusion by the States of Asia \nand the Pacific of a convention on the mutual \nnon-use of force that applies also to the \nproposals for effective measures to enhance \nsecu\u00acrity, particularly in the Mediterranean and \nIndian Ocean regions. The timeliness of those \ninitiatives is underscored by the fact that they \nare designed to restore health to the \ninternational climate in these important regions \nof the world and thus to strengthen peace in the \nworld as a whole.\n133. Czechoslovakia values highly the activity of \nthe non-aligned movement against war and for \ndisar\u00acmament and social progress. We are \nconvinced that by proceeding consistently on the \nbasis of progressive, peaceful and \nanti-imperialist positions the non-aligned \nmovement can play a significant positive role, \nparti\u00accularly in the current complex \ninternational situation.\n136.\tProceeding from positions of principle, \nwe shall continue to extend our support to the \nefforts of the developing countries aimed at \novercoming the con\u00acsequences of colonial and \nneo-colonial rule and bringing about a \nsubstantive restructuring of inter\u00acnational \neconomic relations on an equitable, equal and \ndemocratic basis.\n137.\tCzechoslovakia, as a socialist State and \na member and a strong integral part of the \ndefense alliance of the socialist community of \nStates in the Warsaw Treaty Organization, remains \nunswervingly faithful to the ideals of peace.\n138.\tWe are ready to co-operate with all \ndelegations to ensure that the thirty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly fulfils the hopes \nwhich humanity has placed in it and contributes \nto finding ways of limiting the arms race, \nhalting the dangerous exacer\u00acbation of \ninternational tension, developing detente and \nbuilding confidence among States with different \nsocial systems. in this way alone will it be \npossible to strengthen and enhance the role of \nthe United Nations in interactional relations and \nenable it consistently to implement its ideals, \nthus fulfilling its mandate and meeting the \nexpectations of nations.\n"

        "file_text": "It gave me great pleasure to see Mr. Imre Hollai \nelected President of the thirty-seventh session \nof the General Assembly. On behalf of my \nGovern\u00acment and my people, I convey \ncongratulations and best wishes also to the great \nHungarian people and the friendly Hungarian \nGovernment, of which he is such a worthy \nrepresentative.\n113.\ti should like also tc pay a tribute to \nMr. Ismat Kittani for the skilful and exemplary \nmanner in which he conducted the affairs of the \nthirty-sixth session.\n114.\tThe President's inaugural statement was \nan eloquent compendium of the events that had \noccurred in the year since we met in this Hall at \nthe beginning of the thirty-sixth session. They \nwere truly momentous events which cast a heavy \nshadow of gloom over the international scene. \nThey are fraught with grave dangers both for the \nissues of war and peace and for the issue of \ndevelopment.\n115.\tTwo years ago, Egypt urged that we pause \nfor serious reflection. Members will recall that \nin our statement at the thirty-fifth session of \nthe General Assembly we gave the following \nwarning:\n\\\"The recent alarming developments that have \nchallenged the Charter and the international \norder that we have subscribed to... since 1945 \nhave... created a perilous situation of political \nupheaval sometimes bordering on chaos...\\\".\nAnd we noted that, in our opinion:\n\\\"... the time is ripe to undertake an objective \nappraisal of the existing political order and, in \npar-ticular, of the role of the existing \ninternational machinery. Accordingly, the \nGovernment of Egypt... [Proposes] the convening \nof a special session of the General Assembly to \ntake up this whole matter.\\\"\nH6. We raised this matter and submitted it for \nthe Assembly's consideration at the thirty-fifth \nsession. If anything, the developments that we \nhave all witnessed since that time should confirm \nthe serious\u00acness of our proposal. In this \ncontext, I feel it is most appropriate to pay a \nspecial tribute to the Secretary- General, Mr. \nJavier Perez de Cuellar. His report on the work \nof the Organization has provided a valuable \nanalysis of the international situation and of \nthe role of the United Nations in the \ninternational system. I support all the proposals \nmade in his report.\n117.\tIt is high time that we tackle \neffectively and with firmness and fairness the \nvarious problems that beset us. Foremost among \nthose problems are the issues of war and peace. \nIn the past year alone we have witnessed the \ninvasion of Lebanon, the destruc\u00action of Beirut, \nthe Falklands (Malvinas) war, the con-tinuing \nIran-Iraq war, the situation in Afghanistan, the \ngrave situation in Kampuchea, the precarious \nsituation in Korea, the impasse in the problem of \nCyprus and grave possibilities in Central \nAmerica, Africa and the Middle East.\n118.\tThe problems we are facing are not \nconfined to those political areas; they are \ninterlocked with economic, social and cultural \nproblems as well as with human rights issues. A \nnumber of special sessions of the Assembly have \nbeen held to examine various problems and issues, \nsuch as the Palestinian problem, the question of \nNamibia, the situation in Afghanistan, the new \ninternational economic order and the problem of \ndisarmament. But what has been the outcome of \nthose sessions? The resolutions that were adopted \nhave not been implemented. They remain dead \nletters, thus contributing to the further \nweakening of the United Nations and bringing into \nsharper focus the paralysis of the international \nsystem. This state of affairs is not consonant \nwith aspirations to peace, progress and justice. \nThe present political order, with its principles \nand conventions, was established solely in order \nto guarantee the attainment and enjoyment of \nthose goals. The persistence of present \nconditions can lead only to a serious \ndisintegration of the fabric of international \nrelations.\n119.\tAgainst the backdrop of these \ndevelopments, the Egyptian Government reiterates \nits proposal for the convening of a special \nsession of the General Assembly to assess the \nsituation and the role of the Organization in \ngeneral and so that all Member States can take \npart in a detailed discussion of the issue. \nEssentially, we urge the General Assembly to \nfocus on and intensify discussion of the entire \ninterna\u00actional order, the suitability of the \npresent political system, the role of the United \nNations and, in par\u00acticular, the system of \ncollective security\u2014as the delegation of Sierra \nLeone rightly said in connection with the \ndiscussion on the inclusion of that question in \nthe agenda of the present session.\n120.\tAH these matters are of paramount \nimportance for all the peoples of the world and \nconsequently they must be debated by their \nrepresentatives on a basis of equality. The \nSecurity Council would then be asked to consider \nthe situation in the light of the General \nAssembly's findings. The system of periodic \nmeetings provided for in Article 28 of the \nCharter would probably constitute an appropriate \nstarting- point for the fulfillment by the \nCouncil of its responsibilities in this respect. \nThe Secretary-General has an essential role to \nplay in this regard, but he has to be provided \nwith the necessary resources and with the means \nto help move the world to a new phase of \nconstructive action aimed at achieving more \nstable conditions.\n121.\tThe international economic situation is a \ncause for alarm and profound concern because of \nadverse economic conditions confronting both \ndeveloping and developed nations, with the impact \non the third world even more painful. Third world \ncountries have fre\u00acquently asked for a review of \nthe existing pattern in international economic \nrelations so that economic life can be based on \njustice and partnership. All of us are required \nto redouble our efforts and muster the political \nwill to bring about an economic order that is \nboth effective and just.\n122.\tOur alarm is due to the absence of any \nencour\u00acaging signs in the international economic \nclimate and the tendency among some countries to \nsolve their economic problems in isolation. This \ndevelopment is likely to increase the existing \ndiscrepancies. Relevant to this issue are the \nclaims made by some indus-trialized countries \nthat call into question the efficiency of \neconomic aid through international organizations. \nThis is one of the major reasons for the acute \ncrisis facing UNDP, which is suffering a serious \ndepletion of financial resources because of the \ndecrease in the voluntary contributions of the \ndonor countries, a situa\u00action that has led to a \n40 per cent reduction in country programmes for \ndeveloping nations. This is bound to have an \nadverse effect on the economic and social \ndevelopment programmes of those countries, not to \nmention the negative effects in discrediting the \nconcept of co-operation and interdependence, the \nmainstay of the United Nations.\n123.\tSome of the issues discussed within the \nframe\u00acwork of the North-South dialogue have \nassumed special significance and urgency; we must \ntherefore act vigorously in dealing with them and \nseeking the necessary solutions. In addition to \nthose issues is the question of global \nnegotiations for restructuring the international \neconomic order. Consultations over those \nnegotiations have now entered their third year, \nbut we are still going through a vicious circle \nof sug\u00acgestions and counter-suggestions, a circle \nthat has not yet been broken.\n124.\tNevertheless, we are still hopeful that \nthe parties can find a common ground to permit \nthe realization of this objective, provided that \nthe political will emerges among some patties to \nforge ahead towards genuine reform of the \ninternational economic order.\n125.\tThe Group of 77 has made strenuous \nefforts to get the North-South global \nnegotiations going, and to make the negotiations \ncomprehensive as well as complementary. This \ngoal, regrettably, has not been realized because \nof the rigid position taken by some \nindustrialized countries. We see no alternative \nto stepped-tup efforts to induce more flexibility \namong the industrialized nations in their \nattitude towards the problems of the developing \nnations. The international community is \nincreasingly convinced of the need to review and \nchange the current pattern of international \neconomic relations and to establish it on a basis \nof equity, partnership and international \ninterdependence.\n126.\tThe developing nations have spared no \neffort in providing an impetus to economic \nco-operation among themselves and in establishing \nthe principle of individual and collective \nself-reliance. The Caracas Programme of Actions \nis undoubtedly a positive step towards more \nbalanced economic relations between North and \nSouth. A general review of the meetings that have \ntaken place from the time of the Caracas meeting, \nin May 1981, to the Manila meeting, in August of \nthis year, sheds some light on the efforts made \nand the genuine desire on the part of the \ndeveloping nations, despite their limited \nresources, to ensure the success of the Caracas \nProgramme of Action, and to ensure both sound \nimplementation and continuing economic \nco-operation among themselves.\n127.\tEgypt is very interested in extending its \neco\u00acnomic relations with developing nations. We \nbelieve in such co-operation, especially \ntechnical co-operation. Technical and expertise \nexchange programmes have been instituted, \ntogether with the provision of scholar\u00acships and \ntraining for students and trainees from various \ndeveloping countries in Asia, Africa and Latin \nAmerica.\n128.\tAs a non-aligned and non-nuclear country \nwith a keen interest in international security \nand develop\u00acment, Egypt has a well-established \nposition based on full support of and effective \nparticipation in all efforts and measures leading \nto general and complete disarma\u00acment under \neffective international control.\n129.\tThe convening of the second special \nsession of the General Assembly devoted to \ndisarmament this year was an event of tremendous \nsignificance to which mankind pinned its hopes \nfor peace. Thus, our disap\u00acpointment was all the \ngreater because at that session the Assembly \nfailed to agree on a comprehensive program for \ndisarmament within a specific time\u00acframe, \nincluding specific and effective measures to halt \nthe arms race, nuclear and conventional. By that \nfailure an excellent opportunity was missed for \nrealizing the goal of disarmament and thereby \nguaran\u00acteeing a safe and peaceful world.\n130.\tThe failure of that session, however, \nshould not lead us to give up hope. Armed with a \npersistent political will, we the Governments and \npeoples should be able to proceed towards \nnarrowing the gap between the various positions. \nAnd here we would like to under\u00acline that the \nnuclear Powers, especially the superpowers, have \na special responsibility, emanating from their \ninternational obligations to ensure world peace \nand security, over and above the collective \nresponsi\u00acbility of all States in this regard.\n131.\tEgypt will work tirelessly in \ncontributing to the achievement of peace all over \nthe world, and espe-cially in the Middle East. In \nthat connection, Egypt has launched an initiative \nfor a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East \nand has been pursuing means to implement it for \nthe last eight years.\n132.\tThe declaration of the Middle East as a \nnuclear-weapon-free zone would be a major element \nin lessening tension and eliminating instability \nin the area. Appropriate measures would be needed \nto determine the best approach to that goal.\n133.\tEgypt has suggested that the \nSecretary-General send a special representative \nto meet the parties concerned in the area to \nexplore their views on means of achieving this \ngoal. That proposal still constitutes for us an \nimportant step in this direction. The \nestablish\u00acment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in \nthe Middle East would undoubtedly contribute to \nthe security of the Mediterranean and would \nenhance African security as it relates to the \nDeclaration on the Denuclearization of Africa and \nto the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone \nof Peace.\n134.\tMore than a year after its accession to \nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons Egypt reaffirms its dedication and \ncommitment to ensuring international respect for \nthe objectives of the Treaty, believing that it \ncan contribute to the search for an effective \nsystem of non-proliferation and to ensuring the \nright of all States to the peaceful uses of \nnuclear energy. In this connection, we strongly \nsupport the position of the non-aligned countries \nin insisting on iron-clad guarantees of the \nprotection of the security of non-nuclear \ncountries. In addition, nuclear Powers must give \nassurances to those countries that nuclear \nweapons will not be used against them. Now that \nnon-nuclear countries signatories to the Treaty \nhave fulfilled their obligations, Egypt stresses \nthe need for nuclear Powers to abide by their \ncommitments under the Treaty.\n135.\tIt is abundantly clear that the \ninternational situation, because of the conflicts \nwith which it is plagued or because of wars \nactually being waged, demonstrates that no \npartial approach of dealing with a single problem \nin isolation from others\u2014whether it be \ndisarmament the new economic order or collective \nsecurity\u2014will provide an effective remedy for the \nproblems connected with the international \npolitical system. This leads me to reiterate our \nearlier proposal on the convening of a special \nsession of the General Assembly for the purpose \nof a thorough review of the entire international \npolitical system and the role of the United \nNations. This would help us to fulfill our \nresponsibility to establish an international \npolitical system that is more just and more \nsecure.\n136.\tAs an African country, Egypt is passing \nthrough the game crucial stage as the rest of \nAfrica. We see attempts to circumvent the United \nNations plan for Namibia, the persistence of \napartheid in South Africa, the grave situation in \nthe Horn of Africa and disagree\u00acment over the \nquestion of Western Sahara. Moreover, the pursuit \nof certain reckless policies poses a threat to \nthe unity of Africa and to the territorial \nintegrity of its States and the security of its \npeoples. We are aware of the predicament with \nwhich the OAU has been faced, ever since the \nthirty-eighth session of the Council of \nMinisters, which was held in February in Addis \nAbaba, in connection with the question of the \nmembership of Western Sahara. That question has \ngiven rise to disagreement within the ranks of \nthe OAU, threatening its very survival. However, \nimpelled by our deep conviction and belief in \nAfrican unity and by our interest in the \ncontinuing viability of the OAU, we in Egypt have \nadopted a firm position, namely, that \ndifferences, no matter how deep and extensive, \ncan be solved in a spirit of reconciliation, in \nthe true African tradition. We in Egypt are \nconfident of the ability of Africa to exercise \nAfrican wisdom and to resolve those differences \nthat arose last February and interrupted the work \nof the OAU at a time when the need for \nco-ordinate and collective action though the \nAfrican organization was more pressing than ever \nbefore.\n137.\tForemost among African problems is the \nsituation in southern Africa, where South Africa \ncon-tinues to defy the international community by \ninten\u00acsifying its policies of racial \ndiscrimination and apartheid, which have been \ncondemned by all mankind, irrespective of creed, \nideology or religion. Egypt strongly supports all \ninternational resolutions calling for sanctions \nagainst South Africa until it desists from the \npolicies that flout the elementary principles of \nhuman rights. Furthermore, Egypt urges all States \nto participate effectively in the application of \nsuch sanctions.\n138.\tWe condemn the racist policies of South \nAfrica and its colonialist policy in Namibia. \nAlthough four years have passed since the \nadoption of Security Council resolution 435 \n(1978), which sets forth the United Nations plan \nfor the peaceful settlement of the matter, the \nregion has not yet achieved its indepen-dence, \nbecause of the intransigence the colonialist \nracist Pretoria regime.\n139.\tWe are all only too aware of the lengths \nto which SWAPO, the legitimate representative of \nthe people of Namibia, has gone in its efforts to \nadopt a reasonable attitude and to achieve a \npeaceful settle-ment of the problem. We are all \nfamiliar with the maneuvers of South Africa \ndesigned to perpetuate its illegal occupation of \nNamibia and to set up a quisling regime there.\n140.\tSWAPO and the African States have \nexpe\u00acrienced the bitterness of frustration \ncreated by such endless maneuvers. The latest of \nthose maneuvers occurred only a few weeks ago. \nAfter the Western contact group had sent the \nletter concerning the agreement reached on \nconstitutional principles, the Prime Minister of \nSouth Africa came up with a new stratagem to \nobstruct agreement by introducing elements \nextraneous to the question of Namibia and also to \nthe United Nations plan. We call upon the Western \ncontact group to exercise all types of pressure \non South Africa to induce it to implement the \nUnited Nations plan which it approved in \nprinciple in 1978.\n141.\tIn talking about Africa I cannot refrain \nfrom emphasizing one of the most serious problems \nin the continent's history, namely, that of \nWestern Sahara. The resolution adopted at the \neighteenth session of the OAU Assembly of Heads \nof State and Government in June 1981 in Nairobi, \n\\\" and the decisions adopted in August 1981\\\" and \nFebruary 1982 by the OAU Implementation Committee \nprovide a sound basis for a peaceful settlement \nthat would ensure stability in the area in \naccordance with the right to self-determination. \nThe subsequent negative develop\u00acments in the \nattempt to impose new conditions without \nconsensus have not only complicated the question \nof Western Sahara but also threatened political \nlife in the continent.\n142.\tWe appeal to our brother countries \nparties to the problem before the OAU to seek a \npeaceful approach to conflicts and to avoid \nrecourse to force. We consider it our duty to \ncall for adherence to the charter of the OAU, \nwhich forbids intervention in the internal \naffairs of member States. We also call upon them \nto safeguard their independence, sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity and the security of their \npeoples.\n143.\tWhile reviewing the situation in Africa I \nshould like to convey some good news to the \ninternational community about an important event \nthat will take place in a few days. Egypt and the \nSudan are con-cluding a new charter for \nintegration, a charter formulating an \norganizational and substantive frame\u00acwork and \nreflecting the political will of the two \ncoun\u00actries to step up their development through \nthe imple-mentation of a number of projects in \nthe economic, social and cultural spheres. The \ncharter provides for a presidential council for \nintegration affairs, a \\\"Valley of the Nile\\\" \nparliament with about 60 members repre\u00acsenting \nthe two peoples, a general secretariat to act as \nthe executive arm in following up integration \nprojects and a special fund to finance those \nprojects.\n144.\tThe goal of the integration and its \ncharter is to establish regional co-operation as \na model and a nucleus that could, in the future, \nencompass the nine countries of the Nile Basin. \nIt should be recalled that in 1980 the OAU \nAssembly endorsed the Lagos Plan of Action for \nthe Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for \nthe Development of Africa, when they decided that \nAfrican regional co-operation constituted an \nindispensable basis for social and economic \ndevelop\u00acment in Africa. The integration plan \nconcluded by Egypt and the Sudan is fully in \nkeeping with the Lagos plan. It is indeed a good \nomen, heralding wel\u00acfare and prosperity for the \npeoples of the Nile Valley, north and south alike.\n145.\tAs a founding member of the non-aligned \nmovement, Egypt declares that there is no \nalternative to the policy of non-alignment. \nNon-alignment is the sole means of safeguarding \nthe security and the safety of the third world \nand of facing the policies of polarization, \nblocs, pacts and confrontation. Non- alignment i: \nincontestably the only deterrent to policies of \nhegemony, expansion and domination. The \nnon-aligned movement was established in response \nto the aspirations of emerging nations which had \nbarely left behind the struggle for liberation. \nThe movement also includes peoples and nations \nwhich are still locked in a bitter struggle to \nliquidate the remnants of colonialism, overcome \ndependence, back-wardness and racism and defend \nhuman rights and dignity.\n146.\tThe active and historic role played by the \nearly pioneers and founders of the movement \ndeserves a special tribute from all of us. Today \nwe recall the guidance of great, inspired leaders \nsuch as Tito, Nehru and Abdel Nasser, who charted \nfor us the lofty goals and noble means for \nsuccess. We feel that the values and principles \nwhich they struggled for are in need of further \ndefense and further sustained efforts if they are \nto retain their authenticity, purity and essence.\n147.\tIndeed, much has been achieved. The \nmovement now has a wider membership, as it \ncomprises the majority of the States in the \ninternational community. But as opposed to these \nachievements, a number of problems have \nunfortunately arisen, the most serious of which \nare those affecting the ranks of the countries of \nthe movement.\n148.\tWe have faced direct and indirect \nintervention in the internal affairs of the \nnon-aligned countries. We have experienced \nmilitary adventures and power politics exercised \ndirectly or by proxy. The movement has been \ninfiltrated by a tendency to divide the world \ninto natural allies and natural enemies. \nFurthermore, the movement has been arbitrarily \nover-categorized and over-stratified, which has \ndeepened differences and dissension, distracting \nthe movement and sapping its energy.\n149.\tThe challenges facing the movement make \nit necessary that all of us who have an interest \nin pre-serving its non-aligned character should \ntry to keep it on course. It gives me great \npleasure to note that within the movement the \nsituation is far better than it was a few years \nago. This is to the credit of the member States, \nwhich for the most part have reso\u00aclutely defended \nthat great body and respected its true principles \nin order to put non-alignment back on its \noriginal track in facing the perils of the cold \nwar between the super-Powers. Experience has \ntaught us that it is the small and developing \ncountries that generally and ultimately bear the \nbrunt and the conse\u00acquences of that cold war.\n150.\tThe basic principle of our great \nmovement, to which President Hosni Mubarak \nreaffirms his commit\u00acment, is for us a firm creed \nand a constant element of our foreign policy \nunder the new leadership of Egypt.\n151.\tIt would be appropriate to acknowledge \nhere the efforts that have been made recently to \nsave the movement from fragmentation owing to the \ninsistence of some countries on changing the \nvenue of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State \nor Government of Non-Aligned Countries, which was \nscheduled to be held in Baghdad. We welcome the \nconstructive attitude of the Iraqi Government in \nnot insisting on Baghdad as the venue, and also \nthank the Government of India for agreeing to \nhest the meeting; we urge, so that the \nnon-aligned countries can pursue the positive \napproach they have chosen.\n152.\tRecently the Middle East has been the \ntheatre of very tragic events, being subjected to \ndevastating wars and unprecedented waves of \ndestruction. But despite all the anguish, hopes \nof a just settlement that takes into account the \nrights of all the parties without exception have \nnot yet been extinguished. Egypt, which bears a \nspecial responsibility in this area, was in the \nforefront of the battlefield when war was the \nonly means of dealing with the situation. \nSimilarly, Egypt was in the front line of \nnegotiators when the time was propitious and the \nbalance was redressed.\n153.\tEgypt most emphatically cannot afford to \naccept a situation in which one party to the \nconflict arrogates to itself the role of arbiter, \nwaging wars; wreaking havoc and committing \naggression. Egypt will never accept Israeli \naggression against Iraq, its annexation of the \nSyrian Golan Heights or its occupa\u00action of \nLebanon. Egypt totally rejects Israel's utterly \nirresponsible policy of unbridled aggression \nagainst the Palestinian people and the FLO.\n154.\tIsrael must understand that Egypt will \nnever tolerate the mutilation of the Palestinian \nquestion or of the Palestinian people and that \nEgypt rejects Israel's crime in Lebanon and \nagainst the Palestinians in all its aspects.\n155.\tIf Israel demands respect for its \nsovereignty, territorial integrity and security, \nthis can be achieved only with reciprocity. If \nIsrael demands respect for its rights and the \nrights of its people to life and existence, \nIsrael must respect the rights of the Palestinian \npeople to life and existence.\n156.\tThere should be no double standards. \nIsraeli policies should not be based on \nconsiderations of self-arrogated privileges over \nother countries and peoples. This should be \nunequivocally clear to the leaders of Israel. In \nthis context, Israel stands fully responsible for \nall its actions. Israel, under the provi\u00acsions of \nthe Charter, the norms of international law, the \nresolutions of the Security Council and the \nprovi\u00acsions of the peace accords, is committed to \nrespect the legitimate rights of the Palestinian \npeople, fore\u00acmost among which is their right to \nlife, to existence and to self-determination.\n157.\tIf Israel does not understand, or chooses \nnot to understand, it will have shunned \ninternational legality, flouted the Charter, \ndisregarded the norms of interna\u00actional law and, \nindeed, repudiated the peace accords.\n158.\tHowever, if Israel still relies on its \nsecurity argument, we, for our part, assert in \nall candors that such claims defy logic and \nreason. Israel's security lies, in a word, in the \nestablishment of peace based on justice. No \namount of weapons, money, maneuvers, invasion, \nattempts to establish settlements, or \ndisplacement of thousands of human beings is \ngoing to bring security to Israel. Peace means \nsecurity for all, based on justice for all. This \nis the only road to security and stability.\n159.\tWhen Egypt initiated the peace process \nwith President Sadat's visit to Jerusalem it was \ndestined to achieve the following objectives: \nFirst, Israel's recog\u00acnition of the existence of \nthe Palestinian people and the existence of the \nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people. \nSecondly, Israel's acceptance of negotiations \nwith the representatives of the Palestinian \npeople. Thirdly, free election of a Palestinian \nauthority to assume power fully in the occupied \nPalestinian terri\u00actories as a transitional \narrangement. Fourthly, the with\u00acdrawal of the \nIsraeli military and civilian administra\u00action \nfrom the occupied territories, as well as the \nbeginning of the withdrawal of the Israeli \noccupation forces, the remaining forces to be \nredeployed during the transitional phase to \nspecific, points and camps. Fifthly, initiation \nof negotiations between the Israelis and \nPalestinians on the final status of the occupied \nWest Bank and Gaza/This meant, in other words, a \ntotal rejection of Israel's expansionist, \nannexationist and sovereignty claims as well as \nof any unilateral or arbitrary measure. Sixthly, \nit is inevitable that the Palestinian people \nshould be enabled to exercise its right to \nself-determination, including the right to \nestablish its own State or any other arrangement \naccepted by the Palestinian people within the \nframe\u00acwork of international legitimacy.\n160.\tAs all delegations are aware, Egypt has \nbeen engaged in negotiations with Israel with the \nfull participation of the United States of \nAmerica to help establish transitional \narrangements that would assist in accomplishing \nthose legitimate objectives. Egypt entered into \nthese negotiations in good faith, motivated by \nthe hope of an early dawn of peace and \nanticipating that Israel, too, would pursue that \npath and co-operate in implementing the \nagreements towards comprehen\u00acsive peace.\n161.\tHowever, Israel opted to persist in \nestablishing settlements in the occupied \nPalestinian territories in an attempt to seize \nand usurp the territories of the West Bank, \nincluding Jerusalem and Gaza. Again, Israel \npersisted in annexing Jerusalem and the Syrian \nGolan Heights and in adopting other measures that \nconflict with the confidence-building endeavors \nrequired to establish a comprehensive peace in \nthe area.\n162.\tThis has culminated in the suspension of \nthose negotiations more than once. Needless to \nsay, Egypt, committed as it is to a firm rational \nstand based on and reinforced by the rules of \ninternational law and the principles and the \npurposes of the Charter, cannot accept such \ndistorted interpretations of accords reached \nunder international legality. Egypt cannot \nassociate itself with a conspiracy against the \nPalestinian people through any unsound \ninterpretation or equivo\u00accal intentions or \ndesigns aimed at annexation, incor\u00acporation and \nother practices directed against the Palestinians \nin Jerusalem, the West Bank or Gaza.\n163.\tIn the wake of Israel's complete \nwithdrawal from Egyptian territory on 25 April \n1982, hope still lingered and did not fade. We \nexpected that Israel would be serious this time \nin the continuation of the peace process. Allow \nme here to emphasize the fact that Egypt views \nthe withdrawal from Sinai as only part of a \nsettlement of the overall problem and as a step \non a long, tedious road. Unfortunately, Israel \ndissipated all hopes through persistence in its \npolicies, unacceptable by any logic or reason. \nThen came the devastating aggression on Lebanon, \nwhich has been both a staggering blow to the \nsovereignty and terri\u00actorial integrity of Lebanon \nand a flagrant violation of the political and \nhuman rights of its citizens, whose lives have \nbeen severely disrupted. The invasion has also \npainfully disrupted the structure of the \nPalestinian community in Lebanon which, owing to \ndisplacement and dispersion, had been forced to \ntake temporary shelter in Lebanon. The invasion \nwas planned also to abolish the political and \nnational rights of the Pal\u00acestinian people and to \nstifle its struggle under the leadership of the \nPLO.\n164.\tAgainst this background, Egypt and France \npresented a joint initiative in the Security \nCouncil last July. The draft resolution contained \ntwo parts, the first providing for guarantees of \nthe sovereignty and political independence of \nLebanon and the second dealing with and \nsupporting the national and inalienable rights of \nthe Palestinian people against the armed Israeli \ninvasion. It called for the application of the \nprinciples of security in order to:\n\\\"Reaffirm the right of all States in the region \nto existence and security in accordance with \nSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967);\n\\\"Reaffirm the legitimate national rights of the \nPalestinian people, including the right to self- \ndetermination with all its implications, on the \nunder\u00acstanding that to this end the Palestinian \npeople shall be represented in the negotiations \nand, con\u00acsequently, the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization shall be associated therein;\n\\\"Call for the mutual and simultaneous recognition of the parties concerned\\\".\n165.\tThis is the political, historical context \nand rationale of that initiative. Egypt and \nFrance strongly uphold their initiative and \nreiterate full commitment to its principles in \nthe deep conviction that its provi-sions stem \nfrom the rules of international law and the \nprinciples and purposes of the Charter and \nresolutions of the United Nations. While solemnly \nstating this position, Egypt also declares that \nin the light of the agreement reached with France \nat the highest level, we shall defer our \nparticipation in the debate on this initiative at \nthe present time, taking into consideration a \nnumber of positive developments in the overall \nsituation and also in anticipation of future \ndevelop\u00acments. In this context, we wish to \nwelcome the PLO's statement in the Security \nCouncil on 29 July 1982.\\\"\n166.\tForemost among those positive \ndevelopments is President Ronald Reagan's \ninitiative made public on 1 September 1982. It is \na commendable attitude on the part of the \nAmerican Administration. Its analysis of the \nsituation in the Middle East is sound, and that \nis why the United States is urged to take a \nfirmer stand concerning the grave developments \nresulting from the Israeli policy in Lebanon, \nBeirut in par\u00acticular, the Palestinian problem \nand the problem of the Middle East in general.\n167.\tWe welcome the initiative, which contains \nmany ^ positive elements and constitutes a major \nstep towards a just solution of the Palestinian \nproblem and a fair and comprehensive settlement. \nMeanwhile, we have some comments to make on parts \nof this initiative which we hope will be \nconsidered by the United States Administration. \nThere will certainly be ample time and \nopportunity for such reconsideration when \ndiscussions start with the parties concerned. \nHow\u00acever, what is essential in the final analysis \nis that sustained efforts be made to give effect \nto this ini\u00actiative as quickly as possible, \nbefore it is overtaken by events or eroded by \nmaneuvers such as those we have witnessed \nrecently.\n168.\tAt the same time we urge the Government \nof Israel to reconsider its negative attitude to \nthe Reagan initiative, to respect the framework \nof international legality by ceasing the \nestablishment of settlements and desisting from \nits policies of annexation and assimila\u00action and \nto treat the population of the West Bank, \nincluding east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in \naccord\u00acance with the provisions of the Geneva \nConvention. We urge Israel not to adopt an \ninflexible attitude but to respond positively to \nthe appeal made by the highest authority in the \nUnited States.\n169.\tWe also urge the PLO to reassess the \npresent situation in all its aspects, re-examine \nour suggestion for simultaneous mutual \nrecognition, and reaffirm its adherence to all \nthe United Nations resolutions relevant to the \nquestion of Palestine, in order to facilitate a \ndialogue with the United States, thus enabling \nthe PLO to participate in the dialogue with all \nthe parties directly concerned with this \nquestion. In turn, such a dialogue would enable \nthe American Administration to communicate on a \nbasis of equality with all the parties concerned.\n170.\tIn that context, we appreciate the \nstatement made by Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the \nExecutive Committee of the PLO, to the effect \nthat he accepts all United Nations resolutions \nrelevant to the ques-tion of Palestine. We \nconsider this statement to be a step in the right \ndirection. This attitude deserves respect and \nencouragement, as it reflects a sound appraisal \nand understanding of the situation and its \nimperatives.\n171.\tThere was yet another development when \nthe Twelfth Arab Summit Conference adopted \nunani-mously another peace plan on 8 September \n1982. Some might take issue with one or other \naspect of the plan, but many positive elements in \nit cannot be overlooked or minimized. Also, the \npolitical significance implicit in a consensus \namong Arab heads of State or Government on such a \nplan should not be overlooked. The Arabs have \nspoken with one voice in Fez, opting in clear and \nunequivocal terms for a comprehensive peace based \non justice. The Arab States are willing to pursue \nthe course of a negotiated peaceful settlement \nbased on mutual recognition.\n172.\tThe principles and broad outline embodied \nin the Fez resolutions constitute an acceptable \nbasis for negotiation. They may require \nmechanisms or pro\u00accedures, executive preparatory \nmeasures or transi\u00actional arrangements, but, \ntaken with the other existing initiatives, the \nFez resolutions are capable of being translated \ninto a practical, just and acceptable form.\n173.\tBy the same token, I have to reiterate \nthat Egypt does not exclude any other initiative \ndesigned to make it possible to forge ahead \ntowards a just, peaceful and comprehensive \nsettlement. In this connection, reference should \nbe made to the European initiative, the Romanian \ninitiative, the Soviet initiative and the ideas \nput forward by the Secretary-General.\n174.\tBy a natural process of association, \ntalking about Fez leads me to touch on \nEgyptian-Arab relations. Egypt has been \nintrinsically an Arab country for the past 14 \ncenturies. The genuinely Arab character of Egypt \ncan be neither made nor unmade by a decision. \nEgypt is far beyond being affected by one country \nand regime, or a number of countries and regimes, \nwhich may call into question its genuine Arab \nchar\u00acacter. The Arabism of Egypt, metaphorically \nspeaking, is like a tree, deeply rooted for 14 \ncenturies, watered by the blood of the martyrs \nwho have fallen in battle in defense of \nPalestinian rights on many occasions, indicating \nthe position of Egypt as it has stood firmly for \nArab rights from Morocco to the Gulf States, from \nthe turn of this century until today.\n175.\tWe may have disagreed with some of our \nbrothers, and we may still be in disagreement, \nover a number of issues but we call upon Arab \ncountries to stand united in the face of the \ncrucial challenges confronting the entire Arab \nnation today. Egypt will continue to exert every \neffort to that end. We are confident that Arab \nsolidarity will surmount those Arab differences \nand disputes.\n176.\tI have talked at some length about the \nsituation in the Middle East and the Palestinian \nproblem, the core of that conflict, and in \nconclusion I should like to tackle two important \npoints. The first relates to the deteriorating \nconditions in Lebanon. The situation is still \nfraught with danger; it still threatens to \nexplode, engulfing Lebanon and spreading beyond. \nWe in Egypt reject the claim that the continuing \nIsraeli occupation is a necessity or that it \nprotects anybody. The existence in Lebanon of \nforeign military occupa\u00action resulting from \ninvasion would be the principal cause of any \nfurther deterioration. We maintain our unshakable \nbelief that the solution lies in the with\u00acdrawal \nof the Israeli invasion forces from all Lebanese \nterritory to its internationally recognized \nborders.\n177.\tAll foreign forces must withdraw from \nLebanon, but the withdrawal of Israeli occupation \nforces should neither be conditional on nor \nrelate to any other presence. Israel must realize \nby now that its view concerning the situation in \nthe Middle East is erroneous, that its \nunderstanding of conditions in Lebanon is \nsuperficial. It results not from any \nunder\u00acstanding of reality but from the arrogance \nof power. The presence of Israel in Lebanon will \nnot lead to stability in that country but will, \nrather, intensify the waste and destruction \nthere. That may be what Israel wants; it is \ncertainly what Israel is accomplishing. But \nIsrael will not long escape the consequences, \nunless it hastens to correct the situation, \nunless its wise men or its friends correct the \nsituation, before the oppor\u00actunity is missed and \nit is too late.\n178.\tWe urge the United States, the \nsuper-Power that is in a position effectively to \ninfluence several situations in the area, and \nwhich is providing Israel with the tools of power \nand the means of life, to restrain Israel without \ndelay, as President Eisenhower did in 1957.\n179.\tIsrael dishonored all its pledges and \nguaran\u00actees under the agreement reached on the \nwithdrawal of PLO forces from Beirut when Israeli \ntroops pushed into west Beirut and inside the \nrefugee camps of innocent Palestinian civilians \nin Sabra and Shatila unleashing their henchmen \nand lackeys, murderers and assassins to butcher \nchildren, babies, women and elderly men who were \nunder the protection of the Israeli occupation \narmy, on a dark day of shame for Israel.\n180.\tThe basic solution to the Lebanese \nproblem lies in respect for the sovereignty, \nterritorial integrity, political independence and \nArab character of Lebanon, the unity of its \npeople and Government and the safe\u00acguarding of \nthe rights of all its citizens on a basis of \nequality, coexistence and co-operation.\n181.\tAt the same time, we advise our brothers \nin Lebanon, irrespective of their creed, \naffiliations, aspi-rations or position, to make \nthe unity of their State and their people their \nhighest concern. They are required to stand \nunited in these crucial moments to enable Lebanon \nto weather this stormy crisis and restore their \ncountry to its traditional pride and traditional \npros\u00acperity. In this connection, Egypt wishes all \nsuccess to President Amin Gemayel, Lebanon's new \nPresi\u00acdent, in his challenging mandate, and hopes \nthat his election will be a major step towards \nstability, inde\u00acpendence and the termination of \nforeign occupation.\n182.\tI have touched on the painful events \ntaking place in the heart of the Arab world. On \nits eastern frontiers, a ferocious war between \nIran and, Iraq has entered its third year posing \ngrave perils to the stability, resources and the \nwell-being of the Middle East.\n183.\tWe know all about the latest of the repeated Iranian invasions of \nIraq. We are also familiar with Iran's rejection \nof all attempts at a settlement and of all peace \nmediations. Iran, instead, is determined to \ncontinue the war against Iraq. Iraq has already \nwith\u00acdrawn or at least is ready to withdraw from \nall Iranian territory. Iraq has also made public \nits readiness to accept peace mediations and its \nresponsiveness to efforts for a settlement. We \ncall upon the Iranian Government to opt for peace \nand to revoke all claims that could engender \nconflicts and rekindle the con\u00acflagration.\n184.\tAs an Arab country which believes in the \nterri\u00actorial integrity of the Arab nation, and \nconfident of the Government of Iraq's acceptance \nof peace initiatives, Egypt declares that it will \nsupport Iraq in defense of the Iraqi people and \nterritory.\n185.\tPeace for Egypt is a profound conviction \nand a full commitment. Consequently, despite the \ncolossal obstacles obstructing our pain towards a \npeaceful settlement in the Middle East, Egypt \nwill never resign itself to despair, but will \npersist unwaveringly in exerting all efforts to \nachieve a peace based on justice, which alone can \nensure permanence and continuity.\n186.\tEgypt's commitment to peace is not \nexclusive, but transcends the Middle East to \nspread to other regions of the world. Egyptian \npositions on world issues emanate from one \nconsistent and constant prin-ciple. We call for \nthe peaceful settlement of disputes through \ndialogue and negotiation, and through respect for \ninternational law and the principles of the \nCharter of the United Nations.\n187.\tThese are our expectations and \naspirations. They are not dreams, because through \nour common and concerted efforts, they could be \ntranslated into realities of life, to help create \na better world for our posterity and all future \ngenerations.\n"

        "file_text": "Sir, I congratulate you on your election to the \nhigh office of the presidency. A heavy \nresponsibility rests on your shoulders. This has \nbeen a turbulent year in international affairs. \nThe shocks of the past 12 months are reflected in \nthe agenda. This has been a testing time also for \nthe new Secretary-General. He faces more hard \ntasks ahead.\n43.\tWe have endured a year of crisis in the \nworld economy. The international monetary system \nhas teetered on the brink of catastrophe. The \ntwin evils of inflation and unemployment have \nranged throughout the world; growth has slowed \nalmost to a halt.\n44.\tNor has the world become a more peaceful \nand secure place. On the contrary. The Middle \nEast has been a cockpit of war. We have just seen \na massacre of unarmed civilians in Lebanon on a \nscale we find hard to believe. Afghanistan is \nstill occupied and tyrannized by the Soviet \nUnion. Vietnamese troops still hold Kampuchea. A \ntotally avoidable war has been fought over some \nremote islands in the South Atlantic. Great-Power \nrelationships have deteriorated. There has been \nno progress towards disarmament.\n45.\tI want to say a little more about the \nworld economic situation. As a small trading \nnation, New Zealand is acutely sensitive to \nfluctuations in the health of our major trading \npartners. New Zealand is classed as a developed \ncountry, but we share many of the problems of \ndeveloping countries. Our prosperity depends on \nthe export of a relatively few primary products. \nIn the current world situation, terms of trade \nrun against us. When the economic giants sneeze, \nwe do not catch cold; we catch pneumonia.\n46.\tIt is not surprising therefore that my \nGovernment has taken a leading role in recent \nmonths in advocating a revitalization of the \ninternational economic and financial \ninstitutions. The system established at Bretton \nWoods 38 years ago served reasonably well during \na long period of economic growth in the 1930s and \n1960s. There is a widespread agreement that it \nneeds to be improved and strengthened, not tom \ndown. There is no consensus yet as to how that \ncan be achieved.\n47.\tAt international meetings of Finance \nMinisters in recent weeks, the New Zealand Prime \nMinister has advocated an international \nconference to re-examine the role and adequacy of \nthe international institutions established at \nBretton Woods. Such a conference would require \ndetailed groundwork and preparation. It is, \nperhaps, too early to spell out the agenda. What \nmust first be demonstrated is the political will \nto undertake the task. My Government believes \nthat that will exists in many countries, but some \nof the largest and most powerful Members of the \nOrgani-zation\u00f3those with the greatest economic \nclout\u00f3have still to be convinced.\n48.\tOne thing is clear. The efforts that have \nbeen made in the Organization to effect progress \nthrough a North-South dialogue have reached \nstalemate. The very term  North-South  polarizes \nattitudes. Doctrinaire argument will get us \nnowhere. Nor will a retreat into policies of \neconomic isolationism. The growth of \nprotectionism is one of the most disturbing \nby-products of economic recession. It will not \nhelp growth in the powerful economies of the \nmajor industrialized countries, and its effects \non the vulnerable economies of the developing \ncountries can only be disastrous.\n49.\tLet me emphasize again the constructive \npurpose of my Government's call for a review of \nthe international economic institutions. We wish \nto see them strengthened and, if necessary, \nsupplemented. They may need new powers. They \nshould be more responsive to genuine needs. In \nthe financial field, they should be more flexible \nin the conditions they impose for lending. There \nshould be a large increase in quotas to \nstrengthen the position of the International \nMonetary Fund [IMF]. There is a need for \ndiscipline to apply to those countries which \naccumulate large surpluses in their balance of \npayments, as well as to tht.se which are forced \ninto large deficits. This is sometimes called \nsymmetrical surveillance. Greater regulatory \npowers than exist at present may be required. IMF is \nno longer facing cyclical downturns in member \nnations but long-term structural imbalances. Its \nrules must be adapted for longer-term lending and \neasier conditionality. A decision on these \nmatters at a special meeting of the world \ncommunity would make the political decision, \ncountry by country, to accept such changes much \nmore easily.\n50.\tBut these are only suggestions on our \npart. I repeat that what is needed is a clear \ndemonstration of political will to embark on a \nnew program designed to restore confidence in \nthe world economic system. Only thus can we look \nfor the world consensus required to implement \nsuch a program. May I say that we look to the \nmajor economic Powers to display both more \ndetermined leadership and a greater \nunderstanding of the problems faced by smaller \nand weaker economies than they have so far.\n51.\tAlthough far removed from the Middle \nEast, New Zealand is closely concerned with what \ngoes on there. We have friendly relations with \nall Middle East countries and important trading \nrelations with an increasing number of them. The \nUnited Nations has an important role to play in \nmaintaining peace in that area and it must \ncontinue to play that role despite the \nfrustrations it faces. For many years New Zealand \nhas contributed observers to the United Nations \nTruce Supervision Organization. We welcomed the \nrestoration of peace between Egypt and Israel. \nWe wanted to see a peace-keeping force \nestablished in the Sinai under United Nations \nauspices but, since that was not possible, we \nagreed to contribute to a force that was \nacceptable to both Egypt and Israel. In that way, \nwe hope we have made an appropriate contribution \nnot only to the peace-keeping but to the \npeace-making process.\n52.\tIt is a matter of great concern to us \nthat L at process has not continued as intended. \nNew Zealand has consistently supported Security \nCouncil resolution 242 (1967). We believe that \nIsrael is entitled to exist in peace behind \nsecure borders. Equally, we believe that the \nPalestinian people are entitled to determine \ntheir own futures: and to establish their own \nState, if that is what they wish, following the \nwithdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied \nterritories. We believe also that all foreign \ncombat troops should be withdrawn from Lebanon. \nThe innocent civilian population in that war-torn \ncountry has suffered long enough, if necessary, \nafter the present temporary three-nation force is \nwithdrawn from Beirut, the role ol' the United \nNations peace keeping force should be expanded to \nstabilize the situation in Lebanon for as long as \nmay be necessary.\n53.\tIn his report on the work of the \nOrganization the Secretary-General has commented \nwith admirable frankness on the shortcomings of \nthe United Nations in carrying out its primary \ntask of preserving international peace and \nsecurity. He has suggested ways in which the \nSecurity Council might operate with more \nauthority. We support those suggestions. We \nbelieve that a greater willingness on the part of \nthe great Powers to work together rather than \nagainst one another is the key to a more \neffective Security Council. Nevertheless, the \nnon-permanent members also have an important part \nto play. We take seriously the obligation \nconferred by the Charter on the Members of the \nUnited Nations to make their own contribution to \nthe maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity. It is with that obligation very much in \nmind that New Zealand has presented its \ncandidature for membership of the Council at the \nforthcoming elections.\n54.\tThe situation in Kampuchea also remains \nof deep concern, h undermines the stability of \nSoutheast Asia and adversely affects the security \nof our close friends in the Association of \nSouth-East Asian Nations. If unresolved, it \ncarries the potential, by reviving great-Power \nrivalry in the area, to threaten the security of \nthe wider Asia-Pacific region. More immediately \nthe situation prolongs the human misery and \nsuiting that have been a tragic fact of life m \nKampuchea for too long.\n55.\tNew Zealand firmly believes that any \nlasting solution to the situation in Kampuchea \nwill have to take into account their legitimate \ninterests of all the parties concerned. We hope \nthat the year ahead will see some progress. The \nformation of the coalition Government in \nKampuchea is a step in the right direction. We \nhave never condoned the crimes and atrocities of \nPol Pot and his associates and we welcome the \nbroader representation of the Kampuchean people \nin the Government of Democratic Kampuchea.\n56.\tThere is an important role for the United \nNations in working out a settlement. We welcome \nthe efforts of the Chairman of the /i J Hot \nCommittee of the International Conference on \nKampuchea as part of it.\n57.\tAnother year has passed without progress \nin relations between North and South Korea. \nTension remains high in the peninsula and the \ndiversion of resources to military purposes \ncontinues. Families are still separated and a \nunique and ancient society remains divided. New \nZealand does not believe that this situation need \nor should continue. My Government's view is that \nthe way forward is through negotiations between \nthe Korean peoples themselves. We exhort the \nNorth Korean authorities to respond positively to \nSouth Korea's various proposals for steps towards \nnational reconciliation.\n58.\tWith regard to Africa, my Government has \nfollowed closely the efforts of the five-member \ncontact group to negotiate the withdrawal of \nSouth Africa from Namibia and permit the people \nof that country freely to exercise their right to \nself-determination and independence. Following \nthe emergence of a Government in Zimbabwe \nreflecting the wishes of the majority, we \nexpected to see more rapid progress towards the \nfreeing of Namibia from illegal occupation. We \nhope that the situation will now be peacefully \nand speedily remedied and that the people of \nNamibia will very soon be able to decide their \nown future in free and fair elections. It is long \nsince time Namibia took its rightful seat in the \nOrganization.\n59.\tNew Zealand maintains its steadfast \nopposition to the system of institutionalized \nracism imposed by a minority Government in South \nAfrica on the vast majority of its people. New \nZealand has no diplomatic or consular \nrepresentative in that country. For many years we \nhave embargoed the export of arms to South \nAfrica. In accordance with its obligations, as a \nmember of the Commonwealth, under the Gleneagles \nAgreement my Government has consistently sought \nto discourage sporting contacts with South \nAfrica. The great majority of New Zealand sport \norganizations, including the Olympic and \nCommonwealth Games Association have steadfastly \nrefrained from such contacts.\n60.\tIt is time that the disgrace of apartheid \nwas ended. It is an affront to human dignity. \nTragically, the South African Government has \nignored the calls of its own people and of the \nworld that it dismantles the apartheid system and \nintroduces one which upholds racial equality and \nrespect for human rights and basic freedoms. Only \nthen can South Africa resume a normal \nrelationship with the rest of the world and play \nits proper role in a continent which has \ndesperate need of its technology and resources.\n61.\tI should like to end by saying something \nabout the small island countries of the South \nPacific and their problems. These are, after all, \nNew Zealand's closest neighbors and friends. We \nhave with them strong ties of history and \nculture. Many of their people have migrated to \nNew Zealand but retain close links with their \nisland homes. New Zealand's overseas aid program \nis increasingly concentrated in these countries. \nWe welcome the fact that the great majority of \nthe island countries have now achieved \nindependence or an advanced stage of \nself-government. Some of them now speak with a \ndistinctive South Pacific voice in the \nOrganization.\n62.\tit is good that self-determination in the \nSouth Pacific has been achieved peacefully. The \nprocess is, however, not yet complete. We welcome \nthe progress that has taken place towards \nself-determination in the Trust Territory of \nMicronesia. We welcome also the program of reform \nwhich has been instituted by the French Government \nin New Caledonia. In common with our fellow \nmembers of the South Pacific Forum, we hope for \nquick progress towards the goal of \nself-determination for this Territory. We are \nactively promoting political development in the \nsmall island Territory of Tokelau and have \nwelcomed visits by United Nations Missions to \nmonitor its progress.\n63.\tThe fragile economies of small island \nStates pose enormous problems for their \ndevelopment. The United Nations criteria for \nleast-developed States take insufficient account \nof the problems of minute size, lack of resources \nand extreme isolation, which are common to many \nof these island States. New Zealand has sought to \nhelp overcome these problems by lowering trade \nbarriers, promoting private investment and \nhelping to develop regional shipping services. We \nhave welcomed the increased involvement of the \nUnited Nations in the South Pacific area. But \nmore outside help is needed, and the small size \nof the recipient countries should not deter the \nappropriate international agencies from making a \nmore effective contribution than they have up to \nnow.\n64.\tOne of the few significant resources \nwhich the South Pacific countries can export is \nfish. The most important part of this resource \nconsists of the highly migratory species such as \ntuna. The establishment of the 200-mile economic \nzone under the United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea offers the island countries the \nopportunity to exploit this resource for their \nown benefit. It is for that reason, among others, \nthat New Zealand and other South Pacific \ncountries are strong supporters of that \nConvention and look forward to its early entry \ninto force. My Government will continue to urge \nthe major industrialized countries to accept and \nbecome parties to the Convention. All South \nPacific countries are naturally sensitive to the \npossibility of pollution of the surrounding \nocean, for example by the dumping of nuclear \nwaste. We are also strong advocates of the \ncomplete cessation of nuclear-weapons testing, \nespecially in the Pacific. It is a matter of \ngreat regret and concern that the negotiation of \na comprehensive test-ban treaty has virtually \ncome to a halt.\n65.\tNew Zealand and its South Pacific \nneighbors will continue to press for the \nconclusion of a test-ban treaty. Such a treaty \nnot only will remove a possible environmental \nthreat from our own backyard, but will be an \nimportant step towards nuclear disarmament, which \nhas seen no progress in the past year but becomes \nmore urgent day by day.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPermit me to\ncongratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his unanimous election\nto preside over this session. His election is a reaffirmation\nby the United Nations Member States of the confidence\nthat they have placed in him and in the Government of\n20\n\n\nMalaysia. In this regard, I should like to assure him of the\ncooperation of the delegation of the Republic of Rwanda in\nour shared desire to galvanize the community of nations in\ntheir common resolve to fulfil the objectives of the United\nNations Charter. I should like to take this opportunity to\npay tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Diogo\nFreitas do Amaral, for presiding over the fiftieth session of\nthe General Assembly in a most efficient and able manner.\nThe session over which Mr. Razali is presiding will be\naddressing a considerable agenda of more than 155 items,\nwhich, when put together, will contribute to world peace,\nsecurity and stability. The United Nations is the most\nappropriate forum to discuss these and other related matters\nof global peace, development and international cooperation.\nThe agenda before us therefore seeks to address the\nimplementation of the objectives of the Charter, as\nenshrined in Article 1.\nAs we move towards the twenty-first century, it is our\nindividual and collective responsibility to re-examine the\nextent to which our countries have or have not contributed\nto the attainment of these objectives. The United Nations\nAgenda for Peace and its valuable initiatives on\npeacekeeping, human rights and other development-related\nissues \u2014 collective security, terrorism, denuclearization,\nconflict prevention and resolution \u2014 will be discussed\nduring the session. Rwanda would like to join its voice to\nthose of the delegations that spoke from this rostrum and\nwho called for world peace, security and the development\nof developing countries.\nStatements have been made from this rostrum in\nconnection with what some have described as the ghastly\nevents that took place in Rwanda in 1994. Many, perhaps\ninadvertently and in a simplistic manner, have described the\nevents of 1994 in Rwanda as a conflict, a crisis, ghastly\nevents or as gross violations of human rights. There was\ngenocide in Rwanda, nothing else but a genocide. It was\nnot a tribal or ethnic conflict, as it is often referred to.\nBetween April and July 1994 more than one million\nRwandans were butchered in a systematic and planned\nmanner. This carnage was carried out in only 98 days. The\ndevastating effects of the aftermath of the Rwandan\ngenocide are still with us, and we live with them. Rwanda\u2019s\npopulation now consists of 70 per cent women, 60 per cent\nof whom are widows, and we have 400,000 orphans in the\ncountry.\nThe perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide are still at\nlarge in some capitals. Far from feeling remorse, they pride\nthemselves in their unfinished agenda. Their army, militia\nand political leadership are in military and refugee camps\nwithin walking distance of the Rwanda-Zaire border. They\nhave recently stepped up infiltrations into Rwanda in\norder to kill the remaining survivors of genocide.\nWe call upon the international community to exert\npressure on the Government of Zaire to relocate the\nrefugees away from its borders with Rwanda, in\nconformity with the 1951 Geneva convention (relating to\nthe Status of Refugees).\nThe withdrawal of United Nations peacekeeping\ntroops in April 1994, at the height of the execution of the\ngenocidal agenda, was not helpful. For us in Rwanda, it\nremains, and will continue to remain, a reminder of the\nresponsibility of the United Nations to ensure that this\ndoes not reoccur anywhere else. More importantly, it\npoints to the need for the United Nations to support\nRwanda in its efforts to rebuild its socio-economic\ninfrastructure. This is critical. There can be no sustainable\npeace without reconstruction and development. The recent\nhigh-level symposium on conflicts in Africa, which was\nheld in Tokyo this month, on 9 and 10 September, came\nto the same conclusion.\nAllow me to put on record my Government\u2019s\nappreciation of the efforts made by those countries,\ninstitutions and humanitarian agencies that helped and\ncontinue to assist Rwanda in the various sectoral\nrehabilitation programmes. We are equally grateful to\nthose who have shown their disposition to do so in the\nnear future.\nThe recently concluded round table conference,\nwhich was organized with the support of the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), has been\nhelpful. We are grateful for the commitments that were\nmade. This will go a long way in assisting Rwanda to\nconsolidate and build on the achievements of the past two\nyears.\nThe Government of National Unity of Rwanda,\nunder the leadership of His Excellency President Pasteur\nBizimungu, has made significant strides to return the\ncountry to normalcy. Tremendous achievements have\nbeen made, including the gradual and steady rehabilitation\nof the security structure, the judiciary, the legislature and\nthe economy. The sound macroeconomic policies that\nhave been adopted have contributed, in less than two\nyears, to a reduction in inflation from 60 per cent in 1994\nto 10 per cent in 1996. This will drop to 5 per cent by the\n21\n\n\nend of 1997. Agricultural production has reached 70 per\ncent of the pre-war level, and we have recorded impressive\nlevels of food production.\nWe are also pleased to inform the international\ncommunity that more than 2.2 million refugees have now\nreturned to Rwanda. All Rwandan refugees originally based\nin Burundi have been repatriated and successfully resettled\nin their own communities without incident. This is\nsufficient proof that Rwandan refugees in other\nneighbouring countries, apart from being the hostages of\ngenocidal leaders in the refugee camps, have no other\nreasons to remain.\nThese achievements have been made in spite of some\ncritical factors that the international community could help\nRwanda overcome if we are to maintain the pace of our\ncontinuing progress towards stability, durable peace and\ndevelopment.\nThe crippling debt burden has hamstrung all social\nsectors, especially the most vulnerable groups. Children,\nwomen, widows and the elderly are among the most\naffected. Rwanda\u2019s debt stock at the end of 1995 stood at\na staggering high of $1 billion, or 91 per cent of the gross\ndomestic product (GDP). Most of this, 84 per cent, is owed\nto multilateral institutions; 13 per cent is bilateral; and the\nremaining 3 per cent is on account of suppliers\u2019 credits.\nGiven the magnitude of this suffocating debt, the\nGovernment cannot rebuild its shattered socio-economic\ninfrastructure in the aftermath of genocide. We therefore\nurge the international community, and especially the\nmultilateral financial and development institutions, to cancel\nimmediately Rwanda\u2019s debt. Short of new resources in the\nform of a Marshall Plan, this cancellation would greatly\ncontribute to Rwanda\u2019s recovery and sustainable growth.\nWe know very well that where there has been a significant\ninfusion of financial resources in post-war periods, peace\nand stability have been achieved and sustained.\nThe question of conflicts and insecurity in the Great\nLakes region has been mentioned by many speakers. The\nsituation in Burundi is cause for concern to many,\nespecially the countries of the region. I should like in this\nregard to commend the efforts of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, the leaders of the region and all those who\nare involved in the search for a durable solution.\nRegional instability has been complicated by the\nsystematic persecution of Kinyarwanda-speaking Zaireans.\nThis process was stepped up this year with the massacre of\nseveral North Kivu region Zaireans of Rwandese culture;\nothers were forced to flee to Rwanda and Uganda. This\npersecution has recently been extended to the South Kivu\nregion of Zaire, where, again, Kinyarwanda-speaking\nZaireans have been subjected to brutal attacks by Zairean\nforces, along with former Rwanda Government soldiers\nand interahamwe militias, who did not finish but exported\ntheir genocidal and \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d agenda.\nSurvivors of these attacks \u2014 predominantly women\nand children, as men and boys are either killed or\nimprisoned \u2014 have been forced to seek refuge in\nRwanda. It is the responsibility of the Government of\nZaire to unconditionally repatriate its nationals who are\ncurrently living in refugee camps in Rwanda. We call\nupon the international community to prevail upon the\nGovernment of Zaire so as to stop the systematic \u201cethnic\ncleansing\u201d currently taking place in eastern Zaire. We\nfurther call upon the Government of Zaire to cease\nimmediately its military aggression which has recently\nbeen directed against Rwandan territory.\nWe would like to pay tribute to Mwalimu Julius\nNyerere, former President of the United Republic of\nTanzania, for his unequivocal and genuine search for\nsolutions, not only for Burundi, but also within the wider\ncontext of the Great Lakes region.\nThe problem is not the lack of solutions. What is\nlacking is the decisiveness to implement commitments\nvoluntarily entered into. That is what should be addressed.\nIn the case of the Great Lakes region, former Presidents\nJulius Nyerere of Tanzania, Jimmy Carter of the United\nStates of America and General Tour\u00e9 of Mali successfully\nmanaged to get the Heads of State and Government to\nagree and sign solemn declarations on the modalities for\nsolving the problems of the region.\nAt this session, we will be considering the\nre-election of the Secretary-General. My Government\u2019s\nposition has been clear since Yaound\u00e9, during the summit\nof the Organization of African Unity. We are not\nsupportive of the re-election of the incumbent. Doing so\nwould reward his failure to use the instruments of the\nUnited Nations Charter in order to come to the rescue of\nRwandans during the genocide. Above all, it would be\nagainst the collective conscience of the Rwandan people\nto support the candidacy of the incumbent. But beyond\nthese moral grounds, we believe that the election of a\ncontested Secretary-General is not in the interest of the\nUnited Nations. It would jeopardize the functioning of an\ninstitution that needs to be strengthened.\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like, first of all,\nto extend my warmest compliments to His Excellency Mr.\nRazali Ismail, Permanent Representative of Malaysia to the\nUnited Nations, on his assumption of the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly last week. I also pay tribute to the\nefforts of His Excellency Mr. Diego Freitas do Amaral,\nwho demonstrated great skill in presiding over the historic\nfiftieth-anniversary session.\nLast year commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations. This year marks the fortieth anniversary of\nJapan\u2019s admission to the United Nations. Over the past four\ndecades, Japan has consistently made its commitment to the\nUnited Nations one of the main pillars of its foreign policy\nand has steadfastly supported the United Nations.\nAt the same time, Japan has benefited immensely from\nthe international system, including the United Nations. I\nshould like to take this opportunity to express my sincere\ngratitude for the support Japan has received from the\ninternational community in building the stability and\nprosperity it enjoys today. In addition, as the role of the\nUnited Nations grows in importance in the new post-cold-\nwar environment, I hereby affirm that Japan is resolved to\nplay a more active role by further strengthening the\ncooperation it extends to the Organization for the sake of\nworld peace and prosperity.\nMy ultimate foreign policy goal is the creation of a\nbetter world for future generations, a world free of poverty\nand conflict. I intend to achieve this goal through change\nand creation, which is the mission of my Cabinet. Children\nwho can talk vividly about their dreams of the future are\nthe world\u2019s treasure. Is it not our grave responsibility, as\nleaders of the international community, to build an\nenvironment in which the children of the next generation\ncan flourish?\nEfforts towards the creation of a better world for\nfuture generations must be based on the following three\npillars: first, securing world peace and stability; secondly,\npromoting development so as to bring growth and stability\nto developing countries; and thirdly, ensuring the well-being\nof each and every citizen throughout global society. These\nthree pillars are interrelated, and we will be unable to\nachieve a world free of poverty and conflict if any one of\nthe three is missing, or if only one of them is in place.\nSince taking office, I have pursued foreign policies\nbased on the strong belief that Japan should be a nation\nthat works for world peace and stability on its own\ninitiative. In accordance with this position, Japan intends\nto play a leading role in the building of each of these\nthree pillars, as I shall subsequently explain. These are\nprecisely the areas which the United Nations of the\ntwenty-first century will be expected to address.\nThe first pillar is securing world peace and stability.\nThis is surely of the utmost importance, because unless\nthis is achieved, future generations will be left with\nnothing but confusion and destruction. At this time of\never greater interdependence, world peace is indivisible.\nInstability in one region can readily lead to the instability\nof other regions and, in turn, to the instability of the\nworld as a whole. It is Japan\u2019s intention not simply to\nsecure its own peace and stability but, consonant with the\nphilosophy embodied in the Constitution of Japan, it will\nstrive to secure global peace and stability and make\ngreater efforts, commensurate with its political and\neconomic status, for the prevention and resolution of\nconflicts in various regions of the world.\nIt goes without saying that, as a nation in Asia,\nJapan will spare no effort in securing peace and stability\nin the region. The recent incident of infiltration by a\nNorth Korean submarine makes us all the more aware of\nthe importance of easing tensions on the Korean\npeninsula. Realization of the four-party meeting, which\nwas proposed by the leaders of the United States and the\nRepublic of Korea last April, is very important, and I\nshould like on this occasion to reiterate Japan\u2019s support\nfor that proposal. In an effort to further strengthen the\nachievements of the Cambodian peace process, which has\nproved to be a successful example of the international\ncommunity\u2019s peace-building efforts, and looking ahead to\nthe elections that Cambodia will hold on its own for the\nfirst time beginning next year, Japan intends to continue\nto extend assistance to that country. Japan welcomes the\nfact that Russia, also located in the Asian region, is\ncontinuing its reform process in the light of the results of\nthe recent presidential election. Moreover, by actively\nparticipating in political and security dialogue, for\nexample in the context of the ASEAN Regional Forum,\nJapan is endeavouring to further promote confidence-\nbuilding in the region.\n8\n\n\nAt the same time, Japan is actively engaged in\naddressing issues in other regions, for example by\ncooperating with United Nations activities to foster global\npeace. During the latter part of August I visited five\ncountries in Latin America where I witnessed at first hand\nthe success of the democratization process and steady\nprogress in economic reform. Japan intends to strengthen its\nassistance for the stable development of this region.\nIn the former Yugoslavia, Japan has contributed both\npersonnel and financing to the local and national elections\nrecently held in Bosnia in view of their importance in the\nformation of a democratic political system. As a member of\nthe Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council,\nJapan will continue to participate actively in the civilian\naspects of international efforts towards the implementation\nof the peace process.\nOn the occasion of Foreign Minister Ikeda\u2019s visit to\nthe Middle East in August, and Chairman Arafat\u2019s visit to\nTokyo in mid-September, Japan called for continued\nnegotiations among the parties to the Middle East peace\nprocess. Japan is determined to continue to contribute to the\ncreation of an environment conducive to the advancement\nof the peace process by extending assistance to the parties\nconcerned, including assistance to the Palestinian people,\nand by participating in multilateral talks.\nJapan is gravely concerned about the current situation\nin Iraq. It strongly hopes that Iraq will listen to the opinion\nof the international community and comply in good faith\nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions so that the\nsituation will be settled as soon as possible.\nIn order to resolve the Afghanistan issue it is\nimportant that foreign interference cease and that the\nsuccess of the peace and reconciliation efforts of the United\nNations is ensured. Toward that end, Japan is providing an\nexpert on that region to serve as a political counsellor at the\nUnited Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan.\nThe ongoing regional conflicts in Africa, including the\nsituations in Burundi, Liberia and Angola, are of grave\nconcern. The international community must actively support\nthe conflict-prevention and conflict-resolution efforts of\nAfrican countries as well as the strengthening of their\ncapabilities in this regard. In addition to extending financial\ncontributions to the Organization of African Unity and the\nStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions in\nCentral Africa, Japan is extending assistance to\npeacekeeping operations, refugee assistance, rehabilitation\nassistance, and assistance for democratization in the form\nof personnel and intellectual input.\nPeacekeeping operations are an effective complement\nto the collective security function as originally envisaged\nin the United Nations Charter, and they supplement the\nconflict-resolution efforts of the parties themselves. It is\nimportant that the international community should\ncontinue to support peacekeeping operations but also that\nit should seek their further reform. Experiences in recent\nyears have reaffirmed the effectiveness of traditional\npeacekeeping operations. Their role in preventing\nconflicts, as exemplified by the success of the United\nNations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP), is\nlikely to become increasingly important. Japan will\ncontinue to participate in the discussions that are now\nunder way among interested Member States on measures\nto improve the rapid reaction capabilities of the\npeacekeeping operations. Japan is participating in the\nUnited Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF)\nin the Golan Heights and intends hereafter to cooperate\nactively and as much as possible in peacekeeping\noperations.\nI believe that, as it responds to regional conflicts, the\nUnited Nations has the potential to fulfil, in a practical\nmanner, an extremely effective function through\npreventive diplomacy. I should like to propose that a\nmeeting of eminent persons be convened to explore\nmeans of enhancing the Organization\u2019s preventive\ndiplomacy capability.\nIn order to maintain international peace and stability,\nit is essential to further promote disarmament efforts and\nto strengthen the regime for the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction. In particular, Japan would\nvigorously emphasize the importance for the international\ncommunity of promoting realistic and steady efforts for\nnuclear disarmament with the aim of realizing a world\nfree of nuclear weapons. As the only country to have\nsuffered nuclear devastation, Japan has been making\nprecisely this appeal to the international community as a\ntop priority in accordance with its own philosophy.\nThus I am deeply gratified by the adoption of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by the General\nAssembly with the support of many Member States; this\nindeed marks a historic step towards a world free of\nnuclear weapons. Having the opportunity just this\nmorning to sign the Treaty gave me great personal\nsatisfaction. In order to realize the early entry into force\nof the Treaty, Japan would like to call upon those\n9\n\n\ncountries which have expressed opposition to the Treaty to\naccede to it at the earliest possible date from the broader\nperspective of promoting nuclear disarmament. For its part,\nJapan will continue to make contributions in the field of\nverification of nuclear testing, by such means as expanding\nthe technical cooperation on seismic technologies that it\nextends to concerned developing countries. As a next step\ntowards the elimination of nuclear weapons, I should like\nto call for the early commencement of negotiations on a\ncut-off treaty which would prohibit the production of fissile\nmaterials for nuclear weapons.\nJapan takes the problems posed by landmines very\nseriously. Japan supports international efforts toward a total,\nworldwide ban on anti-personnel landmines. Furthermore,\nin order to reinforce international support for measures to\ndeal with anti-personnel landmines, Japan is preparing to\nhost a meeting at the senior official level in Tokyo early\nnext year.\nThe promotion of development to bring about the\ngrowth and stability of developing countries is the second\npillar required for the creation of a better world for future\ngenerations. Development is a prerequisite for peace; at the\nsame time, the maintenance of peace is a precondition for\ndevelopment. As a leading donor, Japan will work to\nfurther enhance its official development assistance; at the\nsame time, it is keenly aware of its responsibility to lead\nthe discussion on issues relating to the proper form and\nprovision of such assistance.\nBased on this recognition, Japan has been calling for\na new development strategy. The central ideas in this\nstrategy are an emphasis on the ownership by developing\ncountries of the development process and on the\nestablishment of a new global partnership in which\ndeveloped and developing countries, released from the\nNorth-South confrontational mind-set, cooperate with each\nother. Moreover, it is important to address development not\nsimply with official development assistance, but also by\norganically combining various elements including trade,\ninvestment, economic policy, debt relief, technology\ntransfer, and the development of social infrastructure. It is\nalso important to extend assistance that is most appropriate\nto the circumstances of the particular country while paying\nadequate attention to the efforts made by developing\ncountries in the promotion of democratization and the\nintroduction of market-oriented economies. Furthermore,\nJapan attaches importance to the setting of development\ntargets and the reinvestment in development activities of\nsavings resulting from reforms, as well as to promoting\ncoordination between the United Nations and the Bretton\nWoods institutions.\nWe have witnessed the development of various\nforms of regional cooperation, such as the Southern\nAfrican Development Community, MERCOSUR, and the\nSouth Pacific Forum; such regional cooperation is an\nimportant element for development. Emphasizing the\nsignificance of South-South cooperation, Japan is utilizing\nthe Japanese Human Resources Development Fund in the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in\norder to support South-South cooperation.\nIn the context of developing countries, Japan\nattaches particular importance to the development of\nAfrica, where poverty and conflict are particularly acute.\nJapan will actively promote its initiatives on assistance to\nAfrican countries, which Foreign Minister Ikeda presented\nduring the general debate of the Ninth United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development, convened in\nSouth Africa this past spring. In order to give new\nmomentum to African development, Japan is hoping to\nconvene the second meeting of the Tokyo International\nConference on African Development in 1998, which\nwould follow a preparatory meeting that will take place,\nalso in Tokyo, in 1997.\nThe third pillar to which I would like to refer is the\nguarantee of the well-being of every citizen of the global\ncommunity. It is important to embrace the global\ncommunity as a whole, and to give heed to the\nimportance of each and every one of its members. Indeed,\nthe peace of mind of individuals contributes to the peace\nand stability of the world.\nJapan intends to address more actively various social\nproblems such as the environment, population, AIDS,\ndrugs, terrorism, organized crime, refugees and the status\nof women, as well as problems relating to food and\nenergy, which may become more acute in the years to\ncome. Concerned about environmental issues, Japan will\nhost the third conference of the parties to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in\nKyoto in December next year. Japan will make every\neffort toward the adoption at that conference of an\neffective and practical document prescribing an\ninternational framework to prevent global warming after\nthe year 2000. I should like to call for the valuable\ncooperation of every Member State and international\norganization concerned for the success of that conference.\n10\n\n\nRecognizing that it is important that each and every\nhuman being be cared for, throughout more than 30 years\nof political activity, I have focused my attention on the\nprotection of the most vulnerable among us and to the\nelimination of poverty. The Initiative for a Caring World\nwhich I proposed on the occasion of the Lyons summit of\nthe Group of Seven is an extension of this endeavour.\nUnder this initiative, Japan intends, first of all, to share\nwith developing countries its experiences in the field of\nsocial security, including health care, hygiene and social\nwelfare services so that they can develop more effective\nservices in these areas, and secondly, to exchange\nexperiences and knowledge with other developed countries\nwith respect to issues that they commonly confront.\nAs I stated at the outset, I should like to urge world\nleaders to join hands and strengthen their efforts\nparticularly on behalf of the well-being of children. Ever\nsince the Japan Committee for the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) was established in 1955, my\nmother has been dedicating herself to promoting its\nactivities. This has had a profound influence on me, and I\ntoo have been actively engaged in its activities. Japan has\nbeen contributing approximately $30 million to UNICEF\nannually and it intends hereafter to strengthen its\ncooperation. As part of its initiatives on assistance to Africa\nwhich I mentioned earlier, Japan announced that it would\nprovide assistance for the expansion of education and the\neradication of polio on that continent. It also intends to\nenhance its assistance for the protection of the health of\nvery young children in developing countries.\nThe protection and promotion of human rights is the\nfoundation of world peace and prosperity. Japan is\ndetermined to support the democratic development of\ndeveloping countries and at the same time hopes that the\nUnited Nations will further enhance its activities in the field\nof human rights.\nAs we approach the twenty-first century, it is essential\nthat the United Nations itself play a role that responds\nadequately to the growing expectations of the international\ncommunity based on the three pillars to which I have been\nreferring. Towards that end, reforms that strengthen the\nfunctions of the Organization are necessary. There is a\nconsensus among the United Nations membership regarding\nthe importance of the new role envisaged for the\nOrganization as well as the urgent need for comprehensive\nUnited Nations reform. However, when it comes to\nconcrete measures for reform, a convergence of views\namong Member States is yet to emerge.\nWith the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\nwe witnessed an increase in the momentum for reform. It\nshould be the aim of this fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly to maintain this momentum so that a general\nagreement on the major elements of reform can be\nreached before the session ends. The entire United\nNations membership should then make every effort to\nreach an agreement on concrete measures to realize\nUnited Nations reform in the near future. If the United\nNations simply engages in repetitious debate and proves\nincapable of reforming itself to adapt to the changing\ntimes, its very credibility could be severely undermined.\nIt is thus incumbent upon the membership as a whole to\nbe tenacious in its efforts to achieve reform.\nSecurity Council reform, and reforms in\nadministrative and financial areas and in economic and\nsocial areas comprise the threefold centrepiece of United\nNations reform. I should like to point out the importance,\nabove all, of carrying out these reforms as a whole in a\nbalanced manner. For example, even though there may be\na financial crisis, if we were to carry out reforms in that\narea alone, separately from reforms in the other two\nareas, it would not correspond to the original basic\nconcept of United Nations reform, which was to seek to\nstrengthen the functions of the Organization as a whole.\nPermit me to present the views of Japan regarding\nreforms in these three areas. I should like first of all to\ndiscuss the reform of the Security Council. Inasmuch as\nthe Security Council bears the primary responsibility for\ncarrying out the major purpose of the United Nations,\nnamely, the achievement and maintenance of world peace\nand stability, its importance is obvious. As it has\nindicated on previous occasions, Japan, with the\nendorsement of many other countries, is prepared to\ndischarge its responsibilities as a permanent member of\nthe Security Council in accordance with its basic\nphilosophy of the non-resort to the use of force prohibited\nby its Constitution.\nUntil the reform of the Security Council is realized,\nJapan is determined to contribute to the work of the\nSecurity Council for the sake of international peace and\nsecurity, and has presented its candidature for non-\npermanent membership on the Council in this session of\nthe General Assembly. Responding to the strong support\nand confidence that have already been expressed with\nrespect to its candidature, Japan will continue to make\nevery effort so that it can play an active role on the\nSecurity Council.\n\n\n\nAs I stated earlier, Japan attaches great importance to\ndevelopment. More than two thirds of United Nations\nMember States are developing countries. If the United\nNations is to aim at achieving a world free of poverty and\nconflicts, it is crucial that discussions on development be\nfurther promoted within the Organization. In this, the\nfunctions and role of the Economic and Social Council\nshould be strengthened and the integration of the various\ndevelopment issues with which the United Nations is\nengaged should be ensured.\nJapan is the second largest financial contributor to the\nUnited Nations; its assessment for the regular budget has\nincreased to 15.65 per cent for next year, and is likely to\nincrease further. Japan will not shirk the tremendous\nresponsibility it bears in financially supporting the United\nNations. However, with respect to the scale of assessment,\nI wish to reiterate that Japan attaches importance not only\nto the concept of capacity to pay but also to the\nresponsibility to pay. Japan also welcomes the endeavours\nof the Secretariat towards administrative streamlining and\nrationalizing.\nThroughout the four decades since it joined the United\nNations Japan has faithfully upheld the purposes and\nprinciples enshrined in the United Nations Charter. It has\nconsistently attached importance to the United Nations, and\nit is proud to be among the countries that have made the\ngreatest contributions to its overall activities. Disarmament,\ninitiatives in the area of nuclear non-proliferation, an appeal\nfor a new strategy on development issues, an active\naddressing of global issues, as well as considerable\nfinancial contributions to the United Nations \u2014 these are\nthe issues to which Japan has attached profound importance\nin recent years.\nI wish to conclude my statement in this general debate\nby reemphasizing Japan\u2019s readiness to participate in the\nSecurity Council, which is at the centre of United Nations\nactivity, as well as to engage more actively and more\nconstructively in the aforementioned areas of endeavour in\norder to discharge its responsibility with regard to world\npeace and prosperity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAs the United Nations faces\nthe beginning of its second half-century and the dawn of\na new millennium, we look to the Organization for the\ncontinuing fulfilment of the high purposes of its Charter:\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and\nthe achievement of international cooperation in solving\nproblems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian\ncharacter.\nThe experience of the past 50 years has shown that\nthese goals are not easily attained. The end of the cold\nwar has not meant an end to conflicts. The world has now\nentered a new era in which civil strife has replaced super-\npower rivalry as the main threat to peace and security.\n7\n\n\nWe have yet to find workable solutions to many situations\nin which conflict continues to prevail. At the same time, the\nvast majority of mankind remains prey to poverty, hunger\nand disease. Such inhumane conditions serve as a fertile\nbreeding ground for chronic economic and social\ndegradation.\nYou, Mr. President, face the enormous task of guiding\nus through this vast thicket of concerns. We are confident,\nhowever, that your well-known diplomatic experience and\nskills will lead us to new paths in the search for satisfactory\nsolutions. As a son of Malaysia, a country which has long\nchampioned the cause of peace and development, you will\nundoubtedly bring to bear a sense of urgency to the\ndischarge of the many responsibilities with which you will\nbe entrusted.\nIn so doing, you will build upon the efforts of your\npredecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, who\nspearheaded our thrust to reform and restructure the world\nOrganization in order to make it more responsive to our\nneeds in the post-cold-war era. He is deserving of our\ngratitude for his labour during the past year.\nI would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral for providing dynamic leadership to the Secretariat\nin these challenging times.\nThe special commemorative meeting held last year to\nmark our Organization\u2019s fiftieth anniversary provided an\nexcellent opportunity not only for reflection on its past\nachievements, but also on its future direction. There was no\ndearth of ideas and proposals for strengthening the United\nNations in order to help it face the challenges of the\ntwenty-first century. It may be useful for us to look closer\nat some of those suggestions to determine their feasibility\nfor implementation. It is an exercise in which some of our\nmain Committees, our several working groups and the\nSecretariat may profitably engage so that the thinking of\nour Heads of State and Governments does not fall by the\nwayside, unheeded and forgotten.\nMy own President, on that historic occasion, presented\nhis concept of a new global human order in which the\nnations of the world could come together in a creative\npartnership for progress. This concept of partnership is\npredicated on the belief that we all now live in an\ninterdependent world, in which, unless we learn to hang\ntogether, we will certainly hang separately.\nNo one nation, no matter how militarily and\neconomically powerful, can hope adequately to address the\nmany complex cross-boundary problems which it now\nfaces. States Members of the United Nations need to\ncome together urgently to see how they can enhance\ncooperation in the various areas specified by the United\nNations Charter.\nAmong the immediate imperatives would be the\ncreation of a partnership for peace, for, although the\nworld has been mercifully spared another world war since\n1945, it has witnessed a number of conflicts, both old and\nnew, which continue to proliferate and to sap our\ncollective strength. The causes of these eruptions are\noften deep-seated and not easily eradicated. They require\ncareful study and attempts at resolution. Invariably, this\nwill mean that the United Nations will have to go beyond\ntraditional peacemaking and peacekeeping to the increased\npractice of preventive diplomacy aimed at pacifying\npotential conflict situations. The experience of past\noperations, both successes and failures, should be distilled\nwith a view to garnering those lessons which may be of\nguidance in future cases. In this context, classical\napproaches to conflict resolution may have to be\nsupplemented by new and imaginative ideas.\nOver the past few years, we have together made a\nlaudable effort to enhance the Security Council\u2019s capacity\nto deal with threats to international peace and security. To\nour credit, we have been somewhat successful in making\nthe Council\u2019s operations more transparent to the public\neye. We have yet to decide, however, on the major\naspects of resolution 48/26 on the question of equitable\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\nSecurity Council.\nIdeas abound on ways and means of achieving these\naims. Our challenge is to reconcile these so that a\nconsensus can be reached on reform. My delegation\nbelieves that the various proposals now on the table, such\nas those made by Belize, Italy and Malaysia, need to be\nfurther examined to determine both their political\nacceptability and feasibility. It is possible that, under the\nright circumstances and with the necessary political will,\na reformed and more representative Council will emerge.\nA more democratic Security Council will command\nthe respect and enjoy the confidence of United Nations\nMember States. In time, they may be persuaded to rely\nless on their own costly defence forces and more on the\ncollective security system provided by the Organization.\nAs specified by the Charter, the various organs and\n8\n\n\nagencies such as the Assembly, the Council itself, the\nInternational Court of Justice, the Secretariat and \u2014 under\nChapter VIII \u2014 regional arrangements, can combine to\nform an effective bulwark against breaches of peace.\nDuring the cold war, some of these organs were precluded\nfrom performing their several functions. We must now seek\nto endow them with the machinery needed for their full\noperation.\nAt the same time, we need to strengthen the\npartnership against the proliferation of all lethal weapons,\nnuclear and conventional alike. Following the indefinite\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons, we have the opportunity now to sign the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty which, while\nadmittedly less than satisfactory, nevertheless offers a\nchance to proscribe the further development of dangerous\nweapons.\nAlthough considered less worrisome than their nuclear\ncounterparts, conventional weapons are no less destructive\nof human life and property. With the ending of the East-\nWest arms race, these weapons are being diverted by\nproducer States to developing countries, where they fuel\ntensions and eventual conflict. These dangerous transfers\nmust be closely monitored and a serious attempt made to\nconvert the arms industry to development purposes. It is\ntime that we see a dividend from our investment in peace.\nIn eschewing the use of arms, we must seek to\npromote dialogue, negotiation and development to remove\nthe root causes of all disputes and conflicts. The persistent\neruption of violence in the Middle East demonstrates that,\nunless respect is shown for the fundamental rights of the\nPalestinian people, peace will continue to elude that\ntroubled region. The peace process cannot, therefore, be\nallowed to die since without it there is little prospect of\nreconciliation among belligerents. Similarly, in the Korean\npeninsula and, indeed, in all areas where divisions among\npeoples exist, we must use our best diplomatic and political\nefforts to reduce tensions and encourage peaceful\nreunification.\nOur security concerns have widened in the post-cold-\nwar era to other areas, such as the environment and drug-\ntrafficking. As a small State and member of the\nCommission on Sustainable Development, Guyana looks\nforward to the review of the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development, which is due to take place\nin 1997. That meeting will provide us with an opportunity\nto assess the progress made towards implementing the\ncommitments assumed both at Rio and Bridgetown.\nWith regard to our efforts to combat drug-trafficking\nand abuse, we were pleased to participate in the high-\nlevel debate in the Economic and Social Council last\nJune. We urge further international action on the\nmeasures agreed upon and also on the early establishment\nof an international criminal court which, in our view, will\nserve as an effective deterrent to drug-related crimes and\nto other violations against humanity.\nHaving participated in the various summit\nconferences which have been held on the environment\nand development, population and development, human\nsettlements, women and children and social development,\nmy Government is also anxious to see these agreements\nfully implemented. We also look to the upcoming World\nFood Summit in Rome to build upon these existing\ncommitments. Eliminating hunger and guaranteeing food\nsecurity to all the world\u2019s people are urgent imperatives\nfor the international community.\nAs a country which has suffered from the deleterious\neffects of colonialism, Guyana stands in solidarity with all\nStates that now face the formidable challenge of\ndevelopment. We were thus pleased to participate in the\nrecent mid-term review of the implementation of the\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\nAfrica in the 1990s. The results of that review gave\nreasons to hope that the African predicament can be\novercome through a much-strengthened cooperation\nbetween African countries and the international\ncommunity. We wish at this time to call on all States to\nintensify their efforts to support Africa\u2019s initiatives to\npromote its development, for the success or failure of the\nAfrican Agenda will be the success or failure of us all.\nThese issues are at the heart of the wider and\ncomprehensive Agenda for Development which we are in\nthe process of elaborating. The endeavour we have made\nthis past year to complete our negotiations on the content\nof this important document, while significant, points to\nthe inevitable conclusion that we have yet to find the\nlevel of political will needed for meaningful agreement.\nWe seem to be stuck in the confrontational mode set\nduring our previous years of dialogue. My delegation is\nnonetheless of the view that, given the growing\ninterdependence of Member States and the globalization\nof the world economy and society generally, there are\nnow sufficient elements to form the basis of a global\npartnership for peace and development.\nThe terms of this partnership could be drawn up by\nmutual agreement of the parties, specifying both the\n9\n\n\nobligations and the rights of each side. On the part of the\ndeveloping countries, there would be acceptance of their\nprimary responsibility for their development as well as the\nneed for good governance. The developed nations, on the\nother hand, would commit themselves to supporting these\nendogenous efforts and to assisting in the creation of an\ninternational economic environment that would be\npropitious to success.\nLike the Lom\u00e9 partnership that has existed for some\ntime now between a large group of African, Caribbean and\nPacific States and countries of the European Union, such an\narrangement would provide a fair degree of predictability in\nits operations. Developed and developing countries alike\nwould have the assurances of joint performance and\ncommon benefit. Eventually, this partnership would form\nthe basis of a new and enlightened world order to which we\nhave all aspired for many years.\nMy President, Mr. Cheddi Jagan and the Government\nand people of Guyana are dedicated to the creation of this\nnew global partnership. We were pleased to note that\nseveral international conferences \u2014 including the ninth\nsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment at Midrand, South Africa, and the meeting of\nthe Group of Seven in Lyon, France \u2014 have fully\nsubscribed to the concept. We are therefore encouraged to\nthink that the time has come for the establishment of a new\nglobal human order that would be based on respect for\nnational sovereignty, participatory democracy, socio-\neconomic equality, people-centred development and the\nrealization of the economic, social and cultural rights\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. We know that\nsuch an order or partnership \u2014 call it what you will \u2014 will\nnot be easy to create and will require the adoption of a\nfundamentally new development paradigm which will bring\ntogether all actors, governmental and non-governmental\nalike, as well as multilateral and regional institutions, to\nwork together for economic and social progress.\nAt a symposium which was hosted in August 1996 by\nthe Government of Guyana, ample consideration was given\nto ways and means of promoting this new order. In light of\nthe changed political, economic and social circumstances of\nthe world today, the conference agreed inter alia, that, since\nthe enormous debt burden continued to inhibit development,\nserious consideration should be given to the cancellation of\nthe debt of the least developed countries; a significant\nreduction in multilateral debt; and a reduction of the\nremaining debt stock to sustainable levels for the other\ndeveloping countries, with debt-service payments limited to\n10 per cent of exports, provided that 50 per cent of the\nsavings are used for social sector development. There\nshould also be a significant increase in transfers of long-\nterm development finance to developing countries by,\nfirst, attaining the existing official development assistance\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by\nmobilizing new and additional sources of finance;\nsecondly, creating a global fund by mobilizing resources\nusing new and innovative measures, such as the Tobin tax\nand environment-related levies from which Governments\nin both the North and the South would benefit; and,\nthirdly, introducing measures to stabilize the international\nmonetary system and financial markets.\nIn our efforts to promote the concept of the new\nglobal human order, we believe that serious consideration\nshould also be given to the establishment of a fair and\nequitable trading system, including the provision of\nreliable access to the markets of the North. Such a system\nshould take into account the special needs of small\ndeveloping States; ensure fair and stable commodity\nprices; secure a renegotiation of the provisions of the\nWorld Trade Organization, especially with respect to trade\nand environment, intellectual property rights and foreign\ndirect investments; a reduction and relaxation of\nconditions attached to future financial transfers; a new\nemphasis on the expansion of production and growth for\nsustainable development and a safe physical environment\nin the south; the development of the social sector as a\nfocus of any new programme with emphasis on education,\nhuman resources, health and the development needs of\nwomen, children and indigenous peoples; and the\nenhancement of efforts to democratize and strengthen the\nUnited Nations and to restructure other multilateral\nfinancial institutions to respond more effectively to the\nchallenge of people-centred development.\nIn this regard, we must quickly resolve the financial\ncrisis in which the Organization finds itself. Member\nStates, particularly the developed countries, must honour\ntheir payment obligations so that the funding of all United\nNations activities may be placed on a sound and\npredictable basis.\nThese are some of the measures which my\nGovernment believes need to be taken urgently by the\ninternational community in order to promote global peace\nand security. Admittedly, some, if not all, may seem in\nthe eyes of many to be too bold and far- reaching. Yet, if\nthey are not implemented soon, we run the grave risk of\njeopardizing the future of generations to come. We have\nthe moral imperative to act swiftly to prevent the further\ndecline of our peoples and, indeed, of our entire\n10\n\n\ncivilization. Let us therefore resolve to make this fifty-first\nsession of the General Assembly a decisive turning point in\nthe life of the Organization and an opportunity for forging\na just and enlightened partnership among the peoples of the\nworld.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first of all to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the post of\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\nsession.\nGeneral debates over a number of years have already\nclearly indicated that virtually all Member States consider\nit of vital importance to transform the United Nations into\nan Organization with enhanced potential in the service of\npeace and security in the world.\nBelarus advocates a pragmatic approach to the\nreform of the United Nations based on a realistic\nassessment of the Organization\u2019s ability to enhance the\npractical efficiency of the entire United Nations system\nalong the strategic lines of its activities. One of these is\npeacemaking, which in the aftermath of the cold war\nacquired new substance and quality.\nThe New Testament reads,\n\u201cBlessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be\ncalled children of God.\u201d (Matthew, 5:9)\nToday\u2019s efforts by the United Nations to maintain\npeace are noble indeed. Belarus supports actions to\nfurther perfect peacekeeping operations as an important\npractical instrument at the disposal of the United Nations.\n18\n\n\nA crystal-clear understanding of peacekeeping operations as\na specific means used in conflict settlement, aimed at\nmaintaining peace rather than imposing it and at preventing\nhighly explosive situations from emerging, is a sure\nguarantee that such operations will be successfully\nimplemented.\nWe note with satisfaction a substantive breakthrough\nin the peaceful settlement of the conflict in the former\nYugoslavia. Belarus emphasizes the key significance of\nrestoring close economic, scientific and cultural ties\nbetween the States of the region for the normalization of\nthe situation in the Balkans. That is why we support the\nidea of making the decision of lifting the economic and\ntrade embargo against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\na permanent one.\nBelarus attaches great significance to the process of a\npeaceful settlement in the Middle East, based on respect for\nthe right of all States of the region to live in peace within\ninternationally recognized borders.\nAs regards the ways and means to further perfect the\nSecurity Council\u2019s activities, Belarus would like to\nemphasize the principle of balanced representation for all\nregional groups of Member States, in particular the Eastern\nEuropean group, in a renewed and expanded Security\nCouncil.\nGiven their particular significance, concerted\ninternational efforts in the field of disarmament are required\nin shaping the global security system that would befit the\ntwenty-first century. We consider it a great privilege and\nhonour that our practical actions and initiatives in this\ndomain have been recognized and supported through the\nelection of a representative of Belarus to the post of\nChairman of the First Committee at the current session.\nThis year has been marked by momentous events in\nBelarus. Very shortly the last nuclear missile will leave the\nterritory of our Republic, thus making the entire territory of\nCentral Europe, from the Baltic to the Black Sea, a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone. This brings into particular prominence\nthe initiative put forward by Alyaksandr Lukashenka,\nPresident of Belarus, to establish a nuclear-weapon-free\nzone in Central and Eastern Europe.\nEfforts aimed at setting up and consolidating nuclear-\nweapon-free zones in various regions of the world are\ngaining momentum. Hence, we consider it illogical for\nEurope to remain the only continent where no practical\nsteps have been taken in this direction. We strongly believe\nthat setting up a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central and\nEastern Europe would further enhance the spirit of trust,\nmutual respect and partnership in that part of the\nEuropean continent and would serve as a solid\ncontribution by the European nations to nuclear non-\nproliferation.\nIn the search for an efficient arms control regime,\nthe delegation of Belarus intends to initiate further\nconsideration at this session of the General Assembly of\nthe item on prohibition of the development and\nmanufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction\nand new systems of such weapons. Ecologically safe\ndestruction of weapons, conversion of military enterprises,\nlegal aspects of the transfer of sensitive advanced\ntechnology and of their impact on the development of\nscience and technology stand high on the list of our\npriorities.\nFrom this lofty rostrum I am proud to say that,\ndespite the formidable economic, social and financial\nconstraints we have had to overcome, Belarus has\ncompletely fulfilled all its obligations under the Treaty on\nConventional Armed Forces in Europe. Equally significant\nis the fact that Belarus submitted to the Secretary-General\nof the United Nations in July 1996 its ratification\ninstruments on joining the Chemical Weapons\nConvention.\nLocated in the geographical centre of Europe, my\ncountry has set itself the goal of preventing dangerous\ntensions from evolving in the region which, more often\nthan any other part of the planet, has been a seat of world\nwars, in order to help prevent the emergence of new lines\nof separation, curtains, walls and other constructions that\nseemed gone for ever.\nFrom that perspective, we must bring to the\nAssembly\u2019s attention the concern of the Belarusian people\nregarding the eventual rapid expansion of North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) and the deployment of its\nmilitary infrastructure in close proximity to our borders.\nIt is worth noting that a considerable part of the\npopulation of Belarus no longer considers NATO a hostile\norganization. Yet, being realistic, we must admit that\nmuch more time is needed to transform that attitude into\na sympathetic stance. It would be appropriate to expect\nthat such large and drastic transformations in the\nEuropean security system to evolve gradually.\nIn these new circumstances, the role of the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n19\n\n\n(OSCE) acquires new significance. In all confidence, we\npin our hopes on the forthcoming OSCE summit in Lisbon.\nThe results of the summit, I am convinced, will prove to be\na solid basis for enhancing coordination between the United\nNations and the OSCE, as well as for better distributing\nbetween them the functions of ensuring regional security in\nEurope in order to help create a comprehensive security\nmodel for Europe in the twenty-first century and to further\nthe efforts towards concerted actions by European States\naimed at strengthening stability on the continent.\nGlobalization of the world economy made it possible\nfor the States to considerably expand their markets, as well\nas the flow of goods, services, finance and technologies, to\nadjust economic relations and to improve the economic and\nsocial well-being of their populations. At the same time, the\nremoval of trade and other economic barriers exposed the\nvulnerability of countries with less-developed economies.\nMany of those countries find it difficult to keep pace with\nthe rapid transformations now under way and to break the\nvicious circle of backward development.\nThat is why the countries with economies in transition,\nBelarus included, have every reason to expect that special\nmeasures will be taken by the United Nations in order to\nfacilitate their integration into the world economic and trade\nsystems and to help them join existing and emerging\nmultilateral economic institutions and mechanisms.\nWe reiterate our intention to host an international\nconference on the sustainable development of countries with\neconomies in transition, to be convened in Minsk in May\n1997. I am convinced that the results of the conference will\nprove a valuable contribution to the five-year review of the\nimplementation of Agenda 21, at the special session of the\nGeneral Assembly next June.\nThe activities of the United Nations in the social and\nenvironmental fields have a particular significance for\nBelarus. The problems in these areas are extremely acute\ndue to the negative impact of a number of factors that\nemerged in the course of complex economic\ntransformations. The leadership of Belarus is undertaking\nconsiderable efforts to improve the quality of life of its\ncitizens. At the same time, we are not always able to\nresolve acute social problems by our own means alone.\nDecisions adopted at six world summits, held in Rio de\nJaneiro, Vienna, Copenhagen, Beijing, Cairo and Istanbul,\nhave prompted the needed and long-overdue adoption of a\nglobal programme of assistance to the countries that have\nembarked on the road of market reforms.\nThe problem of refugees, displaced persons and\nrepatriates is also very acute today. Our Republic\nwelcomes the results of the Geneva regional conference\non refugees, displaced persons, other forms of forced\nmovements and repatriates in the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS). I believe that the establishment,\nunder the aegis of the United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Refugees, of a permanent regional centre on migratory\nproblems and refugees for the countries of Eastern Europe\ncould make a considerable contribution to the process of\ncomplete and effective implementation of those decisions.\nWe propose that such a centre be headquartered in Minsk.\nTaking urgent measures to combat terrorism, illicit\ndrug trafficking and organized crime is yet another\ndemand of the moment. Proceeding from this premise, we\nwelcome the initiative announced from this rostrum by\nPoland to introduce a draft United Nations framework\nconvention against organized crime.\nOur Republic does not possess nuclear energy, but\nmore than any other State in the world it is interested in\nthe implementation of effective preventive measures in\nthe field of nuclear safety that would make it impossible\nfor new Chernobyls to occur in the future. Belarus is in\nfavour of the comprehensive strengthening of the nuclear-\nsafety regime, including development and adoption of the\nappropriate international convention with concrete and\nstrong commitments under international control. The\ninitiative to establish a global fund for environmental\nprotection deserves most serious consideration. My\ncountry is grateful to the United Nations for its valuable\nefforts in coordinating, initiating and discussing\nChernobyl-related issues. This is extremely important to\nus. At the same time Belarus is deeply concerned over the\nfact that, alongside the ongoing discussion related to the\nclosure of the Chernobyl reactor, the problem of\nmitigating the medical and environmental after-effects of\nthe Chernobyl catastrophe \u2014 the main burden of which\nhas been borne by our young State \u2014 are being pushed\naside.\nWe are deeply concerned over the financial situation\nof the Organization. Admitting that Belarus now finds\nitself among the States with the biggest debts to the\nUnited Nations, we cannot but underscore that this\nsituation has emerged as a result of objective financial\nand economic difficulties experienced by Belarus at this\ncomplex stage of its development, as well as of the unjust\ndistribution of United Nations expenses among the\nMember States. Excessive rates of assessment for the\nUnited Nations regular budget and for peacekeeping\n20\n\n\noperations has now resulted in one of the founding States\nof the United Nations being unable, for objective reasons,\nto fulfil its financial obligations to the Organization. In\nview of this, we support all-round measures aimed at\nreforming the entire financial system of the United Nations\nand the search for fair forms of financial cooperation\nbetween the Organization and the Member States, in\nparticular those whose arrears have accumulated due to a\nnumber of reasons beyond their control.\nFinally, the wide-scale reforming of the United\nNations system coincides with the democratic\ntransformations taking place in a number of States, Belarus\nbeing one of them. Given that the reforms now under way\nare of immediate concern to each and every citizen of our\ncountry, we are fully aware of their significance at this\ncrucial juncture in the development of international\nrelations. Comprehension of the importance of that factor\nenabled Belarus to secure public law and order, stability\nand peace in its territory. Yet sometimes it is not so easy\nfor the major political actors to achieve a coordinated\napproach to tackling the intricate problems facing Belarus\nat this transitional juncture in its history. Thus, it has\nbecome of vital importance today to find an efficient\nbalance between the legislative, the executive and the\njudicial branches of power and to ensure their stable\ninteraction. This is precisely the purpose of the upcoming\npopular referendum in Belarus, which is being held at the\ninitiative of President Alyaksandr Lukashenka.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations has also\nbreathed new life into its ideals and strengthened our belief\nthat the United Nations is a unique and genuinely integral\npart of international life. I am convinced that the fifty-first\nsession of the General Assembly can and must become a\nstarting point for effectively reforming the United Nations,\nwhich will be possible only through the joint efforts of all\nMember States of the Organization.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe opening of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly, under the presidency of Ambassador Razili,\ntakes place at the very moment a large number of States\nhave entered into new commitments on the long road to\nnuclear disarmament. Our signature, this very morning, of\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is another\nopportunity for Belgium to reiterate its determination to\ncontribute to the fight against nuclear proliferation. I am\nvery happy that this important step was taken today. It\nshould inspire us to continue our common effort towards\nuniversal acceptance of this new international instrument,\nas well as an effective implementation of the international\nverification measures it provides.\nMy Irish colleague, Minister Dick Spring, has spoken\non behalf of the European Union, whose objectives and\nconcerns my country shares. Belgium endeavours to\ncontribute substantially to the definition and implementation\nof the policies and plans of action which the European\nUnion intends to carry out throughout the world.\nOur intentions before this Assembly should aim to go\nbeyond formalities. Diplomatic language all too often hides\nour inability to act or our lack of real compassion.\nThe citizens of the world are fearful as we come to\nthe end of the century. Whatever their country, people are\nconfronted with a new anxiety, a fear of tomorrow, without\neven realizing that these feelings are shared by the entire\nworld. In numerous regions of the world, this is a fear of\nphysical danger. It is a fear of external threats, aggression\nand civil war. People die in the same way in Africa, Asia,\nAmerica and Europe. People are killed for the same\ndreams and mutilated in body and spirit by the barbarism\nof modern weaponry and criminal madness born of\nhatred.\nYes, our world is fearful in the face of all these\nviolations of fundamental human rights which persist\nnotwithstanding the major conferences proclaiming our\nhope and belief in a world where the rights of men,\nwomen and children are respected. In such a world\nrespect for humanitarian law need no longer be\nquestioned.\nThe crises felt by rich countries cannot possibly\ncompare with the tragic consequences of war and\nunderdevelopment. Yet the crises in Europe, in our\nprosperous societies, also constitute a humanitarian\ndeficit. They are also the symptoms \u2014 albeit of a\ndifferent nature \u2014 of the same ills of modern times.\nThese include contempt for the human person as a subject\nof law and his reduction to mere merchandise. Today,\nsociety everywhere is in crisis. The logic of the market\nseems to be an exclusionary mechanism which segregates\nsociety. As the Mexican poet Octavio Paz once wrote,\n\u201cThe society of consumption has chilled human life\nwith its glacial waters of selfish calculation.\u201d\nThis dehumanization of mankind for financial profit is the\nprimary cause of many scourges which affect our planet,\nirrespective of the traditions and political systems that\ncharacterize each and every region of the world.\nIn this respect the inertia of individuals transformed\ninto consumers rather than dynamic actors comes to mind,\nas do the problems of unemployment, the scourges of\ntrade in human beings, child prostitution, organ trading,\ndrugs and all other international criminal activities. These\ncalamities of modern times require the international\ncommunity to put in place effective mechanisms by which\nwe can combat them together.\nAs I said during the World Congress Against\nCommercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, which was\nheld in Stockholm last August, we must join efforts,\nwills, means and resources to eliminate and prevent the\nproliferation of these activities on our planet. The\nbehaviour of those who profit from such cruel treatment\n0\n\n\nof human beings must be punished by the international\ncommunity.\nBelgium strongly believes that the provisions of the\nStockholm declaration and programme of action to\ncriminalize the sexual exploitation of children should be\ntranslated into new treaty obligations for all States. The\nongoing negotiations on the adoption of the optional\nprotocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child seem\nto me the appropriate forum to reach this goal.\nThe protection of children in this field should equally\ninspire us to a creative and courageous approach in other\nUnited Nations forums where the question of international\ncriminalization of the trade in human beings is dealt with.\nThe Stockholm declaration and programme of action should\ntherefore be reflected in the texts we adopt during the fifty-\nfirst session of the General Assembly in order to strengthen\nthe protection of the rights of the child and to condemn\nstrongly the exploitation of children.\nThis year, the International Day for the Abolition of\nSlavery, 2 December 1996, will be devoted to the trade in\nhuman beings. The whole world should endeavour to bring\nthis horrendous scandal to an end.\nAlthough we must tackle these social problems, our\naction should first be introspective in order for it to be\ncredible and efficient. How can modern society be\nreconciled with the globalization of cultures and trade?\nHow can the balance between the resources of rich\ncountries and the needs of poor countries be restored?\nThe freedom of the market cannot be absolute, lest it\nbecome an absurdity. Our societies can only be viable if\nthey result from a balance between the freedom of the\nindividual and the fundamental rights of the other. The\nunfortunate evolution of our consumer society and the\nabandonment of humanist values could lead us \u2014 as the\nevents of this summer in my country have shown \u2014 to a\nsociety where murder and rape become commonplace for\nsome and where abuse is tolerated for too long. We must\ntherefore reconstruct our list of moral priorities and crate a\nnew international moral code based on simple, readily\nimplemented priorities.\nPeace, non-violence and acceptance of the other head\nthe list, followed by sharing and social solidarity. Man\nneeds to be reconciled with modern times, reclaiming his\ncentral role as subject and actor rather than object and\nmerchandise. These values also should determine the\nrelations between rich and poor countries. Finally, our\nchildren should be trained to be involved, responsible\ncitizens, conscious of the consequences of their actions on\nsociety. I believe that the formulation of a new\ninternational moral code is necessary if we are to\novercome our fears and rediscover our will to act \u2014 to\nfulfil our moral duty to take an optimistic approach to\ninternational cooperation.\nThis is why preventive diplomacy must be one of\nour top priorities. Belgium neither can nor wants to\nignore the need to turn its attention to the South, to Africa\nin particular. We must overcome the desperation of\ncertain situations and do everything within our means to\nfinally allow the development of justice, social progress\nand democracy in Africa. The situation is extremely\ntroublesome and warrants our basing our political action\non the essential priorities, which are, in fact, challenges\nto be overcome. What are these challenges? to avoid new\nfratricidal wars and genocide; to ensure that in existing\nconflicts international humanitarian law is respected; and\nto guarantee the reconstruction and sustainable\ndevelopment of the continent with full respect for human\nrights and the rule of law. We should develop our policies\nwhile keeping in mind the fundamental relationships that\nmust be constructed between these complementary\nobjectives.\nIn particular, I am thinking of former President\nNyerere\u2019s work in Central Africa. Our support for this\nwork shows our willingness to cooperate with the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the countries\nof the region in trying, together, to find solutions to the\npresent crisis and to prevent hatred, death and the ravages\nof destruction from overrunning Africa, which is dear to\nus. Belgium supports the convening of a conference on\nsecurity and stability in the Great Lakes region.\nThe appointment of Mr. Ajello as Special Envoy of\nthe European Union and of Ambassador Haesendonck as\nBelgian Special Envoy to the region shows the\nwillingness of the European Union and Belgium to\naddress these concerns. For 1996 and 1997, the Belgian\nGovernment has made financial resources available to\nsupport the efforts under way. The survival of the\npopulations of Burundi and Rwanda and of the Kivu\npeople in Zaire is at stake, as well as the security and\nprosperity of Central Africa as a whole.\nWithin the framework of a policy of conflict\nprevention which the European Union, in cooperation\nwith the OAU, is trying to elaborate, the Western\nEuropean Union (WEU), of which Belgium currently\n1\n\n\nholds the chairmanship, is also prepared to offer logistical\nsupport to African peacekeeping operations. The WEU\u2019s\nfact-finding mission to Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda and\nKenya returned with strong conclusions, and we intend to\npursue the recommended course of action during our\nchairmanship. My country, which for years has participated\nin stand-by agreements, must review the mechanisms that\nmight be established to improve the functioning of these\nagreements.\nIn this context, I wish to recall our willingness to\nsupport logistically and financially any possible contingency\nplanning for Burundi. Possibly in a revised form, the\nagreements reached in Arusha last 25 June and 31 July\nshould allow support for the normalization efforts in\nBurundi. This option would clearly be preferred to any\nother possible solution. The Belgian Government would like\nto confirm here its political will to be associated with this\npossible assistance to the security of Burundi, taking into\naccount the modalities that are yet to be defined. However,\nit is my deepest wish that the Burundi authorities and all\nactive parties in that country will find the road to national\nreconciliation and peace, to a system of government which\nguarantees equitable representation and real protection of\nminorities. I wish to recall that Security Council resolution\n1072 (1996) of 30 August demands that these negotiations\nbe initiated before 31 October.\nBelgium\u2019s preventive diplomacy efforts should also be\nseen in the framework of European Union initiatives to\npromote the development of these new societies. The\npresidential, legislative, regional and local elections to be\nheld in Zaire in 1997 are an opportunity for the Belgian\nGovernment and the European Union to show their active\nsolidarity within the framework of collective electoral\nassistance, which must be coordinated by the United\nNations. In order to organize this electoral assistance, I\nwould hope that a representative of the Secretary-General\ncould be appointed as soon as possible. Zaire\u2019s people have\nthe right to participate knowledgeably in free and fair\nelections. The international community has the obligation to\nfacilitate the democratic process in Zaire.\nThe Belgian Government is aware of the difficulty of\narriving at a global approach to the problems of the South,\nand of Central Africa in particular. We do not believe that\nwe should impose upon other countries any system of\ngovernment or dictate the way to achieve this. But we must\ninsist on the concept of good governance. That is, there\nshould be systems of government with checks and balances,\nwhich guarantee the free exercise of the civil, political,\nsocial and cultural rights of the people, and which enhance\nthe development of a free and dynamic society \u2014 the\nonly way to ensure harmonious and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nPreventive diplomacy is meaningless if weapons\nremain available to extremist groups who seek, by the\nsuppression of others and by \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", solutions\nto problems which should only be found in dialogue,\nconsensus and political negotiation. The United Nations\nRegister of Conventional Arms is an essential element in\nmaking the arms trade transparent, a goal which my\ncountry and others support. Since its inception, Belgium\nhas provided the arms Register with the information\nrequested. The extension of the Register to other\ncategories of arms is extremely desirable. The Belgian\nGovernment believes nevertheless that, for now, the main\npriority should be making the Register universal. We,\ntogether with our partners of the European Union, will\ncontinue to concentrate our efforts on this aspect.\nAnti-personnel mines are particularly inhumane\nweapons. Belgium is tirelessly pursuing, in every\ninternational forum, its objective of total and universal\nprohibition of anti-personnel mines. The Belgian\nGovernment regrets that very little progress has been\nmade to date. Next October we will participate in the\nOttawa conference which, I hope, will be able to give a\nsignificant boost to the achievement of our objectives.\nWhen preventive diplomacy and arms control cannot\nkeep peace, peacekeeping missions become necessary. In\nour view, these peacekeeping and peace-restoration\nmissions remain one of the primary responsibilities of the\nUnited Nations. The Belgian Government has taken part\nin various peacekeeping operations and is assuming\nmilitary leadership of the United Nations Transitional\nAdministration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western\nSirmium (UNTAES). I am convinced that the success of\nUNTAES will contribute significantly to the\nre-establishment of a society which we hope will be\npluralist, tolerant and peaceful. Last year, the General\nFramework Agreement, negotiated in Dayton and signed\nin Paris led to the establishment, under United Nations\nauspices, of the NATO-led implementation force (IFOR).\nMy country is, with its partners, part of this peacekeeping\noperation whose role is to be a force for solidarity,\nreconstruction and hope for a new Europe. The recent\nelections in Bosnia and Herzegovina allow us to look\ntoward the future with a degree of optimism.\nThe increase in number and size of peacekeeping\noperations that has characterized the recent history of our\n2\n\n\nOrganization has allowed the development of political\nconcepts and given a new dimension to international\nmilitary cooperation. It has also allowed for positive and\nnecessary developments in the field of international\nhumanitarian law. The Belgian Government hopes that the\nrecent agreement between the International Committee of\nthe Red Cross (ICRC) and the Secretariat on the\napplicability of humanitarian law to peacekeeping\noperations will permit a swift adoption of the lines of\nconduct to this effect. This is indispensable and should be\nwelcomed unreservedly by all troop-contributing countries.\nFor peacekeeping operations to succeed they must be\nfollowed up by rehabilitation programmes. Obviously, these\nprogrammes, which are meant to eliminate the potential\ncauses of new conflicts, must be developed in a climate of\npeace that ensures respect for human rights.\nThis fin de si\u00e8cle is characterized by the size and\nurgency of rehabilitation operations and by humanitarian\nintervention and aid. Despite exceptional crises situations,\nwe must not forget the importance of implementing global\nand sustainable development. The major thematic\nconferences of the United Nations were designed to\nestablish a strategy for the growth of the human being. I\nbelieve that the effective implementation of the moral and\npolitical decisions taken at these major conferences is fully\nin keeping with the new moral code that I hope to see\nemerge.\nIn this context, I would like to mention the efforts to\nreform United Nations institutions and, in particular, the\nquest for efficiency and sound financial management that\nshould be the watchword of the functioning of our\norganizations.\nI began my statement today by denouncing fear and\nwith a plea for a new international moral code. I would like\nto conclude an observation that I made at the outset: that\nwords are hollow if they are mere figures of speech and\ndiplomatic formulas. Our words must be alive, and they\nmust spring from peace, silence and complete transparency.\nOnly then will we be able to understand the language of the\nmany children, women and men afflicted by\nunderdevelopment, war and indifference.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I would like\nto congratulate the President on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session.\nGiven his talent and experience, I am confident that he will\nguide this session to a successful completion of the noble\nmission entrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations.\nI would also like to express my appreciation and\nthanks to his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas Do Amaral,\nfor his outstanding leadership in accomplishing the tasks of\nthe last session.\nThe end of the cold war has given a decisive\nimpetus to globalization by offering former socialist\neconomies the opportunity to assume their rightful place\nin the world economy. The challenges posed by extremely\nrapid transformation are nowhere more graphically\ndepicted than in the current transition of the countries of\nEastern and Central Europe and in the former Union of\nSoviet Socialist Republics.\nIn addition to severe economic and social problems\nresulting from the extraordinary changes buffeting the\ncountry, the transition process in Armenia has been\nexacerbated by the transport and energy blockade by\nneighbouring Azerbaijan, the devastation caused by the\nmassive earthquake of 1988, the conflict between\nNagorny-Karabakh and Azerbaijan and the presence of\nmore than 300,000 refugees.\nDespite such serious circumstances, economic\nreforms begun after the declaration of independence in\n1991 have been continued and expanded over the past\nyear. Having achieved a fair degree of economic stability,\nthe Government of Armenia has designed a medium-term\neconomic programme for 1996-1998. Armenia\u2019s medium-\nterm policy objectives are to maintain financial stability\nand establish the institutions and mechanisms of a market\neconomy by the end of the programme period in order to\nlay the foundation for sustainable growth and a viable\nbalance of payments. Consistent with this strategy, the\nmain macroeconomic objectives of the programme are to\nraise the economic growth rate from 5 per cent in 1995\nto 7 per cent in 1998; to lower inflation to 8 per cent by\nthe end of 1998; and to narrow the current account deficit\nfrom 26 per cent of the gross domestic product in 1995\nto 12 per cent in 1998. To cope with the social pressures\ninvolved in the transition process, the reorientation of\nsocial expenditures towards the most vulnerable remains\na high-priority task. The programme lays emphasis on\nimproving the targeting of the social safety net and\nintensifying efforts to rationalize social expenditures.\nWhile each country is responsible for its own\neconomic policies for development, in accordance with its\nspecific situation and conditions, the reactivation of\neconomic growth and development in all countries\nrequires a concerted effort of the international community.\nHere, particular attention should be given to the needs of\nthe countries with economies in transition, without this\naffecting development assistance to the developing\ncountries.\n5\n\n\nThe completion of the transition process, the\nintegration of these countries into the world economy and\ntheir effective involvement in the multilateral institutions\nwill have a positive impact not only on these countries\nthemselves, but also on the global economy.\nAs we approach the twenty-first century, it is the\ncollective responsibility of the international community to\nensure that, within the multidimensional and integrated\ncharacter of its mandate, the United Nations system is\nequipped to show leadership in the fulfilment of the\ncommitments made to international cooperation for\ndevelopment.\nIn this context, the United Nations System-wide\nSpecial Initiative for Africa exemplifies the system\u2019s\ncommitment to collaborative action and its renewed\ncommitment to supporting Africa\u2019s development. Launched\nlast March by the Secretary-General, this Initiative is the\nlargest coordinated action in the history of the United\nNations. While it is clear that the implementation of the\nInitiative will be led at the country level by Governments,\nthe United Nations agencies will hold themselves mutually\naccountable for achieving this Initiative\u2019s goals.\nThe United Nations, in cooperation with the Bretton\nWoods institutions, other bodies of the United Nations\nsystem, including its specialized agencies, and the World\nTrade Organization, has a key role in fostering greater\ncoherence, complementarity and coordination in global\neconomic policy-making. The General Assembly should\nexert greater policy leadership on development issues\ninasmuch as the Charter of the United Nations provides the\nAssembly with broad mandates concerning these issues. In\naccordance with relevant provisions of the Charter, the\nEconomic and Social Council must continue to strengthen\nits role as the central mechanism for coordinating the\npolicies and activities of the United Nations, its specialized\nagencies and funds in the economic, social and related\nfields. It should provide overall guidance and coordination\nto the United Nations development system. The Council\nmust also promote a coordinated follow-up to the outcomes\nof major international conferences.\nRecommendations adopted by the Economic and\nSocial Council at its 1996 substantive session on\nstrengthening collaboration between the United Nations and\nBretton Woods institutions and on new arrangements for\nconsultations with non-governmental organizations\nrepresented a great step forward.\nModern democracy is the political counterpart of the\nmarket economic system, and the two go hand in hand.\nThe success of a democracy requires informed and civil\ndiscourse and respect for the rule of law and the\ndemocratic process, including the expression of the public\nwill through free and fair elections.\nThe recent, vigorously contested presidential election\nsignalled the vitality of the democratic process in\nArmenia. President Levon Ter-Petrossian\u2019s re-election\ndemonstrates the will of the people in support of the\npolicies pursued thus far by the Government, based on a\nclear programme and an achievable plan of development.\nDevelopment cannot be attained in the absence of\nrespect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nArmenia strongly supports the High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights in his efforts to restructure the Centre for\nHuman Rights. The Member States must continue\nworking towards better coordination within the Centre and\nconsolidation of human-rights functions within the United\nNations system.\nArmenia considers self-determination in its multitude\nof manifestations to be an inalienable human right. In this\nlight, the Nagorny Karabakh conflict continues to concern\nthe Government of Armenia and its peaceful resolution\nremains Armenia\u2019s top foreign-policy priority. A few\nmonths ago, on 12 May, we marked the second\nanniversary of the cease-fire in the Nagorny Karabakh\nconflict. At the same time, the parties to the conflict\nreleased all prisoners of war and hostages identified by\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross. We\nconsider these developments encouraging and conducive\nto the overall peace process and to the establishment of a\nfavourable atmosphere for negotiations.\nNegotiations among the parties within the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) Minsk Group on a political agreement continued\nduring the past year. We believe that the signing of the\nagreement provides the best hope for consolidating the\ncease-fire and making the peace process irreversible. The\nelements of the political agreement, and most importantly\nthe security provisions for Nagorny Karabakh, will\neventually comprise an inseparable part of any settlement,\nregardless of the ultimate status of Nagorny Karabakh.\nAlso this year, the parties took an extra step to\nestablish a second negotiating track through immediate\nand direct contacts, as mandated by the December 1995\nmeeting of the OSCE Council of Ministers in Budapest.\n6\n\n\nThus far, several rounds of talks have taken place between\nArmenia and Azerbaijan in which general aspects of key\nissues have been discussed. We are hopeful that the\nrepresentative of Nagorny Karabakh will join in upcoming\nrounds, for we strongly believe that no final solution can be\nachieved without Karabakh\u2019s direct participation in the\ndeliberations.\nThe peaceful resolution of the Karabakh conflict\nremains Armenia\u2019s first priority. Armenia is committed to\nthe talks on both tracks and will remain constructively\nengaged in both processes. We believe that these two tracks\ncompliment each other and that any progress we make on\neither can only positively impact the other, ultimately\nleading to a breakthrough.\nDuring the past five years, Armenia has experienced\nfirst hand how war, armed conflict and regional instability\nin general can hamper economic progress and development.\nThus, I would like to reiterate Armenia\u2019s commitment to\nmaintaining the existing cease-fire, while eagerly searching\nfor a solution based on good will, mutual compromise and\nunderstanding.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nposes a serious threat to both global and regional security\nand stability. The adoption last month by the General\nAssembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nrepresented the international community\u2019s determination to\nbring to a completion one of the most sought after non-\nproliferation and disarmament measures in the history of\nthis Organization. It gave me much satisfaction to sign the\nTreaty earlier today on behalf of the Government and\npeople of Armenia.\nVirtually all States Members of the United Nations\nfavour an increase in the membership of the Security\nCouncil, reflecting the radical changes in the world and the\nincrease in the Organization\u2019s overall membership.\nHowever, during the discussions in the Open-ended\nWorking Group, wide support has been expressed for the\nview that, if there is no agreement on other categories of\nmembership, expansion should take place, for the time\nbeing, in the non-permanent category alone. Armenia\nfavours an increase in the non-permanent membership of\nthe Council that would incorporate the interests of all the\nregional Groups and correspond to the principle of equitable\ngeographic distribution.\nIn order to carry out its activities, the United Nations\nneeds financial means. The financing of the Organization is\nthe collective responsibility of all Member States and\nArmenia is not indifferent to the financial situation of the\nUnited Nations.\nI would like to assure the Assembly that Armenia\nwill do its best to fulfil its financial obligations. However,\nthere is an urgent need to adopt a global package of\nmeasures to solve the grave financial situation of the\nUnited Nations. These measures should contemplate,\ninter alia, review of the scale of assessments so that it\nwould reflect as accurately as possible the principle of\ncapacity to pay.\nAllow me to conclude by wishing the General\nAssembly every success in the demanding work it faces\nduring this session, and by pledging Armenia\u2019s most\nactive and effective cooperation with the delegations of\nother States.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation wishes to\nexpress its satisfaction and joy in seeing Mr. Razali\nIsmail preside over the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly. His unanimous election is an honour to him\npersonally and also to his country, Malaysia, with which\nGhana has forged very warm and special relations. We\nhave no doubt that his sterling qualities and long record\nof distinguished service to his Government and the\ninternational community will stand him in good stead in\nleading this Assembly to a successful conclusion of its\nwork.\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of\nPortugal, we wish to express our appreciation for the able\nmanner in which he led us through very difficult\nnegotiations during his presidency.\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nhas demonstrated, through his indefatigable energy and\ncommitment to the independence and well-being of the\nUnited Nations, that he is up to the challenges that lie\nahead of us in seeking to revitalize this Organization for\nthe twenty-first century.\nIt was only a year ago that we celebrated with\nfanfare the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of our\nOrganization. The world leaders assembled in this\nAssembly at that time once again rededicated themselves\nto achieving the visions embodied in the Charter of our\nOrganization and fulfilling its goals and objectives, which\nserve the largest interests of humanity. We have gathered\nhere again this year to take stock of developments since\nour last meeting and to renew, through various decisions\nand resolutions, our commitment to the promotion of\npeace and prosperity for our mutual benefit.\nThe end of the cold war provides us with a golden\nopportunity to work earnestly in pursuit of the\ninternational community\u2019s desire for general and complete\ndisarmament \u2014 including nuclear disarmament \u2014 to be\nachieved under effective international control. Through\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\nand nuclear-weapon-free zones, most of us non-nuclear-\nweapon States are making our contributions in this\nrespect. My Government is in the process of ratifying the\nPelindaba Treaty, of which we are a proud signatory, and\nwe appreciate the support of the non-nuclear and nuclear-\nweapon States for that Treaty. However, such zones can\n20\n\n\nonly be given meaning by the nuclear-weapon States\u2019\ngenuinely accepting the need for the eventual elimination of\nnuclear weapons within a given time-frame. It is with this\nin view that my country voted in favour of the adoption of\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and signed it,\ndespite its shortcomings. We see the Treaty as a first step\nin the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons in the world.\nWe also join the Non-Aligned Movement in urging all\nnuclear-weapon States to conclude an international\ninstrument that would offer unconditional and legally\nbinding assurances to all non-nuclear-weapon States against\nthe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. This will\nenable all States subscribing to international instruments on\nnon-proliferation to cooperate freely and unconditionally in\nthe application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\nWe will also continue to urge that more attention be\npaid to conventional armaments and to efforts to enhance\ninternational cooperation to curtail and eventually prohibit\nthe use of anti-personnel land-mines and other inhumane\nweapons, which continue to inflict untold damage and\nhardship on innocent people long after the conflicts in\nwhich they were deployed have ended. Similar attention\nshould be given to international cooperation in curbing\nillicit transfers of arms. Success in this field will go a long\nway towards curtailing the availability of weapons, which\nfeed the numerous conflicts we have had to contend with in\nrecent years, to drug traffickers and terrorists.\nInternal strife within States, nurtured by racial and\nreligious intolerance, and the resort to arms for the\nsettlement of disputes threaten the very existence of a\nnumber of States in diverse regions of the world. In all of\nthese States, the intransigence of warlords poses serious\nchallenges to the capacity of the international community in\ngeneral and the United Nations in particular to meet their\nresponsibilities with regard to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. We have seen this in the\nformer Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Somalia, Rwanda,\nBurundi, Angola, Liberia and Haiti. The efforts made so far\nto deal with these conflicts are laudable, but more needs to\nbe done.\nThat is what we are doing in West Africa, despite the\nrecent setbacks suffered from the attacks on forces of the\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) in December 1995 and the\noutbreak of fighting in Monrovia in April and May 1996.\nThough the implementation of the programme for the\ndisarmament and demobilization of the fighters, their\nreinsertion into normal civil life and the holding of\ndemocratic elections in Liberia, as set out in the Abuja\nAgreement, are now behind schedule, the meeting of the\nECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia, in August 1996\nin Abuja, saw the Liberian factional leaders renew once\nagain their support for the peace process and their pledges\nto cooperate with the efforts to bring the Abuja\nAgreement back on track. Thus far we have been able to\nrestore the capital, Monrovia, to its status as a safe haven\nand reinstate the Council of State and the Liberian\nNational Transitional Government. The ceasefire between\nthe warring factions in the country has remained largely\nrespected, although there are still disturbing reports of\nhostilities between some of the factions.\nWe do appreciate the assistance of some individual\ncountries to ECOMOG, as well as the cooperation of the\nUnited Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, but we wish\nto stress once again that these modest forms of support\nare grossly inadequate, viewed against the enormity of the\ntasks in Liberia and the present state of the economies of\nECOWAS member States. The Liberian factional leaders\nare tired of the war. The subregion has been able to\nbroker peace amongst them, but it lacks the means to\nprovide the resources to implement the peace accord. The\ninternational community should respond to the call for\nresources now or run the risk of the situation deteriorating\nonce again. We shall not tire of reminding the\ninternational community that this Organization, the\nSecurity Council in particular, bears the ultimate\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\nand security. Regional or subregional efforts like ours can\nonly complement, not substitute for, those of the\ninternational community, which must face its\nresponsibilities more seriously in Liberia.\nFor our part, we in Ghana have endeavoured over\nthe years to play the role assigned to us within the limits\nof our resources in meeting our common responsibilities\ntowards the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. Since our participation in the United Nations\npeacekeeping operations in the Belgian Congo \u2014 now\nZaire \u2014 in the 1960s, Ghana has been present in almost\nall the continents where United Nations peacekeeping\nduties call, and we are indeed proud of our contribution\nto these international peace efforts.\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, we\ncannot hide our amazement that some people and their\nGod-given territories remain under colonial or alien\ndomination and foreign occupation. Even more\nastonishing is the fact that some otherwise democratic,\nadministering countries and colonial Powers fail to\n21\n\n\nrecognize the inalienable right of the administered or\ncolonial peoples to self-determination, and they fail to\nrecognize that colonial domination is among the worst\nforms of violations of the human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms of colonial peoples.\nIt is therefore no accident that we should be gravely\nconcerned at the continuing lack of progress on the question\nof Western Sahara. Despite all of its shortcomings, the\nsettlement plan agreed to by the parties to the Western\nSahara problem, under the auspices of this Organization,\nremains the best option for pursuing a long-lasting solution\nin the interest of the Saharan people. We remain concerned\nthat the identification process has had to be suspended and\nthe Identification Commission withdrawn as a result of the\nfailure of the parties to agree on some relevant important\nprocedures and modalities. To break the stalemate, dialogue\nis essential, and we once more call on the Assembly to\nencourage the principal parties to the conflict to engage,\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, in direct talks that\ncan open the way for the continuation of the identification\nprocess. Urgent attention and action is required to bring to\nan end the present unacceptable situation, which poses a\nveritable threat to subregional, regional and wider\ninternational security.\nIn a similar vein, we take this opportunity to reaffirm\nour unflinching support for the Middle East Peace Process\ninitiated at the Madrid Peace Conference in 1991 and\nculminating in the Oslo accords. Over the past five years,\nseveral gains have been made, giving rise to hopes that a\njust and comprehensive peace in the region is attainable that\nwould take cognizance of the legitimate right to self-\ndetermination of the Palestinian people and their right to an\nindependent state. We therefore see the recent outbreak of\nviolence in the area as a set-back to those laudable efforts\nand as a reflection of a growing mistrust on the part of the\nparties. We call on them to honour all their commitments\nunder the agreements reached and to bring the peace\nprocess back on track. In this connection we welcome the\nefforts of the United States Administration to bring the\nparties together once more.\nI should like at this juncture to refer to the question of\nthe United Nations sanctions imposed on Libya. The\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), the League of Arab\nStates and the Non-Aligned Movement, which represent the\nvast majority of States and peoples of the world, have been\ncalling for some years now for the sanctions on Libya to be\nlifted. Our call for dialogue and negotiations that could lead\nto an acceptable solution of the dispute between Libya and\nthe three permanent members of the Security Council, as\nwell as proposals for a fair trial of the two suspects in\nThe Hague, by Scottish judges and under Scottish law,\nhave not elicited the expected response. Let it not be\nconstrued that our calls are based merely on sentimental\nconsiderations of regional solidarity. After careful\nexamination of the facts as made known to the\ninternational community, and with due respect for the\ntenets of international law, we think that the three States\nconcerned need to reciprocate the flexibility shown by the\nLibyan authorities and help to bring to a close an issue\nthat has unjustifiably caused untold suffering to the\ninnocent people of Libya. Issues of this nature justify our\nsupport for the establishment of an international criminal\ncourt for the promotion and maintenance of international\ncriminal justice on a fair and equitable basis.\nThe relics of the cold war in international relations\nremain particularly on the Korean peninsula and in United\nStates-Cuba relations. We believe that the four-party talks\nproposed to ease tension on the Korean peninsula should\nfoster dialogue, understanding and cooperation among all\nthe countries concerned and enhance the process aimed at\nthe eventual unification of the two Koreas. With regard to\nUnited States-Cuba relations, we hope that the blockades\nand mutual exchanges of rhetoric will give way to a new\nera of dialogue and mutual respect, in tune with current\ntrends in international relations.\nAs has been eloquently stated by the Secretary-\nGeneral in his Agenda for Peace, there can be no\ndevelopment without peace, just as there can be no peace\nwithout development. We are convinced that we need to\npursue development as a means of preventing most of the\nconflicts, tragedies and humanitarian disasters that\nconfront the world today. We are enjoined under the\nCharter of the United Nations to\n\u201cemploy international machinery for the promotion\nof the economic and social advancement of all\npeoples\u201d.\nThe need for concerted international action to restructure\nthe international economy; construct a new regime to\nguide trade, aid and resource flows; and address the\nproblems posed by environmental degradation, population\nexplosion, the debt overhang, abject poverty and disease\nin developing countries, cannot be overemphasized. Such\nmeasures would redress the existing global economic\ninequalities and eradicate poverty in a way that will\nengender the peace and security that we all so dearly\nneed. As expected, the series of global conferences held\nrecently under the auspices of the United Nations, which\ninvolved not only Governments but also non-\n22\n\n\ngovernmental organizations, civil society, the media and the\nprivate sector, have raised awareness of and built consensus\naround a number of overarching issues concerning\neconomic growth and sustainable development. The time\nhas come to shift into implementation gear and invest the\nsame political will and energy in the monitoring of the\nfollow-up process. We want to safeguard the environment\nand the welfare of our children, eradicate poverty, ensure\nsustainable development, and mainstream gender concerns\nin all our activities at the national and international levels,\nso that women and men participate fully and equally in all\nspheres of life as we approach the new dawn.\nIt bears mentioning that Africa\u2019s socio-economic\ndifficulties are further compounded by the twin processes\nof globalization and liberalization. Africa therefore needs\nthe special attention of the international community to\nensure that the profound economic and institutional reforms\nit is undertaking to create an enabling environment for\ndevelopment yield maximum benefit for its people. The\nlaunching of the United Nations System-wide Special\nInitiative for Africa in March 1996, if fully implemented,\nwould contribute meaningfully to this endeavour.\nWe are painfully aware that international financial\nsupport for Africa is insufficient and unreliable. It is\ntherefore necessary for the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) in Africa to focus on the enhancement\nand strengthening of Africa\u2019s subregional economic\ngroupings, which will serve as building blocks for an\nAfrican economic community. This in turn will ensure\nAfrica\u2019s effective participation in the emerging global\neconomic order that is increasingly being shaped by the\nforces of globalization and economic liberalization.\nFor our part, we in Ghana are coping, not without\ndifficulty, with the challenges posed by these forces,\nincluding those that are concomitant with the structural\nadjustment programmes that we have pursued for well over\na decade. Coupled with these are those other imperatives\nthat come with the processes of democratization and good\ngovernance. Our democratically elected Government will\npresent itself to the electorate on 7 December 1996 to seek\na fresh mandate to continue with the policies that have\nensured stability and development in our country in recent\nyears.\nThe entry into force of the United Nations Convention\non the Law of the Sea is a welcome development, and we\nfully appreciate the numerous efforts and various\ncompromises that contributed immensely to putting into\nplace the various organs of the International Seabed\nAuthority. We hope that adequate resources will be made\navailable to enable developing countries to utilize fully the\nbenefits, and also discharge the responsibilities, deriving\nfrom the Convention.\nThe financial situation of our Organization remains\nprecarious and a source of concern to my delegation. The\ncrunch in the cash-flow situation has not changed for the\nbetter, principally because a number of countries,\nincluding some of the largest, are neither paying their\ncontributions nor making good on their arrears. It is\nimportant for Member States to provide the United\nNations system with the means and resources required to\naccomplish the tasks assigned to it. Support for the\nUnited Nations should manifest itself not only in an\neagerness to restructure it to make it more effective, but\nalso in the payment in full, on time and without\nconditions of assessed contributions, in order to promote\nthe successful pursuit of the objectives of the\nOrganization at a time of both challenge and opportunity.\nIn addressing the cash-flow situation, we also wish to\ndeplore the high degree of wastage and overlap in the\nsystem, especially during the start-up and liquidation\nphases of peacekeeping operations as well as in the\nproliferation of mandates. With the consolidation of the\ninternal oversight mechanisms into the Office of Internal\nOversight Services, coupled with the existing external\noversight mechanisms, it is hoped that the financial\nfunctioning of the Organization will be more cost-\neffective.\nI should like to conclude by reaffirming my\ndelegation\u2019s support for the reforms currently being\npursued by the United Nations. In our view, the reforms\nin the financial administration of the Organization, the\nrevitalization of its economic and social structures, the\nstrengthening of the General Assembly and the\nSecretariat, and the restructuring of the Security Council\nall should contribute to a better functioning United\nNations suited for the challenges ahead of us as we enter\nthe new millennium."

        "file_text": "\ufeffSamoa congratulates you most\nwarmly on your highly acclaimed election. It is a particular\npleasure for me to express to you our full confidence in and\nsupport for your presidency. I want also to pay tribute to\nHis Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal\nfor his outstanding service and leadership during the\nhistoric fiftieth session of the Assembly.\nSamoa welcomes the adoption by this Assembly of\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT),\nwhich I will sign on behalf of my Government later\ntoday. We are signing the Treaty because it is what we\nhave all sought for so long. We applaud and thank\nAustralia for the initiative to bring the Treaty directly to\nthe General Assembly. For us in the Pacific, the CTBT\nbrings to an end a long and unsatisfactory situation. Too\nmany nuclear weapons, far too many, were tested in our\nregion, and we remain fearful of the consequences,\nespecially to our fragile environment and marine\nresources. Like others, we acknowledge the shortcomings\nof the CTBT and regret that it was not possible to reach\nthe required consensus in the Conference on\nDisarmament. But that must not be allowed to stand in\nthe way of the work that remains to be done. The CTBT\nis a mark of critical progress. We must all now employ\nthe most serious effort in moving the disarmament\nprocess further, including bringing the CTBT into force.\nToday the international community is united, perhaps\nmore so than at any other time, in recognizing the\ncomplete elimination of all nuclear weapons as a\nfundamental goal. Samoa is deeply committed to this\ngoal, and we will continue to work for its achievement\ntogether with other members of the United Nations as\nwell as with members of civil society.\nIt is a matter of the greatest encouragement to my\nGovernment to have the favourable opinion of the\nInternational Court of Justice on the question of the\nlegality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons. We\n\n\nwelcome in particular the Court\u2019s very timely reminder of\nthe obligation to pursue in good faith, and to bring to a\nconclusion, negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament.\nWe accept entirely the important opinion of the Court that\nnuclear disarmament, in all its aspects, must be under strict\nand effective international control.\nI should also acknowledge the signing earlier this year\nby the United States of America, the United Kingdom and\nFrance of the Protocols to the South Pacific Nuclear Free\nZone Treaty. The prompt ratification by France is\nappreciated, and we look forward to full adherence by all\nnuclear-weapon States. We believe that their full\nparticipation will not only inspire confidence within our\nregion, but will also carry a message of hope for the rest of\nthe international community.\nWe place considerable faith in the importance of\nnuclear-weapon-free zones and the vital role they play in\nthe disarmament process. During this session, along with\nother delegations, Samoa will support efforts aimed at\ndeveloping links and enhancing cooperation among southern\nhemisphere nuclear-weapon-free zones.\nWe are from a region which treasures peace and\nsecurity, and we seek for ourselves the highest measure of\npeaceful coexistence with all countries. We therefore share\nin full the anguish of our fellow humans in all countries\nwho are being denied the conditions to live and to develop\nin peace and in fulfilment.\nMy Government welcomes the developments in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina and the implementation of the Dayton\nAgreement. Our hope is that the recent elections too will\nserve to provide confidence and trust among all the parties.\nWe continue to pray for lasting peace in the Middle\nEast. We commend President Clinton for initiating the\nrecent Washington meetings, and we urge all sides, in the\nrenewed negotiations now taking place in the region, to\nmake every effort possible to restore stability and direction\nto the peace process in the spirit of mutual respect.\nWe are also a country which cherishes the United\nNations Charter and the fundamental principles for which\nour Organization stands. This is the basis for our support of\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China.\nWe have faith in the elaboration of rules to regulate\ninternational behaviour and cooperation. Increasingly,\ndevelopments in the international system require both State\nand citizen to submit to international scrutiny. One area\nthat calls for attention concerns serious humanitarian\noffences and crimes of international concern, including\nterrorism. Samoa fully supports the early establishment of\nan international criminal court to deal with these crimes.\nReforms of the United Nations were given a great\ndeal of focus at the fiftieth session and much has already\nbeen said during this general debate, and rightly so. At\nalmost every level, the Organization remains in need of\nsubstantial change and improvement. My own country is\nfully committed in its support for the ongoing efforts to\nstrengthen and revitalize our Organization to make it\nmore democratic, fair and representative. I must say,\nhowever, that having only a small delegation to cope with\nthe multifaceted work being carried out in the five high-\nlevel Working Groups, we feel both disadvantaged and,\nat times, dispirited about the pace and often the direction\nof the discussions.\nThe membership of the Security Council must be\nenlarged to reflect the realities of the present time and to\nenhance the Council\u2019s effectiveness and legitimacy. There\nis need to give particular consideration to the case of\nJapan and Germany. My Government is also giving the\nmost serious thought to proposals, such as that of Italy,\nthat would ensure the proper and regular representation of\nsmall States and their concerns in the work of the\nCouncil. We think the discussions during this session\nshould try and focus on areas with regard to which there\nis reasonable chance of progress and on which significant\nconsensus can be consolidated. We do not see the point\nin endless open-ended discussions.\nWe share fully the concerns voiced about the very\nserious and unsatisfactory financial situation of the United\nNations. The payment of assessed contributions is a freely\naccepted responsibility and a solemn duty that all States\nmust discharge promptly and without condition. Samoa\nwillingly accepts this duty and will continue to meet its\nown financial obligations. However, we must say again\nthat the current floor rate has rendered the present scale\nof assessments inequitable for small and least developed\nStates like my own. A recent report of the Committee on\nContributions has given attention to this anomaly, and we\nfeel that timely action must be taken to work out a fairer\nsystem of assessment based on capacity to pay in real\nterms.\nNext year, during your presidency, Sir, we shall\nhave to undertake the five-year review of Agenda 21. It\nwill be a first and timely opportunity for comprehensive\n2\n\n\nassessment and for giving momentum to sustainable\ndevelopment. Given your prominence at the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development in 1992, we\nshall have to look to you for an extra measure of leadership\nto ensure solid results from the review and effective\nperformance from the institutions charged with\nimplementing Agenda 21.\nSamoa, together with other small island States,\ncontinues to emphasize the importance of the Programme\nof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States. It is a realistic plan for our sustainable\neconomic development. While our endeavours to implement\nthe Programme of Action have been greatly assisted and\nfacilitated by United Nations organs, achievement is\nultimately a matter of national effort and perseverance.\nWith the crucial support of the international community, we\nmust continue to hold high the ethic of self-sufficiency.\nThe sea and its resources provide real prospects for\nour development. The legal regimes that govern them and\ntheir use are matters of vital importance to Samoa. They\nwill continue to receive our closest attention. We welcome\nthe election of members of the International Tribunal for\nthe Law of the Sea and the establishment of the\nInternational Seabed Authority. We think it is appropriate\nto grant United Nations observer status to the Authority and\nwe will support the efforts to strengthen the organization of\nthe Authority and to ensure its financial viability.\nThe preservation of our environment is a major\npreoccupation for my country. We will continue to make\nevery effort to be engaged in international discussions and\nto contribute to the development of international\nenvironmental principles and modalities to ensure that our\nconcerns are adequately reflected. Recourse to international\nlaw and to effective international mechanisms is the\nultimate protection and security for small States.\nThe global climate is changing, and the impact of this,\nespecially the rise in the sea level, pose the most serious\ndangers for Samoa and for all small islands. As a member\nof the Alliance of Small Island States, we have pressed and\nwill continue to press our concerns for immediate and\neffective international action.\nThe second assessment report of the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change confirms what we have long\nfeared: human activity is warming and changing the climate\nsystem. Ministers of the Environment who attended the\nsecond Conference of the Parties in Geneva in July this\nyear endorsed the report as the most comprehensive and\nauthoritative assessment of climate science.\nThe Panel\u2019s report underlines the real urgency of the\nclimate change negotiations mandated at Berlin last year.\nCurrent commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\nunder the Convention will not be enough to arrest global\nwarming, and additional and effective commitments by\nindustrialized countries extending beyond the year 2000\nmust be established. In 1994, the Alliance of Small Island\nStates submitted possible solutions as set out in its draft\nprotocol. It remains the only complete proposal on the\ntable.\nWe now have barely a year before the need to\nfinalize negotiations of a protocol or another legal\ninstrument to strengthen the Convention on Climate\nChange for adoption at the Conference of the Parties next\nyear in Kyoto, Japan. We call on all Convention parties\nto move with all seriousness and urgency on the matter.\nThe General Assembly has a full and comprehensive\nagenda before it. Under your leadership we have every\nreason to look forward to firm and positive results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe Burundi delegation, which I have the honour\nof leading at the current session of this General Assembly,\nwould like to begin by taking this opportunity to present the\nfriendly greetings of the Government and people of\nBurundi.\nBurundi attaches overwhelming importance to the\nnoble ideals of justice, peace and security which the United\nNations has defended and pursued. This is why, even\nduring the acute crisis that has rocked our country these\npast three years, we have always tried to participate as\nactively as possible in these proceedings. We offer well-\ndeserved thanks for the Organization\u2019s tireless efforts to put\nan end to the fratricidal war we have been experiencing\nsince 21 October 1993.\nOur delegation welcomes the fitting choice of a\nworthy son of Malaysia to act as President of the fifty-first\nsession of the General Assembly of our Organization. We\nare convinced that his intellectual and moral qualities,\ntogether with his thorough knowledge of the concerns of\nthe world today, are undeniable assets in ensuring the\nsuccess of our work.\nHe can count on the full support and readiness of my\ncountry, which has a Vice-President on the Bureau, and we\nwill make our modest contribution to ensuring the success\nof the work of the President.\nWe also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal,\nfor the competence and clear-sightedness with which he\nconducted the proceedings of the previous session, when\nthe United Nations was commemorating its fiftieth\nanniversary.\nFinally, we wish to express our appreciation for the\nrole that His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, has played\nthroughout the world during his term of office to promote\npeace, cooperation and development. We particularly\nremember the important appeal for peace and national\nreconciliation he addressed to the people of Burundi and\nAfrica during his visit to Bujumbura in July 1995.\nDespite the crisis in my country, we believe that this\nmessage will finally be heeded by those who opted for\nviolence to satisfy their ambitions.\nAs members know, the fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly is taking place at a time when my\ncountry, Burundi, is suffering the deepest crisis of its\nhistory. The end of the cold war certainly made it\npossible for the international community to free itself\nfrom the ideological shackles and other constraints\nimposed on it by East-West antagonisms. The United\nNations has thus been able to focus on its fundamental\nobjectives and effectively respond to some of the\nproblems the rivalry between super-Powers had long\nmade it impossible to solve.\nHowever, we cannot but note, not without bitterness,\nthat in the post-cold-war period, new, more complex\nconflicts have broken out, mostly within countries, that\nhave caused serious humanitarian problems. That,\nunfortunately, is the case in my country. For three years,\nBurundi has been in the grip of widespread massacres and\nacts of genocide.\nSince October 1993, Burundi has been increasingly\nmired in a tragedy from which it seems unable to escape.\nThe consensus Government established in October 1994\nin the context of implementation of the Convention on\nGovernance of 10 September 1994, after lengthy\nnegotiations among political parties, has been\ncharacterized by suspicion and a lack of trust at the\nhighest echelons of State and a serious lack of will to\nrestore peace.\nThe complicity of the previous administration with\narmed groups, massive human rights violations, duplicity\nat the top of the State administration and the absence of\nleadership have led to denunciation of the Convention on\nGovernance and a breakdown in institutions. With a view\nto avoiding implosion in the face of the threat of renewed\ngenocide, and lacking a credible alternative, the active\nforces of the nation requested His Excellency President\nBuyoya to take on the burden of responsibility of putting\nBurundi back on track.\nThe new administration has decided that its priority\nis to put an end to massacres and slaughter, to restore\npeace and security for all, to end impunity, to reintegrate\ndisplaced persons and reconstruct the country.\nThe government of public salvation was inaugurated\non 2 August 1996. This is a broad-based team that\n3\n\n\nreflects the various ethnic components and political trends.\nAll regions of the country have been represented.\nThe Government wants to promote solidarity and unity\nto ensure the success of its transitional programme, which\nwill last three years. Its plan of action was made public\nrecently by the Prime Minister, His Excellency\nMr. Pascal Firmin Ndimira. Its aim is to make good the\ncommitment entered into by the Head of State to bring\nBurundi back to the path of peace, security and prosperity\nby means of dialogue and national debate.\nThe changes in Burundi since 25 July 1996 have been\nwelcomed by the population of Burundi as a rescue\noperation. The messages of support from all quarters and\nthe spontaneous demonstrations throughout the country\nwere visible signs of the support of the people of Burundi\nfor the new administration, which has come to the\nassistance of a country that was on the brink.\nHowever, some countries, particularly our neighbours,\nwere slow to realize the need, if we were to avoid genocide\nin Burundi and maintain the sovereignty of the country, to\nestablish an administration that would bring people together\nin the quest for security, not of one ethnic group to the\ndetriment of others, but of all.\nThis was therefore not an attempt to undermine\ndemocracy, as some claim. The Government wants, instead,\nto end the massacre of innocent populations battling with\nthe various armed factions within the country and outside,\nfrom the capital to the heart of Burundi, to restore peace\nand security for all and create conditions conducive to\ncomprehensive democratization based on national realities.\nThe efforts being undertaken by the new\nadministration to restore peace and organize dialogue and\nnational debate have been hampered by the economic\nsanctions against Burundi. I am duty-bound to draw the\nattention of representatives here to the damaging effects of\nthe economic blockade imposed on my country at the\nSecond Arusha Regional Summit on Burundi on\n31 July 1996. The international community must not, one\nday, say that it did not know. The countries of our\nsubregion were more than anyone else aware of the chaotic\nand complicated situation in Burundi before 25 July 1996.\nThey also knew of the almost total institutional paralysis as\na result of the crisis. Every day they see my country\u2019s\ncontinuous struggle to restore peace and security despite the\nhost of difficulties before us.\nWe therefore see the embargo imposed on Burundi\nas unfriendly, unjust and illegal. It violates international\npublic law and the international accords and conventions\nthat our countries have ratified. The embargo, which is\nreally a total economic blockade against my country,\nconstitutes a dangerous precedent, violating Article 1,\nparagraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations\nregarding the right of peoples to self-determination and\nthe sovereignty and equality of States.\nThis blockade flouts the principle of non-interference\nin the internal affairs of other States as stipulated in\nArticle III, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the\nOrganization of African Unity and the Declaration of\n24 October 1970 adopted by the General Assembly on the\nduty of States to refrain from interfering in the domestic\naffairs of other States.\nThe nature of the sanctions adopted flies in the face\nof the principle of the non-use of force and the peaceful\nsettlement of international disputes in accordance with the\nDeclaration of 24 October 1970 adopted by the General\nAssembly. We know that States are prohibited from using\nforce against another State, even in the case of damages\ncaused by the latter.\nIn the case of Burundi, there was no damage to any\nof our neighbours. However, our access to the sea, our\nright of transit and our freedom of trade have been taken\naway. The illegality of the embargo is obvious, since\ninternational and regional treaties recognizing Member\nStates\u2019 freedom of transit have been violated.\nThese instruments include the Marrakesh Agreement\nestablishing the World Trade Organization, the treaty on\nthe Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa, the\nConvention on Transit Trade of Land-Locked States, not\nto mention the charters and agreements of neighbouring\ncountries, such as the Economic Community of the Great\nLakes Countries and the preferential trade area.\nWhat is worse \u2014 and we would emphasize this here\nbefore the General Assembly \u2014 the sanctions imposed\nare hindering the action of our Government, weakening\nthe chances for peace and working in favour of the\nextremist militias and armed bands, which feel\nencouraged by them. At this very moment, the latter are\nusing the embargo to intensify their acts of violence and\ndestruction in the country.\nThe embargo imposed on Burundi has had\ncatastrophic consequences on people who, as a result, find\n4\n\n\nthemselves deprived of urgently needed medications,\nvaccines, diagnostic materials and surgical instruments.\nToday, children, women and the elderly are dying.\nThe vaccination rate, which, because of three years of\nwar, has fallen from 80 per cent to 30 per cent among\nchildren under five years of age, may soon reach zero if\nnothing is done to improve the situation in the meantime.\nThat will necessarily have an impact on the most vulnerable\nmembers of the population. Further, the population of\nBurundi is at risk of widespread famine, which will have\nunfortunate consequences for the inhabitants of\nneighbouring countries. It will have a greater impact on the\nmost vulnerable, namely, displaced persons, the homeless\nand the repatriated, which latter group has already been\nliving for three years now in inhuman conditions. Nearly\n80 per cent of them are children, women and the elderly.\nLastly, owing to lack of fuel and non-availability of\neducational materials, a large number of pupils and students\nmay leave school. The drop-out rate is already 18 per cent\nfor secondary education, 21 per cent for technical training\nand 20 per cent for university studies.\nAs for the economic aspects of the embargo, I would\npoint out that Burundi lives essentially on agriculture and\nanimal husbandry. There will be a sharp decline in our\nharvest if fertilizers, concentrates and veterinary\npharmaceuticals continue to be held by embargo in the\nports of neighbouring countries. The result will obviously\nbe widespread famine.\nThe few industries still operating are gradually\nshutting down owing to lack of raw materials. State\nrevenues are at a dangerously low level because of our\ninability to export and import. That will lead to\nunemployment or inability to pay workers in both the\npublic and private sectors and foment social unrest that will\nincrease insecurity and destabilize the country. Overall, the\nsituation will favour the retaking of territory and strengthen\nthe armed actions of rebel groups and other outlaw bands\nagainst the peaceful population, with the risk of widespread\ncivil war.\nThis apocalyptic prospect can and must be avoided.\nThe neighbouring countries behind the embargo had\ndemanded that the new regime end its suspension of the\nNational Assembly and political parties and commit itself\nto dialogue with the armed groups, points that are priorities\nof the new regime\u2019s programme made public on\n25 July 1996. Decree Number 100-023 of\n13 September 1996 has just reinstated Parliament, the\npolitical parties and political associations.\nFurthermore, the Government of Burundi has just\nreiterated its solemn commitment to engage in dialogue\nand to discuss all the country\u2019s fundamental questions\nwith all interested political partners, including armed\ngroups. We renew that commitment here before the\nAssembly.\nThat measure, which is already a priority of the new\nregime, was the latest recommendation of the Arusha\nSummit Meeting on 31 July 1996. Now that my\nGovernment has responded positively and promptly to the\nconditions fixed by its neighbours, we invite them to take\nall appropriate steps to lift the embargo immediately so as\nto alleviate the indescribable suffering of the people of\nBurundi and to enable dialogue \u2014 which is also hindered\nby the embargo \u2014 to take place by opening lines of\ncommunication, both on the ground and in the air, and by\nfulfilling their commitments.\nMy country, Burundi, seeks to play an active and\nconstructive role in the development of peaceful, friendly\nand mutually beneficial relations with countries of the\nregion and the rest of the world. In return, we require of\nour partners that they refrain from threat or use of force\nor from any other action incompatible with the purposes\nand principles of the United Nations Charter.\nBecause of the war and the embargo, my country\ncontinues to suffer from a very critical economic\nsituation. It is land-locked and therefore must rely on its\nneighbours for the transit of its exports and imports. For\nthat reason, we attach great importance to the policy of\ngood-neighbourliness and non-interference in the internal\naffairs of other States.\nMy Government is perfectly well aware of the\nconcerns of the international community over the crisis in\nBurundi. We express our gratitude to all our bilateral and\nmultilateral partners that have given us their support,\nsolidarity and understanding in this difficult period.\nHowever, we remain convinced that the imposition\nof conditions about the pace and the way to resolve the\ncurrent conflict cannot benefit the people of Burundi. We\nare determined to find lasting and definitive solutions to\nthe evil that is eroding Burundi, but such complex\nproblems cannot be resolved by precipitate action or by\nholding a knife to our throats.\n5\n\n\nThe political situation in the Great Lakes region\ncontinues to be cause for concern. This geographical area\nholds the sad world record for number of refugees.\nFollowing the genocide carried out in Rwanda in April\n1994, several hundreds of thousands of persons sought\nasylum in neighbouring countries, particularly in Zaire and\nTanzania.\nFollowing the crisis of October 1993, those countries\nalso contained tens of thousands of Burundi\u2019s citizens, who\nswelled the ranks of those gone into exile. In\nFebruary 1995 an international Conference about this thorny\nquestion was held in Bujumbura, under the auspices of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the United\nNations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees.\nThe decisions and recommendations made at that time have\nremained virtually a dead letter. However, we have noted\nthe voluntary and peaceful repatriation of a large number of\nRwandan refugees who had sought asylum in Burundi.\nThe OAU and the United Nations, through the Office\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,\nshould step up their initiatives designed to encourage all\npersons who wish to return to their countries once the\nconditions of peace and security have been met. The\nauthorities of the countries concerned must, of course, play\na primary role. The Government of Burundi, for its part, is\nprepared to welcome at any time all of our nationals who\nwish to return to their respective homes. To that end, it is\nnow organizing and doing all it can to bring about the rapid\nrestoration of a climate of peace, understanding and\nnational reconciliation.\nWe encourage all efforts being made by neighbouring\ncountries, by friendly countries, the Organization of African\nUnity, the European Union and the United Nations on\nbehalf of this troubled region and to return the situation as\na whole to normal.\nAt the same time, we draw the attention of the\ninternational community to other scourges and other\nphenomena that are rife in this geographical area. I am\nreferring to the trafficking in and proliferation of weapons\nand the training of militias and armed groups that foment\nterrorism and threaten the security of our fellow citizens\nfrom certain neighbouring countries.\nWe note the spread of the ideology of genocide,\nhatred, violence and marginalization made manifest in\nintolerance and ethnic fundamentalism. The pernicious ideas\npropagated by the champions of those ideologies will, in\nthe long term, generate social upheavals with political and\nethnic roots that will in turn cause enormous human and\nmaterial damage. The genocide in Rwanda, the massacres\nperpetrated in Burundi since the October 1993 crisis, the\nkillings we have witnessed in South Kivu, in particular in\nthe Massissi region and very recently in the region of\nUvira, are the best example of this threat to peace and\nsecurity in our subregion.\nThe international community must mobilize to\ncombat such inhuman and degrading acts, whose\nphilosophy is so strangely reminiscent of notorious\nHitlerite nazism.\nWith regard to the other conflicts with which Africa\nis beset, the Government of Burundi welcomes the\npositive developments in the situation in Somalia and in\nLiberia. It appreciates the decisive role played by the\nOAU, the United Nations and subregional organizations\nin helping to sort out differences and commit the parties\nto disputes to a process of peace and reconciliation.\nIn that connection, my Government welcomes the\nestablishment by the OAU of a Mechanism for Conflict\nPrevention, Management and Resolution. African leaders\nhave thereby demonstrated their determination to become\nmore involved in solving problems on their own\ncontinent.\nWe take this opportunity to express our thanks to the\nEuropean Union, the United Nations and other bilateral\npartners for the political, material and financial support\ngiven that initiative. To that end, Burundi is convinced of\nthe overriding importance of preventive diplomacy and\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue and\nnegotiation.\nThe United Nations has two main priorities, namely,\nthe Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for Development.\nTheir success entails a determined struggle against\nterrorism and organized crime as well as the elimination\nof the nuclear threat. Burundi therefore supports the\norganization of an international criminal tribunal.\nBurundi\u2019s representative to the United Nations has\njust signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nMy Government warmly welcomes that noble decision by\nthe General Assembly of our Organization. It is a signally\nimportant step towards the establishment of a world of\npeace free from the threat of meaningless death caused by\nman himself.\nThe Government of Burundi is also concerned about\nother contemporary scourges, such as the trafficking in\n6\n\n\nand the distribution and consumption of drugs and other\npsychotropic substances. They are a grave danger,\nespecially for our young people who are our future. Apart\nfrom their deleterious effects on health, they are a\nformidable weapon in the hands of the supporters of\ninternational terrorism.\nFor that reason, we wholeheartedly support efforts\nbeing made within the framework of international\ncooperation to eradicate that disaster confronting humanity.\nWe emphasize this fact, for armed groups that are\norganized to rob, rape, burn and kill sate themselves with\nthese harmful substances to kill in cold blood, without\nremorse and without pity.\nSeveral delegations have recognized the fact that many\nAfrican Governments are increasingly committed to\nshouldering their responsibilities for the development of\ntheir continent. It has been noted, in particular, that over the\npast two years the average growth rate in gross domestic\nproduct has reached 5 per cent. Those efforts deserve encouragement.\nNevertheless, the burden of external debt continues to\nweigh heavily on many of our countries and often\nundermines their development efforts. That is why the\nGovernment of Burundi pleads for the substantial easing of\nexternal debt in order to give every chance to programmes\naimed at improving the living standard of our people.\nI should like to join other eminent heads of delegation\nwho have spoken earlier in announcing that my\nGovernment shares the hope that our Organization will be\nreformed and made into an efficient and effective\ninstrument better able to respond to the purposes and\nprinciples assigned it by its founding fathers. The United\nNations must adapt its structures and working methods to\nthe current and future concerns of our planet and all\nhumankind.\nWe view with special attention the ongoing\ndiscussions on restructuring the Security Council to allow\nfor more equitable representation in that body, to increase\nits membership and to achieve its general democratization.\nGiven their political and economic advantages, Germany\nand Japan have legitimate aspirations for permanent seats\nin the Security Council, as does Italy. Since none of the\nproposals before us commands general support, it is just as\nlegitimate to take into account the cogent suggestion put\nforward by Italy for a possible rotation of permanent seats\namong States of respective regions. We believe that Africa,\nAsia and Latin America should have at least two permanent\nseats per region in that lofty, decision-making body of the\nOrganization.\nMy country, Burundi, wishes to reaffirm its total\ncommitment to and unswerving support for the noble\nideas upheld by the Organization. We hope that the\nUnited Nations will continue to move forward in the\nstruggle against racism, intolerance, xenophobia, terrorism\nand child prostitution. It is our ardent desire to see this\nvast home of mankind promote and further promulgate\nthe values of peace, freedom and mutual respect and\nfraternity among men in order to stave off for all time the\nspectre of war, hunger and famine in the world, through\na more generous and more committed international\ncooperation. All countries of the world, rich and poor,\nsmall and large, are urged to join forces to meet that\nchallenge: the challenge of building a better future in a\nmore just, more peaceful, more human world."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the delegation of the Socialist\nRepublic of Viet Nam, I would like to congratulate you\nwarmly, Sir, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-first session. We are truly proud that\nyou, an experienced representative of Malaysia, a member\ncountry of the Association of South-East Asian Nations\n(ASEAN), have been elected to this important position. We\nare confident that, under your guidance, our session will\nachieve many fine results.\nLet me take this opportunity to express our high\nappreciation of the performance of your predecessor,\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral. We also hold in high\nregard the dynamism and perseverance of Secretary-\nGeneral Boutros Boutros-Ghali in the service of our\ncommon cause.\nLast year at this time, we had the opportunity to take\na retrospective look at the world\u2019s development over the\npast half-century and the role played by the United\nNations in this long journey. One year later, the world\nlandscape is still full of contrasts, interwoven with factors\nand trends of hope and with events and tendencies that\ngive rise to the concerns of the international community\nat this end of the twentieth century.\nIn a world of teeming changes, what emerges as\ninvariable are the legitimate aspiration and vigorous\ndetermination of nations to achieve peace and\ndevelopment based on equality, democracy, respect for\nthe independence and sovereignty of each country and the\nidentity of each nation. In this grand endeavour, peoples\nturn to the United Nations for timely support and fruitful\nassistance because the Organization, having waded\nthrough the vicissitudes of a half-century of history, has\nbeen daily affirming its crucial role for the world as a\nwhole. Today\u2019s challenge for our world Organization is\nhow to reform and adapt itself to the new international\ncircumstances in order to meet the expectations of the\npeoples.\nAs the system of international relations in the post-\ncold-war era takes shape, we can already see its trend\ntowards diversification and multicentrism. In this context,\nmultilateral institutions and mechanisms, especially the\nUnited Nations, have assumed an ever-more essential role.\nHowever, there are various ways of interpreting the role\nof our Organization today. As regards the vast majority of\nthe Member countries, the United Nations, in its capacity\nas a centre for harmonizing inter-State relations, should\nplay a fundamental role in firmly defending international\nlaw and in encouraging States\u2019 strict and consistent\nrespect for and observation of the United Nations Charter.\nIn this spirit, the United Nations must use its weight and\nresponsibility to stem the practices \u2014 such as coercion\nand imposition, arbitrary embargo and sanctions that bring\nsuffering to innocent people, and flagrant interference in\nthe internal affairs of States, in violation of their\nindependence and sovereignty \u2014 that run counter to the\ncurrent general trends.\nTo play its role adequately, the United Nations must\nreform itself so as to increase the representativeness of its\ninstitutional organs and to democratize and ensure greater\n15\n\n\ntransparency in our Organization\u2019s working procedures and\nmethods. The cornerstones of the democratization of the\nUnited Nations system are the reform of the Security\nCouncil and the enhancement of the role of the General\nAssembly. This is a complex and difficult task which\nrequires utmost perseverance. The expansion of the\ncomposition of the Security Council and the\ndemocratization of its decision-making procedures constitute\nan urgent demand of the international community. At the\nsame time, the authority and role of the General Assembly,\nthe broadest and most representative body, must be\nstrengthened in response to the legitimate appeal of us all.\nCertainly, the reform must be undertaken on the basis of\nthe agreed principles, particularly that of consensus,\nreflecting to the fullest extent the views and aspirations of\nthe majority of the member countries and ensuring the\ninterests of the different regions.\nIf in today\u2019s world democracy in a society means the\nactive participation of its citizens, democracy in\ninternational relations requires the active participation of all\ncountries, large or small, rich or poor. Only an increasingly\ndemocratized United Nations can enjoy the prestige and\nconfidence necessary for playing its role in harmonizing the\nactions of States on the basis of international law, as all\ndesire it to. Let us build upon the momentum gathered at\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations so that on\nentering the twenty-first century, the United Nations can\ntruly serve as an example of democratization in the world\u2019s\npolitical life.\nThe wise way to achieve the common objectives of\nnational independence, peace and development is that of\ncooperation in the spirit of equality, mutual respect and\nmutual benefit. The globalization of the world economy, the\nliberalization of trade and investment and the dizzying\nadvances of science and technology now present every State\nwith both unprecedented opportunities and imposing\nchallenges. It is no mere coincidence that the recent summit\nof the seven major industrialized countries, the G-7, in\nLyons, focused on the theme of globalization.\nHowever, the developing countries, and especially the\nunderdeveloped ones, are approaching this trial that is so\nvital for their development and prosperity poorly equipped\nand in extremely difficult conditions. Therefore, it is\nincumbent upon the international community and in\nparticular the developed countries, to give the required\nattention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucial\nequation, because it is impossible to accept, in the context\nof interdependence, a world in which affluence is\nconcentrated in a small number of countries while the\nmajority of countries continue to struggle against\nincreasing poverty and the gap between the rich and the\npoor grows inexorably wider.\nGiven its strength and prestige, the United Nations\nis able to and needs to play a useful role in this process.\nIn implementing the Agenda for Development, our\nOrganization should concentrate first on the regions in\ndifficulty and on the essential issues. With its financial\nresources and groups of experts, the United Nations\nsystem can assist the countries of the South to overcome\ntheir disadvantaged position and succeed in their efforts\nfor timely regional and global integration, in the context\nof an economic, trade, scientific and technological race on\na global scale.\nIn Viet Nam, for instance, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) is carrying out projects\nto assist us in our integration into the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). UNDP is also\nplaying an active and effective role to facilitate the\nestablishment of a framework for cooperation among the\ncountries along the Mekong. UNDP is currently working\non a national capacity-building project so that Viet Nam\ncan be prepared to participate more effectively in the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) in the near future.\nSuch practical bilateral and multilateral development\nprojects are to be welcomed.\nHowever, we are now facing a glaring paradox: the\nneed for international cooperation for development\ncontinues to grow, while the available means become ever\nmore scarce and natural resources more depleted. In the\nfierce competition for development, States must\nconcentrate their resources on domestic needs in order to\nrestructure their economies and solve the pressing social\nproblems, thus enhancing their internal strength. That is\nquite understandable.\nNevertheless, in the current context of increasing\ninterdependence among States, international cooperation,\nespecially the flow of capital and technology transfer\nfrom the developed to the developing countries is\nindispensable, and it is also necessary and beneficial for\nthe sustainable development of the developed countries\nthemselves. Moreover, today, when urgent global issues\nare strengthening links between all States, a danger to one\nnation may also affect others, and the stability and\nprosperity enjoyed by one society may contribute to an\nenvironment favourable for the stability and prosperity of\nother societies.\n16\n\n\nHunger, illness, social injustice and other phenomena\nare all potential threats to the security of each country and\nthe stability of the world as a whole. Allocating of\nresources to support the development of developing\ncountries and contributing in various ways to bilateral and\nmultilateral international cooperation for development are\nwise investments for peace and for the shared future of all\nof our societies.\nThe United Nations is not immune to this discrepancy\nbetween resources and the needs for development\nassistance. Today, the resources available to the United\nNations are not increasing; on the contrary, they are\nshrinking or being overextended. This worrisome situation\ncalls for the attention and responsibility of all Member\nStates, especially of the major Powers and developed\ncountries that possess greater resources and potential. The\nmeasure to be taken immediately, in the unanimous view of\nMember States, is for every State to fulfil its financial\nobligations. Moreover, all initiatives to provide\nsupplementary resources for the United Nations should be\nencouraged. Recently, scholars and renowned personalities\nhave advanced numerous interesting proposals in this\nregard. We are of the view that the General Assembly\nshould assign the Working Group on the Financial Situation\nof the United Nations and other relevant working groups\nthe task of seriously studying these proposals in order to\nexplore all possible ways of providing the United Nations\nwith the resources necessary to actively assist in\ndevelopment for all \u2014 first and foremost, that of the\nunderdeveloped countries.\nThe United Nations has a rather weighty responsibility\nregarding the demands of development. Its role in the\nglobalization process is therefore no less crucial. Since the\nbeginning of this decade the United Nations has initiated\nand organized a number of world summit conferences on a\nset of global issues ranging from environment to social\ndevelopment, from population to human rights, from\nwomen to children \u2014 and coming up we have the World\nFood Summit, the aim of which is to find and implement\ncoordinated measures at all levels \u2014 national, regional, and\ninternational \u2014 to solve problems of importance for the\nfuture of all nations.\nIf in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the\nparticipation of the majority of countries is somewhat\nlimited or even indirect, through an intermediary\nmechanism, in the resolution of the global issues for\ndevelopment the United Nations has been able to mobilize\nthe direct participation of all countries, big and small, rich\nand poor, developed and developing, because these are not\njust \u201cto whom it may concern\u201d issues. In this manner, the\nUnited Nations can succeed in its efforts to emerge from\na mere reactive role to crises and conflicts and play a\nproactive role in preventing such conflicts and crises.\nClearly, the resolution of global issues is always broadly\ndemocratic in nature.\nFor all these reasons, we hold that the United\nNations should further strengthen its role of assistance\nand coordination in this essential field and continue to\nadvance the implementation of programmes of action\nalready adopted. It is evident that no organization can\nreplace the United Nations in this vital role. In fulfilling\nthis role, the United Nations will see its prestige enhanced\nand its image brought closer to the life of each nation and\neach human being.\nThe year 1996 will go down in the history of Viet\nNam as the beginning of a new stage of development of\nour country. Last June, the Eighth Congress of the\nCommunist Party of Viet Nam was successfully\nconcluded. The special significance of this historic event\nis that, based on the successes achieved over the last 10\nyears of renewal, reform and national revival, the\nCongress decided to lead the country into a new phase of\nindustrialization and modernization, with a view to\ndoubling by the year 2000 the 1990 per-capita gross\ndomestic product and essentially transforming Viet Nam\ninto an industrialized country in the next 20 to 25 years.\nAt the same time, we have reaffirmed the pursuit of\nour foreign policy of independence and sovereignty,\nopenness, the diversification and multilateralism of our\ninternational relations, and regional and international\nintegration. It is because of this direction that the foreign\npolicy of Viet Nam has achieved and continues to achieve\noutstanding results, assisting in the work of nation-\nbuilding and development in a practical way, and\neffectively contributing to the resolution of international\nproblems.\nViet Nam has established diplomatic relations with\nover 160 countries, including all the major Powers and\nthe most prominent world political-economic centres. Viet\nNam has commercial relations with more than 100\ncountries and investment ties with over 50 countries and\nterritories. In addition to expanding its relations with\ncountries of all continents, last year as a full member of\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations, one of the\nmost dynamic and successful of regional organizations,\nViet Nam actively contributed to regional and world\ncooperation and development.\n17\n\n\nWe are participating more actively in the work of\ninternational organizations, especially those of the United\nNations system, as well regional organizations. This year,\nViet Nam begins its term as a member of the UNICEF\nExecutive Board, and will present its candidature for a seat\non the Economic and Social Council at this session of the\nGeneral Assembly. We hope to receive the support of\nMember countries of the United Nations to be able to\ncontribute our share to the work of that important body,\ndeveloping and coordinating policies of economic and\nsocial development and cooperation. We are currently\npreparing for the successful organization of the upcoming\nseventh Francophone summit to be held in November 1997\nat Hanoi. As regards broader integration, Viet Nam is also\nactively preparing to participate soon in other international\norganizations, such as the World Trade Organization and\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum.\nAs a new member of the Conference on Disarmament,\nViet Nam played an active part in the negotiations on the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which it recently\nsigned. By signing that Treaty, Vietnam joined in the broad\nappeal of the international community that all States refrain\nfrom all nuclear testing, regardless of the form, strictly\nobserve the ban on all nuclear-tests and undertake concrete\nsteps and measures towards the total elimination of all\nnuclear weapons. Viet Nam stands ready to cooperate with\nall countries for the effective implementation of the Treaty,\ncontributing to a cleaner environment, to greater confidence\nand to consolidation of international security, aimed at a\nmore secure and healthy world. At the same time, we hold\nthat the verification activities of the Treaty implementation\nprocess must be carried out in a fair and impartial manner,\nwith strict respect for the sovereignty of States. In this\nspirit, we view that the proposal for a programme of action\nfor the elimination of nuclear weapons submitted recently\nat the Conference on Disarmament by 28 States, including\nViet Nam, deserves serious consideration.\nTo achieve the objective and sincere desire to build a\nViet Nam with a prosperous people, a strong nation and a\njust and civilized society, we are determined to bring into\nfull play the achievements of the reform and renewal\nprocess and equip ourselves with the internal strength\nneeded to move forward steadily on the path of integration.\nOn the basis of our current international relations, we will\nstrengthen our cooperation with other countries and\ninternational and regional organizations; we will enhance\nproductivity; we will consolidate the peaceful environment\nand create international conditions still more favourable, in\nthe service of the prosperity of our nation as well as for the\nprosperity of the region and the world.\nAt the threshold of the third millennium, all nation-\nStates are subject to strong pressures of both opportunity\nand challenge. The vast ability of mankind in this age,\ntogether with the extraordinary advances in science and\ntechnology, offers us hope for development and prosperity\nfor all nations. Yet the poverty that afflicts more than one\nfifth of the world population and the gap between the rich\nand the poor raise concerns. The opportunities seem great\nbut the challenges are acutely felt. To begin the twenty-\nfirst century with more hope than anxiety, it will be\nimportant for us first to enhance our sense of\nresponsibility and broaden our overall long-term interests:\nthose of peace and development. There is no doubt that\nthe United Nations, the Organization to which we all\nbelong, will contribute actively towards achieving that\nend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of 130 million\nPakistanis, please accept, Sir, greetings on assuming the\npresidency of this session of the General Assembly.\nI come to address the Assembly in the twilight of the\ntwentieth century, where we seem to be, in the words of\nCharles Dickens, at \u201cthe best of times\u201d and at \u201cthe worst of\ntimes\u201d. A century now comes to a close which witnessed\ntwo world wars, a Holocaust, hunger, hopelessness and the\nspectre of nuclear annihilation.\nBut there is another twentieth century that we should\nremember. The candle flickers on a century that brought\nmankind a technological and information revolution\nbeyond our wildest dreams; a century of breakthroughs in\nmedicine and health, in communication, in energy, in\ntransportation and in agriculture; a century that witnessed\nthe triumph of liberty over authoritarianism, the triumph\nof the free market over government control. One historian\nhas called the twentieth century the age of extremes.\nTested time and again, the world survived.\nI come before this Assembly, at this time of\ntransition from one century to the next \u2014 from the\nsecond millennium to the third \u2014 to speak of history, of\njustice and of morality. Today, the United Nations stands\nat the crossroads, not just of the calendar, but of the\ndirection of the community of nations.\nWe confront three simultaneous challenges. The first\none is the proliferation of conflicts, disputes and tensions\namong and within nations, and the accompanying rise of\nnational, ethnic and religious prejudice, intolerance and\narrogance. The second challenge is the persistent spread\nof poverty. The third challenge is the growing sense of\nalienation, the loss of people\u2019s hope and confidence that\nthe world\u2019s Governments will address successfully the\nmultifaceted problems inherent in the new technological\nera. The manner in which we address these problems will\ndetermine the quality of life that we bequeath our\nchildren.\n\n\nWe remain deeply concerned at the conflicts and\ndisputes in many parts of the world \u2014 in Bosnia, in\nChechnya and in Azerbaijan. Our confidence in our ability\nto resolve conflicts has been visibly shaken after the\nexperiences of Somalia, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan,\nLiberia, Rwanda and Burundi.\nWe hope that the Middle East peace process,\nwelcomed by the world, will not be reversed and that all\nparties will honour their obligations under the agreements\nsigned.\nThe success of the Dayton Agreement and the\nrestoration of peace and justice in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nwill be an acid test of the world community\u2019s will to\nprevent aggression and genocide in the future.\nYet there is another place on Earth where there is a\ntest of strength between the principles of law and freedom\nand the force of aggression and foreign occupation. After\nthe creation of the United Nations, the people of Jammu\nand Kashmir were among the first to have their right to\nself-determination recognized by the Security Council. I\nshould like to quote the words of the Security Council\nitself:\n\u201cthe final disposition of the State of Jammu and\nKashmir will be made in accordance with the will of\nthe people expressed through the democratic method\nof a free and impartial plebiscite conducted under the\nauspices of the United Nations.\u201d (Security Council\nresolution 122 (1957), second preambular paragraph)\nAfter 50 years, the Kashmiri people still await the\nfulfilment of this resolution, of this commitment, of this\npromise.\nThe great African-American poet Langston Hughes\nasked fundamental questions about liberty. He asked:\n\u201cWhat happens to a dream deferred?\nDoes it dry up\nlike a raisin in the sun?\nOr fester like a sore \u2014\nAnd then run? (...)\nMaybe it just sags\nlike a heavy load.\nOr does it explode?\u201d\nIn 1989, as the winds of freedom swept across the\nglobe, blowing away dictatorship, domination and\noccupation, a new generation of Kashmiris rose to demand\ntheir right to self-determination, a right that had passed\nfrom father to son, from mother to daughter \u2014 a torch\nrekindled from generation to generation. To suppress the\nbrave Kashmiri youth, India sent in 600,000 military and\nparamilitary forces. The tools of murder, torture, rape,\npersecution, arson, incarceration and assassination\nattempts were ruthlessly used. But as the Nobel Peace\nLaureate Martin Luther King said,\n\u201cFreedom is never voluntarily given by the\noppressor. It must be demanded by the oppressed.\u201d\nForty thousand Kashmiris have given their lives in\nopposing this oppression during the last seven years\nalone. India has recruited and trained renegades to subvert\nthe Kashmiri movement, to create dissension and to\ntarnish the image of the struggle for freedom. Under\nmounting international pressure, India sought this\nSeptember to divert world opinion by organizing a sham\nelection. Those very people who claim to be front-runners\nin the elections cannot even enter the valley without\narmed escorts, much less muster popular support.\nThis is what the world\u2019s media had to say. The Arab\nNews of 8 September 1996 reported that its correspondent\nvisited Baramula that morning and saw the entire town\ndeserted. Not a single person was visible on the streets,\nwhich were being heavily patrolled. The New York Times\nof 7 September 1996 reported that while India hopes that\nthe elections will blunt the guerrillas\u2019 appeal, there are\nmany in Srinagar who say New Delhi is chasing an\nillusion. The Economic Times, an Indian publication, of\n17 September 1996 reported that a number of booths in\nAnantnag and Pulwama recorded single-digit voting, even\nas late as 3 p.m. The Statesman, another Indian\npublication, reported on 22 September 1996 that Srinagar\nput up a stiff resistance to elections that day, and that\npolling was held in a curfew-like atmosphere on deserted\nstreets. According to the Voice of America\u2019s broadcast of\n27 September 1996, United States Senator Tom Harkin\nsaid that these elections were fraudulent and would not be\nconsidered to reflect the legitimate aspirations of the\nKashmiri masses.\nThe Chairman of the Kashmir All Parties Hurriyat\nConference, Mir Umar Farooq, declared that such\nelections cannot be a substitute for the Kashmiris\u2019 right to\nself-determination.\nThe United Nations Security Council declared in\nresolution 122 (1957) that the organization of such\nelections does not \u201cconstitute a disposition of the State\u201d\n2\n\n\n(resolution 122 (1957), operative para. 1) in terms of the\nplebiscite to be held under the auspices of the United\nNations. This was confirmed by a recent study by the\nInternational Commission of Jurists.\nI should like India to remember the words of the\nFrenchman Andr\u00e9 Breton, who said:\n\u201cThere is nothing with which it is so dangerous to\ntake liberties as liberty itself.\u201d\nSo I stand before the United Nations General\nAssembly and urge \u201cto thine own self be true\u201d, to thine\nown Charter be true; and to thine own resolutions be true.\nIndia may argue that the Security Council resolutions\nthat guaranteed a plebiscite to Jammu and Kashmir are old,\nbut there is no statute of limitations on United Nations\nresolutions. Occupation, repression and annexation cannot\nnullify the actions of the Security Council itself. The\nresolutions of this body cannot be applied selectively only\nwhen politically expedient.\nPakistan calls on the United Nations to implement its\nown Security Council resolutions 47 (1948), 51 (1948), 80\n(1950), 96 (1951), 98 (1952) and 122 (1957) \u2014 seven\nspecific and binding resolutions guaranteeing self-\ndetermination to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.\nKashmir is the core issue that divides India and\nPakistan. I had proposed a meaningful dialogue to the new\nIndian Prime Minister on his assumption of office, and was\nencouraged by his positive response. Unfortunately, the new\nGovernment persisted with the strategy of a sham election\nin occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe Kashmir dispute has led to four direct or indirect\nwars between India and Pakistan between 1947 and 1971.\nIndia has the third-largest army in the world today, almost\nall of which is deployed against my country Pakistan.\nSouth Asia lacks a regional security system. We in\nPakistan have made several proposals for conventional arms\ncontrol: first, the negotiation of a mutually agreed ratio of\nforces; secondly, measures to prevent the possibility of a\nsurprise attack; and thirdly, the adoption of agreed\nprinciples for conventional arms control in South Asia.\nOver the past 30 years, Pakistan has formulated a\nseries of proposals to contain proliferation of nuclear and\nmissile technology in South Asia. All along, India argued\nthat it opposed bilateral or regional measures and would\naccept only a global non-proliferation policy. The\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is exactly the\nkind of global measure for non-proliferation and\ndisarmament that India had been championing for 40\nyears. Yet, unfortunately, India chose to veto the Treaty\nin the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, and it\nopposed the Treaty at the United Nations General\nAssembly just last month. So now the world can see the\nreality.\nLet me state that just as we are prepared to sign any\nand all nuclear treaties if India simultaneously signs with\nus, any step in nuclear escalation by our neighbour will\nfind a response from us to preserve our national security.\nI should like to take this opportunity to propose to\nthis Assembly that it endorse the convening of a\nmultilateral dialogue for peace and security in South Asia,\nwith the participation not only of Pakistan and India, but\nof the five permanent members of the Security Council\nand other major Powers, such as Germany and Japan.\nThis multilateral conference could cover three critical\nareas: first, the resolution of the Kashmir dispute and\nother bilateral problems between India and Pakistan;\nsecondly, the promotion of conventional arms control and\nconfidence-building measures; and thirdly, measures to\npromote nuclear restraint and avert the danger of a\nnuclear-arms race in South Asia. I believe that such\nmultilateral talks offer a framework for genuine\nnegotiations that can lead to a resolution of disputes, avert\nthe nuclear threat and promote prosperity in South Asia.\nI hope this proposal will receive the support of this\nAssembly and of India.\nA clear distinction has been made by the United\nNations between terrorism and the legitimate struggle for\nnational liberation. We in Pakistan will always be at the\nforefront of the effort to combat terrorism because we\nhave frequently been victims of these crimes from across\nour own borders. This year alone we faced a series of\ncross-border terrorist attacks, but, by the grace of God,\nwe were successful in arresting different rings of cross-\nborder terrorists.\nHowever, I should like to take this opportunity to\nexpress deep concern, on behalf of one billion peace-\nloving Muslims, at the propaganda from certain quarters.\nSome quarters are trying to present terrorism as peculiar\nto the followers of Islam; this is wrong. There is no place\nin Islam for acts of terrorism. However, let us\nacknowledge that in the post-cold-war period we are\nwitnessing the rise of extremist fringe groups in the East\n3\n\n\nand in the West. Whether it be Hindu fundamentalism,\nIslamic militancy, Judaic extremism, Le Pen\u2019s racism in\nFrance, or the Oklahoma bombing in America, a number of\nyouth are turning to acts of violence. We who believe in\nthe policies of moderation, accommodation and tolerance\nmust unite against this new threat of violence and terror.\nInternational mechanisms and systems to check the agents\nof terror need strengthening, and we must condemn\nterrorists and extremists with one voice, irrespective of their\nrace, religion or creed.\nPakistan is the second-largest Muslim country in the\nworld. It is a democracy, and the Government I lead is\ndetermined to turn Pakistan into a fortress of enlightenment,\nemancipation and social advancement. This is no easy task\ngiven our recent history. The Afghan war led to the\nproliferation of arms and militancy in our region, and to the\nrise of ethnic, sectarian and separatist forces in the country.\nIt spawned a drug culture and failed to equip our youth for\nemployment in the modern world.\nToday we face, along with other countries of the\nworld, the dangers of debt, deficit and demography. I am\nproud to say that we in Pakistan have brought down our\npopulation growth rate from 3.1 per cent to 2.9 per cent.\nWe hope to reduce it further, to 2.6 per cent. In the last\nthree years, we have brought down our deficit by three\npoints, and a billion dollars of debt has been retired.\nHowever, the cost has been heavy.\nEach year we have had to present a harsh budget to\npull our country out of the quicksand of debt, deficit and\ndemography. This year alone, out of new budgetary\nmeasures of PRs. 40 billion, PRs. 22 billion went to debt\nservicing. The example of Pakistan shows why increasing\nnumbers of the world\u2019s population live in poverty and\nsqualor, without access to clean drinking water, sanitation,\nschools or hospitals.\nThese bleak realities of debt servicing breed a despair\nand frustration that often manifest as random violence and\nterrorism. Despite this grinding poverty, the aspirations of\nthe marginalized keep rising due to the communications\nrevolution sweeping the world.\nThe world needs to devise a system under which\nGovernments adopting international standards of trade and\nhuman values get proportionate relief in their debt.\nShrinking aid flows have forced countries such as Pakistan\nto borrow capital at commercial interest rates. Indeed, debt\nservicing now accounts for 47 per cent of our budget. The\nnegative impact of such reverse transfers needs to be\nredressed.\nSimilarly, it is time to renew and implement the\npledge of the developed nations to devote at least 0.7 per\ncent of their gross national products for assistance to the\ndeveloping countries. Even this target has now dwindled\nto a level of 0.3 per cent of the gross national product of\nthe developed world.\nWe in Pakistan, committed to the dream of our\nfounding fathers, have chosen the path of a federal\nparliamentary democracy wedded to the concept of social\nequality. Under a democratic Government, Pakistan has\nplayed a responsible role in combating terrorism and\nnarcotics, promoting the rights of women and children,\nand working on non-proliferation issues such as the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We have done\nthis while confronting the forces of ethnicity,\nsectarianism, separatism and militancy that were tearing\nat our social fabric. Those who sought to undermine our\ncountry\u2019s unity by undermining peace in our port city of\nKarachi have been defeated.\nWe have a clear agenda as we move towards the\ntwenty-first century: a Pakistan dedicated to the rule of\nlaw and to safeguarding the rights of its women, children\nand minorities; a Pakistan providing equal opportunity for\nthe advancement of its citizens by investing in health and\nin education; a Pakistan that has already attracted over\n$22 billion in investment pledges.\nI speak to you, Mr. President, in the twilight of a\ncentury that awaits the dawn of a fresh one. As I speak,\nI dream of a third millennium in which the gap between\nrich and poor evaporates; in which illiteracy, hunger,\nmalnutrition and disease are at long last conquered; in\nwhich every child is planned, wanted, nurtured and\nsupported; and in which the birth of a girl is welcomed\nwith the same joy as that of a boy. I dream of a\nmillennium of tolerance and pluralism, in which people\nrespect other people, nations respect other nations, and\nreligions respect other religions.\nThat is the third millennium I see for my country\nand others \u2014 for all children. Let the United Nations be\nthe infrastructure for making this dream into a reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He can certainly\ncount on the support of the Republic of Mali to contribute\nto the success of his mission. Allow me also to thank his\npredecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for the\noutstanding work he accomplished during his term of\noffice. Finally, I should like, on behalf of my delegation,\nto pay well-deserved homage to the Secretary-General,\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\ncourageous action and tireless efforts for peace and\nunderstanding among peoples.\nThe end of the cold war gave the peoples of the\nworld cause to hope for the advent of a new era marked\nby the promotion of more stable and balanced\ninternational relations. To this end, the international\ncommunity must mobilize to find just and lasting\nsolutions to the many hotbeds of tension and conflict that\njeopardize international peace and security.\nIn this respect, Mali welcomes the qualitative\ndevelopment of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nWe welcome the holding of elections on 14 September,\nwhich marked a decisive stage for the future of the\ncountry. We exhort the international community to work\nto preserve and consolidate this newly restored peace.\nWe likewise welcome the possibilities that arose at\nthe latest Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) summit in Liberia for a settlement based on\n24\n\n\nnational reconciliation and the restoration of democratically\nelected institutions. Mali has worked steadfastly to find a\nsolution to the crisis in Liberia and is prepared to make\navailable a battalion to the ECOWAS Monitoring Group\n(ECOMOG).\nLikewise, Mali supports the efforts undertaken by the\ninternational community to assist the people of Burundi to\nestablish a lasting peace and national reconciliation. Mali\nalso supports United Nations efforts to establish a just and\nlasting peace in Angola.\nThe international community must do everything\npossible in Somalia to help bring about reconciliation and\nthe establishment of national institutions that are supported\nand trusted by all Somalis.\nRecent developments on the question of Western\nSahara require that our Organization work even more\nintensively towards the holding of a referendum, in keeping\nwith the relevant resolutions adopted on the matter.\nMali has always reaffirmed its support for\ninternational law and is concerned at the continued\nsanctions imposed on Libya, which have compounded the\nsufferings of the Libyan people, with whom my country\nreiterates it solidarity.\nLike other countries in the international community,\nMali is seriously concerned over recent developments in the\nsituation in the Middle East. My country remains convinced\nthat in order to settle the Israeli-Arab conflict, there is no\nalternative to the possibilities offered by the Madrid Peace\nConference. Mali therefore calls for the continuation of the\npeace process and for compliance with the commitments\npreviously undertaken.\nTo promote more stable and balanced international\nrelations, the present mechanisms for the consolidation of\npeace need to be strengthened; but we also need to find\nnew tools. The Agenda for Peace opens new possibilities in\nthis area.\nAccordingly, Mali welcomed the adoption of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as a historic stage\nin the strengthening of general and complete disarmament.\nWe likewise welcomed the adoption on 11 April 1996 of\nthe Pelindaba Treaty, which made Africa a nuclear-weapon-\nfree zone. My country also hopes that further progress\nmight be made to eliminate anti-personnel mines.\nMali has demonstrated its commitment to\nstrengthening the process of general and complete\ndisarmament through specific national and international\ninitiatives. Accordingly, in 1994, the President of the\nRepublic of Mali, His Excellency Mr. Alpha Oumar\nKonar\u00e9, requested and obtained special assistance from\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations to establish\na consultative mission responsible for studying ways and\nmeans to stem the proliferation of small arms in the\nSahelo-Saharan region. Indeed, our countries, which are\nnot arms producers, have become lucrative markets for\nthe war industry. Where did these weapons come from?\nWhat are their transit points? An answer to these\nquestions, in my delegation\u2019s view, would make it\npossible to find ways and means to guarantee that the\npeople of the affected countries enjoy a safe environment\nconducive to pursuing development.\nBesides the support of other countries in the Sahelo-\nSaharan region, Mali\u2019s initiative was also backed by other\nregions during the forty-ninth and fiftieth sessions of the\nGeneral Assembly, namely through the adoption of\nresolutions 49/75 G and 50/70 H. Mali\u2019s initiative helped\ngive rise to our Organization\u2019s now-famous concept of\nmicro-disarmament, which seeks to draw the attention of\nthe international community to the disastrous\nconsequences of small weapons, particularly in the\ndeveloping countries, where they are used mostly to fuel\nconflicts.\nA better-structured and more united international\norder seems today to be the very precondition for\ninternational peace and security. Development is one of\nthe major challenges that our Organization must meet\ntoday. As Pope Paul VI has stressed,\n\u201cDevelopment is another word for peace.\u201d\nThus, in order to establish the basis for a lasting peace,\nthe problems of poverty, destitution and social\nmarginalization must therefore be given priority at the\nUnited Nations.\nI should like in this respect to stress the great\nimportance Mali attaches to the drafting of an Agenda for\nDevelopment, the indispensable counterpart to the Agenda\nfor Peace. This entails the organization of international\ncooperation for development on a new basis, an area in\nwhich my country is working with resolve. The role of\nthe United Nations system in the development process\nalso must be strengthened.\n25\n\n\nIn this connection, the Agenda for Development \u2014\nwhich my delegation hopes will be adopted at this session\nof the General Assembly \u2014 will make it possible to\nrefocus the world\u2019s attention on cooperation for\ndevelopment, particularly by encouraging new, more\ncomplete and more effective approaches to development. It\ncould also provide a way to strengthen coordination within\nthe United Nations system, particularly by recognizing the\nOrganization as a network of institutions responsible for the\neconomic and social development of the Member States.\nIn this respect, because of the persistent foreign-debt\ncrisis of the countries of the South and the dwindling of\nofficial development assistance, the question of\ndevelopment financing requires special attention.\nThe Agenda for Development should likewise take\ninto account the recommendations contained in the Plans of\nAction adopted by the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro; the\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\nheld in Cairo; the World Summit for Social Development,\nheld in Copenhagen; the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen, held in Beijing; and the second United Nations\nConference on Human Settlements, held in Istanbul.\nThe Agenda for Development clearly must give special\nattention to Africa. The socio-economic situation of our\ncontinent is indeed of great concern. Africa, which is\nconfronting all kinds of epidemic and endemic diseases \u2014\nincluding malaria and AIDS \u2014 has only one doctor for\nevery 18,000 people, as compared to one doctor for fewer\nthan 400 people in developed countries. More than 80\nmillion school-age African children do not have access to\nprimary or secondary education. More than one third of\nAfrica\u2019s population suffers from famine, and more than 23\nmillion children are malnourished. Finally, Africa is reeling\nfrom an external debt that in 1995 was estimated to be\n$322 billion, the debt servicing of which absorbs more than\none third of its export earnings.\nGiven this situation, in an increasingly interdependent\nworld, the international community must show solidarity\nwith Africa. That is why a solidarity pact between Africa\nand the rest of the international community was sealed with\nthe adoption of the United Nations New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. As we know, under\nthe terms of this New Agenda, Africa solemnly reaffirms\nthat Africans themselves are primarily responsible for the\neconomic and social development of the continent, while\nthe international community undertakes to support Africa\u2019s\nefforts in attaining its development objectives.\nCommendable efforts have been made by African\ncountries in implementing this New Agenda. In the\npolitical and economic spheres, in particular, these have\nbeen achieved by consolidating the democratic process, by\npromoting investments and by taking account of\nenvironmental and population problems in development\npolicies. Mali has thus established a policy for economic\nrecovery and improved public financing. Macro-economic\ngoals, on the whole, have been attained.\nA broad range of structural measures has been\nimplemented through price liberalization; privatization;\nthe elimination or restructuring of many public\nenterprises; and the reform of the agricultural sector, with\na view to reducing costs and to increasing and\ndiversifying production. These tangible results enabled\nMali in February 1996 to conclude a new three-year\nagreement for the period 1996-1998 in the framework of\nthe Reinforced Structural Adjustment Facility.\nMindful of the need to accompany the promotion of\neconomic growth with resolute efforts in the social\ndomain to improve significantly the living standards of\npeoples and to reduce poverty permanently, my\nGovernment has expanded social services. In addition,\npriority in socio-economic development programmes has\nbeen given to women.\nSince 26 March 1991, Mali has continued its steady\nprogress towards consolidating its regained peace and\nbuilding a State based on the rule of law. The qualitative\ndevelopments that have taken place in Mali\u2019s northern\nregions show clearly the determination of Mali\u2019s young\ndemocracy to tackle and resolve all problems in a\nconcerted and peaceful way, with the active participation\nof all players and with scrupulous respect for human\nrights and fundamental freedoms.\nThe organization of the \u201cFlame of Peace\u201d ceremony\nwas an eloquent illustration of this. It was a symbolic\nceremony to destroy the stockpiles of several thousand\nweapons that were surrendered by ex-combatants of the\nMouvement et Fronts Unis de l\u2019Azawad and the\nMouvement Patriotique Malien Ganda Koy. It took place\non 27 March 1996 in Timbuktu under the presidency of\nthe Head of State of Mali, His Excellency Mr. Alpha\nOumar Konar\u00e9, and in the presence of the President of\nthe Republic of Ghana, the current President of ECOWAS\nand several ministerial delegations of Mali\u2019s neighbouring\ncountries. The United Nations, which contributed to the\npeace efforts through the Department of Political Affairs\nand the United Nations Development Programme as well\n26\n\n\nas to the small-arms collection process, was also\nrepresented by an important delegation.\nDuring that ceremony the Mouvement et Fronts Unis\nde l\u2019Azawad and the Mouvement Patriotique Malien Ganda\nKoy issued a joint declaration under which they\n\u201csolemnly and irreversibly proclaim the dissolution of\ntheir respective movements and fronts\u201d.\nThese positive developments in northern Mali mean\nthat real prospects now exist for integration and socio-\neconomic development in the region. We therefore appeal\nto the international community to support the efforts of the\nGovernment of Mali to consolidate democracy in the\ncountry; to continue to strengthen the peace that has been\nestablished with the participation of the country\u2019s various\ncommunities; and to show its solidarity concretely, by\nproviding the necessary humanitarian assistance to meet the\nneeds of returning refugees and to help promote their\nreintegration.\nIt is thus important to undertake urgent work to\ndevelop the regions concerned by, inter alia, reintegrating\ndisplaced peoples, restoring our administration, boosting\nagricultural production and improving the functioning of\npublic services, in particular in the areas of education,\nhealth and justice.\nI take this opportunity to urgently appeal to Mali\u2019s\ndevelopment partners quickly and effectively to implement\nthis programme, which, in the long run, aims at\ndevelopment within a State based on a strengthened rule of\nlaw and on democracy and human rights. Respect for the\nrule of law is of major importance to Mali\u2019s Third\nRepublic, which makes the promotion and defence of\nhuman rights one of its priorities.\nIn this connection I should also note the\ninstitutionalization, which has now been going on for two\nyears, of the Space for Democratic Discourse, which\nenables individuals, civil society and political parties to\nmake direct and public appeals to the Government on 10\nDecember every year with regard to the respect of human\nrights in Mali. We likewise have institutionalized a\nchildren\u2019s parliament, which provides a forum for the free\nexpression of Mali\u2019s children to assist the public authorities\nin implementing the national plan of action for the survival,\ndevelopment and protection of children.\nMali \u2014 one of the six countries that initiated the\nWorld Summit for Children in 1990 \u2014 welcomed the\ncommemorative meeting held on 30 September 1996 to\nreview the progress made and to give thought to the\nadditional steps that need to be taken on behalf of\nchildren.\nThe consolidation of Mali\u2019s young democracy\nrequires also the harmonious organization of relations\nbetween civilians and the military. With the support of the\nUnited Nations, the Government of Mali held a seminar\non this subject last July. A code of good conduct is being\ndrafted in this connection.\nI should like to underscore here, simply but\nforcefully, the importance Mali attaches to human rights,\nin particular the rights of women and children. We are\nconvinced that the role played by our Organization must\nbe backed up by concrete actions that stress the right to\neducation, health and life.\nThe international economic situation clearly shows\nthat the gap between developed and developing countries\nis widening. By generating an increase in inequalities and\nin the risk of social upheavals, this imbalance is making\nthe future of the world increasingly uncertain. Given the\nsituation, the international community must find adequate\nsolutions.\nIt is imperative that we find an answer to the\nexternal debt problem of the countries of the South. In\nspite of the progress made in this area, relief measures for\ndebt servicing remain insufficient. My delegation\ntherefore makes an urgent appeal that the ongoing\ndiscussions at the current meetings of the World Bank\nand the International Monetary Fund on the creation of a\nspecial fund aimed at considerably reducing the\nmultilateral debt of poor countries under structural\nadjustment result in a successful outcome.\nMy delegation deeply appreciates the important\nextension of $500 million, intended to reduce the debt of\nAfrican countries, made by the Group of Seven major\nindustrialized countries last June at their summit meeting\nin Lyons. This is an encouraging sign and an example to\nfollow.\nIt is just as important to support the efforts of the\nAfrican countries to diversify their economies and the\nrange of their commodities. It is also necessary to reverse\nthe current trend towards disinvestment and dwindling\nfinancial resources destined for Africa.\n27\n\n\nWe should facilitate the access of African products to\nworld markets, particularly by lifting the tariff and non-\ntariff barriers that affect its finished, semi-finished and\nmanufactured goods. They should also receive preferential\ntreatment, as provided in the Final Act of the Uruguay\nRound concluded in Marrakesh.\nFinally, the international community should give its\nfull support to the Secretary-General\u2019s United Nations\nSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa so that it does not\nsuffer the same fate as the United Nations Programme of\nAction for African Economic Recovery and Development.\nIn addition to the critical economic and social situation\nin Africa, there is the problem of the least developed\ncountries. For this reason, my country appeals to the\ninternational community to implement urgently the United\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\n1990s.\nMali also welcomes the proclamation of 1996 as the\nInternational Year for the Eradication of Poverty. We hope\nthat the international community will achieve the goals of\nthe first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of\nPoverty.\nMy country hopes that the next World Food Summit,\nto be held in November in Rome, will make it possible for\nthe international community to reaffirm its commitment to\nensuring that poverty-eradication strategies are fully\nintegrated into all United Nations initiatives.\nMali has signed and ratified most international\narrangements regarding the environment and therefore\nwelcomes the convening of a special session devoted to a\nreview of the progress made by Agenda 21. Mali intends to\ncontinue to work towards the elaboration of the United\nNations Convention to Combat Desertification in those\nCountries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\nDesertification, particularly in Africa. Mali is therefore\npleased at how fast the necessary ratification of 50 Member\nStates was achieved. My delegation is nevertheless\nconcerned about the deadlock on the question of a world\nmechanism. Mali believes that the mechanism should serve\nas a data bank and a supplier of the resources necessary to\nimplement national plans to combat desertification.\nOur Organization faces new challenges, both in the\nconsolidation of peace and in economic and social\ndevelopment. Its role is constantly growing, and increasing\nnumbers of voices throughout the world appeal to it. In\norder to meet the challenges of the day, our Organization\nmust have a sound and adequate financial basis. It must\nalso carry out the necessary reforms so that it can be\nmore effective and thus meet the aspirations of peoples\nfor security, justice and development. Accordingly, these\nreforms must apply to the Security Council, the General\nAssembly and the Secretariat, but particularly to the\nspecialized and development agencies responsible for\nelaborating and implementing development programmes.\nThis is an ambitious challenge, and Africa must\ncontribute significantly to efforts in that direction. The\ninternational community must renew its trust in Africa by\ngiving a second term of office to the Head of our\nOrganization, in keeping with past practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy country is especially pleased at the\nPresident\u2019s election to lead the General Assembly. He\nrepresents a great country that plays an important role in\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and I\nam glad that he is to preside over our work during this\ncrucial period for our Organization.\n17\n\n\nI should also like to endorse the remarks made by\nIreland\u2019s Foreign Minister in the name of the European\nUnion.\nLast year, we celebrated the first half century of the\nUnited Nations existence, during which its energies were\ndevoted, with a success universally acknowledged, to the\norganization of international society. A mammoth collective\nundertaking has been accomplished and the United Nations\nhas become the keystone of an international system founded\non law and the peaceful settlement of conflicts. This\ncollective undertaking owes much to the determined action\nof successive Secretaries-General, and I should like to pay\na special and warm tribute here to Mr. Boutros-Ghali,\nwhose determination, vision of the future and firmness have\ngiven our Organization a presence and vitality rarely\nachieved. He deserves our confidence.\nToday, as the century reaches its turning point, the\nOrganization is confronted with another major challenge:\nglobalization. In every sphere, the ideas and realities to\nwhich we were accustomed are changing at a pace\nunequalled in human history. The movement of people, of\nideas and images, and of goods is accelerating as distances\nshrink. At the same time, the standardization of cultural\npractices \u2014 and the legitimate reactions this provokes \u2014\nthe general spread of low-cost high technologies and\nintensified competition bring into question the positions that\nhave been achieved and the functioning, if not the very\nfoundation, of international society. At the same time, the\nproduction of wealth is increasing tenfold and scientific\nprogress is growing rapidly, while unexpected opportunities\nfor development are being given to new nations.\nBut these benefits have adverse effects. The control\nfragile States have over their development is being eroded,\nnational legislation is becoming inapplicable and the notion\nof territorial integrity is changing in meaning. In short,\nnational authorities are too often reduced to powerlessness\nby transnational phenomena over which they have only\nscant control. If we are not careful, we are going to be\nliving in a world without criteria, without values, without\nreferences, in which some \u2014 the strongest and the\nrichest \u2014 will be in a position to decide alone on the future\nof the planet. It should come as no surprise that, in these\ncircumstances, the United Nations has many detractors.\nOur Organization is in effect a privileged forum in\nwhich the framework of a genuine international society can\nbe built, a framework that frees the forces of creativity and\ndevelopment and represses the forces of violence and\noppression. It is up to all of us present here to enable the\nUnited Nations to play that role and to ensure peace,\nsecurity and progress in these new circumstances and in\nkeeping with its mandate. Rest assured that France, a\nfounding Member of the Organization and permanent\nmember of the Security Council, will devote all its\nenergies to this task and will be in the front ranks of this\nnew fight.\nOur world is confronted today with terrible problems\nthat know no borders and, sadly, spare no population:\nterrorism, crime and drugs. The fight against these\nscourges is foremost in our concerns and high on the\ninternational agenda. Accordingly, an uncompromising\nfight against terrorism, whatever its forms, perpetrators\nand motives, constitutes our priority. This is why I\nconvened a conference on terrorism in Paris last July that\nbrought together the G-7 countries and Russia. We\nadopted 25 practical, specific recommendations. They will\nbe implemented by each State and will strengthen\ninternational cooperation against terrorism. Therefore,\ntoday I make a solemn call on the entire international\ncommunity to join wholeheartedly in this fight.\nWe must also react without weakness to the\nchallenge of organized crime, in the knowledge that it\nknows how to make the fullest use of the possibilities that\nhave been opened up by the liberalization of trade. For it\nis the very foundation of our societies and institutions that\nit endangers today.\nInternational cooperation is indispensable to stem\nthis phenomenon. France, pursuing the path mapped out\nby the Canadian presidency, has drafted a corpus of legal\nand operational recommendations with its G-7 partners\nand Russia to improve the effectiveness of the fight\nagainst this scourge. These should guide in particular the\naction of the States most affected by transnational\norganized crime. France recently strengthened its financial\nlegislation against money-laundering. All States should\npay particular attention to this phenomenon, which is one\nof the hardest forms of organized crime to counter.\nOne of the most loathsome aspects of organized\ncrime is that which targets our children. A world summit\non combating the sexual exploitation of children was\nrecently held in Stockholm. That is good, but it is still not\nenough. Everyone must now make a commitment to\nimplementing effective measures for immediate\napplication. I urge all States represented here to act\nquickly and with determination in this area which, more\nthan any other, affects our future. The Assembly may rest\nassured of France\u2019s political resolve.\n18\n\n\nDrugs are a formidable threat today because of the\nravages they inflict on young people. International\ncooperation must be solid. The producer and consumer\ncountries must recognize their shared responsibility. The\ninternational community must therefore continue to pursue\nconvergent policies to reduce the supply of illegal\nsubstances and the demand for them. The European Union\nhas chosen such a global policy and has launched large-\nscale actions in close coordination with international\ninstitutions, in particular the United Nations International\nDrug Control Programme. France strongly supports the\nproposal to convene a special session of the General\nAssembly devoted to drugs in 1998.\nThese new perils do not supplant the traditional\nchallenges, which our Organization must address with\nsustained vigilance and unwavering firmness. Peace-keeping\nremains the central function of our Organization under the\nterms of the founding Charter. The mission of the United\nNations to soothe tensions, separate combatants and resolve\nconflicts remains fundamental.\nThe panoply of available instruments is becoming\nmore diversified. Recent additions to conventional peace-\nkeeping missions include activities to consolidate peace,\npreventive diplomacy measures and even regional\nconferences \u2014 such as I hope will soon take place with\nregard to the situation in the Great Lakes region.\nSanctions constitute one of these instruments. They are\na useful weapon, but they penalize populations and must\ntherefore be used with prudence and moderation, follow\nstrict criteria and \u2014 I stress this \u2014 always be limited in\ntime. Only under those conditions can sanctions, which are\nsometimes necessary to prevent something worse, continue\nto be used by our Organization with the required\nlegitimacy.\nOf course, we cannot refer to the traditional challenges\nto peace without speaking about current regional conflicts.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, where my country has paid a\nheavy tribute, France is pleased that elections could be held,\nimperfect though they were. That represents an essential\nstage in the return to peace provided for by the agreements\nsigned in Paris in 1995.\nBut peace still has to be consolidated, devastated\nterritories be reconstructed, refugees encouraged to return\nand a civilian society rebuilt. To that end, France has\nproposed a plan of consolidated action by the international\ncommunity with a time-frame of two years. With this goal\nin mind, we will very shortly be hosting an international\nconference in Paris to examine, and I hope adopt, this\nproposal.\nSimilarly, the peace process in the Middle East\nseems to be at a crucial stage. I wish here to express my\nanxiety about it. I certainly believe the process to be\nirreversible, but I am also aware of the precariousness of\nthe gains and the urgency of the need for long-term\nsolutions. We are half-way there. I say \u201cwe\u201d, because this\nprocess concerns not just Arabs and Israelis but all of us\nhere.\nFor France, peace in the Middle East is built upon\ndialogue between equal partners, respect for the identity\nof each and the right of peoples to the free determination\nof their destiny, the affirmation of their independence, and\nsecurity. That is why \u2014 and I wish to emphasize this\npoint \u2014 France believes that there will be no lasting\npeace in the region, based on an exchange of land for\npeace, unless the right of the Palestinian people to self-\ndetermination is respected, together with their legitimate\naspirations for a State.\nWe believe that a just and balanced agreement\nbetween Israelis and Palestinians cannot avoid the issues\nof Jerusalem, refugees and the settlements in the\nPalestinian territories. Finally, a lasting peace presupposes\nthat Israel is assured of its existence within secure and\nrecognized borders.\nFrance believes that complete withdrawal from the\nGolan Heights in exchange for total peace constitutes the\nbasis of an agreement between Syria and Israel, and that\nLebanon must regain full and complete sovereignty over\nthe whole of its territory.\nBased on these principles, France intends to have a\ngreater and more active presence than ever in the Middle\nEast, with which it has close and long-standing relations.\nIt will pursue this policy in close consultation with its\nEuropean partners. Furthermore, Europe must have a\nplace, alongside the two sponsors of the peace process,\ncommensurate with the major contribution it is making to\nthe region\u2019s development.\nWhile we are endeavouring to build peace in areas\nin crisis, our efforts are no less ambitious for the entire\nEuropean continent. In building step by step what we call\nan \u201carchitecture of security\u201c, we are really offering the\ninternational community a pillar of peace. France is\nmaking an important contribution to the establishment on\n19\n\n\nthe European continent a system of global security that\nleaves no one out on the edge.\nThe construction of peace in Europe began with the\nconstruction of European institutions. It is being continued\nby deepening the Union. The intergovernmental Conference\nrepresents a decisive stage in this process, the forerunner of\nexpansion, which is vital to the stability and prosperity of\nthe continent.\nFrance wishes to see the Union go still further by\ngiving substance to the European identity in security and\ndefence matters. To that end, we would like to see a\nstrengthening of the Western European Union and its\ngradual rapprochement with the European Union.\nThe European identity is also based on the reform of\nthe Atlantic Alliance. France, after taking a decisive step,\nis now working actively with its allies on the adaptation of\nstructures. This should allow the emergence of a genuine\nEuropean security and defence identity within the Alliance\nand make it possible in practice for the Western European\nUnion, and therefore the European Union, to use the assets\nof the Alliance for military action that Europeans decide to\nundertake themselves. This reform is also the key to the\nprocess of expanding the Alliance, with which France is\nready to assist. That expansion must naturally go hand-in-\nhand with in-depth dialogue and cooperation with Russia.\nThe third and last aspect of the structure is the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE), which is the sole forum for security in which all\nthe European States are represented on an equal footing.\nThat is why France believes that it is necessary to\nstrengthen the organization. We hope that the Lisbon\nsummit will provide the occasion to move towards the\ndrafting of a charter or treaty linking all the States of the\ncontinent.\nImportant events therefore await us on the path that\nwe have mapped out, including the OSCE summit in\nDecember and the NATO summit next year. The latter\nshould bring together all the European States for a\n\u201cpan-Europe day\u201d, demonstrating the community of security\ninterests of all the countries on the continent, including\nRussia and our North American allies whose role in\nEuropean security remains decisive. That is our ambition\nfor a Europe of security that leaves no one out and is safer\nand more stable for the entire international community.\nIn this changing world, it is for the United Nations to\nbring out the common values that will be the foundations\nof civilization in the twenty-first century. It is thanks to\nits actions that we hope to build a safer, less harsh world\nfor its inhabitants. First, we hope it will be a world in\nwhich the spectre of nuclear war has faded. For many\nyears, public opinion called for a complete ban on nuclear\ntests. It was a hope and a plan that was certainly worthy,\nbut remained blocked by the reality of East-West\nconfrontation.\nFrance welcomes the signing of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which I had the honour to sign\nyesterday. This Treaty marks a major turning-point in the\nworld\u2019s strategic balances.\nIt puts an end to the possibility of the nuclear-\nweapon States\u2019 developing new types of nuclear weapons,\nand it makes a decisive contribution to the fight against\nnuclear-weapon proliferation.\nThe Treaty thus opens the way to a more stable,\nsafer world which will cease to be haunted by the twin\ndangers of the nuclear-arms race and the proliferation of\nthese weapons.\nThere is another development which I find\nremarkable: the endorsement of human rights as a major\nprinciple of international relations. And the United\nNations is at the centre of this development.\nI should like in this regard to pay tribute to the\nremarkable work done by the Commission on Human\nRights. In often difficult circumstances, it has pursued\nwith pragmatism and tenacity its patient efforts to awaken\nconsciences, to galvanize energies and to promote the rule\nof law in concrete ways.\nOur aim must not be to pronounce\nexcommunications or establish a blacklist, generally to no\neffect. Rather, it must be to promote the protection of\nindividuals and the progress of law with due respect for\ndifferences.\nI should also like to reaffirm France\u2019s determination\nto see crimes against humanity punished. The\ncondemnation they warrant cannot brook any exception.\nTogether with others, France took the initiative of\nproposing the establishment of the international criminal\nTribunal and the international Tribunal for Rwanda. I\nwish to reaffirm France\u2019s unqualified support for their\nfounding work, and its backing in order that the tribunals\nmight carry out their work in full.\n20\n\n\nLastly, France is pleased that the foundations that have\nthus been laid have helped to speed up the debates on the\nestablishment of an international criminal court, which we\nearnestly desire and to which we attach a high priority.\nThere are other important areas which we have begun\nto consider.\nAt this time when workers, money, factories and\ncommerce operate at a heightened pace, it is essential to\ndevelop dialogue among the partners of economic life. This\nis really the only solid basis on which to build social\nprotection that preserves the interests of all without harming\nthe growth of economies.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the International Labour\nOrganisation (ILO) provided the opportunity to recall the\nessential role of this organization in defining these minimal\nnorms, without which the economic world is but a vast\njungle.\nUniversality, however, must not lead to uniformity.\nThe definition of common values, accepted by all, is based\non respect for the identities that underpin the cultures of the\nworld. Our values will thus command all the more respect\nfor being expressed in all our respective languages.\nAccordingly, we welcome the fact that the General\nAssembly last year adopted a resolution on multilingualism\nby a very large majority. Our civilizations, languages and\ncultures, inherited from an often turbulent history, but of\nirreplaceable richness, are a precious legacy for humankind.\nThe importance that my country ascribes to the\nFrench-speaking community reflects its determination to\nmaintain the specificity and richness of the profoundly\noriginal world view of several hundreds of millions of\npeople. We will not give this up.\nThe search for a new world ethic is not limited to\nhuman rights but extends to the whole of international life.\nSince 1945, international trade has been a powerful growth\nfactor, contributing to a large extent to the expansion of the\nindustrialized economies and to the success of the so-called\nemerging countries. But here too we must have rules of the\ngame, acknowledged at the world level, so as to develop\nand regulate trade, ensure that it is fair and prevent\nunilateral conduct.\nI should like to mention here the dangers of\nunilateralism. Unilateralism: behind this technocratic word\nlurks the temptation to impose the law of the strongest at\nthe expense of dialogue and negotiation.\nFrance and Europe cannot accept that one country,\neven if it is the most powerful, attempt to regulate world\ntrade by itself by means of decisions that have extra-\nterritorial scope. The World Trade Organization does not\nallow it, and no one should doubt the firmness of French\nand European reactions were such measures actually to be\nimplemented.\nThe globalization of the economy and the\nliberalization of trade and investments have opened up\nunprecedented prospects. However, we must take care not\nto allow the gap to widen between the nations that trade,\ninvest and derive profit from this new factor and those\nthat remain on the sidelines of this new prosperity.\nEach nation is responsible for itself and must create,\nthrough rigorous public management and compliance with\nits legislative rulings, optimum conditions for freeing\nprivate initiative, a factor in economic and commercial\nprogress. But I do not believe that one can leave to\nmarket forces alone the care of ensuring the development\nof the poorest nations.\nHere, too, the United Nations has an important role\nto play. By its side, the wealthiest States must affirm their\nsolidarity in a tangible way: actively and effectively, this\nsolidarity must assist the developing countries without\nbecoming a substitute for them. On the threshold of a\nnew century, poverty and exclusion cannot constitute the\nsole prospects for two-thirds of humankind. France, for its\npart, will not accept this.\nThis commitment concerns Africa in particular,\nwhere real prospects for progress are beginning to\nemerge.\nAfrica has embarked with courage and perseverance\non the path to readjustment and recovery, which will\nenable it to find its place again in the great flows of\nworld trade.\nFor the first time in a long time, Africa\u2019s growth\nrate has been on the order of 5 per cent these past two\nyears, higher than its demographic expansion, very high\nthough it is. This is a reassuring sign, attributable to the\nefforts made by the African States themselves. They have\nbeen able to cut public deficits, establish realistic\nmonetary parities, open up their markets and move\ntowards regional integration and democratization. Such\n21\n\n\nachievements, which are the result of structural reforms,\nseem to us to justify our confidence. France believes in\nAfrica\u2019s future.\nStill, official development assistance must be\nmaintained and strengthened, but this assistance must be the\nsubject of many initiatives. France has taken such\ninitiatives within the European Union, the African\nDevelopment Bank, the International Development\nAssociation and the International Monetary Fund.\nRecently, at the summit of industrialized countries\nheld in Lyons, my country reaffirmed the need to increase\naid to the poorest countries, asking for more generous\ntreatment of debt for them, and for a new global partnership\nto be defined between the developing countries and the\nmultilateral institutions.\nIn this new world context, we have to consider the\nprogress that the United Nations needs to make to be able\nto meet its responsibilities for the next century.\nFrance approves of the current discussions on\nimproving the representative character of the Security\nCouncil, in particular with respect to Germany, Japan and\nthe States of the South.\nSimilarly, under the decisive impetus of the Secretary-\nGeneral, the Organization has embarked on a vast effort for\nstructural reform, the first results of which are beginning to\nshow.\nIt is not a matter of changing everything but of seeing\nthat every institution is in a position to make a useful\ncontribution to the collective work in its own sphere.\nThat is why the members of the G-7 have proposed\nputting the savings realized through reforms into\ndevelopment projects.\nFrance would like to see the reform of the United\nNations economic and social sector concluded quickly so as\nto strengthen the overall coherence of the Organization. To\nthat end, the roles and mandates of the specialized agencies\nand commissions in particular should be better defined, and\nwaste and duplication eliminated.\nThese proposals are dictated solely by the wish to help\nthe United Nations better fulfil its mission of fighting\npoverty and exclusion on a global scale.\nIn the case of the United Nations budget, many of us\nare worried about the financial crisis that threatens to\nparalyse the United Nations. The European Union has put\nforward concrete proposals for overcoming this crisis. It\nis now up to all States that have let their arrears\naccumulate to assume their responsibilities.\nWhatever some may say, the United Nations is still\none of our best chances for building a better world. Let\nus not spoil it.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, Sir, to offer you my\nwarm congratulations on your election as President of the\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly. I am very\nconfident that, with your skill and experience, you will\nprovide the leadership and direction we require to ensure a\nsuccessful outcome to the work of the forthcoming session.\nYou have the assurance of our full support.\nI have the honour to address this Assembly on behalf\nof the European Union.\nLast year we gathered here on the fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations. The speeches we heard then\nreflected a dual message: a conviction that the United\nNations remained more than ever indispensable in a world\nof increasing interdependence among nations; and concern\nthat the Organization adapt and renew itself to serve the\nneeds of a new century. There was a clear call that the\nnon-payment of dues owed to the United Nations \u2014 this\npoison in the system \u2014 should cease.\nThe Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth\nAnniversary of the United Nations rightly anticipated\n\u201ca sharp increase in the level of expectations of the\nUnited Nations\u201d (resolution 50/6).\nIt called for the occasion to be seized\n\u201cto redirect it to greater service to humankind,\nespecially to those who are suffering and are deeply\ndeprived\u201d.\nWe have no need at the outset of the fifty-first\nsession to seek a new agenda. Cooperation through the\nUnited Nations continues to offer the world the\nirreplaceable means necessary for advancing peace,\neconomic and social progress, human rights, democracy\nand caring humanitarian action. To retain the\nOrganization\u2019s effectiveness, we need, together with\nadequate resources, a continuing modernization of the\nstructures and working methods of the institutions of the\nUnited Nations. What we must do now is sharpen the\nfocus on common priorities to achieve this and get on\nwith the decisions to give them effect.\nGlobalization is one of the defining characteristics of\nour age. With it has come the realization that our peace\nand prosperity cannot be assured by States, or even\nregions, acting in isolation. The European Union itself\nembodies the principles of cooperation, interdependence,\nhuman rights and democracy. The spirit of cooperation is\nalso the starting point for the contribution that the Union\nis making at the global level, where the enormous\nbenefits that can be achieved by working together\nconstitute the greatest, and potentially the most rewarding,\nchallenge that faces mankind today.\nThe very interdependence of our peoples, nations\nand regions that leads us to assemble here as the United\nNations should serve to underscore the unique role and\npotential of this Organization, the sole such universal\nbody of global outreach. Has it done so? Have we\nstrengthened the potential of the United Nations, or yet\nsufficiently exerted the energy and imagination necessary\nto use the opportunities it offers us?\nWe were able last year to reflect with justifiable\npride on 50 years of substantial success by the United\nNations. Our celebration was tempered, however, by a\nsobering awareness that the level of conflict, economic\ndisparities and humanitarian crisis in our world was\nincreasing, not diminishing. We had witnessed a series of\nopen and bloody intra-State conflicts and the resurgence\nof old antagonisms in many regions of the world,\nresulting in death and injury to millions of innocent\ncivilians, many of them women and children; an increase\nin the already high number of refugees; gross and flagrant\nviolations of human rights on a massive scale; and the\nwidespread incidence of hunger, disease and\nhomelessness. At the same time, threats to the\n7\n\n\nenvironment and the scourges of drugs and terrorism were\namong a new range of risks and challenges that required\nconcerted international action.\nThe urgency and complexity of these and other\nproblems facing the United Nations at a time of great\npolitical, economic and technological change led us to a\ncommon call for a United Nations revitalized and more\neffective in dealing with these new needs. Some progress\nhas been made in the past year in rationalizing United\nNations activities in the economic and social fields and in\nenhancing efficiency and better management. This deserves\nto be recognized. But we are still far from the overall\nresults needed. Serious new efforts are required from\nMember States and the Organization. The multilateral\napproach which the United Nations embodies is under\nthreat if we cannot respond to the challenges before us. We\nneed a renewed commitment to collective action, with\nstrong vision and leadership sustained by the political will\nof each Member State. The European Union renews again\ntoday its commitment to the United Nations. We are\ndetermined to equip it for the tasks of a new century.\nRecent experience has taught us that we need a more\nencompassing strategy for conflict prevention and crisis\nmanagement. This strategy has to address both the causes\nand the consequences of conflict. The Agenda for Peace\nwas a well-considered and timely initiative of the\nSecretary-General which points the way forward.\nSubstantial lessons from the United Nations experience of\npeacekeeping have indeed been learned. They should be\napplied in developing this new strategy.\nTo secure peace, the root causes of conflict have to be\ntackled. Too often the United Nations is called upon to\nreact to the appalling aftermath of conflict. Prevention is a\nfar better strategy. Improved early warning through more\neffective and internationally coordinated efforts which also\ntake account of economic and social factors can do much\nto improve the quality of the response. There needs to be\nan increased emphasis on preventive diplomacy and on a\nmore informed, better-planned and rapid response to crises,\nincluding improved procedures for consultation with\ntroop-contributing countries. Existing mechanisms for\nmediation, conciliation and good offices could be more\nvigorously and imaginatively exploited. Post-conflict\nrehabilitation has to be more comprehensive and\ncoordinated to address the wider issues of humanitarian\nassistance, economic and social reconstruction and respect\nfor human rights, democracy and the rule of law.\nEven with an improved approach to early warning\nand conflict prevention, peacekeeping operations will still\nbe necessary. The experience of some recent difficult\noperations should not detract from the record of successes\nin United Nations peacekeeping. The support of the\nEuropean Union for the peacekeeping role of the United\nNations is undiminished. The member States of the\nUnion, my own included, have consistently provided\nresources and personnel to United Nations peacekeeping.\nThe Union today provides the majority of personnel for\ncurrent operations and contributes some 37 per cent of the\nUnited Nations peacekeeping budget. This has involved\nsacrifices, including at times the ultimate sacrifice. On\nbehalf of the European Union, I pay tribute to the\nmemory of United Nations peacekeepers who have laid\ndown their lives in the cause of peace and to the over\n25,000 peacekeepers currently serving in 17 United\nNations peacekeeping operations.\nToo often, the United Nations has been called upon\nto intervene in conflict situations without a clear mandate,\nadequate resources or the consistent political support\nrequired to have any prospect of success. Too often, the\nUnited Nations has been confined to policing indefinitely\na fragile and hostile peace between parties that, even after\ndecades, show no real inclination to assume responsibility\nfor securing a resolution of the conflict. This wastes\nmuch-needed United Nations resources. But more\nseriously, it undermines confidence in the United Nations.\nIf we apply our energies to developing new strategies for\nconflict prevention and crisis management, we will have\ndone much to strengthen the capacity of the United\nNations in this core area. The European Union, for its\npart, will work to strengthen and reinforce this vital role\nof the Organization.\nThe United Nations cannot be expected to stand\nalone in conflict prevention and the maintenance of world\npeace. The European Union welcomes the trend towards\ncloser cooperation and mutual support between the United\nNations and regional organizations. In Europe, the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) has been designated as a regional arrangement\nunder Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. The\nUnited Nations and the OSCE are already cooperating\nclosely and coordinating their efforts. Within the OSCE\narea, the European Union is working with all the OSCE\nparticipating States to develop further the concept of\nmutually reinforcing institutions so as to enhance\nEuropean security and stability. The Union encourages\nand supports the similar efforts being made in other\nregions. It is important that the United Nations benefit\n8\n\n\nfrom, and build on, these initiatives. The meetings of\nregional organizations that the Secretary-General has\nconvened in recent years are an important innovation in this\nregard. Since its inception, the United Nations has played\na central role in the longer-term strategies for conflict\nprevention, in particular in the fields of disarmament and\narms control, human rights and equitable economic and\nsocial development.\nThe European Union attaches the highest priority to\nprogress in the fields of arms control and disarmament. If\nwe mean to invest in peace, then we must all become\nadvocates of disarmament. Today was a particularly good\nday for disarmament and for the United Nations. It was my\nprivilege this morning to join with other colleagues in the\nEuropean Union in signing, on behalf of our respective\nStates, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The\nEuropean Union would urge all States to sign and ratify this\nimportant Treaty.\nWe must respond to the clear wish of all our peoples\nto live in a world in which the threats posed by nuclear\nweapons and weapons of mass destruction can be reduced\nand ultimately removed. We have made a start with\nConventions banning chemical and biological weapons. The\nnext step is the start of negotiations for a cut-off treaty.\nThe European Union will also give priority at this\nsession to measures to deal with the menace of the\nindiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines. Today, there\nare over 110 million landmines in our earth, mostly in\ndeveloping countries. They kill, indiscriminately, 26,000\npeople every year, mostly civilians, many of them women\nand children. Anti-personnel landmines have disabled a\nquarter of a million people.\nIt is an incredible and obscene irony that at a time\nwhen the United Nations, with the active support of the\nEuropean Union and other States, is continuing its vital\nwork of mine clearance, further millions of anti-personnel\nlandmines are still deployed annually. The European Union\nhas endorsed the appeal made by the Security Council to all\nStates to contribute to the Voluntary Trust Fund for\nAssistance in Mine Clearance. We call upon all Member\nStates of the United Nations to join with the European\nUnion, in a spirit of common humanity, to put an end to\nindiscriminate killing and maiming by anti-personnel\nlandmines.\nConventional arms control, at both a global and\nregional level, also requires our attention. We now have the\nopportunity to overcome the mistrust and insecurity that\npreviously predominated in arms-control negotiations and\nto create a climate of transparency and cooperation\nleading to arms reduction. This process is under way in\nEurope. We would hope to see it develop in other regions\nof the world.\nFailure to respect human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms is a major cause of conflict today. Many\nintra-State conflicts arise from the denial of basic human\nrights to minorities and in some cases to whole\npopulations. The democratic right of all citizens to\nparticipate freely and openly in the governance of their\nsocieties continues to be under threat or denied. The battle\nfor the economic and social emancipation and\nempowerment of women has begun. This is an issue of\nspecial importance for the European Union.\nThe United Nations has since its inception been in\nthe vanguard in the promotion and defence of human\nrights and democratic freedoms. Its record is indeed a\nproud one. The European Union will continue its support,\nboth material and political, for the vital ongoing work of\nthe United Nations in this area. The Union believes it is\nessential to secure adequate financing from the regular\nbudget for the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for\nHuman Rights. The European Union fully supports the\nDeclaration and Plan of Action adopted by the recent\nWorld Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation\nof Children. This is a timely initiative in tackling this\nappalling abuse, which affects all regions in the world.\nDespite decades of effort and resources, the poverty\ngap has widened, not narrowed. For many of the least-\ndeveloped nations, their development is regressing rather\nthan advancing. The time is long overdue to mount a new\nglobal offensive against poverty, a major cause of\ninstability and conflict. We will give major priority to the\nwar against poverty and the United Nations New Agenda\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s initiative.\nA more vigorous effort is needed to carry through\nmajor programmes for the economic and social\nadvancement of women, as are more emphasis and action\non the gender perspective across the whole spectrum of\ndevelopment.\nThe European Union recognizes the central role\nwhich the United Nations system, through its specialized\nagencies and programmes, has played and will continue\nto play in the humanitarian, economic and social fields.\nWe need to reform and revitalize the United Nations\n9\n\n\nsystem in this area to ensure a real and lasting impact on\nsustainable development.\nOur aim is reform, not the retrenchment of resources.\nThe discussions on \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d have\nbegun this process. A sense of urgency is required to give\nimpetus to our work during this session of the General\nAssembly and to build upon recent progress. The European\nUnion will pay particular attention to the follow-up to\nresolution 50/227 concerning the revitalization of the\nsystem.\nEffective follow-up to the conclusions of the\nEconomic and Social Council (ECOSOC) substantive\nsession on humanitarian assistance will be vital to achieve\na stronger and more coordinated strategy within the United\nNations system to deliver effective programmes where they\nare most needed. We must also see progress in coordinating\nthe outcome of recent United Nations conferences,\nincluding the Habitat II Conference in June.\nThe European Union welcomes the renewed emphasis\nof ECOSOC on the global threat posed by narcotic drugs.\nThe Union is giving high priority to measures which will\nimprove the coordination of efforts to fight this threat,\nwhich undermines the very fabric of all our societies.\nThe success of the United Nations Conference on\nTrade and Development (UNCTAD) conference in Midrand\nis welcome in that it underlines that reform and progress in\nrenewing the system are possible.\nThe forthcoming special session on Agenda 21 and the\nfollow-up to the Rio Conference will allow us to give fresh\nimpetus to action on development and environmental issues\nand renewed support to the work of the Commission on\nSustainable Development.\nThe European Union invites all Member States to join\nin a new global partnership for development. It is in the\ncommon interest of the peoples we represent to forge a\nglobal alliance against poverty, hunger, disease, ignorance\nand deprivation. This is a key challenge for the United\nNations and its Member States.\nOur endeavour to revitalize and reform the United\nNations system is taking place against the backdrop of a\nserious financial crisis. This continuing crisis undermines\nthe necessary climate of partnership and the capacity to\nimplement current programmes in many areas. It distracts\nefforts and attention from the real tasks of the moment.\nThe European Union has repeatedly stated that all\nMember States have an obligation under the Charter to\ndischarge their arrears and pay their assessed\ncontributions to the regular and peacekeeping budgets\npromptly, in full and without conditions. The States\nmembers of the European Union, which contribute over\n35 per cent of the regular and over 37 per cent of the\npeacekeeping budgets have consistently honoured this\nobligation. They believe that to resolve this crisis, all\nStates Members of the United Nations must do likewise.\nThe Union recognizes the need for financial reform\nto secure the long-term financial stability of the United\nNations. It has therefore put forward a set of proposals\naimed at achieving comprehensive financial reform,\nincluding adaptation of the scale of assessments to make\nit more genuinely reflective of the capacity to pay.\nThis session should see resolute efforts to negotiate\nsolutions.\nThe conflicts and tensions in today\u2019s world are\nreflected in the memorandum distributed as part of this\nspeech, in which the European Union outlines its position\non issues facing the world community. I would like to\ndraw attention at this point to some critical areas of major\nconcern to the European Union: the former Yugoslavia,\nCyprus, the Middle East peace process and the Great\nLakes region of Africa.\nEurope has not been spared the tragic ethnic conflict\nwitnessed in other regions. The progress we have made in\nbringing an end to the savage war in the former\nYugoslavia has required the combined efforts of the\ninternational community and a variety of international and\nregional bodies, including the United Nations, the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union.\nHowever, we still need to address the massive\nhumanitarian and reconstruction needs left in its wake, as\nwell as the more difficult and long-term task of rebuilding\ntrust, security and peace among the peoples of the region\nand ensuring full respect for the territorial integrity of the\nvarious sovereign States.\nThe European Union and its member States remain\ncommitted to full implementation of the provisions of the\npeace Agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and to\nmaking a very substantial contribution to the concerted\neffort being made to assist the parties who have primary\nresponsibility for this implementation in living up to their\nobligations.\n10\n\n\nThere are daunting tasks ahead. The immediate focus\nis on the follow-up to the elections in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina which took place on 14 September 1996 under\nthe supervision of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe. On this occasion, I would\nacknowledge in particular the very important contribution\nthat was made by the Implementation Force and the United\nNations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the\nInternational Police Task Force, in ensuring that the\nelections were conducted peacefully.\nThe Union fully supports the strategy of the High\nRepresentative, Mr. Carl Bildt, in regard to establishing the\ncommon institutions of the State after the elections. He has\nthe full assurance of our support for his leading role in the\nimplementation process. We do not underestimate the\nenormity of this task. If we are to succeed in maintaining\npeace, it is essential that the international community\nclosely coordinate its activities and that all parties cooperate\nfully in the process. The European Union will work closely\nwith the United Nations and the international community to\nachieve an effective long-term strategy to secure peace and\nself-sustaining stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this\ncontext, the Union notes that parties have agreed to hold\nfurther elections in September 1998. An important focus\nduring the intervening period will be assisting the Office of\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in\nfacilitating the return of the many thousands of refugees\nand displaced persons who have not yet been able to go\nback to their homes. Ultimately, our aim must be a return\nby all the former Yugoslav republics to the community of\npeaceful and democratic nations.\nThe basic agreement for Eastern Slavonia must be\nimplemented in full and the return of refugees and\ndisplaced persons to this region completed. Such persons\nmust be ensured of full protection for their human rights.\nThe Union acknowledges the important work of the United\nNations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia,\nBaranja and Western Sirmium, which enjoys our full\nsupport in its efforts.\nThe Union continues to attach great importance to full\ncooperation with the work of the International Criminal\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia. This work reflects the\nresolve of the international community to bring to justice\nthose responsible for war crimes and crimes against\nhumanity. It is vital to efforts to develop justice, confidence\nand democracy in the region that all parties fulfil the\ncommitments they have made to hand over indicted persons.\nThe European Union stresses once again that the\ncurrent status quo in Cyprus is not acceptable. It reaffirms\nits strong support for the efforts of the Secretary-General\nof the United Nations aimed at a negotiated and lasting\nsolution to the Cyprus question which will respect the\nsovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity\nof the country in accordance with the relevant United\nNations resolutions. The European Union welcomes the\nappointment of the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Han Sung-Joo. The Presidency of\nthe European Union has also nominated a Special\nRepresentative on Cyprus.\nThe Middle East peace process, based on the\nprinciples already accepted by all parties under the\nMadrid and Oslo frameworks, is the only path to security\nand peace for Israel, the Palestinians and the neighbouring\nStates. The Florence European Council of June 1996\nreaffirmed the approach of the European Union. It further\nstated that peace in the Middle East was a fundamental\ninterest of the European Union. The Union is therefore\nconcentrating its efforts on encouraging all parties to\nre-engage themselves in this process and to respect and\nimplement fully all the agreements already reached.\nWe wish to make an active contribution to promote\nthis process in both the political and economic fields and\nto build upon the important work which has been done\nover the years by the United Nations in the interests of a\njust, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East.\nWe would invite all Member States to do their\nutmost to nurture this process and give encouragement to\nall parties to move forward.\nThe Union is deeply concerned that the current lack\nof progress in negotiations should not undermine the\nprospects for peace. The progress already achieved should\nbe advanced by further agreement on concrete issues. We\nhope that the recent meeting between the Israeli Prime\nMinister and the Palestinian President will have positive\nresults for the peace process. We call upon the Israeli\nGovernment not to pursue the extension of settlements.\nContinued expansion of settlements does more than any\nother issue to erode Palestinian confidence in the peace\nprocess. It undermines the ability of both the Palestinian\nAuthority and society at large to deter extremists and\ntrouble-makers. As the largest donor, the Union remains\ncommitted to providing assistance to the Palestinian\npeople and urges all parties concerned to contribute to the\neconomic revival of the West Bank and Gaza. This\nendeavour will hopefully be rendered more effective by\n\n\n\nthe recent relaxation of the border closures, and we hope\nthat this encouraging trend will continue.\nIt is important that all tracks of the peace process\nmove forward. We favour an early resumption of\nnegotiations between Syria and Israel, and have reaffirmed\nour support for the independence, territorial integrity and\nsovereignty of Lebanon and for early negotiations involving\nthat country.\nThe creation of the Middle East peace process has\nbeen a historic breakthrough in the long-standing search to\nbring to the peoples of the region the lasting and just peace\nwhich they clearly want and, indeed, they deserve. The\nEuropean Union will intensify its efforts to ensure its\nsuccess.\nThe European Union shares the heightened concern of\nthe international community at the grave threat to peace and\nstability in the Great Lakes region posed by the current\nsituation in Burundi. The United Nations and the European\nUnion are already involved in an international effort to cope\nwith the aftermath of the Rwanda tragedy \u2014 the major\nhumanitarian crisis, the serious refugee problem, and the\nongoing process of regional reconstruction. But at the same\ntime the area is again facing the prospect of bloody civil\nwar and genocide, in Burundi. We cannot allow this to\nhappen. The European Union strongly supports the efforts\nof the United Nations and the Organization of African\nUnity to restore dialogue and democracy in Burundi. It\nacknowledges in particular the pivotal role being played in\nthis endeavour by former President Nyerere, supported by\nother regional leaders. Their efforts are assisted by the\nspecial envoys of the European Union and the United\nNations, and other parties.\nThe international community, through Security Council\nresolution 1072 (1996), has sent a clear message to the\nparties involved that there must be an end to all violence\nand an early beginning of unconditional and all-inclusive\nnational dialogue in Burundi. This is the only constructive\npath to a solution which is lasting and based on a\nnegotiated, democratic and institutional consensus which\nensures security for all. The European Union remains\nwilling to support the necessary recovery process in\nBurundi once the path of dialogue is embarked upon by all\nparties with the resolve necessary to ensure a solution. It\ntherefore calls on all parties to forsake violence and to\nengage in this process of dialogue.\nThe European Union continues to be the major donor\nto the humanitarian and reconstruction needs of the region.\nIt welcomes the progress in rehabilitation in Rwanda, to\nwhich it contributes substantially, and it pays tribute to\nthe work of the United Nations in various sectors in\nRwanda.\nThe return of refugees and national reconciliation in\nRwanda will remain a priority for the Union. We will\nalso continue to support the International Criminal\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for\nGenocide and Other Serious Violations of International\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda\nand Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and\nOther Such Violations Committed in the Territory of\nNeighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December\n1994, to underscore our belief that the international\ncommunity must pursue and bring to justice those who\nhave perpetrated gross crimes against humanity.\nWe have begun this fifty-first session with a signal\nof hope. The signature at the United Nations today of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty shows this\nOrganization in its rightful place \u2014 seized of the deepest\nconcerns of humanity. This is the place which the\nfounders sought for the United Nations. This is the place\nwhich it is our responsibility to ensure that it firmly holds\nfor today\u2019s world and for the generations to come.\nLastly, and speaking solely in my capacity as\nForeign Minister of Ireland, I would like to inform the\nAssembly of developments in the Northern Ireland\nsituation over the past year. The search for a lasting peace\nand a comprehensive political settlement continues.\nSubstantial advances have been recorded in the past 12\nmonths, despite serious setbacks and despite the\nuncertainty and suspicion which still hamper the\ndevelopment of true reconciliation between the\ncommunities in Northern Ireland and between the main\ntraditions which share the island of Ireland.\nNegotiations involving the Governments and the\nparties began in June and resumed earlier this month. The\nstated purpose of these negotiations is to achieve a new\nbeginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within\nthe island of Ireland and between the peoples of these\nislands, and to agree new institutions and structures to\ntake account of the totality of relationships.\nThe Irish Government continues to base its approach\nto the negotiations on the fundamental principles set out\nin the 1993 Joint Declaration published with the British\nGovernment. As I indicated last year, A New Framework\nfor Agreement, published in 1995, represents the shared\n12\n\n\nassessment of the two Governments of a balanced and\nhonourable accommodation which might be envisaged\nacross all the key relationships. We shall in negotiations\nmake the case for a fair accommodation along these lines,\nbelieving as we do in the necessity of radical and ambitious\nchange on all sides. At the same time, agreement requires\nthe support of the political representatives in both\ncommunities, and must also command majority popular\nsupport in both parts of Ireland.\nWe continue to be firmly of the view that wholly\ninclusive negotiations, involving the representatives of both\ncommunities in their totality, offer the best prospect of\nachieving a durable settlement founded on a recognition of\nthe rights and aspirations of all. The Irish Republican Army\n(IRA), by terminating its cease-fire last February, not only\nperpetrated renewed death and destruction and flouted the\nwishes of the overwhelming majority of the people in both\nBritain and Ireland. It also obliged the two Governments to\ncease ministerial dialogue with Sinn Fein, which, because\nof the collapse of the cease-fire, is currently not a\nparticipant in the negotiations.\nThis is a matter of both regret and frustration. Sinn\nFein has a potentially valuable and constructive role to play\nin contributing to a stable and far-reaching settlement. But\npolitical dialogue is sustainable and productive only on the\nbasis of the principles of democracy and non-violence. That\nis why there must be an unequivocal restoration of the IRA\ncease-fire before Sinn Fein can enter the negotiations,\nwhich would be enhanced by their presence, as they are by\nthe continuing presence of the loyalist parties.\nLikewise, however, all of those truly committed to\nfinding an accommodation must impartially reject\nsectarianism and oppose disorder from whatever source if\nthey wish to create an atmosphere in which reconciliation\ncan flourish and agreement take root. The confrontation and\npolarization which occurred during the past summer in the\n\u201cmarching season\u201d, the consequences of which still vibrate,\nhighlight the absolute necessity of compromise and mutual\nunderstanding.\nThe instrument for progress is to hand in the Talks\nprocess under way, if we can persuade all the parties to use\nthe Talks process constructively. That requires the earliest\npossible transition to substantive negotiations. The Irish\nGovernment is working with the British Government to\npersuade the representatives of the unionist community to\nembark on this step without delay, secure in the knowledge\nthat the process already contains multiple safeguards,\nincluding the guarantee of popular referendum, to ensure\nthat the interests of their community must be respected in\nany agreed outcome.\nThe continuing support of the international\ncommunity is an invaluable asset on which we can draw\nin the search for a settlement. Most directly, the\nnegotiations benefit from the independent chairmanship of\nSenator Mitchell of the United States, former Prime\nMinister Holkeri of Finland, and General de Chastelain of\nCanada, whose skill and authority command the respect\nand confidence of all participants. In addition, I would\nlike to express my Government\u2019s gratitude for the\ngenerosity and support of all of our many friends in this\nAssembly, in particular the Governments of the United\nStates and of our European Union partners.\nThe wounds of conflict are still deep and unhealed\nin Ireland. We can be under no illusion but that the\nprocess of reconciliation and the crafting of an agreement\nwill be slow and painstaking. But we have continued to\nmake progress on that journey, and we are committed to\ncontinuing in our quest for peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI join all those who\nhave gone before me in congratulating you, Sir, on behalf\nof Mauritius, on your accession to the office of President of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-first session. I also thank\nMr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal for his skilful\nstewardship of the fiftieth session.\nHearing and reading the speeches of world leaders to\nthis Assembly, I am struck by the extraordinary degree of\nunanimity between them \u2014 how much we seem to agree in\nprinciple but how little on the right course of action; on the\nnecessity of diplomacy and discussion as the primary path\nto peace; on the necessity of according to every man,\nwoman and child the fundamental rights and freedoms\nwhich this Organization has, over the years, done so much\nto establish; on the necessity of providing equal\nopportunities for men, women and children in all our\nsocieties; on the necessity of protecting the environment;\nand on the need to ensure that mankind moves forward\ntogether on the path of development.\nIn all these noble and commendable aims we are\nunited. However, we often seem to suffer from a paralysis\nwhen it comes to actual implementation of these good\nintentions.\nThis Organization was the response of the human race\nto the catastrophic experiences of two world wars and to\nscientific discoveries and inventions which confronted us\nwith unprecedented choices. It was an expression of faith\nin the power of human beings to be rational in the face of\nthese choices and to choose the paths of peace and progress\ninstead of war and destruction.\nBut sometimes its voice has seemed very faint and\nfar off in the midst of the terrible troubles that have\nafflicted us since then. Some have begun to mutter of the\nineffectiveness of the institution and to complain of the\ncost. I am convinced that those criticisms do not begin to\nexpress the whole truth about the work that is done by\nthis Organization. We are embarked upon a great and\nnecessary experiment, and that is why the work of the\nSecretary-General is so important. Here I should like to\npay tribute to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose\ncontribution has been so valuable in recent years. It is\nparticularly appropriate that this great office should be\nfilled, as we move into the next millennium, by a\nrepresentative of Africa, for Africa remains the great\nintransigent challenge which the world has scarcely yet\nbegun to face. Only through the renewed and concerted\ndetermination of this Organization and the vision of\ncooperation and mutual responsibility which it represents\nis there any hope of successfully meeting the\nextraordinary difficulties which the next century will\nbring.\nDecade after decade, many of the nations of Africa\nhave seen their efforts at development frustrated by\nnatural and man-made disasters, poor governance and a\nhostile international environment. Foreign aid has not had\nthe desired impact on the progress of these countries, and\nthe poorer nations have accumulated huge and\nunmanageable debt which they labour, with inadequate\ntools, to support.\nAs the Assembly knows, of the 36 poorest countries\nin the world, as classified by the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme in the human development\nindex, 29 are in Africa. The majority of them have per\ncapita incomes lower than they were 20 years ago. The\ncountries of sub-Saharan Africa last year attracted only 3\nper cent of the foreign direct investment into the\ndeveloping world, compared to 20 per cent for Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean and 59 per cent for East Asia\nand the Pacific region. Life expectancy is placed at 50.9\nyears, the lowest among developing countries.\nAt the same time, a new and more demanding\ninternational economic order is emerging, one in which\nAfrica is beginning to feel overwhelmed and isolated\nfrom the mainstream of world economic development. If\nsome of its nations have not yet caught up with the\nindustrial revolution, what hope have they, unaided, of\nreaching the heights of the technological and information\nrevolutions which are sweeping the developed countries\nof the world towards new horizons.\n\n\n\nIf we are to bring Africa into the general march of the\neconomies of the world towards progress and prosperity, we\nmust begin, at the highest level, to coordinate and to chart\na course for Africa to join in. Piecemeal aid and occasional\nintervention on the occasion of awesome disasters will not\nbe enough.\nTherefore, we welcome the Group of Seven\u2019s\ncommitment in Lyon to a partnership for development and\nto the elimination of trade barriers to exports from\ndeveloping countries. These barriers must come down. But\nwe question whether this and private investment alone will\nbe sufficient. Swift and dramatic debt relief for countries in\nneed of it is essential. We welcome the lead provided by\nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\nin this regard, but it must be followed by decisive and\nurgent action. Measures should also be designed to promote\nthe growth of real democracy and good governance, for\neconomic prosperity must go hand in hand with democracy\nand the rule of law. It may seem temporarily otherwise. It\nmay seem that the creation of wealth can, for a while, be\nseparated from the yearning of the people and of\nindividuals to be free, but sooner or later the force of the\naspirations which prosperity brings will burst forth, as the\nwaters burst from the dam.\nSurely we must look with dismay at many areas of our\nworld in which human rights are discounted or denied. A\ncase in point is Myanmar, where a democratic vote, held in\n1990, has been defeated and denied by force, and where the\nhouse of the elected leader of the people is kept under\nconstant surveillance and surrounded by soldiers.\nMy Government will continue to support the cause of\ndemocracy and human rights in Africa and wherever in the\nworld such support is required. Mauritius will later this\nmonth host the twentieth session of the African\nCommission of Human and People\u2019s Rights, which\ncommemorates the tenth anniversary of its African Charter.\nThis session of the Commission will undertake, with the\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations and other\ninterested elements of civil society, an assessment and\nreevaluation of the implementation of the Charter and\nprepare a five-year plan of action which we are confident\nwill greatly help strengthen and improve the situation of\nhuman rights in our continent.\nMy country, whose only resources are the stability of\nits democracy and the enterprising spirit of its people,\ncomprises many races, cultures and religions. We look to\nEurope, Africa, the Far East and the Indian subcontinent for\nour cultural inheritance. Our people cross many divides.\nTherefore, we are able to witness and sense the impact of\nthe rapid development of the modern world upon these\ndifferent cultures and peoples more quickly, because we\nare a part of them. And I can tell the Assembly that what\nwe see gives us cause for concern.\nAs the old world order passes and a new one\nreplaces it, we are going through a period of transition\nfraught with pitfalls and dangers. We cannot but be\ndismayed at the number of countries that are falling prey\nto the ancient and deadly sirens of ethnicity and narrow\nnationalism that appeal to man\u2019s baser instincts of\nintolerance and xenophobic fear. Our continent of Africa\nseems particularly affected. Somalia and Liberia seem to\ndescend endlessly into chaos, while Burundi threatens to\nblow up again.\nWe are concerned by recent indications that parties\nto the Middle East peace process may be giving in to the\ntemptation of pandering to extremist fringes. We owe\npeace to this Holy Land and to the generations to come.\nWe owe it to the memory of two statesmen who laid\ndown their lives to this cause. The resolute pursuit of\npeace is the only way to defeat the assassins, those who\nfelled President Sadat and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.\nIn the Commonwealth family of nations to which we\nbelong, the uniqueness of which is its very diversity, a\nnumber of Member States are blighted by this affliction.\nMauritius fervently hopes that the sister island of Fiji\nwill soon be able to resume its rightful place in the\ncomity of nations by correcting the inequities written into\nthat nation\u2019s constitution in a moment of tension, when\nracist passions were unbridled. We would be pleased to\nshare with the people of Fiji our own constitutional\nexperience of a pluricultural society.\nIn my own country, only 10 months ago in a free\nand democratic election, the people voted overwhelmingly\nfor change. The Government has pledged to render our\ndemocratic process even more transparent and\nunequivocal. The numerous strategies and policy\nobjectives enunciated by the new Government at the\nbeginning of the current legislature, earlier this year, aim\nprecisely at confronting squarely the problems that we\nface on all the issues that I have broached. Our overriding\nobjective will be to ultimately make the economy work\nfor the people and not the people work for the economy.\nWhile a Government\u2019s overall objective is to\nimprove the well-being of the people, sound economic\n12\n\n\npolicies alone will not make our countries prosper. In order\nto create the right environment for the economy to flourish\nthere must be good governance. This is also a moral\nimperative. The history of mankind inevitably moves in the\ndirection of greater freedom, more transparency, wider\naccountability in all sectors of public life and greater access\nto information held by public agencies relating to citizens.\nMy Government is committed to a continuing process\nof democratization which will reinforce our institutions by\ncreating wider confidence in them. We are convinced that\nthis will create a climate more conducive to investment and\nwill enhance the creative and entrepreneurial spirit of our\npeople.\nWhile the pursuit of happiness has perforce to be\nindividual and private, it cannot be to the detriment of the\ncollective good. The protection of the environment is one\nendeavour that has to be undertaken collectively at the\nnational as well as the global level. Only if mankind as a\nwhole takes care to ensure the integrity of our planet can\nwe envisage a future for generations yet to be born. It is up\nto us to ensure the viability and ecological health of the\nplanet we shall bequeath to those who come after us. My\nGovernment will pursue on its own national territory a\nvigorous policy of conservation and rehabilitation of natural\nresources. Our actions at the national level will be matched\nby our contributions at the international and regional levels,\nin concert with all our partners, to advance on these same\nissues.\nThrough our membership in regional and subregional\norganizations, we are undertaking, in close partnership with\nneighbouring countries, to advance and promote the same\nobjectives that I have defined. Only one year after joining\nthe Southern African Development Community (SADC),\nMauritius has become an active member, putting its skills\nand knowledge in sectors where it has acquired valuable\nexperience at the service of fellow members.\nMauritius informed this Assembly last year that it had\ninitiated a process for the creation of a regional cooperation\nplatform in the Indian Ocean region. Indeed, the Indian\nOcean region was the only one in the world which did not\nhave such a platform to discuss the economic and social\ndevelopment policies of its countries in a coordinated\nmanner. I am pleased to inform the Assembly this year that\nthe Mauritius Indian Ocean Rim Initiative has gathered\nconsiderable momentum. The Initiative, which started with\nonly seven countries, has doubled its membership to 14\ncountries. A charter has been drawn up to provide the\nrelevant framework within which to develop and implement\nregional cooperation programmes. In addition, in contrast\nwith some existing regional blocs, it has adopted an\noutward-looking approach, so as to be compatible with\nthe multilateral system. The association has the\ndistinguishing feature of having adopted a tripartite\napproach comprising government, the private sector and\nthe academic community, to ensure as wide a consensus\nas possible.\nMauritius is convening a ministerial meeting in the\nfirst week of March 1997 to give political blessing to the\nIndian Ocean rim association for regional cooperation.\nThe Indian Ocean region can now serenely look forward\nto playing its role, as a serious regional partner in the\ninternational arena, in the effort to uplift the standard of\nliving of the peoples of the region. I am sure that the\ninternational community will lend its full support to this\nnascent regional grouping, in line with the often repeated\nappeal for South-South cooperation.\nWe have witnessed in recent years the growing\nsignificance of regional accords and blocs in determining\nand fashioning the orientation of multilateral financial and\ntrading systems and institutions. We believe that\nregionalization is a necessary step towards a more liberal\nglobal environment inasmuch as it allows the less\nendowed countries and regions with specificities of their\nown to experiment and to test the political, economic and\nsocial reforms of their programmes. A similar approach\nhas been adopted by the more advanced countries and\nregions, as evidenced by the emergence of the North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement and the consolidation of\nexisting groupings, such as the European Union and the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations, to mention just\na couple of them.\nIn addition, we have witnessed a new interpretation\nof the concept of regional blocs as purely geographical\nunits that make use of their own individual characteristics\nto experiment, and to test political, economic and social\nreforms programmes within a smaller geographical entity\nbefore challenges are confronted on a worldwide scale.\nRegionalization is increasingly being viewed by aid\ndonors and international financial institutions as a means\nto promote overall economic development and to create\nan enabling environment that will attract foreign direct\ninvestment in specific regions. This process has also\nchanged the way in which international businesses and\nmultinational corporations are restructuring their activities.\nImprovements in telecommunications facilities, the\nadoption of advanced technology for the transmission of\n13\n\n\ninformation in real time and the use of more rapid and\nreliable modes of transportation have all contributed to\ngiving regionalization a new dimension in political and\neconomic issues. Hence, the prospects for ensuring a more\nbalanced global development process are more real and\nattainable.\nThe decades-old partnership between African,\nCaribbean and Pacific (ACP) States and the European\nUnion through the Lom\u00e9 Conventions, the fourth of which\nwill come to an end in the year 2000, has served as an\nexcellent instrument for trading agreements between the\nAfrican, Asian, Pacific and Caribbean countries and the\nEuropean Union. This instrument has to a very large extent\nhelped in consolidating the links between the ACP States\nand the European Union. It has permitted the growth of\ntrade, economic, political, social and cultural development,\nfor both developed and underdeveloped countries. However,\nthe successor agreement to Lom\u00e9 IV will have to take into\naccount the changing pattern in world trade and the\nacquired benefits under the Lom\u00e9 Conventions, and in this\ncontext we shall wait for the publication of the green book\non the subject commissioned by the European Union.\nThe Sugar Protocol, which provides for guaranteed\nprices and quotas for the ACP sugar-producing countries,\nhas been instrumental to a large extent in the socio-\neconomic development of Mauritius.\nWhile I have addressed development issues mainly, we\nshould not overlook the crucial question of disarmament.\nThe principled stand of Mauritius in the field of\ndisarmament has always been to advocate a world free of\nnuclear weapons as well as chemical and other weapons of\nmass destruction. On the question of nuclear weapons, we\nonce again reaffirm our total commitment to nuclear\ndisarmament, and hope that the world community will make\nall efforts to secure unanimity around the views expressed\nin this Assembly by Member States that have some\ndifficulties with some treaty provisions. Furthermore, with\nregard particularly to the position of Mauritius on the recent\ndecision on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\nwe stood by the principle that we have always applied to\nother issues in the past, namely that of fairness and non-\ndiscrimination against any party. It is therefore imperative\nthat we give renewed momentum to the disarmament\nprocess in general, and address the flaws of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty urgently.\nIn order to meet the challenges of the next century, we\nbelieve that it is urgently necessary to pursue the reform of\nthe United Nations. It is vital that the Security Council\nshould be enlarged and made more representative and\nbalanced among its permanent members, and should\ninclude developing countries such as India. And it is\nequally imperative that the Working Groups of the\nGeneral Assembly should complete their task of\nproducing an effective and credible programme for\nreform. It seems to us self-evident that, after 50 years,\nsome revision and redesign is necessary. We think, with\nShakespeare,\n\u201cWhen we mean to build,\nWe first survey the plot, then draw the model;\nAnd when we see the figure of the house,\nThen we must rate the cost of the erection;\nWhich if we find outweighs ability,\nWhat do we then but draw anew the model\nIn fewer offices...?\u201d (King Henry IV, Part 2, Act I,\nScene 3)\nSome have come to this Assembly in order to\ncomplain that the world and the United Nations are not\ndoing enough. But we should inquire of ourselves first:\nWhat are we doing to advance or to hinder these causes\nupon which, in principle, there is such remarkable\nagreement?\nAfter this overview of the world situation, allow me\nto speak of a matter of national interest to us. One of the\nfundamental principles to which we all subscribe is that\nof respect for the sovereignty of Member States.\nInterference in the internal affairs of States and disregard\nfor their national sovereignty has often been a source of\ntension and conflict. Now that the cold war is behind us\nand we move towards ever greater economic, commercial\nand cultural integration, we should be able to find\namicable answers to questions of sovereignty. Mauritius\nhas sovereignty disputes regarding the Chagos\nArchipelago and Tromelin Island with two countries with\nwhich we have historically close and friendly ties. These\ndifferences were referred to as friendly disputes by\nSir Seewoosagar Ramgoolam, architect of our\nindependence and father our nation. We hope to resolve\nthese differences through quiet diplomacy and dialogue.\nThe cold war has died, but the need for peace and\nsecurity lives on. The state of affairs in the world today\nchallenges us but must not daunt us. Against this\nbackground, the principle of meliorism \u2014 that the world\nmay be made better by human effort \u2014 should prevail in\nour actions. Those who have the means and capabilities\nto help should not waver or shy away at the call of the\nUnited Nations.\n14\n\n\nThese are some of the ideas that I wanted to share\ntoday. It is my hope that we will all join in a global\npartnership for the achievement of a better and stronger\nUnited Nations at the service of the peoples in whose name\nwe stand here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt\ngives me great pleasure to convey to Mr. Razali Ismail\nthe heartfelt congratulations of the delegation of Niger on\nhis outstanding election to the presidency of the United\nNations General Assembly at its fifty-first session. His\nelection is testimony to the high esteem and prestige\nenjoyed by his country, Malaysia, in international affairs\nfor its contribution to the attainment of the ideals of our\nOrganization. It is also recognition of the fact that he is\na seasoned diplomat and a man of great experience.\nI extend my congratulations to the other officers of\nthe Assembly, and we assure Mr. Razali of the full\ncooperation of the delegation of Niger in the discharge of\nhis duties. I should like to convey to his predecessor,\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, our great\npleasure at, and our compliments on, the excellent job he\ndid during his presidency.\nThe President of the Republic of Niger, General\nIbrahim Ma\u00efnassara Barr\u00e9, reaffirms his unreserved\nsupport for and encouragement to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his tireless efforts for\npeace and development. As the Assembly knows, this\nsupport was demonstrated to the Secretary-General at the\nrecent Summit of Heads of State and Government of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), when my country\njoined the unanimous tribute to him.\nI know that my country\u2019s decision to propose one of\nour sons as a possible candidate for the post of Secretary-\nGeneral has given rise to much comment. Let me here\nmake it clear that Mr. Hamid Algabid, the candidate in\nquestion, is simply a \u201ccandidate for the candidacy\u201d. In\nother words, if in the coming weeks no veto opposes the\nre-election of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali as Secretary-\nGeneral, Africa would only stand to gain. It would be\nperfectly normal for a son of our continent, who is just as\nqualified as his predecessors, to enjoy, as they did, a\nsecond mandate at the head of our distinguished\nOrganization.\nThe annual session of the General Assembly gives\nmy country an opportunity to renew its faith in the ideals\nand principles of the United Nations Charter. The fiftieth\nanniversary of our Organization, which we\ncommemorated last year, gave us an opportunity to look\nat the progress made and to define the priorities on which\nwe should focus. Among those priorities is joint action by\nthe international community to reduce the economic\nimbalance between the nations of the North and the\nnations of the South. Unfortunately, the map of economic\n24\n\n\nand social development of the world contains a geography\nof contrasts and disparities, although there were reasonable\nhopes that the end of the cold war would facilitate the\nmobilization of the international community for\ndevelopment.\nEverywhere, and more specifically in the countries of\nthe South, poverty is the greatest threat to political stability\nand social cohesion. The destitution of the shanty towns,\nthe destitution of the street children, and absolute poverty\nare a disgrace to us all, and they will be as long as we see\nmarginalization as inevitable. As the Director-General of\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization, Frederico Mayor, stated so well:\n\u201cFrom poverty to marginalization, from\nmarginalization to exclusion: this is how the most\nfertile breeding ground for violence is created.\u201d\nIt is this violence which we must avoid, by offering\nbetter alternatives to the peoples to whom we are\nresponsible \u2014 most particularly in Africa. Indeed, this\ncontinent shows signs of being a land full of vitality,\ncapable of major economic achievements, if the\ninternational community gives us a chance and the\nresources. Accordingly, the commitments jointly entered\ninto in the United Nations New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s are as relevant as ever.\nAnd more than ever they require that greater efforts be\nmade for Africa by other members of the international\ncommunity.\nThe question of external debt, and in particular the\nquestion of multilateral debt, which was given special\nattention at the G-7 summit in Lyon deserves radical,\nurgent treatment. Niger fully supports the recommendations\nadopted at the mid-term review of the United Nations New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa. We welcome the\nlaunching on 15 March 1996 of the United Nations System-\nwide Initiative on Africa. We hope that this programme,\nwhich is in any case an important framework for\ncooperation, will make it possible to ensure sustainable\neconomic and social development in Africa.\nOfficial Development Assistance \u2014 quite rightly\nidentified as one of the main conditions for the\nrevitalization of the African countries \u2014 should be\nincreased to the level indicated in the resolutions adopted\non this subject. At the upcoming Singapore meeting of the\nWorld Trade Organization appropriate follow-up action\nshould be taken to ensure that the rights and interests of all\ncountries, and in particular of the African countries, be\nprotected. Likewise, the provision of technical and\nfinancial assistance to implement horizontal and vertical\npolicies to diversify exports will give African countries\nthe means for greater economic independence.\nSince the end of the cold war, our Organization has\ncertainly had some success in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. Among these successes\nwas the coming into being of a democratic and multiracial\nSouth Africa and the end of the disastrous war in\nMozambique. We have also made significant progress in\nthe peace process in Angola, in the crisis in the Middle\nEast and in the former Yugoslavia, in particular the\nholding a few days ago of elections in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. Niger is following closely the efforts\nundertaken by the authorities in Rwanda to overcome the\naftermath of the tragic events we all witnessed and in\nparticular to consolidate national reconciliation and lasting\npeace.\nThe situation in Liberia has seen a change for the\nbetter after the recent Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) summit devoted to that\ncountry. Niger supports the recommendations which\nemerged from it and has decided, despite our own\nfinancial difficulties, inter alia, to strengthen the structure\nof the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in\nLiberia by sending a contingent of about 500 men. My\ncountry believes, however, that these efforts will only be\nsuccessful with the valuable support of the international\ncommunity, which inter alia must honour its\ncommitments to this country.I take this opportunity to\ncommend the tireless efforts made in Liberia by Nigeria,\nthe great friend and brother of Niger.\nSomalia also deserves support. My country has been\nfollowing with great interest the evolution of the situation\nin Western Sahara and hopes for a resumption of dialogue\nbetween the two main protagonists there so that, in the\nnear future, efforts by made by the United Nations will\nfinally lead to the self-determination referendum which\nthe international community hopes to see. Concerning the\nsanctions imposed on Libya, Niger believes that the\nconstructive proposals made by the authorities of that\ncountry provide a serious basis for negotiations to resolve\nthat crisis, the consequences of which are adversely\naffecting the Libyan people as well neighbouring\ncountries.\nIn the Middle East, for three years now, considerable\nprogress has been made on the path to peace. Until\nrecently, President Arafat, living among his own people,\n25\n\n\nwas developing a dialogue with his former enemies that,\nwhile certainly difficult, was also useful. With the support\nof the international community, that dialogue must go on.\nBut unfortunately, since the return of the right wing to\npower in Israel, all hopes seem to have been dashed. Our\nOrganization must shoulder its responsibilities and do\neverything in its power to stop the Middle East from\nplunging into a new war with unforeseeable consequences.\nIf the State of Israel has the right to exist and to live in\npeace, the same goes for all States in the region \u2014\nbeginning with Palestine.\nNiger is similarly concerned about the serious situation\nin Jammu and Kashmir and hopes that the international\ncommunity will discuss it further. It is indispensable that in\nthat region of the world as well, and with the\nencouragement of all countries of good will, that wisdom\nand dialogue prevails, so that in the near future the people\nof Kashmir can finally exercise freely their inalienable right\nto self-determination.\nDisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction, including nuclear weapons, have a central\nrole to play in conflict prevention and the promotion of\npeace and economic and social development. This is why\nNiger renews its appeal for universal accession to\ninternational conventions and treaties that relate to weapons\nof mass destruction, and in particular to the cornerstone\ntreaty: the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons.\nFurther efforts should be made to control conventional\nweapons and, generally speaking, to establish confidence-\nbuilding measures among States. The signing of the Treaty\nof Pelindaba, on the creation of a nuclear-weapon free zone\nin Africa, was a source of legitimate pride. My country\nwelcomes the adoption here in New York of the important\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which finally puts\nan end to the fears of millions of human beings for their\nlives and for their environment. It is certainly a significant\nstep towards nuclear non-proliferation. Niger was among\nthe sponsors of the resolution submitted by Australia, and\nwill be signing the Treaty in the near future. We hope that\nthis stage, which puts an end to the risks of horizontal\nproliferation, will lead to a substantial reduction in existing\narsenals.\nFinally, as in previous years, my country will join in\ninitiatives to be taken to combat illicit trafficking in small\narms. It will also join the increasingly unanimous\ncondemnation by the international community of the\nmanufacture and use of those deadly devices: anti-\npersonnel landmines.\nThe building of a better world, which is our common\ngoal, is still dependent on the establishment of\ninternational relations based on the principle of\ncooperation and human solidarity. We have had major\ndiscussions on this subject: in Rio on the environment, in\nCairo on population, in Copenhagen on social\ndevelopment, in Beijing on the promotion of women, in\nIstanbul on human settlements, and soon, in Rome, on\nfood. All the concerns of humanity have been taken into\naccount in the many important recommendations which\nemerged from those conferences and which outlined a\nvision of a better world. We believe that only genuine\nhuman solidarity can transform that vision into reality.\nBefore concluding, I would like to provide an\noverview of the political solution in my country. Niger is\none of the African countries which, early on, chose the\npath of democracy. In less than five years, it has tried\neverything: a national conference, democratic transition,\nand free and transparent elections which established the\ninstitutions of our Third Republic. Following the dismissal\nof the Government by the National Assembly, and the\ndissolution of that Assembly by the President of the\nRepublic, the ensuing elections brought about the victory\nof the opposition and the establishment of a power-\nsharing regime marked by institutional instability in which\nthe higher interests of the country were sidelined. The\nresulting paralysis of State structures prompted the army\nto seize power. Understand me clearly: I have no wish to\njustify military coups d\u2019\u00e9tat. But in Niger, the putsch was\nthe lesser evil. At least that is how it was perceived by\nthe people of Niger, who spontaneously organized\ndemonstrations in support of the new regime.\nAs I speak to you now, Niger, having elected a new\nPresident, General Ibrahim Bar\u00e9 Ma\u00efnassara, is now\npreparing for legislative elections. The Government is\ndoing this in cooperation with the opposition, which only\nlast week finally agreed to hold discussions with the\nrepresentatives of the presidential party and to define with\nit the conditions for organizing future popular elections.\nThe two parties have agreed to abandon sterile polemics\nand to create the calm conditions so necessary to work\neffectively in the higher interests of Niger.\nThis shows that Africa in general, and Niger in\nparticular, is not allergic to democracy. But in the matter\nat hand, what my country wants is to be given the\nopportunity to build to its democratic system \u2014 based,\n26\n\n\nwithout question, on respect for human rights and\nfreedoms \u2014 at its own pace, taking into account its own\npolitical, economic, social and cultural context. And I\nventure here to say that one of the dominant features of\nAfrican culture is that we do not turn public administration\ninto a dichotomy between those in power and the\nopposition, between those responsible for running the\ncountry and those who are excluded from that process. In\nAfrica, we do everything together. We work together, we\neat together and we manage things together. Of course, in\nthe interest of the human community to which everyone\nbelongs, everyone should know his rightful place in this\nprocess and everyone should play the role he has been\ngiven.\nIn this regard, I would like to add that even just in\nour subregion, West Africa, there are several examples of\ncountries that have understood this process and that are\nfruitfully applying it on a daily basis. This is the case of\nSenegal and Burkina Faso. Let us try to find in our\nculture \u2014 or better in our cultures \u2014 all the elements\nthat can enable our countries to establish a viable,\nproperly adapted democracy, while also rejecting\ncategorically any kind of ready-to-wear democracy that\nmight be foisted upon us.\nIn conclusion, allow me to reaffirm Niger\u2019s faith in\nthe ideals of the United Nations and in its ability to find\nin the solidarity of all its Members appropriate responses\nto the new challenges facing humanity."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt\nthe outset and on behalf of my delegation, allow me to\ncongratulate Ambassador Razali on his election as President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-first session. Oman has\nlong enjoyed close friendly relations with his country,\nMalaysia, and we are confident that given his leadership\nand vast diplomatic experience our deliberations will\nreach a meaningful and successful conclusion, to which\nend we shall cooperate in every way.\nI would like to take this opportunity to pay special\ntribute to his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral,\nthe representative of the fraternal country of Portugal, for\nthe exemplary manner in which he steered the work of\nthe previous session.\nWe also wish to convey our sincere thanks and\nappreciation for the unwavering support of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He has enhanced\nand reinvigorated the role of the United Nations in all\nareas of interest, in spite of the problems and obstacles\nfaced by the international Organization as a result of its\nrecent financial crisis.\nOur celebration last year of the fiftieth anniversary,\nthe Nations golden jubilee, offered us a unique\nopportunity to review and contemplate the tremendous\nand substantial achievements of this body over the past\nfive decades, during which this international Organization\nhas made vigorous efforts to save the international\ncommunity from the scourge of war and to alleviate the\nsufferings of vulnerable peoples throughout the world. We\nare fully confident of the United Nations capability to\ndischarge the responsibilities entrusted to it in future by\nthe international community.\nAlthough the world widely considers the Middle\nEast to be a region of great significance, a comprehensive\npeace has not yet been achieved there. The international\ncommunity witnessed an important breakthrough with the\nconvening of the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference aimed\nat reaching a comprehensive and peaceful solution to this\nissue. Since then, concerted and positive steps have been\ntaken to achieve that long-awaited objective, such as the\nsigning of many agreements and conventions between the\nmain parties to the conflict, particularly on the\nPalestinian-Israeli and Jordanian-Israeli tracks. Such steps\nhave made the peace process in the Middle East more\ndeep-rooted and irrevocable.\nAll these attempts have been made through the\ncourageous and strenuous efforts of the concerned parties\nin the Middle East, with the help of international support\nand assistance. My country\u2019s contribution has included\nsupport and encouragement of these steps through its\ncontacts with the concerned parties at the bilateral and\nmultilateral levels of the peace negotiations, notably the\nagreement to establish commercial ties with Israel and\n19\n\n\nother accords with the Palestinian Authority, as well as the\nagreement reached by the group of founder countries to\nestablish a Middle East research centre for water\ndesalination.\nBecause of the procrastination and hesitation of the\nnewly elected Government of Israel fully to implement all\nprevious agreements, the peace process in the Middle East\nrequires, now more than ever before, the support of the\ninternational community.\nThe peace process in the Middle East is a mutual\nresponsibility of and full partnership between the Arab\ncountries and Israel. In a partnership, every party must reap\nthe fruits of peace or bear the risks and losses. Proceeding\nfrom this understanding, all parties must be treated on an\nequal footing. Furthermore, my country sees no justification\nfor Israel\u2019s continued blockading of the Palestinian cities,\nboth from the humanitarian point of view and because it\nundermines all relations between the Palestinian people and\ntheir Israeli counterparts, as was recently seen in the bloody\nconfrontations that occurred in Al-Quds following the\nopening of a tunnel by the Israeli Government at an Islamic\nholy site. Moreover, the expansion of hostilities at the\nexpense of the peace negotiations will serve no one but the\nenemies of peace and the supporters of confrontation and\nanimosity.\nGiven such unacceptable measures, my country\u2019s\nefforts to promote the principles of confidence-building and\nmutual cooperation in this area will be hampered and\ndelayed. We call upon the Government of Israel to close\nthe tunnel. At the same time, we hope that the summit to\nbe hosted today by President Clinton in Washington will be\nsuccessful.\nMy country calls upon Israel to assume its primary\nresponsibility for revitalizing the peace process by resuming\nthe peace negotiations and taking credible steps towards the\ntangible and practical implementation of all agreements\nreached in this regard. It also hopes that the progress\nachieved at the Madrid Peace Conference will have a\npositive impact on all tracks, including the Syrian-Israeli\nand Lebanese-Israeli tracks. We believe that it is high time\nfor the concerned parties to capitalize on the lessons of the\npast and work together in order to restore the momentum\nof peace and achieve a comprehensive settlement of this\nissue. In order to preserve the momentum of the peace\nprocess, my country will stand ready to extend every\npossible assistance and to take positive steps to enhance the\npeace process in the Middle East.\nMy country expresses its satisfaction with the\nsituation in Iraq in the aftermath of the recent events and\ndevelopments in the north of the country, which raised\ntensions and nearly destabilized the region again. We call\nupon all concerned parties to abide by international law\nand to focus on the implementation of the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions on Iraq, as well as to resume\nand activate the negotiations between the conflicting\nparties, in order to maintain the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of Iraq.\nOn the other hand, we welcome the memorandum of\nunderstanding signed between Iraq and the United\nN a t i o n s , a l l o w i n g I r a q t o i m p l e m e n t\nresolution 986 (1995). In our view, if implemented, that\nresolution will help alleviate the suffering of the brotherly\npeople of Iraq. While drawing the international\ncommunity\u2019s attention to the irrelevant linkage between\nthe implementation of the aforementioned resolution and\nrecent events in northern Iraq, and to the humanitarian\nappeals inside the country, we call on Iraq to cooperate\nfully with the United Nations in a manner that guarantees\nthe effective and swift implementation of this resolution.\nIraq is also requested to cooperate with the United\nNations in implementing other international resolutions on\nthe release of Kuwaiti detainees and properties and the\nnationals of other countries detained in Iraq, in the hope\nthat Iraq\u2019s full compliance and further cooperation with\nthe United Nations Special Commission on Iraq will pave\nthe way for the possible lifting of the international\nembargo and the restoration of peace and stability in the\nregion.\nWith regard to the question of disarmament, the\nUnited Nations has played an important role in diffusing\nthe threat of weapons of mass destruction and promoting\nan equitable balance between the regional Powers. My\ncountry has participated in the Commission on\nDisarmament\u2019s meetings on regional security as part of an\ninternational effort to reactivate peace negotiations in the\nMiddle East. While actively supporting the Commission,\nthe Sultanate of Oman would point out that such efforts\nalone cannot guarantee equitable security in the region if\nthey are not paired with other effective and practical\nmeasures to eliminate weapons of mass destruction there\nand to promote comprehensive and unconditional\nacceptance of international monitoring and inspection of\nall activities related to this matter.\nThe Sultanate of Oman was also among the first\ncountries to sign the Convention on the Prohibition of the\nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\n20\n\n\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction and the first\ncountry in the Middle East to ratify it. This is a clear\nindication of my country\u2019s distinctive role in enhancing\nsecurity and stability in the region and throughout the\nworld. Similarly, it is a great honour for me to announce to\nthis international forum the Sultanate\u2019s decision to accede\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT), in the hope that other countries that have not yet\ndone so will follow the same course before the end of the\nyear so as to ensure the Treaty\u2019s universality and to secure\na world free of all weapons of mass destruction in which\nall mankind can live in peace, love and prosperity. My\ncountry, like many others, voted in favour of this Treaty\nand, while we salute all who contributed to this major\nachievement, we call on the United Nations not to stop\nhere, but to continue its efforts to free the world once and\nfor all from all nuclear weapons and weapons of mass\ndestruction. We call upon the nuclear-weapon States in\nparticular to implement time-bound programmes in order to\nachieve this noble objective as soon as possible.\nWe would like to express our deep concern and regret\nvis-\u00e0-vis terrorist acts that target the lives of innocent\npeople \u2014 including children, women and the elderly \u2014 and\nviolate their legitimate right to live in peace and prosperity.\nThe international community should take immediate and\ncollective action to combat this phenomenon. We support\nall sincere and faithful efforts to convene an international\nconference to address and eliminate this problem and\nrelated aspects and to ensure that the perpetrators of such\nterrorist acts do not go unprosecuted and are brought to\njustice.\nThe Dayton Agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nsigned a year ago, has proved to be the optimal solution for\nputting an end to that tragic four-year war, which killed,\nwounded or displaced many Bosnians. My country\nwelcomes this historic Agreement and made every possible\neffort as a Security Council member and at regional and\ninternational forums to put an end to the suffering of the\nBosnian people and the atrocities committed against them\nand to restore security, stability and prosperity to all the\npeoples of the Balkans. We hope that the results of the\nelections held recently in Bosnia will pave the way for a\nbetter and prosperous future in which the people of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina can live in peace, tranquillity and\ncooperation.\nEffective participation in international and regional\nconferences on environmental issues is one of the ways in\nwhich the Sultanate of Oman is helping to improve and\ncoordinate its environmental policies. My country has\nplayed an active role in many of these conferences and\nhas hosted some as a contribution to increasing public\nawareness at the national, regional and international\nlevels. We are fully convinced that, through concerted\nefforts, the international community can preserve the\nenvironment and the world\u2019s ecosystems. We emphasize\nthe need for all countries to participate effectively in the\ninternational agreements and conventions aimed at\nconserving the ecological system, preventing\nenvironmental degradation, enhancing international\nscientific exchange and creating an international\ninformation network.\nIn Oman, we focus consistently on the development\nof human resources, the improvement of our technical and\nvocational education, the encouragement of the private\nsector and economic diversification. Our fifth\ndevelopment plan, initiated at the beginning of this year,\nhas several objectives, including the improvement of\ntechnical and vocational education in Oman, the\nencouragement of the private sector and economic\ndiversification and the establishment of an economic\nbalance conducive to foreign investment. We have also\nupdated our tax systems in accordance with an equation\nthat would establish a level playing field for foreign\ninvestments. A financial centre has recently been\nestablished in Muscat to deal with the activities of foreign\ntrade and investments in Oman. The commercial and\nregional economic groups have had a major impact on\ninternational efforts to expand the range of mutual\neconomic interests and influence the free flow of trade\nand investment throughout the world. In this context, my\ncountry has participated with its sister countries of the\nGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in exploring every\npossible means to promote and expand free trade and\ninvestment among these countries or between any other\ninternational groups.\nMy country has also participated actively in\nfounding a new economic group of the littoral States of\nthe Indian Ocean, including several African countries, to\ntrigger commercial activity among these countries,\ndevelop economic cooperation and maximize\nopportunities for the present and future investment and\nexploitation of their natural and human resources in the\nbest interests of their peoples. We are confident that the\nestablishment of such a new economic group, which\nembraces many countries with deep-rooted historic and\ncultural ties, will ultimately enhance cooperation between\nits member States and affect other economic factors, such\nas raw materials, human resources and energy.\n21\n\n\nHere I would like to talk about Africa. A number of\nAfrican countries are still suffering from the aftermath of\nthe cold war, which resulted in internal political turmoil and\ncrisis, leading to a decline in gross national products.\nAfrica\u2019s role is indispensable. We have to help it assume its\nnatural place on the international scene. We therefore call\nupon the United Nations and the international community\nto continue to extend assistance to Africa through further\ncooperation with all its regional organizations.\nTechnological progress has greatly speeded\ncommunications between countries and economic\nadvancement. My country welcomes the outcome of the\nsummit of industrial countries held last June in Lyon,\nFrance, at which these countries reaffirmed their solidarity\nwith the international community\u2019s efforts to solve the\nproblems and reduce the burdens associated with\nglobalization. Similarly, the developing countries should\nbenefit from the outcome of the Uruguay Round.\nThe developing countries are pushing to adopt market-\neconomy policies and undertaking further structural\neconomic reforms in support of free trade and investment.\nThey are also looking forward to the capital flows and\ntechnology transfers that can help strengthen their economic\nand social development, improve the quality of their\nproductivity and upgrade their services. This in turn will\nenable these countries to increase their development, widen\ntheir markets and enhance the international competitiveness\nof developing countries, creating a more independent world\nin which stability and prosperity will prevail.\nMy Government has already requested full\nmembership in the World Trade Organization (WTO). We\nhave been following its work for a year now. Our accession\nto WTO membership would be a big step for us. It would\nenhance our development, promote our services and\nupgrade our productivity standards to the fullest level\npossible. To that end, we must guarantee a reasonable\nbalance between our national interests and regional and\ninternational benefits. In this context, the Sultanate of\nOman, as a developing country, has been looking forward\nto receiving the global support and assistance which, under\nthe generalized system of preferences, the international\ncommunity extends to developing countries to help them\naddress the challenges posed by economic reforms and\nstructural adjustment. In both the short and long terms, the\ninternational community should continue to enhance this\nsystem.\nAs can be seen in its national legislation and norms,\nsuch as the national law of commercial signs and the\npatenting system which governs new inventions within the\ncountries of the GCC, Oman has played a commendable\nrole in protecting intellectual property. Furthermore, a law\nto protect copyrights and publications has been enacted\nin the general context of updating and improving the\nlegislation and norms of trade and investment in Oman.\nGiven Oman\u2019s support of the principles embodied in the\nnew global trend to protect intellectual property rights and\nits desire fully to participate and cooperate in this regard,\nmy Government has decided to accede to the World\nIntellectual Property Organization.\nAs we approach the twenty-first century, we are\nprompted by hope to continue to work and cooperate\ncollectively in maintaining international peace and\nsecurity to enhance life for the current and future\ngenerations. Such an objective cannot be achieved without\nthe firm commitment of the international community to\nreviewing and adopting clear economic guidelines for an\nurgent and serious approach to the establishment of a\npermanent, effective economic mechanism to deal with\nthis matter for the benefit of all of mankind. The United\nNations should assume the primary responsibility of\naddressing these great challenges and discharge in an\neffective manner the global duties entrusted to it by the\ninternational community.\nWe appreciate the complexity of the task of\nreforming the United Nations and its organs, but we also\nbelieve that it can be accomplished through the\nestablishment of dynamic and cost-effective mechanisms\nfor achieving selected goals and meeting the urgent needs\nof future development plans.\nWe support the Secretary-General\u2019s medium-term\nproposals for an objective strategy for the programmes of\nthe future work of the United Nations. In this connection,\nwe express our concern regarding the deterioration of the\nfinancial situation of the United Nations. We urge\nMember States to fulfil their financial obligations and\nthus enable the United Nations to carry out its functions\neffectively. We would also emphasize the responsibility\nof the Security Council \u2014 its permanent members in\nparticular \u2014 to their financial commitments to\npeacekeeping operations, in coordination with the various\nregional and international bodies of the United Nations,\nwhich collectively endeavour to secure appropriate\nsolutions to international conflicts. We call on the\ninternational community to accelerate its efforts to review\nand reform the administrative organs of the United\nNations in a manner that conforms to the global\naspirations and expectations of the forthcoming century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I wish\nto extend my sincere congratulations to His Excellency\nMr. Razali Ismail of Malaysia on his unanimous election\nto the high post of the presidency of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I also wish to express my appreciation\nto His Excellency Mr. Freitas do Amaral for his excellent\nstewardship of the historic fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly.\nThe current session is being held at a time when the\ncontours of a new international system are still being\nshaped. The twentieth century has witnessed the\ngeneration of enormous wealth. However, its distribution\namong regions, individual States and groups within States\nremains uneven. Scientific and technological\ndevelopments have led to great strides in the advancement\nof human society while they have posed potentially\ndisruptive threats to its survival. Trends towards\nglobalization and integration are accompanied by the\nforces of fragmentation and marginalization. The winds of\nsweeping democratic change have touched the greater part\nof the family of nations. By and large, the world today\nfinds itself at a momentous juncture, at a time of both\nopportunities and challenges.\nToday no country can afford to stay aloof from the\ntremendous transformations that are going on. In\nMongolia, this year ushered in a new era. As a result of\ngeneral elections held last summer, State power has been\npeacefully transferred to democratic political forces for\nthe first time in 75 years. This marks the logical\nculmination of the 1990 democratic revolution and lays a\nsolid foundation for stable democratic development. It is\n10\n\n\nalso a result of the simultaneous pursuit of both political\nand economic reforms.\nThe reform process is complex, time-consuming and\nchallenging. Mongolia is not alone in facing the challenges\ninherent in laying the foundations of an open, democratic,\njust and humane society and in creating conditions for\naccelerated social and economic development. Like many\nother developing countries undergoing fundamental\nchanges, Mongolia is faced with a host of problems: a low\nlevel of development, poverty, unemployment, an external\ndebt burden and an underdeveloped national economic\nstructure vulnerable to fluctuations on the world market. In\nspite of those hardships, the Government of Mongolia is\ndetermined to undertake decisive measures to speed up the\nreform process.\nThe Government of Mongolia, while preserving the\ncontinuity of its multipillared foreign policy, is resolved to\npursue an active, balanced foreign policy based on national\ninterests. Mongolia will continue its strong support for the\nmultifaceted activities of the United Nations as one of the\nmain pillars of its foreign policy.\nA few days ago the international community witnessed\na landmark event designed to attain the goal of a nuclear-\nweapon-free world. I refer to the adoption by the General\nAssembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nThis morning I had the privilege of signing the Treaty on\nbehalf of Mongolia. It is of paramount importance, in our\nview, that all the declared nuclear Powers and threshold\nStates accede to the Treaty so that the many years of hard\nwork that went into it may yield tangible results. With a\nview to contributing to an effective implementation of this\nimportant Treaty, Mongolia will actively participate in its\ninternational monitoring system.\nWe believe that the creation of more nuclear-weapon-\nfree zones in different regions of the world will contribute\nto the strengthening of regional and international peace and\nsecurity. Therefore, we commend and support the\nDeclarations of Africa and South-East Asia as nuclear-\nweapon-free zones. In 1992, Mongolia declared its territory\na nuclear-weapon-free zone, and I am pleased to note here\nthat the nuclear-weapon States, along with other countries,\nhave welcomed and supported our initiative. Mongolia\nintends to formalize and upgrade the status of the zone to\nthe international level. In a broader context, it is essential\nto provide assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States against\nthe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, in the form of\nan international instrument.\nThe advisory opinion of the International Court of\nJustice on the illegality of the use or threat of use of\nnuclear weapons, as well as the important\nrecommendations contained in the report of the Canberra\nCommission, could serve as a sound basis in further\nnegotiations on non-proliferation and nuclear\ndisarmament.\nWhile expressing Mongolia\u2019s satisfaction with the\nChemical Weapons Convention that will soon come into\nforce, I should like to stress the importance of its\nratification by States with substantial arsenals of chemical\nweapons so that the Convention can be more effective in\neliminating this type of weapon of mass destruction.\nTurning to regional issues, I should like to underline\nin particular our deep concern over the uncertain\nsituations in the Balkans and on the Korean peninsula.\nThe recent events in the Middle East are adversely\naffecting the peace process that is under way. We believe\nthat the parties concerned should exercise utmost restraint\nand resolve the problems by political negotiation, as\nenvisaged in the Madrid and Oslo agreements.\nThe peaceful advancement of the human family and\nits safety can no longer be assured in a world\ncharacterized by abject poverty, external debt burdens, a\ngrowing technological and economic gap between the rich\nand the poor, widespread hunger and malnutrition,\nincreasing violence and discrimination, crimes and drug\nuse. It would probably be axiomatic to say that no one\ncan ensure his or her own security at the expense of\nothers. However, merely acknowledging this fact can\nhardly help solve the problem. There must be real\ndetermination and political will, coupled with collective\naction, to face the challenges ahead.\nThe recent international conferences on children, the\nenvironment, human rights, population, social\ndevelopment and human settlements organized under the\nauspices of the United Nations have forged a clear vision\nand a forward-looking strategy for our common and\nconcerted action toward the betterment of the human\ncondition. Mongolia holds the view that this new\nframework for international development cooperation\nshould find its due reflection in the Agenda for\nDevelopment, which would ensure their integrated and\ncomprehensive implementation and follow-up. Vital, in\nthis regard, is a coherent coordination of the policies and\nactivities of the various entities of the United Nations\nsystem and those of the Bretton Woods institutions at the\nglobal and national levels.\n\n\n\nThe implementation of the decisions of the\naforementioned conferences requires genuine political\ncommitment on the part of the international community and\nits individual members to substantially increase the\nresources for sustainable human development. We believe\nthat mobilization of added financial resources can be made\npossible by reducing global military spending and capturing\nthe resultant peace dividend for human priority needs. Our\ncommon and shared future calls for the donor countries that\nhave not yet done so to honour their long-standing\ncommitment to the 0.7 per cent target.\nWe welcome and support the World Trade\nOrganization as a multilateral forum for defining an\ninternational trade policy aimed at coordinating and\npromoting the interests of countries with different levels of\ndevelopment. Mongolia will join this Organization shortly,\nwhich will allow it a greater involvement in world trade\nand economic integration. Likewise, Mongolia will actively\nendeavour to secure its proper place in the Asia-Pacific\nintegration, a region characterized by high economic\ndevelopment and overall political stability.\nHandicapped by their geographical location, the land-\nlocked developing countries face particular difficulties in\ntheir development efforts. Owing to their disadvantaged\nposition, they risk being further isolated and marginalized\nfrom the globalization process. In this connection, I wish to\nemphasize the practical importance of implementing the\nGlobal Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation\nBetween Land-locked and Transit-developing Countries and\nthe Donor Community, endorsed by the General Assembly\nat its last session.\nSouth-South cooperation has become a potential\ninstrument for accelerating the effective integration of\ndeveloping countries into the global economy. I believe that\nthe conference on finance, trade and investment to be held\nin Costa Rica next January will help to further enhance\nSouth-South cooperation by identifying its future priorities.\nWith the acceleration of scientific and technological\nprogress, the question of protecting the environment from\nmercantile human activities is acquiring an ever-increasing\nimportance. Effective international cooperation aimed at\noffsetting the adverse effects of industrialization on\ncountries, especially in environmentally sensitive regions;\npreserving their unique nature and ecosystems; shielding\nthem from natural disasters; and mitigating the damage\ninflicted is the order of the day. Furthermore, this requires\nan allocation of additional resources and their effective\nutilization. Elaboration of a national strategy for sustainable\ndevelopment, in line with the Earth Summit Declaration\nand Agenda 21, is well under way in my country.\nMongolia attaches particular importance to the special\nsession of the General Assembly scheduled for 1997 to\nreview the implementation of Agenda 21. In preparation\nfor that session, a study could be conducted on the root\ncauses of the considerable increase in natural disasters\nover recent years, as noted in the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral on the work of the Organization.\nToday, it is vital to foster respect for and compliance\nwith the norms of international law. In this regard,\nMongolia welcomes the establishment of the International\nSeabed Authority and supports the creation of an\ninternational criminal court. We believe that the\ninternational community should elaborate the guiding\nprinciples of conducting international negotiations \u2014 the\nmain instrument of bilateral and international diplomacy.\nMongolia fully shares the view that the United\nNations should be restructured, its activities modified and\ndemocratized, and its effectiveness and efficiency\nimproved along the lines of the objectives set forth in the\nDeclaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary\nof the United Nations. I hope that the ongoing\ndeliberations in the high-level Working Groups of the\nGeneral Assembly will result in the adoption of specific\naction-oriented recommendations that will make the\nUnited Nations better equipped, financed and structured\nto serve the ideals enshrined in the Charter.\nSecurity Council reform should be intensified\nthrough the introduction of greater transparency in its\nactivities and the democratization of its working methods.\nThe expansion of its composition must ensure the fair and\nequitable representation of various regions and groups of\nStates as well as its increased effectiveness and\nefficiency. It goes without saying that, in the final\nanalysis, this world Organization can be only as good as\nits Member States allow it to be.\nLess than four years separate us from the next\nmillennium. The time has come for resolute action. The\ntime has come to collectively undertake radical changes.\nThe time has come to fulfil the dreams of our forefathers\nto build a better future for our children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women achieved good results.\nAttempts are being made to overcome economic difficulties,\npromote development, and eliminate phenomena that\nthreaten the environment.\nIt is a good omen that this session is starting at a time\nwhen optimism is rising as a result of the progress achieved\nin settling the dispute in the Balkans. But if satisfaction at\nsuch happy developments has been widespread, concern has\ndeepened over the persistence of chronic disturbances and\nthe eruption of destructive civil wars. To confront these\nevents, which threaten international peace and security, the\ninternational community must exert greater effort to contain\nsuch disturbances and wars.\nIn this context, it is essential to remove the obstacles\nhampering the implementation of peace agreements in\nAngola and Liberia. A definitive solution must be\nimplemented for the ethnic disputes in Rwanda and\nBurundi. The brotherly people of Somalia continue to suffer\nfrom long-standing problems. They expect our support for\na reconciliation that would meet the needs of all Somalis\nand respond to their hopes and aspirations. An end should\nbe put to the suffering of the brotherly people of Iraq by\nlifting the sanctions, maintaining the unity and territorial\nintegrity of Iraq and desisting from premeditated attempts\nto impinge on its sovereignty and its freedom in decision-\nmaking.\nMy country is extremely concerned at the latest\ndevelopments in Iraq. The United States aggression against\nIraq is a violation of its sovereignty and an interference in\nits internal affairs. We have confirmed and confirm again\ntoday that Iraq has the right to territorial integrity and to\nexercise sovereignty over its entire territory. For the United\nStates of America to consider that Iraq\u2019s exercise of its\nsovereign rights constitutes aggression, at a time when Iraq\nis being subjected to United States aggression, is reverse\nlogic that must be denounced and condemned by the\ninternational community.\nThe conflict in the Middle East, with the question of\nPalestine at its core, has been among the priority issues at\nthe United Nations for more than half a century. Now,\ndespite all the talk about the peace process, the fact\nremains that the Palestinian people continue to be\ndisplaced from their homeland. Those who remain are\noppressed by the Israelis by collective siege and random\ndeportation, in total disregard of international\ndenunciation of such practices and in complete defiance\nof the international will, which supports the legitimate\nstruggle of the Palestinian people and calls for respect for\ninternational decisions calling for the full realization of all\nthe rights of the Palestinian people, in particular their\nright to return to their homeland and their right to self-\ndetermination.\nAs we have seen ever since the usurpation of the\nland of Palestine by the Israelis, the fact is that\noccupation and expansion have always been a constant\npolicy to realize israeli ambitions. Their settlement\nactivities increase daily. Their jails are filled with\nthousands of prisoners. Houses are demolished for no\nreason. Rash Israeli statements that the Palestinians have\nno right to a State of their own are often repeated, along\nwith acts of aggression against southern Lebanon. The\nIsraelis are also perpetuating their occupation of the\nSyrian Golan. They persevere in the judaization of\nJerusalem, including their designs to demolish the most\nimportant Islamic shrine, namely, the Holy Al-Aqsa\nMosque.\nThese Israeli actions prove that the Israelis do not\nwant peace. Their joining the so-called peace process is\nnothing more than a smoke screen to hide their attempts\nto impose their will on the Arab nation and make it bow\nin submission, thus setting a seal on their occupation and\ntheir sense of superiority.\nMy country has publicly declared that the current\nso-called peace arrangements will not lead to a genuine\nand lasting solution. Events have proved the validity of\nour analysis and the depth of our vision. Just, true and\ncomprehensive peace will not be achieved so long as the\nIsraelis are shedding the blood of the Palestinian people.\nPeace will not be sustainable under the shadow of Israel\u2019s\nnuclear terrorism and its obstinate denial of the legitimate\nrights of the Palestinian people. Peace can come only\nthrough the return of the Palestinians to their homeland\nand the establishment of an independent, democratic State\nin Palestine, with Holy Jerusalem as its capital and where\nPalestinian Arabs and Jews would live on an equal\nfooting \u2014 similar to what has happened in South Africa.\nAnything other than that solution would ignore historical\nfacts and lack realism, and would only lead to more\n20\n\n\nbloodshed and keep the area as a pocket of tension where\nnobody enjoys peace or security.\nFive years ago, three western countries \u2014 the United\nStates of America, Britain and France \u2014 accused Libyan\ncitizens of involvement in the Pan American flight 103\naccident and the incident involving the French union de\ntranports a\u00e9rens (UTA) flight 772. Despite the fact that\nthose who unleashed those accusations never submitted any\nproof or evidence to support their claims, my country has\ndeclared its readiness to uncover all the facts related to the\ntwo incidents. We started an investigation of those whom\nthe American and the British authorities claim are involved\nin the Pan American flight 103 incident.\nMy country has also called on the authorities in these\ncountries to assist with the investigation. Instead of\nresponding to this request, which falls within the legal\nframework of the dispute, the three countries have fully\npoliticized the problem, resorted to the Security Council\nand imposed Council resolution 731 (1992). Despite all this,\nand out of our keen desire to settle all aspects of the\ndispute, the Jamahiriya announced its acceptance of that\nresolution and took practical measures in response to it.\nThe Jamahiriya has condemned international terrorism\nin all its forms and has declared its commitment to any\nmeasures to be decided by the international community to\ncombat terrorism. Libya\u2019s vehement determination to secure\nthe total eradication of terrorism is reflected in the civilized\nproposal contained in document A/46/840, which calls for\nthe convening of a special session of the General Assembly\nto study the causes and dimensions of this phenomenon and\ndevise the means that would eliminate it.\nThe Jamahiriya has also cooperated with the\nGovernment of the United Kingdom in uncovering the\nelements accused by Britain of involvement in terrorist acts.\nIn the statement, circulated in document S/1995/973 of 20\nNovember 1995, the British informed the Security Council\nthat Libya\u2019s answers to their queries about the relationship\nwith the provisional Irish Republic Army were satisfactory\nand conformed with their expectations.\nFurthermore, Libya has cooperated with the French\ninvestigating magistrate who visited Libya during the period\n5 to 16 July 1996. During that visit, the Libyan authorities\nprovided him with all the facilities he needed to conclude\nhis mission. Later, French statements paid tribute to the\npositive cooperation of the Libyan authorities with the\nFrench magistrate.\nThe Jamahiriya has proposed several solutions for\nthe trial of the two Libyans suspected of involvement in\nthe United States plane\u2019s accident. It has proposed that\nthe two stand trial before a court whose venue should be\nagreed upon. Libya has also proposed recourse to the\nInternational Court of Justice after the United States and\nBritain refused to apply the Montreal Convention for the\nSuppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil\nAviation of 1971, despite the fact that both countries are\nparties to the Convention. Libya has also accepted the\nproposal submitted by the League of Arab States, which\ncalls for trying the two suspects at the headquarters of the\nInternational Court of Justice in The Hague, before\nScottish judges and under Scottish law.\nThese proposed solutions which were either\nsubmitted or accepted by the Jamahiriya have been\nconfirmed on more than one occasion and before several\nforums, including this Assembly. This is a sufficient\nresponse to those who claim that Libya refuses to permit\nthe trial of the two suspects, and especially to President\nClinton, who said in his statement on 23 September that\nLibya refuses to surrender the persons responsible for the\nexplosion of Pan American flight 103. Libya has no\nobjection to the two suspects standing trial. The only\nthing that Libya wants is to guarantee them a neutral and\nfair trial, free from any media or political influences. We\nask this especially because officials in both Britain and\nthe United States, in their statements, have claimed that\nthe two Libyan citizens are guilty and should be punished,\nindicating that a conviction is pre-ordained before any\ninvestigation and before any court appearance.\nThe Jamahiriya\u2019s handling of the dispute has been\nwidely supported internationally and by Arab and African\ncountries. The Organization of the Islamic Conference has\ndeclared its solidarity with our position. The Movement\nof Non-Aligned Countries supported it at Jakarta and\nreaffirmed that support at Cartagena. It was also strongly\nsupported by the Arab Summit at Cairo. The Organization\nof African Unity has repeatedly supported it, from the\n1993 Cairo Summit through the latest Summit at\nYaound\u00e9.\nWhen the three countries were confronted by these\npositions, which confirmed the firm conviction that Libya\nhas indeed responded to the requirements of Security\nCouncil resolutions, they started to drag other issues far\nremoved from the dispute and its context. Both Britain\nand the United States are trying to evade responsibility\nfor fabricating the problem. They have been attempting to\ndepict the dispute as one between Libya and the\n21\n\n\ninternational community. Is this not a reversal of the facts?\nHow can the dispute be one between Libya and the\ninternational community, when international support is\nincreasing daily for the Libyan position? This support is\nembodied in the support of regional and international\norganizations, the population of whose members exceeds\ntwo thirds of the world\u2019s population.\nThose two Governments have now come up with a\nnew lie. They say that Libya is defying international\nlegality. The facts totally refute this. Libya is one of the\ncountries most committed to international law. Proof of this\nis its implementation of the verdict of the International\nCourt of Justice in its territorial dispute with Chad, even\nthough this was not in our favour. Furthermore, officials in\nthose two countries claim that Libya is not a peace-loving\nState. This is another lie. The Jamahiriya is a peace-loving\ncountry. It believes in peace and practices it. Its role in the\npeaceful settlement of disputes between States has been\nembodied in its active role in trying to achieve\nreconciliation between Sudan and Uganda. It has also been\nreflected in its successful efforts at reconciling the\nPhilippines and the Moro National Liberation Front.\nRaising what has become known as the Lockerbie\ncrisis falls within the context of these false allegations and\nfabricated accusations. It confirms a fact that we have\nstated right from the beginning: that this is a premeditated,\nfabricated problem aimed at punishing the Libyan people\nfor certain principles in which they believe and certain\npositions they defend. It is as if those who created this\ncrisis were not content with the difficulties and pains which\nthe Libyan people have already suffered at the hands of the\ncolonialists and the fascists who, on our territory, fought a\nwar that killed and displaced hundreds of thousands of\nLibyans, and planted in their farms and under their homes\nmillions of land mines which still kill innocent people and\nimpede Libya\u2019s efforts to protect the environment, combat\ndesertification, and expand in the fields of economic and\nsocial development.\nIf the aim behind the fabrication of the crisis was not\nto punish us for certain principles we uphold and certain\npositions we defend, why did the two countries refuse from\nthe start to apply the relevant international convention \u2014\nthe Montreal Convention? Why did they drag the Security\nCouncil into this legal problem, which has nothing\nwhatsoever to do with its functions? Why did they hasten\nto impose sanctions on us only two months after the start\nof this crisis? How did these countries accord themselves\nthe right to participate in the voting on Security Council\nresolution 731 (1992), in contravention of Article 27 (3) of\nthe Charter? Why do the British and American\nGovernments reject any initiative to settle the dispute by\ndialogue and negotiation? What is the justification for\ntheir intransigence in rejecting the proposal of the League\nof Arab States that was accepted by Libya? Why do these\nStates insist on accusing our citizens when new facts have\nbeen uncovered and published in several books and\nnewspapers refuting their claims and confirming that the\nincident was planned by professional intelligence services\nto coverup certain suspicious activities? Also, why did\nthese States push the Security Council to adopt a double\nstandard, imposing sanctions on Libya under Chapter VII\nof the Charter when it did not threaten anybody or in any\nway compromise international peace and security. At the\nsame time, these countries prevented the Security Council\nfrom applying the same Chapter to a major power that\nsent hundreds of its war planes to attack our country and\nbomb our cities while their residents lay sleeping in their\nbeds? This same big Power still practises State terrorism\nagainst us, freezing our financial assets and imposing\nunilateral sanctions on us, refusing to respond to General\nAssembly resolution 41/38, which calls on it to\ncompensate our people for the losses they suffered as a\nresult of its brutal aggression against us in April 1986.\nThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has sought to settle the\ndispute. All it has asked for is that it be settled in\naccordance with the principles of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations and the rules of international law. My\ncountry is satisfied because its handling of this crisis was\nsupported by most countries of the world. And here I\nwould like to pay tribute to the members of the Non-\nAligned Movement, the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, the Organization of African Unity and the\nLeague of Arab States for their appreciation of our\nposition and their understanding of our earnestness in\nseeking a quick and just solution. In particular, we would\nlike to thank members of the Security Council who\nappreciated our response, tried to do us justice and sought\nto lift the unjust sanctions imposed on us.\nThe magnitude of the suffering of the Libyan people\nunder the sanctions has been detailed in document\nS/1996/717. Suffice it to say that the sanctions have so\nfar resulted in the deaths of 3,340 persons in road\naccidents. More than 12,000 persons have suffered serious\npermanent injuries because of these accidents. Moreover,\nthe sanctions have cost more than $18 billion in material\nlosses.\nThere is no excuse for condoning such injustice, and\nthe continuation of this injustice is wrong. Most countries\n22\n\n\nof the world have repeated their calls for an accelerated\nsolution of the Lockerbie crisis, in accordance with\ninternational laws and conventions. The Jamahiriya has\naccepted that. The obstacle lies in the blind intransigence\nand illogical demands of the American and British\nGovernments. Should the two Governments persist in their\nuncompromising positions, refuse to settle the dispute in a\nspirit of justice and fairness, and relieve the suffering our\npeople have endured for more than four years, the only\nthing left to the Libyan people would be to appeal to those\nin this forum with clean consciences to intensify their\nefforts in order to expose the unjust practices exercised by\nthe United States and Britain to extend the duration of the\nblockade imposed on a small people. Members of this\nAssembly should implement the decisions taken by the\nHeads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned\nMovement in Cartagena, by the Arab Heads of State at the\nCairo summit and by the African Heads of State in the\nYaound\u00e9 summit not to continue compliance with the\nsanctions resolutions. They should also consider possible\nways of sparing the Libyan people more losses if the\nwestern countries persist in rejecting initiatives for a\npeaceful solution.\nThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya attaches the utmost\nimportance to the establishment of security and the\nenhancement of cooperation in the Mediterranean region. It\nreaffirms its conviction that stability in this area will be\nrealized only through an end to military exercises in the\nMediterranean, the closure of foreign military bases, the\nwithdrawal of foreign fleets and the development of a\nsound formula, refuting the policy of exclusion, that would\nenable the Mediterranean countries to contribute to the\nenhancement of their security and the promotion of\ncooperation. By virtue of its distinct location in that region\nand the stability it enjoys, the Jamahiriya can play an\nimportant role in strengthening security in the\nMediterranean by reducing migration from the southern\ncoastal States to the North and the elimination of\ndestructive movements that exploit and have been\nrepudiated by Islam for undermining the stability of a\nnumber of littoral countries of the Mediterranean. The\nJamahiriya would be able to play a bigger role in these\nfields if the sanctions imposed on it were lifted and external\nattempts to undermine its security and stability were to\nstop.\nMy country supports the non-proliferation of nuclear\nweapons as a prelude to prohibiting and destroying all\nweapons of mass destruction. We welcome the international\ntreaties and conventions concluded with a view to\ncontrolling these destructive weapons and their ultimate\nelimination. In particular, my country welcomes the\nconclusion of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone\nTreaty. However, we believe that other measures should\nbe taken to guarantee the total eradication of weapons of\nmass destruction, including a timetable for the destruction\nof these weapons. It is necessary to take drastic and\npunitive measures with regard to a major nuclear power\nthat transported nuclear material to its own territory and\nstill procrastinates in disposing of it under international\nsupervision. It is also highly important to formulate an\ninternational instrument guaranteeing the security and\nsafety of non-nuclear States. The Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty recently approved by the General\nAssembly falls short of the aspirations of the peoples of\nthe world to a total ban on all nuclear tests. As\nformulated, the Treaty merely perpetuates the status quo.\nIt could even pre-empt efforts aimed at achieving a world\ntotally free from nuclear terror. In the context of other\nsteps that should be taken to eliminate nuclear weapons,\nit is essential to take serious international measures to\nguarantee the universality of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nThe Jamahiriya has a special interest in this question\nbecause the region in which we live is greatly threatened\nby the fact that the Israelis possess terrifying nuclear\nweapons with over 200 nuclear warheads. They also have\nnuclear facilities that they refuse to place under\ninternational control. What adds to our concern is the fact\nthat, in addition to the Israeli nuclear terror which\nthreatens the lives of the residents of Arab cities and\nvillages every day, a major nuclear Power not only turns\na blind eye to this terror, but even works to develop and\nenhance it. This same major Power threatens any Arab\ncountry, even if it was merely building a pharmaceutical\nproduct factory under the pretext of saving the world\nfrom chemical weapons.\nThe existence of the Israeli nuclear arsenal cannot be\ntaken lightly or condoned. If the international community\nis truly keen to ensure the security and stability of our\nregion, it should take measures to guarantee Israel\u2019s\naccession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons and the placing of their nuclear\nfacilities under the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s\nsafeguards system. There must also be a timetable for\ndismantling their nuclear stockpiles. Should the failure to\nforce Israel to do that continue, it would be legitimate for\nthe countries in the area to acquire, in self-defence, means\nto guarantee their safety and enable them to face the\nIsraeli nuclear threat to their very existence.\n23\n\n\nThe world has witnessed colossal changes. If we are\nto adapt to these changes, we must restructure the United\nNations to make it better able to respond to international\nneeds and to meet the interests and wishes of Member\nStates.\nMy country has followed the negotiations aimed at\nstrengthening the United Nations system and at reforming\nthe Security Council. We believe that this process, pursued\nby Member States for some time now, should be\naccelerated and concluded, resulting in measures that could\nenhance the powers of the General Assembly, including on\nmatters of international peace and security.\nWe urge that the negotiations lead to steps that would\nenable the Security Council better to carry out its mandate,\nin conformity with the principles and purposes of the\nCharter. Any increase in the membership of the Security\nCouncil should be based not on a selective approach, but on\nthe principles of the sovereign equality of States and\nequitable geographic distribution, taking into consideration\nthe interests of the developing countries that constitute the\nmajority of United Nations Member States. The veto\nprivilege, which has become the focus of interest of most\ncountries, should be at the core of the reform process.\nThere is no longer any justification for maintaining this\nprivilege. The new international arena needs a democratic\nSecurity Council, not one in which the few enjoy\ndiscriminatory rights. My country, which has been in the\nforefront of those calling for the abrogation of the veto\npower, once again urges that the measures aimed at\nreforming the Security Council include arrangements\nultimately leading to the elimination of this privilege, which\ncontradicts the principle of sovereign equality of States and\nalso runs counter to democracy. Preserving it would impede\nthe Organizations\u2019s efforts to maintain and preserve\ninternational peace and security.\nThe world cannot be secure until its economic\nproblems and development are addressed. Looking at the\ninternational scene, we find that the economies and level of\ngrowth of most developing countries continue to languish.\nIt is no exaggeration to state that these conditions may\ndeteriorate further if effective measures are not taken to\nreverse them. The Charter of the United Nations is\nanchored on two basic pillars: the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and international\ncooperation for economic and social development. The\nclose connection between the two pillars requires the United\nNations to strive to achieve both equally.\nWe believe that no sound international economic\nenvironment can be possible without a true world\npartnership for development. This requires that North-\nSouth dialogue be resumed and that the developing\ncountries be enabled to participate effectively in making\ndecisions affecting international economic conditions. In\nthis context, commitments for promoting development in\ndeveloping countries should be undertaken in a realistic\nmanner that would end trade protectionism against the\nexports of developing countries, lift restrictions on the\ntransfer of technology to them and ensure the payment of\nremunerative prices for their commodities.\nIt is essential that special priority be given to the\neconomic situation in Africa and to the implementation of\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\nAfrica in the 1990s. The western countries have a moral\nduty to help end underdevelopment in Africa, given the\ncontinent\u2019s suffering under colonialism, when its wealth\nwas plundered by these countries, which stole its natural\nresources and denied it opportunities for development and\nprogress.\nAs part of the efforts of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\nin the areas of economic development, environmental\nprotection, expansion of agrarian reform and the provision\nof drinking water, the Libyan people, in the midst of their\njoy at the start of the twenty-eighth year of the 1\nSeptember revolution, have celebrated the conclusion of\nthe second phase of the Great Man-Made River Project,\nwhose waters have reached the city of Tripoli, where\nthere is a dense population and arable land. The Libyan\npeople have realized this achievement despite the ongoing\nembargo and the coercive economic practices imposed on\nit for over a decade. These measures were recently\ntightened by a law whose provisions are applicable to the\ncompanies of States that deal with us. This constitutes a\nflagrant violation of the purposes of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations and an intentional disregard for the rules\nof international law. It is also a clear contradiction of the\nAgreement establishing the World Trade Organization.\nMy country has followed with keen interest the\nreactions of anger and denunciation following the\nenactment of that law. We would like to express our\nsatisfaction at the inclusion of an item on this matter on\nthe General Assembly\u2019s agenda for this session. We hope\nthat member States will discuss this question, study it\ncarefully and ultimately adopt a measure to thwart this\nlaw, through which the United States of America is\nattempting to impose its laws on the international\ncommunity. This Assembly should take the necessary\n24\n\n\neffective measures to end all coercive economic\narrangements being imposed on a number of developing\ncountries, in implementation of the General Assembly\nresolutions prohibiting any country from enacting extra-\nterritorial laws or resorting to coercive measures to force\nanother country to relinquish the exercise of its sovereign\nrights.\nThe next century is but a few years away. Before it\nbegins, all the members of the international community\nshould use the remaining time to eliminate all remnants of\nrecent decades, which were characterized by tension and\nconfrontation. As we enter the third millennium, we should\nlive in a world governed by a system based on justice,\nequality and respect for the political and economic choices\nof peoples. Such a system should embody full commitment\nto international law and the principles and purposes of the\nUnited Nations. It must protect and enhance human rights\nand strengthen efforts aimed at eradicating poverty,\nsuffering, discord, conflicts, disputes and wars. It should be\na system in which no country can aspire to hegemony or\nabuse its influence, a system that supports the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes. It should give all peoples the\nopportunity to look to the future with optimism.\nThe United Nations remains the most valid forum and\nthe best tool for building a world consensus in this respect.\nLet us reform and strengthen this Organization so that it\nwill be able to meet these requirements, all of which\nemanate from its aims and purposes \u2014 the establishment of\npeace and security, and the promotion of economic and\nsocial development in the interests of progress, welfare and\nprosperity for future generations.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPlease accept my\ncongratulations, Sir, on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. The Brazilian\ndelegation is confident that, under your leadership, this\nbody will find new strength in the pursuit of the\nprinciples and purposes of our Charter.\nI also wish to pay tribute to my dear friend, Mr.\nDiogo Freitas do Amaral, for the dedication with which\nhe conducted the historic fiftieth session. We are grateful\nfor his steadfast commitment to ensuring that our work\nwas consistent with the high expectations of the fiftieth\nanniversary celebrations.\nMy delegation extends a word of gratitude and\nrecognition to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali,\nfor the perseverance he has shown in carrying out his\ntasks.\nFor the first time, Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde,\nGuinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal and Sao Tome and\nPrincipe come to the General Assembly as members of\nthe Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, a body\ndedicated to cooperation and political coordination. The\nmember States of the Community intend to consult and to\nwork closely together at the United Nations with a view\nto better promoting their common interests and fostering\ntheir linguistic, cultural and historical identity.\nThe countries of the Southern Cone Common Market\n(MERCOSUR) \u2014 Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and\nUruguay \u2014 have also come to the General Assembly\n\n\nwith an enhanced sense of unity. MERCOSUR gives living\nand concrete expression to economic integration and open\nregionalism and represents one of the creative forces at\nwork in the Americas. It is a new and striking feature of\nour continent\u2019s identity and a reflection of democracy and\nthe commitment to economic reform in our region.\nWith the customs union firmly in place, Chile has now\njoined MERCOSUR as an associated State by means of a\nfree-trade agreement with far-reaching political and\ndiplomatic implications. Bolivia will also shortly associate\nitself with MERCOSUR. We look forward to other\ncountries\u2019 of the region joining as well to further bolster the\ndynamic and open nature of MERCOSUR.\nNow firmly rooted in the process of expanding and\nacting as an important partner of a growing number of\ncountries and regional groups, MERCOSUR is a positive\nresponse by South American countries to the challenges and\nopportunities of today\u2019s world. Such achievements as\nMERCOSUR and the Community of Portuguese-speaking\nCountries enhance their credentials and help to make the\npresence of those countries in the world an instrument for\neconomic development and social progress.\nMy country comes to this General Assembly proud to\npresent itself before the international community with a\nstronger presence in the world. Brazil owes this to the\nconsolidation of its democracy, to economic stabilization\nand liberalization and to the resumption of economic\ngrowth with a deeper sense of social justice. It owes this as\nwell to its participation in regional integration and in the\nglobalization of the world economy. We are in tune with\nthe two main forces that are shaping the world today:\npolitical and economic freedom, on the one hand, and\ncooperation through integration and trade on the other.\nI am pleased to say that, through decisive action rather\nthan words, we have made genuine strides in enlarging our\ndialogue and cooperation with friendly nations worldwide,\ndeveloped and developing alike. We have strengthened\ntraditional partnerships and established new ones, especially\nin Africa, Asia and the Middle East. We are aware that, if\nthe Brazilian people are to consolidate these achievements,\nwe will need to persevere in the policies that have brought\nus this far. We know that these policies have yet to meet\nmany challenges Brazil faces in the social, economic and\ncultural fields. But they are an important beginning.\nWe are convinced that Brazil\u2019s growing interaction\nwith its region and the world, the consolidation of its\ninternational partnerships and a fruitful dialogue and\ncooperation with its many friends are necessary conditions\nfor our country to continue to pursue its policies at the\ndomestic level.\nBrazil is one of the world\u2019s largest democracies, a\ndynamic and diversified developing economy, an\nattractive opportunity for productive foreign investment\nand a market of huge potential \u2014 in a word, a country\ncapable of enjoying fruitful ties with all nations on the\nbasis of mutual respect and reciprocity. By its very\nnature, Brazil can act as a bridge between the many\ndifferent worlds that make up its own internal reality.\nOur aspirations to enlarging the scope of our\nparticipation in the international decision-making bodies\nwill always reflect a careful assessment of our own\nmerits, of our specific weight and of the contribution that\nwe can make to the community of Nations. We seek to be\na force for peace and integration.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\nunderstandably raised the expectations of the international\ncommunity \u2014 expectations that we would not dwell only\non the past and on the many achievements of the\nOrganization, but also look to the future in search of\nways for it to come to grips with new realities and\nproblems.\nWe can confidently say that the celebration of the\nfiftieth anniversary produced good results. As world\npublic opinion was focused on the United Nations, leaders\nand Governments were compelled to reflect on the\nOrganization and to make room for it in their political\nagendas.\nThe historic meaning of the San Francisco Charter\nwas recalled, as was the importance of the United Nations\nas a forum for political debate and as a sounding board\nfor conflicting interests in the post-cold-war era.\nOur collective reflection clearly revealed that,\nwithout the United Nations, the world would only have\nbeen more violent, more unstable and insecure, more\nunjust and cruel \u2014 especially to the weak, who are prey\nto power politics and arbitrary decisions.\nWe celebrated great advances in international law\nand in the political and ethical commitments to the issues\nthat concern humanity \u2014 issues such as sustainable\ndevelopment, protection of the environment, respect for\nhuman rights, disarmament, non-proliferation and the fight\nagainst poverty, terrorism, organized crime and drug\n2\n\n\ntrafficking. We have thus given a positive account in the\nfirst 50 years of the United Nations.\nWe cannot say with the same confidence that the\nfiftieth anniversary has ushered in a renewed commitment\nto the United Nations and its future. Our efforts have fallen\nwell short of the expectations of the international\ncommunity. They have been disappointing even in the light\nof the predictions of some of the most cautious analysts. A\nstalemate persists \u2014 an uncomfortable stalemate that leads\nto a feeling of uncertainty and frustration, of insecurity\nabout the future of the United Nations, and thus of\napprehension.\nIn the wake of momentous changes on the\ninternational scene, the United Nations has embarked upon\na new phase in its history without the means and the\neffectiveness to act as the highest political forum of\nmankind and to fulfil the mandate conferred upon it by the\ninternational community \u2014 a mandate that remains as valid\ntoday as it was half a century ago.\nBack in 1961, President John F. Kennedy referred to\nthe United Nations as \u201cour last, best hope\u201d. In the face of\nthe threat of nuclear war and in the midst of various\nconflicts, those words expressed the confidence of the\ninternational community in an Organization founded on the\nuniversal principles of peace, understanding and prosperity\nfor all peoples.\nAt that time President Kennedy renewed a pledge to\nthe United Nations, offering:\n\u201cour pledge of support \u2014 to prevent it from becoming\nmerely a forum for invective, to strengthen its shield\nof the new and the weak and to enlarge the area in\nwhich its writ may run.\u201d\nThirty-five years after these inspired words, the United\nNations finds itself at a crossroads. The world has changed,\nthe correlation of forces has changed, and so have the\nhopes and expectations of countries with regard to the\nUnited Nations and its capacity to manage, prevent and\nsettle conflicts. Yet various confrontations still cause\nsuffering, instability and misery throughout the world.\nThis is happening just as the Organization faces the\nworst financial and motivational crisis in its history. There\nis a widespread feeling of dissatisfaction \u2014 sometimes\nveiled and sometimes explicit \u2014 with an Organization that\nstill embodies the loftiest ideals ever conceived by the\nhuman spirit in the search for peace and understanding\namong peoples.\nBrazil is committed to the United Nations Charter\nand to the Organization\u2019s political, legal and diplomatic\nlegacy of the past 50 years. That commitment is part of\nthe diplomatic history of my country and of the principles\nthat have always governed our actions in this body and in\nour relations with all peoples, particularly with our 10\nneighbours, with whom we have lived in peace for well\nover a century.\nCompelled by that commitment, we sound a word of\ncaution to those who, like ourselves, wish to see the\nUnited Nations as a source of leadership in international\nrelations, as an instrument for promoting an international\nsociety based on freedom, the rule of law and the rights\nof the citizen.\nWith the political and ideological constraints of the\ncold war behind us, the world is now organized around\nmuch more concrete and pragmatic variables, such as\ninternational trade, investment flows and the transfer of\ntechnology. The emphasis on political and ideological\ncoalitions has given way to an emphasis on economic\ncoalitions. Pressured by public opinion, Governments are\ntoday concerned with social well-being, the quality of life,\neconomic and social indicators and unemployment.\nThe focal point of the political debate is shifting\nirrevocably from strategy and ideology to economics and\nintegration. That is why the world is following the path\nof large-scale regional economic agreements. North-South\nand East-West \u2014 the main axes of international politics\nin the last 50 years \u2014 have given way to groups of\ncountries dedicated to the goals of economic integration\nand the coordination of macroeconomic, financial and\ntrade policies.\nNorth, South, East and West are no longer the\ncardinal points on the international political compass. The\nWorld Trade Organization and its body of universal rules\nand regulations for fostering free trade, the European\nUnion, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council\n(APEC), the North American Free Trade Agreement\n(NAFTA), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation\nand Development (OECD), the Group of 7, the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the\nSouth African Development Community (SADC), and the\nSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) have\nbecome, in their respective areas of action, the catalysts\n3\n\n\nfor development, cooperation, understanding and, indeed,\nfor peace.\nThe peace that the founders of the United Nations\nenvisioned may come about as a result of the response by\nthe various regions and groups of countries to the\nchallenges, opportunities and risks of a new world, which\ntoday is called the world of globalization. It is a world that\ngenerates prosperity and a healthy competition among\ncountries and regions; but it is also a world that swells the\nranks of the destitute and the outcast among and within\ncountries, a world that breeds conflict and increases\ninequality, a world that demands reason, reflection and\nconstructive action.\nThrough peace, cooperation, respect for human rights\nand development, the United Nations has a major role to\nplay in preventing the divisions of the cold war from\nfinding new expression in a widening gap in well-being.\nThe Organization must evolve in order to successfully\nplay that role as it has so often done in the past. It must\nadapt its structure and methods of work in order to\noptimize its human, material and financial resources. It\nmust make use of the great political, strategic, and moral\npower it is able to muster. It must implement and follow up\non its decisions, on the rules with which it updates and\nconsolidates international law and on the commitments it\nhas won from the international community.\nMuch remains to be done in the wake of the great\nconferences that have shaped the international agenda in the\npresent decade. The conferences on the rights of the child,\nthe environment and development, human rights, population\nand development, social development, women and human\nsettlements have sealed commitments that must be\nhonoured, decisions that must be implemented and follow-\nup work that must be carried out.\nThe United Nations must ensure that its agenda\nbecomes more appealing and results-oriented, in order to\nearn the esteem of the public and to retain its primacy in\ninternational relations. We must correct the tendency to\nconvene meetings whose only purpose is to produce other\nmeetings or to adopt resolutions of a rhetorical nature. We\nmust rid the United Nations of its image as a lethargic body\nincapable of rising to the challenges of our times.\nBrazil is convinced that United Nations reform\nremains within reach, that it is still possible to ensure that\nthe United Nations will play a paramount role in this new\nphase of its existence. We believe in reform as a means to\nensure that the United Nations becomes a viable and\nlogical alternative to unilateralism and power politics. We\nbelieve in reform as a means to empower the United\nNations to act in a radically changed world. We believe\nin reform as a means to restore the United Nations as a\nunique forum for political and diplomatic action and\ndebate.\nOne year after our Heads of State and Government\ndrew attention to the seriousness of the financial situation\nof the United Nations, a solution to the problem remains\nelusive.\nTo stifle the United Nations little by little by\ndepriving it of the means to perform its functions is no\nway to secure greater administrative efficiency. Should\nthis scenario persist, then the capacity of the United\nNations to adapt to the dynamics of the contemporary\nworld could be seriously jeopardized. We could very well\nwitness a situation where other bodies come to occupy the\nspace left by the United Nations, bodies with their own\ngoals and agendas, which may or may not reflect the\nprevailing sentiments of the international community and\nthe interests of world peace, security and stability. That is\nwhy we need perseverance, courage and, above all, the\npolitical will to advance the discussion on issues which\nreflect a true commitment to the United Nations, issues\nwhich relate to the very relevance of the Organization in\ninternational relations on the eve in the twenty-first\ncentury.\nOne of these issues is the reform of the Security\nCouncil. There is a virtual consensus that the Security\nCouncil should be enlarged to allow for greater\nparticipation by countries with the capacity to act on a\nglobal scale and the willingness to bear the\nresponsibilities that would entail. We must now set a\ncourse for this process. Its outcome is essential for\nstrengthening the United Nations.\nBrazil has made several commitments in the field of\nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction and their delivery systems. We are now\ncommitted to having the southern hemisphere recognized\nas an area free of nuclear weapons. It is our firm belief\nthat this is a right to which the peoples of the southern\nhemisphere are entitled, and an obligation on the part of\nthose throughout the world who possess nuclear weapons\nor the means to develop them.\nA further commitment to disarmament in all fields\nthat I now wish to convey to the General Assembly is the\n4\n\n\ndecision by the Brazilian Government to declare a\nmoratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines. The\nexperience of the Brazilian contingent serving in the United\nNations Angola Verification Mission has underlined for us\nthe importance of a universal moratorium of this kind and\nthe need to rid the world of the scourge of land mines,\nwhich pose a threat to the daily lives of millions of human\nbeings. We would like to see all countries that export land-\nmines or that have the capability to do so join in this\ndecision.\nThe international community has placed its hopes in\na Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). These\nhopes are fully justified. We have a historic opportunity to\nput an end to an outdated practice which has increasingly\ndrawn repudiation and condemnation from international\npublic opinion. We are taking an important step towards\ngeneral and complete nuclear disarmament and stating\nunequivocally that there is no room in today\u2019s world for\nnuclear weapons or regional arms races.\nBrazil is committed to the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction and to the elimination of\nnuclear arsenals. It has consistently expressed its\ndisapproval of nuclear tests. Brazil strove for approval of\nthe CTBT at the Conference on Disarmament and\nconsidered the blocking of consensus in Geneva a grave\nsetback. It was inconceivable to Brazil that we could have\nlet the moment pass, that we could have run the risk of\nseeing the CTBT meet the same fate as so many other\ninitiatives which were allowed to lapse into oblivion.\nThis is why Brazil was one of the first sponsors of the\nAustralian initiative to seize the historic opportunity of\nsubmitting the CTBT for approval by the General\nAssembly. This decision reflected the commitment to\nbequeath to present and future generations a safer and\nnuclear-weapons-free world. This is why Brazil will\nimmediately sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty. We call upon all nuclear- and non-nuclear-weapon\nStates to do the same.\nThe peoples of the world expect action and leadership\nfrom the United Nations. They expect that the United\nNations will continue to be an essential benchmark of\ninternational politics over the next 50 years and that it will\nalways be not the last, but our best hope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe Dominican Republic was\namong the countries that founded the United Nations. But\nthis is only the third time, in 51 years, that its Head of\nState has come to address the General Assembly. Perhaps\nthe reason for this noticeable absence of our country during\nthe many years that this great annual event has been held\nis that following the Second World War, the international\nsystem revolved around super-Power rivalry, giving rise to\nthe cold war. In context, it is probable that our leaders felt\nthat their presence here would have been merely symbolic,\nwith no real importance.\nThat this may have been the case in the past, but the\nworld has changed. From the dramatic transformations in\nthe geopolitical environment, a multi-polar international\nsystem has emerged, in which the economy matters more\nthan ideologies and military conflicts. This reorganization\nof the international system on the basis of strategic\neconomic objectives has been accompanied by a scientific\nand technological revolution, a revolution of knowledge that\nspread across the planet and brought about the most\nprofound change ever experienced in the history of\nhumankind, turning the world into one large neighbourhood.\nIn the new international order that arose following the\ncold war, the Dominican Republic could not remain\nisolated. That is why we are here today: to proclaim to the\nworld that the Dominican Republic is now actively joining\nthe group of nations represented in this multilateral\nOrganization, so that, through international contacts and\nexchange, it can contribute to forging a better future for\nhumanity and, accordingly, a more promising future for\nDominicans.\nTo ensure our participation in the various forums of\nthe United Nations forums, exercising all the rights that\nhave been bestowed upon us, we proceeded, first, to pay\nour financial debts in full. To the Dominican Republic,\nthe payment of our arrears is evidence of our confidence\nand faith in the capability of the United Nations to play\na role in the international arena to guarantee international\npeace and security as well as respect for human dignity\nand fundamental human rights.\nNevertheless, just as we understand that the world\nhas changed, that there is a new international agenda\ngoverned by the common concerns of all peoples over\nenvironment preservation, population growth, respect for\nhuman rights, strengthening of democratic systems,\nrecognition of women\u2019s rights, and the social and\neconomic development of nations, we also understand that\nthis Organization must be renewed and readapted to the\nnew world circumstances.\nLatin America and Africa do not have permanent\nrepresentatives on the Security Council, and Asia has only\none. This means that there is uneven representation in that\nimportant body, which is incomprehensible in an\nOrganization whose Members enjoy equal footing, on the\nprinciple that they are all sovereign States. It is our\nhumble suggestion that the Security Council should be\nextended to enable Asia, Africa and Latin America to\nhave two permanent seats on that body and that the\nnumber of non-permanent representatives be increased to\ndemocratize the decision-making machinery in that forum\nfor peace.\nIn one of his most frequently-cited works on the\nCaribbean, entitled El Caribe, Frontera Imperial, the\nformer Dominican President and author, Juan Bosch,\nwrote as follows:\n\u201cThe history of the Caribbean is the history of\nthe struggle of empires against the peoples of the\nregion in order to rob them of their rich lands. It is\nalso the history of the struggle of empires against\none another to rob the possessions each one had\nconquered. Lastly, it is the history of the peoples of\nthe Caribbean to free themselves from their imperial\nmasters.\u201d\nThis direct contact with the major Powers over the\ncourse of five centuries, a product of these confrontations,\n5\n\n\nhas marked the Caribbean, perhaps forever, with a\nparticular stamp of fragmented histories, and different\ncultures and languages. Yet we are always seeking unity\nwithin diversity.\nRecent years have brought greater understanding and\ncloser bonds between us, based on the understanding that\nwe have a common destiny. As proof of this, our country\nis a founding member of the Association of Caribbean\nStates (ACS), an organization bringing together nations that\nare very different both in ethnic terms and in development\nlevels, and thus reflecting the richness and variety of our\nregion.\nWe would be pleased to see formal contact with and\nbacking from the United Nations for that recently created\nbody, in support of the efforts we have made to strengthen\nour relations and to work for our peoples\u2019 development.\nSimilarly, we have been participating in the Caribbean\nForum of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States,\nwhich is made up of Caribbean countries that benefit from\nthe Fourth Lom\u00e9 Convention. This forum has carried out a\nseries of regional projects financed with European Union\nresources.\nAs an observer, and aspiring full-fledged member, of\nthe Caribbean Community and Common Market\n(CARICOM), we view with great interest the widening and\ndeepening relationship between the United Nations and\nCARICOM. We urge that the necessary steps are be taken\nto intensify the cooperation and coordination between the\ntwo institutions, which would enable us to achieve our\ncommon goals.\nThe countries of the Caribbean are facing the\nchallenges of current circumstances, as the advantages of\naccess to markets are being eroded because of the\nimplementation of World Trade Organization agreements,\nthe effects of a single European market, the consolidation\nof the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)\nand the movement towards reciprocity and similar trends.\nOur participation in preferential access schemes\ndepends on the observance of established standards with\nregard to workers\u2019 rights, human rights, intellectual\nproperty rights, the environment and civil liberty \u2014 matters\nthat go beyond economic considerations.\nWe have gained certain advantages from preferential\ntrading with the United States and the European Union, as\na result of greater prosperity that led to an increase in\nimport demand from those countries and an increase in\ntourism in the Caribbean. By contrast, we must endure the\ncomplications of the new rules and harmonization\nstandards that have come into force. We have not yet\ntaken full advantage of the benefits deriving from such\nconcessional agreements as the Fourth Lom\u00e9 Convention,\nthe Generalized System of Preferences, and the Caribbean\nBasin initiative.\nOur high dependence on foreign trade, the shortage\nin the supply of goods and services and unsuitable\nmarketing methods constitute elements of vulnerability\nthat affect, to a greater or lesser extent, all the countries\nof the region. We must overcome these limitations and\ndefine areas in which we can be competitive.\nStrengthening cooperation is one way to support the\nCaribbean integration process and rectify such\nweaknesses.\nWhen referring to the Caribbean, let us not forget\nthe situation in Haiti, the country with which we share the\nisland of Hispaniola. We view with sympathy the process\nof democratization that is unfolding in that country, and\nwe appeal to the international community to do its utmost\nto assist in the huge task faced by the children of the\ncountry of Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture in constructing a better\nfuture for their countrymen.\nOne of the first foreign-policy actions of our\nGovernment was to encourage a cooperative and friendly\nrelationship between the Dominican Republic and Haiti,\nand we put in place the Joint Bilateral Commission. After\na fruitful meeting, which took place a few day ago in\nPort-au-Prince, that Commission agreed to a series of\ntechnical exchange agreements in the fields of tourism,\nagriculture, trade and investment, sports and border and\nimmigration matters. Furthermore, we defined the\nconditions for joint strategies to take advantage of funds\nprovided by multinational sources, such as those granted\nby the European Union under the terms of the Fourth\nLom\u00e9 Convention.\nI would now like to direct the attention of the\nGeneral Assembly to a subject that just a few years ago\nwas on the front pages of all the newspapers of the world\nand that, even though it still has a considerable impact on\nthe effectiveness of development policies, has vanished\nfrom the world\u2019s attention: the problem of foreign debt.\nThe countries of the region have carried out a series of\nadjustment programmes in an attempt to regain external\nfinancial solvency. Nonetheless, there are still\nconsiderable imbalances as a result of the burden of debt\n6\n\n\nservicing, without a corresponding recovery in the terms of\nexchange that would allow us to create greater resources\nthrough our exports.\nIn the case of the Dominican Republic, foreign debt\nincreased 13-fold between 1964 and 1994. Today, thanks to\nour extraordinary efforts, our country is now current with\nits international creditors, which means that we are eligible\nfor further external financing. However, being current with\nour payments to international credit organizations has meant\nthat our Government has incurred greater social debts to the\nDominican people. There are fewer resources to invest in\neducation, health, housing and social security and,\nultimately, to deal with the critical situation of poverty that\naffects most of our people.\nIn its 51 years of existence, the United Nations has\nmade extraordinary efforts to eradicate bellicose conflicts in\ndifferent parts of the world and to contribute to the\nmaintenance of peace and international security. But great\nhuman sacrifice is inherent in the theatre of war, and our\nimpoverished neighbourhoods have adopted the names of\nwar-torn places, symbolizing the extent of their fight\nagainst misery. In the Dominican Republic the poor and\nmarginalized neighbourhoods have adopted such names as\nViet Nam, Katanga and Cambodia; none of them, of course,\nis called Sweden, Japan or Germany. This means that this\ninternational Organization\u2019s new role is to guarantee\ninternational peace and security through mechanisms to\npromote the economic and social development of the less\nfortunate nations.\nFor this reason, with respect to debt, our country\nbelieves that multilateral organizations that provide\ndevelopment assistance and the donor Governments,\ntogether with the debtors, must find more lasting solutions\nto the burden of foreign debt servicing, so that we can\nrelease resources that can immediately be used to fight\npoverty and to stop the deterioration of the environment.\nWe have made progress in that regard, and it is fair to\nrecognize that the G-7, the International Monetary Fund, the\nWorld Bank and the regional banks for development\nassistance, such as the Inter-American Development Bank,\nhave consistently designed and implemented important\nmechanisms to alleviate the foreign-debt burden, among\nwhich the so-called Brady plan and the G-7 programmes\nfor the reduction of bilateral debt stand out.\nHowever, in the near future we will need to review\nsome of the sacred principles prevalent in the international\nfinancial community now for many years, such as those\nrelated to the Paris Club cut-off date and the impossibility\nof debt restructuring with multilateral organizations. This\naffects especially the so-called least developed countries,\nwhich could receive preferential treatment in this regard.\nThe Dominican Republic therefore urges all interested\nparties to move forward to enable the underdeveloped\ncountries to implement viable programmes against poverty\nand marginalization, within a financially sustainable\ncontext.\nIn addition to the fight against poverty, at this stage\nof reforming the international system it is important to\ntake all appropriate measures to fight terrorism and illegal\ndrug trafficking, scourges that deeply affect the normal\ndevelopment of mankind. Recently, international drug\ncartels have tried to use Caribbean routes to carry out\ntheir illegal operations. The Dominican Republic has been\ntaking all possible measures to prevent the use of its\nterritory as a medium for drug trafficking and drug use.\nFor Dominicans, drug use and trafficking are a national\nsecurity problem, which we will fight with the necessary\nforce to eliminate an evil that has become the great\nplague of mankind at the end of the twentieth century.\nIn expressing its willingness to play a more active\nrole in the international system, the Dominican Republic\nalso expresses its concern at the many unresolved\nconflicts in different parts of the world. We advocate a\ndefinitive and peaceful resolution of the conflict in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina; of the search for peace in Middle East\nbetween the Government of Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization; of cooperation and assistance\nwith regard to situations such as those of Somalia,\nBurundi and Liberia. As to the Republic of China on\nTaiwan, we believe that due to its location in the centre\nof East Asia, its security and stability bear a close relation\nwith the peace and prosperity of that region, and we\ntherefore encourage both the sides along the Taiwan Strait\nto resume constructive dialogue with a view to achieving\nmutual cooperation and understanding. We believe that\nthe parallel participation of both sides in the United\nNations would be conducive to maintaining peace.\nWe stand at the threshold of a new century and a\nnew millennium, which will bring new challenges as well\nas new opportunities for human progress, and an\nOrganization such as the United Nations has always\nserved to stimulate the noblest of human aspirations. The\nDominican Republic, trusting in God and in the creative\ncapacity of its people, aspires to be a spokesman and an\ninstrument for channelling the ideals of justice, peace,\n7\n\n\ndemocracy and prosperity, which inspire the civilized\nnations of the world.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, I should like to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly. I wish to\nassure you the full cooperation of my delegation in the\ndischarge of this heavy responsibility entrusted to you. I\n10\n\n\nshould like also to take this opportunity to pay tribute to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Freitas do Amaral, for the able\nmanner in which he fulfilled his responsibilities.\nLast year we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations and reiterated our dedication to the purposes\nand principles of the Organization, for the promotion of\nwhich it was established. That occasion also afforded us the\nopportunity to take stock of United Nations achievements\nand of its yet-unfinished business, as well as of the\ncontinuing challenges faced by both the Organization and\nthe international community at large.\nThat stock-taking exercise could not have led us to\nunderestimate, let alone belittle, what has been achieved by\nthe United Nations. In any case, in so far as the United\nNations is our universal Organization, its failings can only\nbe our failings, as its successes are also ours. None the less,\nlast year\u2019s stock-taking of the performance of the 50-year-\nold United Nations must have underlined more than\nanything else how complex and daunting the challenges\nfaced by the Organization and by the international\ncommunity are becoming. There are probably no greater\nchallenges before the international community in this regard\nthan those of development and of peace and stability \u2014\ntwo concerns that define the very essence of the United\nNations and that constitute the core purposes and objectives\nof the Organization.\nIt is not yet a distant memory that we all rejoiced at\nthe end of the cold war, believing that it would open up\nnew vistas of opportunity for addressing the vital issues of\ninternational concern that had been overshadowed for\ndecades by the arms race, East-West rivalry and other\nmanifestations of the cold-war era. That positive\ndevelopment \u2014 the end of the cold war \u2014 also encouraged\nmany in the developing world, especially those of us in\nAfrica, to undertake far-reaching political and economic\nreform measures, with a view to laying the foundation for\ndemocratic transformation and meaningful economic growth\nand development.\nDespite all these manifested hopes and courageous\nmoves towards economic reform and democracy, the\nsituation on the African continent remains a source of great\nconcern. At present, Africa is the only continent where the\nlevel of poverty is increasing dramatically. Needless to say,\nthis trend could lead to unimaginable consequences unless\nit is arrested and reversed as speedily as possible.\nThus, Africa\u2019s genuine fear is that the opportunity created\nby the end of the cold war will disappear and that a\nhistoric chance will be squandered forever.\nIt is by no means accidental that, of all the regions\nof the world, Africa is the most affected by conflicts and\nlack of stability. Conflicts in our continent have not only\nbeen greater in number, but have also proved to be more\nintractable and, more often than not, more deadly and\nmore destructive, in terms of both human lives and\nproperty.\nIt may not always be plausible to suggest that all\nconflicts in Africa have their roots in economic\ndifficulties only. But, whatever the constellation of factors\nimmediately responsible for specific conflict situations in\nAfrica, the fact remains that in most instances civil strife\nand conflicts in the continent have emerged within the\ncontext of deteriorating economic situations. In this\ncontext, the only durable solution for the political crisis\nin Africa can be found in the economic regeneration and\ndevelopment of the continent. Development is therefore\nthe only reliable preventive means to ensure and maintain\npeace and stability in Africa.\nThe development of Africa will continue to be a\ndistant dream unless the known obstacles are removed,\namong which the debt burden continues to be the major\nimpediment. In this context, we are encouraged by the\nrecent Lyon summit of the Group of Seven, which we\nwere hopeful would go beyond the Naples terms in easing\nthe debt overhang for countries such as Ethiopia. We also\nhope that some progress will be made during the\nupcoming annual meeting of the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund in connection with\nmultilateral debt. For countries like my own, this is very\ncrucial indeed.\nWhile durable solutions to conflicts and to the lack\nof peace and stability in Africa or anywhere else can\nhardly be achieved within the context of economic\ndislocation and economic decline, it is also equally true\nthat development requires peace and stability. This is the\nvicious circle we find ourselves in, which makes it\ndifficult to find speedy resolution of the very many\nconflict situations that have led to unspeakable human\nsuffering, and on some occasions to genocide, in Africa.\nIn Somalia, where peace and national reconciliation\nhave eluded the people for close to six years, we are still\nfar from making any headway in reversing the situation.\nEfforts are, however, still continuing to help bring about\n\n\n\nnational reconciliation in Somalia, and my own Prime\nMinister has continued to attach the highest importance to\nthis endeavour. In all these efforts, the role of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) has been vital;\nwhether it is in Liberia, Burundi, Somalia or other conflict\nsituations in Africa, the important contribution that the\nOAU Secretary-General has been making is a source of\ngreat satisfaction to us. The Organization of African Unity\nhas indeed upgraded its capacity for conflict resolution in\nour continent since the establishment in 1993 of the OAU\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\nResolution. I wish to seize this opportunity to express\nappreciation to all those who have continued to help ensure\nthat the OAU\u2019s role in this area is strengthened and\nenhanced.\nConflict situations, whether in Africa or elsewhere,\nhave negative consequences not only for the countries\ndirectly affected but also for their neighbours and their\nregions. The situation in Somalia has not been an exception\nto this. The absence of central authority for an extended\nperiod of time in that country has been seen to provide\nopportunity for extra-regional elements bent on exporting\nterror and on experimenting with plans designed to create\ninstability and chaos in our region. It is therefore in my\ncountry\u2019s direct national interest that peace be established\nand national reconciliation achieved in Somalia as speedily\nas possible.\nThis is also in the interest of our region in general.\nOur region, which has had a prolonged period of instability\nand which has also recently experienced State-sponsored\nterrorism, cannot afford and should not be expected to\ntolerate the proliferation and the establishment of centres of\ninternational terrorism by multinational elements in our\nmidst. The spread of terrorism is not a danger merely to\nour region, but to the international community as a whole.\nEthiopia\u2019s conscience is clear in this regard because it has\ndone its level best to fulfil its responsibilities in the fight\nagainst terrorism, and it will always remain committed to\ncombating this evil.\nAt present, the most worrying conflict, with the\npotential for a level of human slaughter which we all dread\nto see, is the one in Burundi. The parties to the conflict in\nBurundi have the responsibility to save their society from\ndecimation through accommodation based on principles that\nsuit the specific conditions of their country. Others with a\nmuch more complex societal mix have managed to put in\nplace democratic mechanisms to reconcile the right of the\nmajority to govern with sufficient guarantees for the\nsecurity and dignity of the minority. This is what\nex-President Mwalimu Nyerere has been striving to assist\nthe Burundi parties to achieve through the Mwanza peace\nprocess, a process which enjoys the full support of the\nUnited Nations and of the international community. I wish\nto take this opportunity to express appreciation for the\nresolve and unity that the countries of the region have\ndemonstrated in an effort to see to it that disaster is\naverted in Burundi and that the country achieves national\nreconciliation. I wish also to express appreciation to all\nthose who have continued to support the Mwanza process\nand the initiative that was taken by the countries of the\nregion on 31 July 1996.\nMy country, which emerged from a very difficult\nperiod of conflicts and severe economic hardships only\nfive years ago, has made major strides on all fronts\nduring this brief period of time. We draw immense\nsatisfaction from the fact that our people have finally\nachieved durable peace and stability. Moreover, our\neconomic reform programmes have started to bear fruit;\nwe are encouraged by the results achieved, particularly in\nagricultural production, over the past few years. That\nEthiopia now has the capacity not only to feed itself, but\nalso to be an exporter of food grains, is increasingly\nbecoming a reality.\nEthiopia is striving to enhance its capacity to\nbecome a useful and effective partner in international\neconomic cooperation. We intend to make our country an\nattractive place for investment; all the necessary\nfoundations have already been laid by my Government to\nthis end. We are determined to make trade and investment\nthe major pillars of our economic cooperation with others.\nEthiopia has also endeavoured to contribute its share\nto regional and international peace and stability over the\npast few years. That is a policy that we intend to expand\nfurther with a view to fulfilling our regional and\ninternational commitments, no matter how small our\ncontribution might be.\nEthiopia welcomes the recent adoption of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by the fiftieth\nsession of the General Assembly. We believe that it\nrepresents an important step towards the attainment of the\nlarger objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear\ndisarmament.\nAs a founding Member of the United Nations,\nEthiopia attaches the highest importance to the work of\nthe United Nations and wishes to see the Organization\nrevitalized and strengthened. In this context, Ethiopia, like\n12\n\n\nmany other countries, is convinced that the future of the\nUnited Nations lies in its democratization and in the\ncreation of conditions under which all Member States, big\nor small, will feel that the Organization belongs equally to\nall of them.\nWith respect to developments in Africa, in the area of\nconflict prevention and in other areas, my Government is\nkeen to see more effective cooperation between the United\nNations and the Organization of African Unity. No doubt,\nmuch work needs to be done in this area, and we are\nconfident that the mechanism for consultation already in\nplace between the two organizations will be utilized more\neffectively and with a far greater sense of purpose and\nconsistency.\nI wish to take this opportunity to express my\nGovernment\u2019s appreciation to the Secretary-General for his\nvery useful and timely initiative on the United Nations\nSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa. The Special\nInitiative is complementary to the United Nations New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, and,\nthrough the reallocation of existing resources and the\nmobilization of additional ones, will contribute to the\ndevelopment of Africa. We hope that the Special Initiative\nwill be implemented as planned and that it will not, like\nprevious initiatives, remain unfulfilled and be another\nsource of frustration and an empty promise.\nWe believe that the United Nations can do more to\npromote effectively the purposes and principles enshrined\nin its Charter and to galvanize international cooperation to\nachieve peace and development. Our world cannot afford to\nsee the international community divided in two, with one\nhalf remaining poor and becoming even poorer. The\nimperatives of interdependence dictate that this trend be\nreversed, especially when all that those who are lagging\nbehind demand is the removal of the obstacles to\ndevelopment and an opportunity to address their economic\nproblems on the basis of their own efforts.\nEthiopia is confident that the United Nations will play\nan increasingly dynamic role, so that all the nations and\npeoples of the world will have an equal stake in the\npreservation of global civilization and in enriching human\nsociety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to congratulate\nwarmly Mr. Razali on his election to the high office of\nPresident of the General Assembly. I am confident that\nunder his wise and able guidance our deliberations will be\nmost successful. I should also like to thank His Excellency\nMr. Do Amaral for his most valuable contribution to the\nwork of the previous session of the General Assembly.\nWe have just left behind 50 years in the life of this\nuniversal Organization, which was founded with the ideal\nof serving and guiding humankind in its common quest to\nmake the world a better place to live. The commemoration\nlast year of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\nmarked an important milestone in our journey. Yet we find\nthat our common pursuit of a new and more promising\norder of international relations is far from its goal. The new\nexpectations and hopes that the end of the cold-war era\ninstilled in us all have, unfortunately, been short-lived.\nIndeed, such dark forces as extreme ethnic nationalism,\naggression, hegemonistic tendencies, intolerance, racism,\nxenophobia and terrorism have been unleashed to wreak\nhavoc on a global scale. At the same time, economic, social\nand environmental problems, as well as risks in the military\nsecurity realm, have assumed global proportions.\nNo country can claim to be immune from any of the\nproblems we are facing today, which need common\nsolutions. In fact, there is an emerging consensus that more\nthan ever, our common problems require global solutions,\nwhich must be formulated in a spirit of solidarity and\ncooperation. This spirit can find concrete expression only\nwithin this Organization, which continues to be the only\nglobal forum for collective cooperation and effective\ninternational action. Therefore, it is our duty to generations\nto come to refashion this institution so as to further\nstrengthen it and equip it with the means to meet the\nchallenge of the new era that begins with the twenty-first\ncentury.\nAs we embark on the second half-century of our\nOrganization, it is high time that the international\ncommunity reassess the ways and means by which it can\ngive a new impetus to the efforts aimed at building a better\nand more secure future for all humankind. Substantial work\nto this end has already been carried out within the United\nNations system. In particular, the series of major\nconferences on basic issues of common concern laid the\ngroundwork for future action. The chain of these\nconferences, which began with the 1990 World Summit\nfor Children and ended with the Conference on Human\nSettlements in Istanbul this past June, has covered\nvirtually every aspect of human interest. The declarations\nand programmes of action they adopted will serve as our\nroad map in our efforts to achieve their final objectives.\nIt was a distinct privilege for Turkey to host, in\nIstanbul this year, the last major international conference\nof the century, Habitat II. That conference played an\ninstrumental role in creating a greater awareness that\nadequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements\nin a rapidly urbanizing and globalizing world are the\ncommon challenges before us. The Istanbul Declaration\nand the Habitat Agenda will be our guiding instruments\nto meet these challenges. We attach great importance to\nthe follow-up of that successful conference.\nAlthough criticized at times for its limitations, the\nUnited Nations has nevertheless played a crucial role in\nthe search for global solutions to the problems\nencountered in every field of human endeavour. Yet the\nchallenges that it will face in the twenty-first century will\nprobably be far greater and more formidable than ever\nbefore, and the United Nations, therefore, has to promptly\nadapt to changing times. For this reason, we support the\nongoing reform process within the United Nations. In this\nrespect, streamlining, rationalizing, revitalizing and\nrestructuring the United Nations system and its work are\nthe widely accepted components needed to bring about a\nmore effective, responsive, representative, democratic and\naccountable world Organization. These modifications,\nwhich are currently under intense consideration at various\nlevels, will, to a large extent, determine the effectiveness\nof the United Nations in the years to come.\nSince January 1994, the Open-ended Working Group\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council and\nother matters has been formulating a set of guidelines for\nthe ongoing reform process. The general issue before us\nhere is the enhancement of the representative character of\nthe Security Council and the democratization of its\nmethod of work. Strongly in favour of a comprehensive\nreform, Turkey last year formally introduced a proposal\nfor the enlargement of the Security Council. As the\nrepresentative character of the Council has, despite minor\nadjustments, eroded steadily, we believe that a Council\n4\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\nwith at least 25 members would be more representative and\nthus more effective. We hold the view that the Council\nshould be enlarged by 10 additional non-permanent\nmembers and that the proposed new additional seats should\nrotate among a predetermined list of about 30 to 40\ncountries. These countries should be selected within the\ngeographical groups according to a set of objective criteria\nthat can be modified, of course, in time. The list would\nconsequently be flexible and updated after a certain period\nof time to conform to arising new conditions.\nAs regards to its working methods and procedures, the\nCouncil has already taken some important steps. There is,\nhowever, a widespread belief that these steps fall short of\nthe legitimate expectations of the great majority of the\nMember States. Hence, more work needs to be done in this\nsphere, especially on questions on which important\ndifferences still exist.\nOn the other hand, the Open-ended High-level\nWorking Group on the Strengthening of the United Nations\nSystem is in the process of formulating recommendations\nfor reform, with the General Assembly and the Secretariat\nas its main areas of interest. Turkey favours the\ncontinuation of the mandate of the Working Group to\nenable it to complete its work.\nThe challenges and risks we face in the military\nsecurity field call for measures that are broad in scope and\napplication. This feature alone underscores the unique\nmandate and authority of the United Nations to address\nthese challenges in their global dimensions. Arms control\nand disarmament \u2014 focusing distinctly and with a sense of\nurgency on measures and regimes destined to curb the\nalarming trends in the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction and in the technologies for their means of\ndelivery \u2014 must remain high on our agenda.\nTurkey, as a Member State of the Conference on\nDisarmament, is pleased to have joined the overwhelming\nmajority of nations in the efforts to conclude and adopt the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The Treaty,\nwhich I signed on 24 September, constitutes an\nindispensable step towards the eventual goal of a world free\nof nuclear weapons.\nAccumulation of conventional weapons beyond\nlegitimate defense needs is inherently destabilizing.\nDevising responsible policies to be globally adhered to in\narms transfers, with due regard to the impact of such\ntransfers on regional and international stability, is not a\nlesser priority. We must ensure that the United Nations\nRegister of Conventional Arms becomes a more effective\ntool for monitoring and for transparency in transfers. On\na parallel track, the international community must\nvigorously pursue a more concerted effort to eradicate\nillicit arms trafficking, not solely as an arms and export-\ncontrol measure, but more importantly as a key\ncomponent in the international fight against terrorism.\nOne of the most daunting tasks before the United\nNations is to foster greater international solidarity and\nconcerted action against terrorism. We should not shy\naway from the responsibility to meet this challenge head-\non, because terrorism not only poses a threat to\ninternational peace and stability, but also violates the most\nfundamental human right of all: the very right to live.\nInternational cooperation is imperative if we choose to\nlive free of fear. The United Nations has to play a central\nrole in this respect. General Assembly resolutions on\nhuman rights and terrorism and a Declaration on\nMeasures to Eliminate International Terrorism are\nsignificant milestones, paving the way for effective\ninternational cooperation to eradicate this common enemy.\nIn combating terrorism, we should not lose sight of the\nfact that what is equally important is to fight against, and\nnot to condone, the countries that are behind it.\nTransnational organized crime, with its connections to\ndrug trafficking and terrorist organizations, also poses a\nserious threat to the stability of our societies. We will\ncontinue to vigorously support international cooperation\nto combat this evil.\nIn 1995, we also celebrated the United Nations Year\nfor Tolerance. A culture of tolerance \u2014 which is vital for\nconsolidating democracy and preventing ethnic conflicts,\nracist tendencies and xenophobia \u2014 has been promoted\nthrough various international and regional activities under\nthe umbrella of the United Nations Educational, Scientific\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Current\ndevelopments unmistakably demonstrate how crucial it is\nto keep this precious concept alive within society and in\nbilateral, regional and international relations. We attach\ngreat importance to the follow-up of the Year and will\npresent a draft resolution under the relevant agenda item\nof the General Assembly.\nLocated on the fault line of several regions fraught\nwith conflicts and instability, Turkey naturally is seriously\nconcerned by developments on its periphery that threaten\nregional and international peace and security. We have\nbeen playing a crucial role in the efforts to find lasting\nand just solutions to the current problems. We are also\nactively taking part in various United Nations initiatives,\n5\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\nincluding peacekeeping operations and preventive\ndiplomacy activities.\nTurning to one of the questions that is high on our\nagenda, our fundamental policy towards Iraq continues to\nbe our commitment to the territorial integrity, sovereignty\nand independence of that country. The full compliance by\nIraq with all of its obligations under international law and\nrelevant Security Council resolutions remains vital for the\nreturn to normalcy in the region. Our main objective here\nis the restoration of peace, stability and security on our\nborders, as well as in the region as a whole. We are closely\nfollowing the recent developments in northern Iraq, which\nmay further aggravate the already delicate situation in the\nregion. To bring durable calm to the area, all segments of\nthe local population \u2014 Kurds, Turkomans in particular,\nsince they have not been mentioned up to this point to the\nextent that they deserve; Arabs; Assyrians; and others \u2014\nshould fully participate in any local administrative\narrangement, and their rights should be guaranteed.\nNorthern Iraq should not be permitted to serve as an area\nthat poses a threat to the security of the neighbouring\ncountries. Turkey will not tolerate terrorist elements using\nnorthern Iraq to stage terrorist acts against its territory. We\nare determined to take all necessary measures to protect our\nlegitimate security interests and to deny terrorist elements\nthe possibility of launching terrorist operations against our\npopulation from northern Iraq.\nWe have fulfilled our responsibilities emanating from\nthe sanctions regime against Iraq, despite the extreme\neconomic burden this has entailed for our country. More\nthan six years after the sanctions\u2019 inception, Turkey is now\nat the forefront of the countries that have been directly and\nmost adversely affected by the sanctions regime. In fact, the\nheavy toll we have been required to pay has long exceeded\nour ability to sustain the financial strain on our economy,\nnor can we pay it any longer. Security Council resolution\n986 (1995), when implemented, will alleviate the suffering\nof the Iraqi people while also bringing limited relief for\nTurkey. However, this relief can in no way be\ncommensurate with our losses. Consequently, we have\napplied to the United Nations Sanctions Committee with a\nview to obtaining further appropriate compensation within\nthe framework of the sanctions regime. In this context, I\nwish to reiterate that we attach great importance to the\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 986 (1995)\nas soon as possible.\nIn the wider context of the Middle East, we are\nconcerned about what we hope will be only a temporary\nimpasse in the Middle East peace process. As a devoted\nsupporter of the peace process, which we regard as the\nonly viable alternative for the region, we desire to see it\npick up its momentum. This indisputably requires the\nparties to live up to their commitments.\nAs we underlined in our statement before the\nSecurity Council on 27 September, any action that may\nadversely affect the peace process should be avoided. The\nIsraeli decision to open an entrance to a tunnel in the\nvicinity of the Mosque and the chain of reactions it\nprovoked are of that nature. We are deeply saddened by\nthe high number of casualties. We call on both sides to\nexercise utmost restraint and to prevent further violence.\nWe urge the Israeli Government to review its decision\nand to refrain from any action that can be construed as\nprovocation and from resorting to the use of force. We\nwelcome Security Council resolution 1073 (1996). We\nexpect President Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to\nmeet immediately to find a way out of this crisis.\nOne of the main obstacles blocking the path to a\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East continues to be\nterrorism. It must be eliminated if the quest for a lasting\npeace and stability is to prevail. We advocate and stand\nready to take part in enhanced cooperation on the\nbilateral, regional and international levels. Similarly, we\nexpect all countries to do their share to this very end. It\nis with this understanding that we participated in the\nsummit of Sharm el-Sheikh, convened to demonstrate the\nresolve of the international community to fight against\nterrorism on a united front. The eventual success of the\npeace process will also hinge on our collective ability to\npromote mutually beneficial economic cooperation and\ninterdependence among the countries of the Middle East.\nAs a Balkan country, we firmly believe that peace,\njustice and legitimacy in the Balkans remain vital for\ninternational peace and stability. We hold the view that\nany cooperative scheme in the Balkans should include all\nand exclude none. We were profoundly distressed for a\nlong time that, during the disintegration of the former\nYugoslavia, lack of resolute international intervention at\nthe very outset of the aggression and war led to\nbloodshed and atrocities unparalleled in recent history.\nThe developments that took place prior to the Dayton\npeace Agreement proved once again that turning a blind\neye to aggression only further aggravates crisis situations,\ncausing untold human suffering and making it all the\nmore difficult to find solutions.\nWe are actively participating in the implementation\nof both the military and civilian aspects of the Dayton\n6\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\npeace Agreement, and in the international efforts to\nreconstruct and rehabilitate Bosnia and Herzegovina. We\nare also conducting, together with the United States, a joint\nprogramme to train and equip the army of the Federation of\nBosnia and Herzegovina in order to provide the Federation\nwith the means to preserve its territorial integrity and to\nensure military parity.\nWe welcome the recently held elections in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. We consider the realization of these elections,\ndespite existing hardships, an important development for\nBosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s future. We hope that this\ndevelopment will lead to the creation of a positive political\nclimate conducive to the attainment of lasting peace and\nstability and to the establishment of the constitutional,\nlegislative, administrative and security structures of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina. We urge the international community to\nremain committed to the cause of Bosnia and Herzegovina;\nto remain vigilant as regards any ill intention against the\nindependence and territorial integrity of that country; to\nensure the return of refugees and displaced persons to their\nhomes; to seek the arrest and extradition to The Hague of\nindicted war criminals; to prevent any negative outside\ninterference that could potentially impede the process of\npeaceful and democratic reintegration; and to make\navailable the assistance pledged for the reconstruction and\nrehabilitation of Bosnia.\nTurkey enjoys good-neighbourly relations with the\nBalkan countries. However, a number of issues between\nTurkey and Greece, mostly related to the Aegean, remain\nunresolved. We have always advocated that disputes should\nbe settled by peaceful means and through dialogue and\nconstructive negotiations. Consequently, we have made\nseveral appeals to Greece to seek an overall solution to all\nthe existing issues that stand between us. However, this\ndoes not mean that we would accept any fait accompli. We\nstill expect Greece to give these appeals the full\nconsideration and positive response they deserve. We would\nlike to hope that the new Greek Government, emerging\nfrom the recent elections, will adopt a more forthcoming\nstance in this regard. Unfortunately, the recent statement of\nthe Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs, from this very\nrostrum on 27 September, does not bode well. Distortion\nand misrepresentation of the established facts, as well as\nunfounded and unjustified allegations, will not serve the\ncreation of the climate of confidence and friendship we\nwish to see in our bilateral relations.\nIn Cyprus, in the period that has elapsed since the last\nsession of the General Assembly, regrettably no noticeable\ndevelopments have taken place towards a comprehensive\nsettlement. It has not been possible to resume the direct\ntalks between the two sides under the mission of good\noffices of the United Nations Secretary-General, due to\nthe negative stance of the Greek Cypriots. The Greek\nCypriot side continues not to acknowledge that, in the\npast, the United Nations negotiating process and direct\ndialogue between the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot\nleaders not only served to establish the key parameters of\na final settlement \u2014 which are already on the table \u2014\nbut also played an important role in defusing tensions\nbetween the two communities. It is all too evident that\nattempts to derail the United Nations negotiating process\ncan only further complicate the already difficult road to\na just solution.\nThe recent regrettable events in and around the\nbuffer zone and, especially the slaying of a Turkish\nCypriot soldier, have proven once again what the lack of\ndialogue as well as inflammatory rhetoric and provocation\ncan lead to. I hope that the Greek Cypriot side will not\nfail this time to draw the necessary conclusions. It is\nevident that the need to reduce tensions and build up\nconfidence on the island makes the resumption of the\ndirect talks, without any precondition, all the more urgent.\nThe Turkish Cypriot side has already made public its\nreadiness to this end. Turkey is committed to supporting\nthe renewed efforts of the United Nations and expects the\nsame constructive approach from Greece and the Greek\nCypriot side.\nPeace and legitimacy are yet to be restored in\nanother area of conflagration: the Caucasus. Indeed, this\nregion continues to be wracked by various conflicts, that\ncause immense human anguish and threaten peace,\nsecurity and stability. Turkey has close bonds with the\ncountries of the region and attaches utmost importance to\nthe preservation of regional peace and stability. The\nongoing occupation of more than one fifth of the territory\nof Azerbaijan by Armenian forces continues to be a\nsource of grave concern for Turkey. More than one\nmillion Azeris are still displaced in their own country and\nliving in unacceptable conditions.\nThey should not be permitted to endure another\nbitter winter in such conditions. Turkey has been striving\nto help bring about a peaceful and just settlement of the\ndispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We will\ncontinue to contribute to the efforts of the Minsk Group\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope with a view to establishing peace, security and\nstability in the region. We earnestly believe that all\ncountries in the region have much to gain from the\n7\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\nrestoration of peace and legitimacy in the Caucasus. The\nattainment of a just peace will pave the way for a climate\nof cooperation to serve the common prosperity of all the\ncountries of the region.\nThe conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, also continues to\nbe a source of distress. We attach the utmost importance to\nthe preservation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and\nunity of Georgia and firmly believe that the international\ncommunity should deploy all efforts to bring about a just\nsolution to the conflict on that basis. To this end, we fully\nsupport the United Nations-sponsored peace talks between\nthe parties and stand ready to contribute to those efforts.\nOne of the important aspects of the economic\ndevelopment of the Caucasus and Central Asia is the\nexportation of their natural resources, for which Turkey is\nin a position to provide easy access to world markets. I can\nmention here Turkey\u2019s proposed Baku-Ceyhan oil-pipeline\nproject and natural-gas pipeline projects, which will serve\nthe common interests and welfare of the entire region.\nAfghanistan is yet another conflict area where the\ninternational community has been unable to help bring\nabout a just and lasting solution. Our close ties with that\ncountry are deeply rooted in history and we are troubled by\nthe tragic consequences of the ongoing conflict. We are all\ntoo aware of the possibility of a spillover effect of the\nconflict in the region. We believe that this terrible conflict\nmay be brought to an end and peace restored through direct\nnegotiations between the fighting groups and the formation\nof a broad-based Government with the participation of all\nparties. Turkey is anxious to see, as soon as possible, the\nsigning of a ceasefire agreement and the beginning of peace\nnegotiations under the auspices of the United Nations. We\nwill be pleased to host a meeting for such negotiations and\nwill continue to support fully the efforts of the United\nNations Special Mission to mediate a settlement respecting\nthe territorial integrity, sovereignty and unity of\nAfghanistan.\nAs an extension of its geography and against the\nbackdrop of its history, Turkey finds itself at the\nmultidirectional crossroads of several continents and\ndifferent cultures. It acts as an important bridge between\nEast and West, combining the values of the East with the\nideals and institutions of the West in a unique synthesis.\nStrong historical, cultural and fraternal ties exist between\nTurkey and the countries of the Balkans, the Caucasus,\nCentral Asia and the Middle East. We spare no effort in\ncontributing to the resolution of conflicts and preventing\nnew ones from erupting, strengthening regional and\ninternational cooperation and promoting tolerance and\ndialogue. This is the very core and essence of the basic\nprinciples that define our foreign policy. We shall\ncontinue to place our assets at the disposal and service of\nregional and global peace, stability and prosperity.\nIn this context, I wish to underline the eminent role\nplayed by Turkey in such regional cooperation schemes\nas the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the\nEconomic Cooperation Organization, as well as its active\nparticipation in cooperation in the Mediterranean basin.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate our sincere desire\nto see the fifty-first session of the General Assembly\nbecome an important milestone on the road to the third\nmillennium. We have to gather our strength, pool our\nresources and ignite our imagination to build, collectively,\na better world. National interests and objectives will\nsurely remain at the core of our policies. However, on the\neve of a new millennium, the time has certainly come to\ntake a broader view and to replace rivalry with\ncooperation, intolerance with tolerance and confrontation\nwith dialogue and conciliation. We should at all costs\navoid faits accomplis and double standards in\ninternational relations. A revitalized and reinvigorated\nUnited Nations entering its second half-century can make\na significant contribution to assisting us all to attain our\nhighest goals and aspirations. Let us not forget, however,\nthat the task of shaping a better future is entirely in our\nhands, for we are the United Nations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOnce\nagain, it is my honour as Secretary for External Affairs of\nthe Government of the Federated States of Micronesia to\naddress the General Assembly.\nFirst, I wish to thank the former President, His\nExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for his\nenlightened and skilful leadership during the historic fiftieth\nsession of the General Assembly.\nAs always, we acclaim the tireless dedication of\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali who, throughout\nthe time of our membership, has worked unceasingly to\nmake the United Nations a more effective instrument for\nthe betterment of our lives.\nThe people of my country are particularly pleased that\nyou, Mr. President, have been elected to lead this body\nduring its crucial fifty-first Session. Last year we celebrated\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and took stock\nof its accomplishments during the first half-century. Now\nwe begin in earnest to apply the commitments we made\ntowards the future of this Organization and the world.\nThere may be no other single individual who has been as\ninstrumental or as effective in leading the world community\nin recent years in the difficult search for common ground,\nparticularly on issues relating to environmentally sustainable\ndevelopment. We are heartened by your past achievements\nand are thankful for your willingness to undertake an even\ngreater commitment as our President during this session.\nThis is a year of strong reflection for the people of the\nFederated States of Micronesia. Ten years have passed\nsince we emerged from the United Nations trusteeship\nsystem, and five years since we took our place as a\nmember of the United Nations. During these years we have\nworked hard to build our capacity to contribute, even as a\nremote small island State, to the advancement of our\ncommon goals. Despite severely limited resources, both in\nterms of personnel and finances, we have accorded high\npriority to our participation in United Nations activities and\nto meeting our financial commitments to this Organization.\nIt remains our strong belief that this priority has not been\nmisplaced.\nAt the time we joined the United Nations the\nworld\u2019s attention was focusing on the global aspects of\nprotection of the environment and on the necessary\ninterrelationship between the environment and\ndevelopment. These were the subjects of the historic work\nat the Earth Summit in Rio in June 1992. Thanks in large\npart to you, Mr. President, that landmark United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development (UNCED)\ngave us Agenda 21 and its associated mechanisms. Since\nthen, much has been accomplished through the work of\nmany institutions and individuals, such as the Commission\nfor Sustainable Development and the Under-Secretary-\nGeneral for Policy Coordination and Sustainable\nDevelopment, Mr. Nitin Desai. We look forward to the\nspecial session of this body next year which will be held\nto review progress during the first five years following\nUNCED and to appraise the effectiveness of the\ninstitutions that have grown up around it.\nIn the case of the Federated States of Micronesia,\nthis movement was very well timed. Just as our internal\nprocess of development began in earnest, we received\nguidance from Agenda 21 as to sustainability and the\nintegration of environmental protection and development.\nA short time later, at the Barbados Conference, which had\nbeen mandated by UNCED, we participated in analysing\nthe barriers to development faced by all small island\ndeveloping States.\nWhile we took encouragement from the international\nand regional aspects of Agenda 21 and the Barbados\nProgramme of Action, we were also motivated to\nintegrate the Rio and Barbados outcomes into our own\nnational policies regarding development. Today our\nNational Council on Sustainable Development, chaired by\nour Vice-President, plays a central role in the formation\nof my country\u2019s development policies. Since last year my\ncountry has been assisted by the World Bank, the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian\nDevelopment Bank in undertaking broad economic policy\nand governmental structural reforms with a view to\nstrengthening the private sector and optimizing efficiency\nin the public sector. We are taking serious steps to\ndownsize the public service workforce. At the same time,\nmeasures are being taken to raise Government revenues\nthrough tax-rate increases and support for the public\nsector. All of our public utility services, including\ntelecommunications, are being commercialized, while a\n\ngood number of our public-works services are being\nprivatized.\nFor a small island developing country such as the\nFederated States of Micronesia, the condition and\nproductivity of our limited land areas, and of the seas that\nsurround us, are key to our survival. Only in recent times\nhave we, and others like us, come to realize the\nvulnerability and fragile nature of a world long taken for\ngranted. It is in the nature of islands to regard our\nremoteness as our primary protection against all dangers.\nBut the twentieth century has taught us how the land on\nwhich we live, and the resources of the sea on which we\ndepend, can be destroyed as a consequence of events that\ntake place far from our own shores. Thus, we are\ncompelled to raise our voice against long-standing actions\nand practices throughout the world as well as within our\nown region.\nAs long ago as 1972, Principle 21 of the Stockholm\nDeclaration established that national sovereignty can no\nlonger be asserted to justify actions that\n\u201ccause damage to the environment of other States or\nof areas beyond (...) national jurisdiction.\u201d\n(A/CONF.48/14/Rev.1, p. 5)\nThe affirmative responsibility of States to ensure the\navoidance of such damage is specifically reiterated in\nPrinciple 2 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and\nDevelopment. That responsibility is now recognized as a\ndoctrine of generally accepted international law.\nYet today we look back on a year during which, at\nbest, only mixed progress was made by the nations of the\nworld in discontinuing or regulating activities harmful to\nthe environment of others. Particularly in the region of the\nPacific Islands, our broad expanses and our helpless\npopulations continue to attract the interest of those who\nhave dirty, dangerous business to conduct. With regard to\nclimate change, our rising sea level and strengthening storm\nactivity sound an ominous warning of a global situation that\nwill engulf us if decisive action is not taken by the world\ncommunity now. Yet, over the past year, the political will\namong nations to adopt concrete measures has appeared, if\nanything, to be diminishing in the face of self-interested\nand determined manipulation of the very processes that we\nseek to apply.\nIt is not my purpose, however, to point with gloom\nto a glass half-empty, for we do take encouragement from\nthe ongoing hard work of thousands worldwide to address\na wide range of global security and environmental threats.\nWe are greatly relieved at the abatement, for now, of\nthe threat of nuclear war and by the cessation, finally, of\nnuclear-weapon testing. We hail the overwhelming\nmajority of United Nations Members that supported the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The\nFederated States of Micronesia took particular pride in\nstanding with other sponsors of the recent resolution\nadopted by the General Assembly at its fiftieth session,\nbecause Pacific Islanders were among the first, and may\nyet prove to be the last actual, not potential, victims of\none of history\u2019s darkest periods. We congratulate the five\nnuclear Powers on their major role in achieving this\nmilestone, and we call on all Members to join us in\nsigning the Treaty, as I did here yesterday on behalf of\nmy country. The CTBT is a major step towards the total\nelimination of all nuclear weapons. We hold that to be the\nultimate objective and obligation of the international\ncommunity and the global environment.\nAnother difficult problem associated with the\ntechnology of mass destruction and with the nuclear age\nis the disposition of dangerous waste, by-products and\ncastoffs, which themselves pose very real risks of mass\ncalamity to those unfortunate enough to be caught in the\npath of accidents. We credit the honest intentions of those\nwho insist upon carrying out movements of plutonium\nand other hazardous materials throughout our region to do\nso as carefully as they can. We accept and rely upon the\nword of those who have brought their hazardous materials\nto our region for destruction that they will conduct this\nactivity only a little longer. We welcome the recent\nannouncement by the United States administration of its\nopposition to plans to establish a nuclear-waste storage\nfacility on Palmyra Atoll in our region. But experience\nhas shown that good intentions are not always sufficient\nprotection. We must also rely on global mechanisms such\nas the Basel and London Conventions, and on regional\nactions to establish zones of protection, such as under the\nNoumea Convention and the recently concluded Waigani\nTreaty.\nI emphasize that the progress made in all these areas\nis not lost on us. However, if our children and their\nchildren are to inherit a livable world, we must all\nsomehow find a way now to take seriously the message\nof the Stockholm Declaration. We must face the hard fact\nthat each time the preventive and precautionary principles\n5\n\n\nare placed on hold to allow some offending activity to\ncontinue \u201cjust a little longer,\u201d the global resolve expressed\nat Rio and reflected in many actions since is seriously\nundermined. Glacial progress is better than no progress, but\nit is not enough where the stakes are literally apocalyptic.\nAs much as we support the process of the Framework\nConvention on Climate Change, it appears that intensive\nnegotiations are leading in the direction of elaborate\ncompromises that might represent masterful diplomatic\nachievement, but fall far short of effectively addressing the\nConvention\u2019s objective. Recently, at the second Conference\nof the Parties in Geneva, we witnessed a sorry spectacle in\nwhich a few delegations blocked the negotiators even from\ntaking note of a critical and unanimous scientific finding,\nnamely that\n\u201cthere is a discernible human influence on the global\nclimate\u201d.\nIt fell to the ministers in attendance to make their own\ndeclaration recognizing the obvious importance of this and\nother findings in the second Assessment Report of the\nInterdepartmental Panel on Climate Change.\nWhen there exists this degree of helplessness on the\npart of a great majority to come to grips with a problem,\neven after the denial factor has been laid to rest, one begins\nto fear that we lack the capacity to save ourselves from\nourselves. There is too little time remaining before the next\nConference of the Parties in Kyoto, where it is anticipated\nthat a protocol or other legal instrument will be adopted\nthat sets specific targets and timetables for emissions\nreductions beyond the year 2000. That action will determine\nwhether the Convention can indeed serve to address the\nthreat of global climate change. Yet, at this point, the only\nspecific suggested text, tabled by the Alliance of Small\nIsland States, is regarded by some larger industrialized\ncountries to be overreaching, even as a first step. The\noutlook is not encouraging.\nThanks to the work of the IPCC in producing its\nlandmark second Assessment Report, we now know that\ndue to the inertia of the Earth\u2019s climate system in adjusting\nto changed inputs, it is already too late to prevent\nsignificant loss of land areas and habitability due to sea-\nlevel rise during the upcoming century. We must therefore\nbegin in earnest to contemplate measures to adapt to, and\ndefend against, these consequences. In order to implement\nsuch measures, island countries will require the financial\nand technological support of the industrialized world.\nWithout it, tens of millions of people on islands and in low-\nlying coastal areas throughout the world are certain to\nbecome homeless. No longer can the world afford to\nleave the development of adaptation measures on the back\nburner. We must begin to act now.\nAs a nation covering over 1 million square miles of\nocean, we place great importance on the sustainable use\nand management of marine resources within and adjacent\nto our territorial limits. We are pleased with the entry into\nforce of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\nSea, which has provided us with a framework to deal\nwith many important issues in this field. The resulting\nmanagement mechanisms are of particular importance to\nthose of us surrounded entirely by oceans.\nOther encouraging events have included the opening\nfor signature of the Agreement on straddling fish stocks\nand highly migratory fish stocks in December 1995, and\nthe election last month of 21 judges for the International\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea. Furthermore, we note\nwith great satisfaction the election in Kingston, Jamaica,\nof an esteemed Pacific Islander, Mr. Satya Nandan of Fiji,\nas the first Secretary-General of the International Seabed\nAuthority. With his election and the subsequent actions of\nthe Assembly of the Authority last month, the Authority\nis finally in place as called for in Part XI of the\nConvention. With a substantial percentage of the global\nmineral resources lying beneath the surface of the oceans,\nthe International Seabed Authority has a crucial role in\nensuring that the ocean environment is protected\nthroughout the process of exploitation. In this connection,\nit is important for the General Assembly to provide\nadequate financial resources to the International Seabed\nAuthority during this session, as it has done with other\nbodies, until States Parties can assume the responsibility\nnext year.\nOne of the great learning experiences we have had\nduring our early years of United Nations membership has\nbeen appreciating the need for us all, collectively, to act,\nby example and with determination, to alleviate the\nsuffering of people, wherever they are, who are denied\ntheir basic rights as human beings. The Constitution of\nthe Federated States of Micronesia reflects in its\nDeclaration of Rights the standards ingrained in our\nculture over many centuries, and it has perhaps given us\na certain sense of complacency in this area. But we have\ncome to appreciate that the worldwide collective effort to\nconfront human rights issues both strengthens our own\nsociety and affords us an opportunity to participate in\nhelping others.\n6\n\n\nDespite the inevitable impact of increased contacts\nwith modern Western society, the most important aspects\nand values of our traditional cultures remain strong, because\nthey are appropriate to our circumstances. We continue to\nadhere to the concept of the extended family, for example,\nand many of the principles that are inherent in that system\nhave long ensured a respect in our society for basic human\nrights.\nChanging times, however, inevitably challenge old\ntraditions, and the maintenance of our traditional human\nrights standards becomes a process of adaptation to our\nincreasingly mobile and homogeneous society, in which\nlegal and governmental institutions must now also play a\ncentral role. Here we stand to benefit by involvement and\nparticipation in the international human rights movement,\nas was pointed out by our Vice-President in his address to\nthe World Conference in Vienna several years ago.\nAs we have studied the mechanisms and obligations of\nthe various United Nations Treaties on human rights, we\nhave entered into constructive internal debates. Children, for\nexample, are among our most important treasures, and so\nwe first acceded to the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild. The preparation of our first report to that Convention\nwas a thought-provoking exercise. Traditionally, women in\nisland cultures have been treated with love and respect, but\nhave not participated fully in public affairs. This is\nbeginning to change. We recently sent a strong delegation\nto the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, and\nare actively considering accession to the Convention on the\nElimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.\nOverall, we realize that our own application of human\nrights standards must evolve progressively along with our\nsociety.\nThe Federated States of Micronesia also accepts the\nresponsibility of continuing to speak out, along with\nsimilarly committed States, on the need to challenge those\nGovernments that still refuse to accord their own citizens\nthe fundamental rights of human beings. It is a long and\noften discouraging process, but only with a strong, constant,\ncollective voice can the international community maintain\nthe progress being made in exposing and deterring abuses\nby the powerful against the unempowered.\nMuch attention has been drawn in the past several\nyears to the serious financial condition of the United\nNations and the need to reform and restructure it. Some\nMembers are so disheartened by the slow pace of this effort\nthat they have lost their resolve to maintain their own\nfinancial commitments to the United Nations, making the\nproblems worse and threatening the continued ability of\nthis Organization to carry out its work.\nIt is the view of the Federated States of Micronesia\nthat while there may be inequities in the structure of\nassessments, Member States should address them while\ncontinuing to meet existing commitments that were\nestablished pursuant to agreed procedures. There will\nalways be some level of disagreement over structures and\nthe requirements of funding. But it would be a tragedy of\nhistoric proportions if the pursuit of the goals of the\nCharter were substantially hindered by Member States\nthat feel that they can rightfully tailor their contributions\nto their own satisfaction according to how their particular\ndemands are met. The fact is that, when we give due\nregard to the importance of our overall work here, this\nOrganization, even without reform, is well worth its\ncost \u2014 especially when one considers the sums spent by\nnations on activities that do not contribute to international\npeace and development.\nThere is no doubt that, as we begin the next half\ncentury of work, the capacity of this Organization is\nchallenged by issues that seem to grow rapidly in number\nand complexity. But this is not a sign of failure, nor of a\nlack of capacity. Neither does it suggest that we need\nanother instrument. It is, rather, an indication of the\nincreasing interconnectedness of the global community\nand of the growing inclination among nations to find and\nrecognize their common interests and to work together to\nadvance those interests.\nIn order to maintain and improve the responsiveness\nof the United Nations in a world in which it faces\nincreasing demands, it is necessary that, on a continuing\nbasis, we apply effective upgrades to the way we do our\nwork here. Only in this way can we keep the\nOrganization on a positive course, and faithfully translate\nthe mandates of the Charter into terms of continuing\nrelevance. This is the real meaning of reform. It is not a\nconsequence of past inadequacy, but a positive\nevolutionary development.\nThat is easily said, but as we all know, it is very\ndifficult to put into practice. Even so we must not allow\nthat high degree of difficulty to plunge us into frustration\nand defeat. The great achievements of those who have\nbeen here before us over the last 50 years must be\nhonoured by our unshakable determination to take the\nUnited Nations into the next millennium as the single\nmost effective multilateral instrument for the betterment\nof mankind.\n7\n\n\nI believe that this Assembly can and will accomplish\nmuch to add to the list of tangible achievements both for\nthe direct benefit of the peoples of the world and for the\nimprovement of this Organization itself. We have the\nhistory, the vision and the leadership. Moreover, the\nurgency is clearly seen by us all. Let us resolve to apply\nourselves as never before, and to live up to the great\npotential that resides in this Hall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is my distinct honour to\naddress the United Nations during this historic session,\nwhich I am confident will be remembered for all time for\nits adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty.\n20\n\n\nThe Republic of Palau applauds and thanks those\ncountries that will be signatories to the Treaty, for we\nbelieve that it does much to advance our goal of ridding the\nplanet of nuclear weapons. The Treaty, by banning further\ntesting, will help prevent the development of more\ndangerous nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the Treaty will\nhelp prevent other nations from obtaining existing nuclear\nweapons. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty thus\nclearly helps to make the world a safer place for us and for\nall of our children.\nThe Republic of Palau\u2019s commitment against the\ncreation and proliferation of nuclear weapons is long-lasting\nand resolute. When the people of Palau adopted our\nConstitution in 1978, we became the first country in the\nworld to become a constitutionally mandated nuclear-free\ncountry. Indeed, protecting our citizens from these horrific\nweapons of destruction is at the very heart and soul of our\nConstitution.\nWhile not every country will sign the Treaty, the fact\nthat the world\u2019s five recognized nuclear Powers \u2014 the\nUnited States, China, France, Russia and the United\nKingdom \u2014 have agreed to abide by the terms of the\nTreaty and that the overwhelming majority of other nations,\nincluding the Republic of Palau, have also agreed to abide\nby its terms gives the citizens of my country and of every\nother nation on Earth the hope that one day we will be free\nfrom these catastrophic weapons of destruction and of the\nthreat they pose to each of us and to our global\nenvironment.\nAccordingly, I would like to thank all of those who\nhelped bring the citizens of the world this Treaty, including\nthe Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on a Nuclear Test\nBan, Ambassador Ramaker of the Netherlands, and\nespecially our close neighbour and great friend, the\nGovernment of Australia, which took the lead at the United\nNations in making this Treaty a reality.\nAnother of my nation\u2019s primary concerns is the issue\nof how to protect the environment while providing\nsustainable economic development. This is a central issue\nfor small island nations in particular and for other\ndeveloping countries around the world. The Republic of\nPalau is therefore very pleased by the recognition and\naffirmation that human beings are at the centre of\nsustainable development and that they have the right to a\nhealthy, productive and meaningful life in harmony with\nnature.\nHowever, to make sure that this affirmation becomes\na reality, action must be taken at all levels of government,\nin particular at the international level. To help every\nnation achieve this goal, developing countries, including\nsmall island nations, must be provided the necessary\nresources to enable them to implement the decisions and\nrecommendations of the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development, the Global Conference on\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates and other significant international conferences.\nThe Republic of Palau, a small island nation in the\nPacific, cherishes its recognition as an independent\ncountry and greatly values its membership in the United\nNations, which allows our voice to be heard on global\nissues such as the importance of freeing the world of\nnuclear weapons and protecting our global environment.\nWe believe that perhaps the most critically important role\nof the United Nations is to provide a forum for nations\nlarge and small to discuss, debate and reach agreement on\nhow best to serve economic, social, cultural and other\nhumanitarian problems. Consequently, we believe that\nthose countries which have made demonstrated efforts to\nadvance regional and global peace, security and prosperity\nby establishing partnerships with other countries to further\nthese causes have much to offer the United Nations as a\nwhole and to its constituent Members individually.\nIn his inaugural speech to his country, United States\nPresident Bill Clinton pointed out that it is very likely\nthat every problem we face has already been solved\nsomewhere in the world. The challenge for us all is to\ncommunicate with each other so that we can discover\nthose solutions. The United Nations clearly provides the\nforum for such dialogue and discovery to take place. The\nRepublic of Palau believes that a greater number of\nvoices invited to participate in these discussions can only\nlead to better solutions to the myriad global problems we\nall face.\nThe overwhelming support given to the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty aptly\ndemonstrates that, through many people working together,\nthe cacophony of historically divergent voices can be\nharmonized for the benefit of all the peoples of all the\nnations on Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset to address to the\nPresident the sincere congratulations of the delegation of\nthe Comoros on his brilliant election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-first session. My\ncountry, the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros, is\ndelighted by his election because, in our eyes, it is a\nunanimous tribute from the international community to his\ngreat, friendly country, Malaysia, with which the\nComoros maintains excellent relations of cooperation and\nfriendship. This choice is also a tribute to his personal\nqualifications as a veteran diplomat respected by all.\nI also take this opportunity to convey our profound\nthanks to his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral\nof Portugal, for the devotion and skill with which he\nconducted the work of the fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly.\nTo Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-\nGeneral, that intrepid artisan of the lofty ideals of peace,\nsolidarity and justice, I should like to pay a well-deserved\ntribute for the efforts that he continuously makes for the\nbenefit of our world Organization.\nMy country adheres entirely to the Yaound\u00e9\nDeclaration adopted by the Heads of State and\nGovernment at the thirty-second session of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), which recommends\nthe candidature of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a\nsecond term.\nLast year, the United Nations commemorated with\nfanfare its fiftieth anniversary. More than 129 Heads of\nState and Government solemnly reaffirmed the ideals of\n17\n\n\nthe maintenance of peace, the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes and the strengthening of international cooperation\nand development. In the Declaration adopted at that\ncommemorative meeting, the indispensable role of the\nUnited Nations was recognized by all. That is why the\nsovereign leaders of the world also called for the United\nNations to be reformed and attuned to the requirements of\nmodern times.\nAn objective analysis has made it possible to see that\nthe structure of the Organization no longer corresponds to\nthe realities of today\u2019s world, which is changing at the\neconomic, political and geographic levels. At a time of\nglobalization, when science and technology are\nrevolutionizing communications, the interdependence of\nnations is emerging as an incontrovertible fact, and\ndemocracy is the only path of salvation for the peoples of\nthe world, our Organization simply cannot and should not\nkeep a body reserved exclusively to certain States on a\npermanent basis while the great majority has only\ntemporary access to it.\nIn other words, Security Council reform is urgent and\nimperative if we are to act in accordance with the principle\nof the sovereign equality of States. In that connection, the\nItalian proposal for the reform of the Security Council\noffers specific advantages in terms of the possibility of\naccess to the Council for small and medium-sized States.\nNo one denies the considerable role of the United\nNations in the establishment of a global society that is more\njust and peaceful and better integrated. But everyone\nremembers the historic conditions of its creation. The end\nof the cold war, the elaboration of a number of conventions\nand treaties on disarmament and the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction are, in our view, moral values\nthat guarantee the emergence of a world of peace in which\nthe right to life and well-being will win out over barbarism\nand brute force.\nAt the dawn of the third millennium, the United\nNations represents the only recourse for the emancipation\nof peoples and the eradication of poverty. In this\nconnection, we must emphasize the considerable work done\nby the Organization\u2019s specialized agencies to help States\nrequiring assistance in their daily struggle against\nunderdevelopment.\nThere is no need to recall that, in the past five years,\nour Organization has initiated and organized a number of\nthematic conferences aimed at identifying solutions capable\nof inspiring States in their national policy-making. These\ninclude the New York World Summit for Children, the\nRio Conference on Environment and Development, the\nVienna World Conference on Human Rights, the Cairo\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\nthe Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development,\nthe Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women and,\nmore recently, the United Nations Conference on Human\nSettlements (Habitat II) at Istanbul. We are also entitled\nto hope that next November\u2019s Rome World Food Summit\nwill offer effective guidance in this vital area.\nThe founding fathers of our Organization, recalling\nthe horrors and atrocities of the Second World War,\nbequeathed to us an instrument that grants primacy to law\nand dialogue. Unfortunately, other modern scourges, such\nas genocide, ethnic cleansing, occupation and civil war\nhave continued to raise the clamour of weapons within\nStates.\nThe victims of these new wars are the same as those\nof yesterday\u2019s \u2014 women, children and the elderly.\nThe resurgence of violence in the Middle East in the\npast few days, arising from the many provocations\norchestrated by the new Israeli authorities, throws into the\nquestion the peace process, which recognizes the\ninalienable right of the Palestinian people to a sovereign\nand independent State.\nFor my country, the resumption of the peace process\nnecessarily involves a withdrawal of Israeli troops from\noccupied territories of the Golan and southern Lebanon.\nThe closing of the tunnel under the Al-Aqsa Mosque is a\nsine qua non for reducing tensions and halting the\nviolence. During the past 30 years of warfare in the\nMiddle East, the victims have been and remain the\ncivilian populations. No one can forget the Gulf war or its\nconsequences for all parties concerned.\nMy country urges Iraq to seek a solution that would\nensure the peace and security of its neighbours and\ninclude respect for the independence and territorial\nintegrity of Kuwait. In this connection, the question of\nKuwaiti prisoners detained by Iraq is a concern, the\nsettlement of which would send a signal of willingness\nfor appeasement.\nThe illegal occupation of the islands of Tunb and\nAbu Musa by Iran is also a source of tension in that part\nof the world. The United Arab Emirates is sparing no\neffort to recover peacefully that integral part of its\nterritory.\n18\n\n\nThe embargoes imposed on the Libyan and Iraqi\npeoples are of concern to my country. Our Organization\nmust seek ways and means to enable the parties concerned\nto begin a dialogue aimed at a solution that would alleviate\nthe suffering of the civilian populations of these countries.\nThe advent of a democratic and multiracial South\nAfrica and the peace restored to Angola and Mozambique\nshould not make us overlook the fact that the African\ncontinent is still a theatre of conflict. Like the international\ncommunity, my country remains concerned over the\ndeterioration of the situation and the persistence of violence\nin Burundi. Only a return to constitutional order and to\nrepublican legality can reduce tensions and foster a dialogue\nbetween all the people of Burundi. We encourage President\nMwalimu Julius Nyerere in his mediation efforts aimed at\na peaceful solution.\nThe recent Abuja Agreement on Liberia offers a\nglimmer of hope for peace, provided that all the factions\nobserve the current ceasefire and participate in the\ndisarmament and demobilization of troops.\nThe Government of Sierra Leone and the\nRevolutionary United Front have made a commitment to\nnegotiation in order to put an end to the tragic fratricidal\nwar in that country. We can only encourage such initiatives\nand commend C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire for its mediation.\nThe situation in Somalia warrants special attention. It\ndemonstrates the inability of the international community to\nfind a viable solution to the Somali tragedy.\nThe question of Western Sahara also requires in-depth\nconsideration on the part of our Organization, because this\nquestion involves safeguarding the unity and territorial\nintegrity of a State Member of our Organization, the\nKingdom of Morocco.\nFortunately, other conflicts are coming to an end.\nThus, the recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina mark\na decisive new stage in the consolidation of peace and\nsecurity \u2014 the only condition that would make national\nreconstruction possible in that country long devastated by\nwar.\nThe world has become a global village fraught with\ninequality for its inhabitants. Indeed, the new world\neconomic order and development strategies have not\nbridged the gap separating the rich and poor countries. The\nmid-term review of the United Nations New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s has made it possible to\nnote that the Agenda has not had the desired impact on\ndevelopment, despite its harmonized priorities and\nobjectives. But we dare to hope that the United Nations\nSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa, which\ncomplements the New Agenda, will stimulate the process\nand accelerate the integration of Africa into the\ninternational trading system. For now, small States can\nonly expect a continued drop in the prices of their raw\nmaterials and an increasingly unbearable debt burden.\nThe Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros, a\nsmall island State that is among the least developed, is\none of those excluded from international trade because, in\naddition to its limited natural resources and the high cost\nof international transport, other political and structural\nconstraints have been brought to bear that bridle its socio-\neconomic development.\nThe recent history of my country has been\ncharacterized by a series of tragedies. The Assembly will\ncertainly recall the dramatic events of September 1995 in\nthe wake of the invasion of the country by mercenaries.\nThis aroused the indignation of the international\ncommunity and brought true economic and social disaster\nto my country. The people of the Comoros have suffered\ntoo deeply from repeated attempts at destabilization\nfomented from abroad. We appeal to the international\ncommunity to ensure that such practices \u2014 which belong\nto another era \u2014 come to an end throughout the world.\nI take this opportunity to reiterate our profound\ngratitude to France, whose military intervention, requested\nby the Government of the Comoros in accordance with\nthe defence agreements between our two countries, made\nit possible to rout the mercenaries. In the same context,\nI am pleased to pay a vibrant tribute to the Organization\nof African Unity for the decisive role it played in\nrestoring constitutional order.\nWe also extend our gratitude to the United Nations\nand all those who, near or far, contributed to the\norganization of the first free, democratic and transparent\nelections, which brought President Mohamed Taki\nAbdoulkarim to the highest office of my country.\nThis short overview of conditions in the Comoros\ndemonstrates the extent to which the newly elected Head\nof State has inherited a catastrophic situation,\ncharacterized by an exorbitant external debt, an empty\nState treasury and months of unpaid salaries for\ngovernment officials.\n19\n\n\nYet, strengthened by his popular legitimacy and the\nsupport of a broad majority of the people of the Comoros,\nin six months President Taki drafted the broad outlines of\npolitical, economic and social reforms to overcome the\nnumerous obstacles impeding the construction of a\ndemocratic, prosperous and interdependent society in the\nComoros. A vast programme was set up in the economic\nand financial sphere that included financial stabilization\nmeasures, a State audit, monitoring of civil servants and a\nrecovery of State movable property and real estate. The\nresults are promising and, for the first time, there are cases\nof corruption and embezzlement of government funds\nbefore the Comorian justice system.\nIn this series of reforms, the private sector has pride\nof place. That is why the Government is disengaging itself\nfrom the monopoly it has enjoyed in many sectors which it\nhas turned over to dynamic privatization that generates\ngrowth.\nOfficial contacts have been opened with financial\ninstitutions and development partners of the Comoros in\norder to establish a structural adjustment programme with\nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to\nrestore my country\u2019s credibility.\nIn the social sphere, ministerial departments \u2014 inter\nalia, those of national education and public health \u2014 have\nmobilized their energies to rehabilitate these very sensitive\nand vital sectors. An international conference on education\nin the Comoros is planned for next December and we invite\nall friendly countries, international and regional bodies to\nparticipate in that important meeting, aimed at mobilizing\nthe necessary resources to finance education that meets the\nexpectations of Comorian youth.\nIn the political and institutional sectors, the incredible\nproliferation of small political parties and a jury-rigged\nConstitution that is ineffective and difficult to implement\nhave seriously hampered the new democratic process. Thus,\nthe new presidential majority, comprised of more than 18\npolitical parties out of the 25 that have been officially\nrecognized, has merged into one great national political\nmovement. A consultative commission comprised of all the\nactive forces within the nation \u2014 political parties, trade\nunions and human rights and environmental associations \u2014\nhas been working to amend the Constitution. Their draft\nwill be submitted for approval this month to the Comorian\npeople in a referendum. As soon as it is adopted, legislative\nand regional elections will be held to set up a parliament\nfor the country and municipal institutions for the regions.\nAfter 2l years of independence, the Comoros are still\nbeing built. President Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim is\naware of what is at stake. He knows that we must first\nrely on our own efforts, but he also knows that he may\nrely on the effective support of the international\ncommunity, especially the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies, including the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations Children\u2019s\nFund, the World Health Organization and the Food and\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, to which\nwe reiterate our complete confidence and deep gratitude\nfor their efforts towards the development of the Comoros.\nFrom this rostrum, I solemnly appeal to the\ninternational community to give special economic\nassistance to the Federal Islamic Republic of the\nComoros.\nI cannot conclude my statement without mentioning\nthe question of the Comorian island of Mayotte, which is\non the fifty-first session\u2019s agenda as a separate item. At\nthe appropriate time, I will not fail to detail developments\nand to express our hope of a settlement in the wake of the\ndemocratic changes that have occurred in the Comoros in\nthe past six months.\nThe end of the twentieth century challenges our\ncollective conscience to build a better world for future\ngenerations \u2014 a world without war and without poverty,\na world in which injustice, violence, drugs, terrorism and\nfundamentalism will no longer exist. Of course, one might\nsay that such a world is impossible because profit-\nseeking, protectionism and intolerance are obstacles to\nprogress and hindrances to the well-being of humanity.\nBut progress in science, technology and medicine\nreinforces our optimism.\nIt is in this spirit that our faith is revived in a United\nNations that is more dynamic and more democratic, a\nUnited Nations in which the rule of numbers will carry as\nmuch weight as the rule of strength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I also wish to pay tribute to Mr. Diogo Freitas do\nAmaral for the excellent and exemplary manner in which\nhe presided over the fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly.\nThe dynamic and extraordinary manner in which\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has accomplished his mission as\nSecretary-General in difficult circumstances of financial\nconstraints and wars within and among Nations, and his\nfostering of social and economic development, has earned\nour sincere gratitude. My Government believes that notable\nendeavours have been undertaken by His Excellency\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali to shape the future of the United\nNations in accordance with the needs and aspirations of\ntoday\u2019s world.\nAs members may know, the people of the Republic of\nSuriname, availing themselves of their fundamental\ndemocratic right through fair, free and secret elections on\n23 May and 5 September 1996, have elected the new\npolitical leadership of the country. As testimony to this\ndemocratic process, I stand before the Assembly on behalf\nof my Government and people as the newly elected\nPresident of the Republic of Suriname.\nMy Government believes that the main challenge\nfacing us is the difficult task of reversing the current\ntendency towards the social disintegration of the nation into\na process of nation- building and creating social harmony.\nThe need for this is even more pressing, considering\nthat Suriname has a small population, composed of different\nethnic and indigenous groups and that the living conditions\nof large segments of its population have deteriorated\nsignificantly. One of the fundamental problems in meeting\nthis challenge lies in the development of an economy that\nis diversified and not dependent on just one economic\nsector \u2014 and even less, dependent on a single donor\ncountry.\nIn order to ensure that our people have the actual\nenjoyment of human rights in the widest sense of the\nword, a social system will be created that will focus\nattention on guaranteeing every citizen minimal social\nsecurity; creating a society in which the quality of life is\nequal for all and harmony is safeguarded; offering\nSurinamese women greater opportunities to develop their\npotentialities and to participate in the social structures, as\nwell as enhancing, in the widest sense of the word, the\ncare for the Surinamese child; providing for the basic\nneeds of the people, such as food supply, health care,\neducation, housing, public transport, water supply,\nemployment, passable roads and affordable energy supply;\nand guaranteeing the protection of property by means of\nadequate security.\nThe Government of Suriname is aware that the\nrealization of these tasks will demand great efforts from\nthe Government itself and from the entire population. In\nthis endeavour we shall work to bring about the\nadministrative and budgetary decentralization of the\nadministration through the strengthening of people-\noriented democracy by giving participatory democracy the\nscope to develop.\nThe decentralization of legislation and administration\nwill be given further attention, to facilitate regional and\nlocal development, with the full participation of regional\nand local structures. The necessary conditions will be\ncreated for an integrated approach to the development of\nthe districts and the interior, so as to eliminate\ndevelopment lag in these regions. We fully realize that the\nresponsibility for achieving this goal lies primarily with\nthe Government and the people of Suriname. We\nacknowledge, however, that we live in a larger world, in\na period in which having friendly relations is of eminent\nimportance. In accordance with international law, and on\nthe basis of the Charter of the United Nations and the\nprinciples of the Non-Aligned Movement, Suriname will\nestablish and maintain relations with friendly nations and\ninternational and regional organizations throughout the\nworld.\nClose relations with countries that are our\nneighbours from a historical, cultural or geographical\npoint of view, especially France, Brazil and Guyana, and\n5\n\n\nwith Venezuela, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the\nUnited States of America, will be maintained and deepened.\nFurthermore, we will strengthen our efforts for full\nintegration into the subregion, into the wider Caribbean\nregion and into the Americas through our membership in\nthe Caribbean Community and the Association of Caribbean\nStates and through our participation in the free-trade zone\nto be established in the year 2005.\nThis approach demands a more business-like stance in\nmultilateral and bilateral relations as concerns the principles\nof equality, mutual respect, and the interest and protection\nof our national sovereignty.\nOne of the most important characteristics of our era is\nthe transitional phase we are going through, in which new\nideas, new Powers, new values and norms have arisen,\nleaving their mark on both national and international\npolitics, on the national and international economy, and on\nthe formation and content of international relations. The\nUnited Nations, which plays a crucial role in defining\ninternational relations and creating favourable conditions for\npeace, stability and development, reflects this transitional\nprocess.\nIn considering the need to redefine the role and tasks\nof the United Nations in the post-cold-war era, some people\nquestion whether the United Nations still has a role to play\nin the international arena. As far as Suriname is concerned,\nthe United Nations, as a centre of multilateral relations, has\ndemonstrated its ability to play a unique role in the\nachievement of overall human development on a global\nscale. The United Nations has also demonstrated an\nextraordinary capacity for giving primacy to the ideals and\naspirations enshrined in its Charter, and has indeed proved\nto be effective in the pursuit of such essential tasks as the\nmaintenance of peace and security and the promotion of\ndevelopment.\nAlong these lines, we would like to emphasize that the\ncontinuation of the United Nations as a centre for\nmultilateral discussion and action is indispensable. We\nacknowledge the need, however, to redefine its functions.\nFirst, there is a clear need to reform its bureaucratic\nstructures in order to make it more effective and efficient\nand to bring it more in line with the aspirations of the\nmajority of the world\u2019s population. Secondly, we must\nabide by our obligations under the Charter of the United\nNations to provide the necessary funds for its proper\nfunctioning, even though a restructuring of the current scale\nof assessed contributions could be considered.\nWe believe that if the United Nations is considered\nas a train of peace and development on these two tracks,\nhumankind will embrace our Organization, which will\nhelp us to move forward into the twenty-first century.\nOn the eve of the new millennium, it is imperative\nfor the international community to seek solutions to\npressing problems, of which abject poverty may well be\nthe most compelling. The solemn commitments of the\nWorld Summit for Social Development and the launching\nof 1996 as the International Year for the Eradication of\nPoverty and the period 1997-2006 as the United Nations\nDecade for the Eradication of Poverty have our full\nsupport. There is evidence the world over that continuing\npoverty, if not addressed adequately, will result in social\ndisharmony and in economic and political disorder, and\nwill become a threat to national and international peace\nand stability, thereby negatively affecting the growth and\nconsolidation of democracy and human rights.\nLet it be understood that all efforts to combat the\nscourge of illicit drug trafficking, terrorism and organized\ncrime will prove to be fruitless unless we present a united\nfront to eradicate poverty.\nSuriname has drawn unexpected international\nattention by its resolve to employ its timber resources for\nthe development of its people. My Government is aware\nof the concern of the international community as to the\npossible consequences of an unsustainable use of our\nforest. There are many examples throughout the world on\nhow we should not proceed, and we have learned from\nthose experiences.\nIn order to strike a proper balance between our\nactual needs for development and the needs of future\ngenerations, the Government of Suriname will abide by\nthe commitment expressed through its contribution at the\nRio Conference in 1992 and to the subsequent\ninvestigations and deliberations at various levels of\nsociety in conjunction with foreign investors. In all these\nendeavours we will continue to be cautious, with due\nregard for the interests of potential investors, the interests\nof our indigenous people and the need to protect the\ninterests of future generations.\nWe hope that the international community will also\nabide by its obligation to provide the necessary\ntechnological and financial assistance, thus contributing to\n6\n\n\nthe achievement of these goals. In this respect we look\nforward to the coming review meeting on the\nimplementation of Agenda 21.\nThe Government of the Republic of Suriname is very\nconcerned about the problem of illicit drug trafficking,\nbecause it poses special security problems for countries\nsuch as Suriname, which have insufficient resources to\nguard its hundreds of miles of shoreline and vast,\nunderpopulated land areas. Therefore, as part of our policy\nof maximum cooperation in the fight against drugs, we\nhave entered into cooperation agreements with many\ncountries in Latin America and the Caribbean, especially\nwith those States adjacent to Suriname. In this context, I\nshould like to mention the recently established and much\nappreciated cooperation between Surinamese police\nauthorities and the drug enforcement agencies of the\nGovernment of the United States of America. However,\nfinding an adequate solution to the drug problem will\ndepend in no small measure on whether equal attention is\ngiven to both the supply and the demand sides of this\nphenomenon.\nWhile reflecting on the issues facing our world and\namidst the many challenges to creating global solidarity, my\nGovernment wishes to express its serious concerns over the\ndevelopments in the Middle East, which have resulted in a\nvirtual discontinuation of the historic peace process. We\nhope that the parties concerned and the international\ncommunity will succeed in bringing the peace process back\non track. The agony of bloodshed and the loss of lives must\nbe avoided, and there are no alternatives to dialogue and\npeace.\nI am deeply honoured to have had the opportunity to\naddress this body on a number of issues that are of prime\nimportance to the Government and the people of the\nRepublic of Suriname. I would like to conclude by\nreiterating our commitment to contribute to the creation of\na new world order characterized by the eradication of\npoverty and based on a more just distribution of wealth and\non an atmosphere that augurs well for peace and global\nimprovement of the quality of life on this beautiful planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPerhaps the term \u201cglobalization\u201d, which occurs so\nfrequently in so many decisions nowadays, best describes\nthe international system which prevails in the present\ndecade and which, under the influence of a growing and\nclose interdependence, will extend into the twenty-first\ncentury. Admittedly, the term is not a precise one that\nsums up the broad and complex range of supranational\nphenomena that have been emerging since 1989, the year\nthat symbolizes the end of the cold war.\nIt is undoubtedly a term that is indicative of the fact\nthat today the cause-and-effect relationship in the\neconomic, political and even the cultural sphere\ntranscends traditional national borders more than ever.\nInterdependence is today more pronounced than ever\nbefore in history: markets, capital flows, research and\nproduction do not coincide with the political map. The\nindustrial assembly lines of advanced technology ignore\nnational borders, often making it difficult to determine the\norigin of a finished product, since its components come\nfrom such diverse sources. The political boundaries of\nStates are no longer boundaries of economic production\nand processes. The network of multinational corporations\nhas expanded to the extent that transactions between their\nsubsidiaries account for one quarter of world trade. In the\nface of the fluctuation and volatility of international\nelectronic transactions, the central banks of the most\ndeveloped countries already have difficulty controlling the\nexchange rates of their currencies or the level of interest\nrates. The recent establishment of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) is seen as the institutional\nculmination of this global trend towards liberalization of\ntrade in goods and services and as a force conducive to\ninterdependence.\nAccordingly, globalization, despite the various rates\nat which it operates in different parts of the world \u2014\nfrom the slow, deliberate pace at which it proceeds in\ncountries with agrarian economies to the dizzying rapidity\nof its progress in those possessing advanced\ntechnologies \u2014 appears to be the distinguishing mark of\n4\n\n\nthe post-cold-war era. This phenomenon increasingly lends\nitself to the dominance of a system of echoes and\nreflections between nations, of all manner of\ninterrelationships, which in theory should contribute to\ninternational stability, since according to classical doctrine,\nthe risks of military confrontation are reduced when nations\nbecome more interdependent economically and financially.\nNevertheless, recent events have revealed the contrary: new\nsources of tension and conflict have emerged on the\ninternational scene, as well as new unconventional forms of\nviolence and crime that affect world peace and destabilize\ncoexistence within and between democratic societies.\nIn this setting of globalization and interdependence,\nthe United Nations \u2014 with its universal composition, its\nagglutinative structure that brings together countries at the\nmost varied levels of human development and ethnic or\nreligious composition, its institutional capacity to act as a\npoint of articulation or a sounding board for all concerns or\naspirations that extend beyond the local, national or\nregional level \u2014 would be in an ideal position to play a\nleading and decisive role. In other words, this Organization\nis the forum that, by the nature and magnitude of its\nmissions, should embody or interpret more faithfully than\nany other institution these compelling, topical phenomena\nof globalization and interdependence.\nYet, this distinctive role of the United Nations remains\nan unrealized vision. It must be asked, then, whether the\nUnited Nations, an organic manifestation of the global\nsystem that has taken shape in this decade, is capable of\neffective, systematic action in preventive diplomacy. We\nwould take it one step further and ask what our own\nnational responsibility is, as a democratic State and a\nfounding Member of the United Nations, in strengthening\nits role in the face of new challenges.\nAlthough this may appear simplistic, it is possible to\nconceive of war as a consequence of poverty, injustice,\noverpopulation or poverty. But if these conditions have to\nbe eliminated before peace is feasible, then preventing or\nrestricting hostile tensions becomes a Utopian exercise. For\nthis reason, we believe that there is an urgent need to take\nan up-to-date, modern look at how the United Nations\nshould react and act in response to the new threats to peace,\nand at what its capacity should be to respond to the\nphenomena inherent in the recent or current forms of\nglobalization.\nOn considering these questions, we shall certainly\ncome up against an unavoidable obstacle: that of the nation\nin its traditional form and as the basic unit on which the\nstructure of the United Nations was built. This nation no\nlonger exercises a monopoly over international decisions,\nand consequently is not the exclusive determinant of their\nlegitimacy. To some extent, this phenomenon may be\nsimilar to that described as the emergence of the\nimprecise State, found in a wide variety of non-State\npolitical bodies or agents that have an international impact\nthrough the intricate network of non-governmental\norganizations and multinational political movements\nwhose proliferation is another sign of the new\ninterdependence, and which play an increasingly active\nrole in the management of the world system.\nUndoubtedly, Governments, as the executives of the\npolitical decisions of States, retain their essential powers\nin matters of diplomacy, security, defence,\nmacroeconomics and currency. Obviously, the United\nNations, sustained by the will of Governments, has acted\nand continues to act as a summarizer or synthesizer of\nthose various wills, without prejudice to the greater or\nlesser influence of the military or financial powers of its\nMember States. For this reason, quite naturally, the\nactivity or inactivity of the Organization depends on the\nconcerns or indifference of national Governments, or on\nthe way in which those Governments articulate their\nconsensus or disagreement. But other actors have also\ntaken the international stage, and they are not always a\npart of the multiplicity of non-governmental organizations.\nThere are also ethnic groups not assimilated into an\nexternally imposed nationality, so-called region-States,\nwith growing links to the world economy and decreasing\nlinks to national authorities, as well as religious\nmovements that transcend frontiers and inflame fanaticism\nwhich, in some cases, has terrorist effects.\nWe therefore see a dual and contradictory process:\nglobalization and fragmentation. On the one hand,\ninterdependence has given rise to an increasingly\ninterlinked world in which entities influence each other\nmutually, and this in theory would be conducive to the\nstrengthening of political units and the formation of\nmega-States or large regional blocs. On the other hand,\nand as a consequence of the progressive impact of these\nnew actors on the international scene, fragmentation has\nalso emerged. Since its establishment, the United Nations\nhas seen the number of Member States increase almost\nfivefold, and at present, approximately one third of these\ncountries has been significantly affected by insurgent or\ndissident movements or Governments in exile.\nFor all of these reasons, which are associated with\nthis dialectical process of globalization and fragmentation,\n5\n\n\nwith the growing international importance of a\nheterogeneous collection of new actors and with the\nemergence of non-conventional threats to peace that cannot\nbe reconciled through traditional mechanisms of collective\nsecurity, we need to rethink our Organization and to act in\nconsequence.\nThe restructuring of the United Nations is certainly not\na new issue. On its thirtieth, fortieth and fiftieth\nanniversaries, efforts at revision, or rather at reform,\nemerged, aimed at achieving greater efficiency in the\npursuit of its purposes. Unfortunately, however, the effort\ncurrently under way, like its predecessors, does not go to\nthe root of the problem, which lies far deeper than the\npursuit of administrative efficiency or the rationalization of\nfunctions. If we evaluate the current efforts to restructure\nthe United Nations, we see clearly that in practice virtually\nall of the reforms being studied have no more than a\nprocedural or formal impact, and do not make a decisive\ncontribution to strengthening the system, or at least its\nsubstance, especially if we bear in mind that this\nOrganization exists at a period in history characterized most\ndistinctly by an accelerated pace of change.\nUruguay fully and spontaneously agrees with the\nwidespread aspiration for change. Like the vast majority of\nStates represented here, our country feels a deep-seated,\nnatural inclination in favour of any means or instrument\nthat, at the global or regional level, prompts or compels\nnations to conduct themselves in accordance with law. For\ncountries such as ours, which are founded on the rule of\ninternational law, it is essential to support any effort to\nguarantee the legal order, the principles of law, and the rule\nof law in relations among States. This is not simply a\nrhetorical reaffirmation of our desire for peace or our\nconviction that international law must prevail.\nUruguay truly takes the principles of the Charter and\nthe purposes of this Organization as its own, from the\nmaintenance of peace and security \u2014 reflected in the fact\nthat our country contributes the largest number of troops\nper capita to international peacekeeping operations \u2014 to the\nrecognition of the primacy of international law \u2014 reflected\nin our being the first country to unconditionally accept the\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of\nJustice. Our position with regard to the United Nations is\nthus consistent with our historical definition of ourselves as\na nation, a definition anchored in respect for international\ncommitments and strict compliance with the principles of\ninternational law in all areas in which States bear\nresponsibility.\nWith reference to the agenda for the present session,\nand without prejudice to the statements the delegation of\nUruguay will be making in the various bodies of the\nAssembly, we believe it appropriate to make a few brief\ncomments on some items of particular interest.\nIt is clear that the reform of the Security Council has\ncaptured the attention of the international community,\nprecisely because of the post-cold-war changes I have\nmentioned. The potential impact of the Council on the\nevaluation, prevention or easing of international conflicts,\nand the effective application of the principle of legal\nequality among States make it necessary to have greater\ndemocratization or transparency in the decision-making\nprocess and more equitable geographical distribution in\nthe composition of the Council.\nUruguay has already expressed its support for\nincreasing the number of permanent members on the\nCouncil in the light of present-day world realities, but the\nnumber of non-permanent members should also be\nincreased, precisely because of the need for greater\ntransparency and greater representativeness. While many\nproposals for change have been put forward, we should at\nthe very least all agree that the Council\u2019s future\ncomposition should be designed so that the quest for more\nrepresentativeness does not adversely affect the Council\u2019s\noperational efficiency.\nWith regard to the question of Palestine and the\nsituation in the Middle East, and despite the various\nobstacles that continue to hamper the consolidation of a\nbroad and stable peace, it is essential that the international\ncommunity maintain its support for the peace process\ninitiated in Madrid in 1991. In the same spirit, it should\ncontinue to encourage direct talks between Israel, the\nPalestinian Authority and the Arab countries \u2014 as is\noccurring even today in the United States \u2014 with a view\nto achieving mutual recognition and the ultimate objective\nof a lasting peace throughout the Middle East. We are\nconfident that the talks taking place in Washington will\nculminate in the success to which we all aspire, and to\nwhich they seem to be leading.\nIn another context, integration processes are\nindispensable for fair competition in a world of\nsubregional blocks. In this regard, the countries of the\nSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) are\nconvinced that our integration process contributes to a\ntrue liberalization of trade. MERCOSUR constitutes an\nintegrated, open process that has created economic zones\nboth inside and outside the subregion. Thus, impetus has\n6\n\n\nbeen given to association with other States of the\nhemisphere, with other regional blocs and with countries\noutside the region. But above all, MERCOSUR has\ngenerated trade, both inside and outside the organization.\nMERCOSUR is today a demonstration of open regionalism,\nwhich affirms the commitments and, above all, the\nteachings of the World Trade Organization.\nThere is no question that free trade has been and\nremains one of the cornerstones of world economic\ndevelopment, as was repeatedly recognized during the\nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade (GATT). For this very reason, we cannot endorse\nunilateral efforts to effect the extraterritorial application of\ndomestic legislation and as a consequence of which,\nwhether by virtue of their letter or their spirit, a country\nwould be able to extend the applicability of its laws beyond\nits own national borders, undermining not only the principle\nof non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States but\nalso freedom of trade, which is the very essence of the\nWorld Trade Organization, recently established by the\ninternational community.\nWhile our hopes for the establishment of\nrepresentative democracy throughout our continent remain\nas strong as ever, we continue to oppose the unilateral\napplication of economic, trade or financial measures against\na State for political purposes. The usefulness of such\nmeasures for the rapid and peaceful transition of a country\ntowards democracy has not yet been demonstrated.\nWith regard to cooperation for development, we recall\nthat the countries with greater capacities to contribute\nundertook to allocate at least 0.7 per cent of their gross\ndomestic product for that purpose. Yet there has been a\nsignificant downward trend in contributions stemming from\nthat commitment in recent years, and this trend cannot be\nlinked to the financial crisis the Organization is\nexperiencing. These are resources intended to fight poverty\nand underdevelopment and to create more dignified living\nconditions for our peoples. Nor should we confine\ncooperation to a vertical, one-way process; rather, we must\nalso view it in terms of South-South cooperation, availing\nourselves of our mutual experience to create our own\ncompetitive advantages.\nA few days ago, Uruguay became one of the first\nsignatories to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nTogether with other developments, such as the Advisory\nOpinion of the International Court of Justice regarding the\nlegality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, this\nTreaty constitutes a basic instrument for the reaffirmation\nof the principles of international peace and security.\nStill in the field of disarmament, we have repeatedly\nvoiced our opposition to the transfer, stockpiling, export\nand production of anti-personnel landmines. Accordingly,\nwe shall continue to support keenly all initiatives aimed\nat eliminating them, as well as at securing the immediate\nentry into force of the Protocol adopted in Vienna last\nMay. Uruguayan contingents assigned to peacekeeping\nMissions in Angola, Mozambique and Western Sahara\nhave been among the many victims of these weapons, and\nit is the moral obligation of humankind to eradicate them.\nFinally, we should like to close by referring to one\nof the clearest and most tangible manifestations of the\nphenomenon of globalization we have sought to describe:\nthe production, trafficking and consumption of illegal\ndrugs. This is one of the most tragic forms of\ninternational organized crime, and its growing seriousness\nis demonstrated by statistics from the most varied sources.\nIts transnational nature makes it essential that the\nprinciple of shared responsibility should be systematically\napplied \u2014 without exception or unilateralism \u2014 to the\nentire cycle of production, trafficking and consumption.\nThis is a tightly wound chain whose links include all\ncountries without exception.\nPlease accept, Mr. President, our sincerest\ncongratulations on your election to guide the work of the\nAssembly and the firmest commitment of the Government\nof the Eastern Republic of Uruguay to support you in\nyour activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe delegation of Panama wishes to join in the very\nwarm congratulations that the President has already\nreceived from the speakers who have preceded me. His\nwell-deserved election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-first session attests to his skills and\npersonal merits, and at the same time reflects the esteem\nthat Malaysia, a prominent member of the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has come to enjoy in\nthe family of nations.\nI am also very pleased that this particular part of our\nmeeting is being chaired by our colleague from the\nPhilippines, Ambassador Mabilangan.\nAllow me on this solemn occasion to pay tribute to\nthe eminent Portuguese statesman Diogo Freitas do\nAmaral, who presided over the historic fiftieth session\nwith great wisdom, poise and humanism and shed his\nparticular light on the institutional reform of the United\nNations.\nAt the fiftieth session of the General Assembly\nPanama proposed, together with the United States and\nFrance, that the United Nations and interested countries\nshould take a decisive part in the holding of the Universal\nCongress on the Panama Canal, which will take place in\nSeptember 1997. On that occasion the Assembly adopted\nresolution 50/12 (1995), which in its operative part,\n\u201cUrges the competent organs, programmes and\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations system,\nin particular, the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the United Nations Environment\nProgramme and the International Maritime\nOrganization, to study the possibility of providing\nassistance from within existing resources for the\norganization of the Universal Congress on the\nPanama Canal\u201d. (resolution 50/12, para. 3)\nIn the first operative paragraph the Assembly noted\nthat it\n\u201cSupports the initiative of the Government of\nPanama in convening the Universal Congress on the\nPanama Canal, with the participation of\nGovernments, international bodies, public and\nprivate academic institutions, maritime users and\n7\n\n\ninternational shipping companies, to examine jointly\nthe role which the Panama Canal should play in the\ntwenty-first century\u201d. (Ibid., para. 1)\nThe Government of Panama has a particular interest in\nseeing that Member States of the United Nations, as well as\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations of\nthe international community, are informed about how\nPanama, as a sovereign State, is preparing to take on all the\nresponsibilities stemming from the final transfer of the\ninteroceanic canal in 1999, pursuant to the provisions of the\nTorrijos-Carter Treaties.\nOne calendar year from the holding of the Congress,\nI wish to inform the General Assembly that the Panamanian\nGovernment is hard at work on preparations and stepping\nup consultations with international organizations and\nfriendly countries in order to secure meaningful\nparticipation. The Panama Canal Congress will be universal\nin terms of participation; it will also be universal because\nPanama, with its universalist and Bolivarian traditions, takes\nthe view that international maritime transport should be\nopen uninterruptedly to all the flags of the world on an\nequal footing and under a neutral and universal regime that\nobliges us all to ensure its peaceful use and transit, taking\ninto account the expansion of international trade and the\ngrowth of the world economy.\nOurs is a time in which nations appear to be closer\nthan ever and in which there are tremendous opportunities\nto improve the living conditions of all. At the same time,\nthe existence of numerous imbalances, obstacles, risks and\ndangers gives Governments and peoples grounds for\nconcern.\nIt is not only remarkable achievements of science,\ntechnology and trade that are being globalized;\nunfortunately, hunger and environmental degradation are\nalso being globalized. There are still national and\ninternational situations that are marked by the denial of\nfundamental values and that affect human rights and the\nfreedom of peoples. There are growing inequalities between\nmembers of our societies and between nations, and certain\ninjustices still persist in some aspects of international\nrelations. Arms trafficking and overt or covert resistance to\nagreements and initiatives to reverse the arms race are signs\nthat attitudes of expediency are prevailing, to the detriment\nof our hopes for peace and agreement and our aspirations\nto sustainable development. Terrorism, organized crime and\ntransnational crime conspire and feed off one another on an\nunprecedented international scale, exploiting the many faces\nof drug use, which is a threat to all mankind.\nThese concerns dominated the agenda of the Rio\nGroup at its tenth summit, held a month ago in\nCochabamba, Bolivia. It was an opportunity to underscore\nat the highest possible political level the serious\nchallenges facing Latin America and the Caribbean,\nwhose average poverty levels have reached alarming\nlevels despite the tremendous efforts of our Governments\nto reduce them.\nAt that meeting the Panamanian Government\nstated \u2014 and I reaffirm here in this forum \u2014 that poverty\nand corruption are powerful forces threatening the\ndemocracies of the continent. On that occasion, the\nPresident of Panama, Mr. Ernesto P\u00e9rez Balladares,\nstated:\n\u201cWhen Nations embark on political adventures\ndivorced from institutionality, they do not do so\nbecause they reject in theory the benefits of\ndemocracy, but because they associate their own\ndespair with the regime under which they live ... For\nthis reason, until the new concepts governing\neconomic relations among countries today and\ndemocracy throughout the continent are accompanied\nby investment in social sectors and a genuine\nmodernization of education to help close the gap, the\nsectors of the population affected by poverty will\nultimately reject what we here today quite rightly\nthink should be permanent values of modern\nsocieties.\u201d\nFor this reason, we wish to reiterate our\nunderstanding of and solidarity with the problems of\nhunger and poverty suffered by countries in other regions,\nin particular the least developed countries, the majority of\nwhich are in Africa, and certain countries in our region\nthat are particularly vulnerable. Whatever may be the\nstandpoint chosen for consideration of the great issues\ncontained on the agenda of this fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly, we should always approach them with\nthe desire to respond appropriately.\nThe organization of social life always presupposes\nnormative vision and action. The United Nations has\nproved its capacity to propose to the international\ncommunity a body of norms whose effectiveness depends\non their universal application. The fundamental debate\nthat has been going on in the area of human rights since\nthe creation of the United Nations has resulted in the\nenshrinement of those rights in legally binding texts and\nin declarations and programmes of action stemming from\nthe major conferences held by the United Nations in\n8\n\n\nrecent years. We are encouraged by the fact that that\nenshrinement is encompassing the rights of solidarity in the\ncontext of problems concerning the environment,\npopulation, society, women\u2019s issues and housing.\nThe Government of Panama is mindful of the complex\ndialectic interactions between peace, human rights and\ndevelopment. The desire to ensure effective democratization\nin national life and to foster development is at the core of\nthe activities the Panamanian Government is carrying out to\nbenefit children, young people, women, indigenous and\nrural populations, the disabled and certain particularly\ndisadvantaged urban groups.\nThe Government\u2019s activities relating to fulfilment of\nthe Platform for Action adopted at the Beijing Conference\non Women represent commitments strengthened by our\njustifiable satisfaction over Panama\u2019s fairly encouraging\nindicators regarding the advancement of women. The accent\nis currently being placed on the sector of the female\npopulation living in unfavourable conditions of health,\nhousing and education and having little participation in\npolitical life.\nIn the context of this constantly renewed effort to find\nthe best solutions to national problems, the delegation of\nPanama wishes to express to the Secretary-General our\nthanks and recognition for the cooperation activities that\nhave been carried out in Panama by the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, as a recognized and neutral\nfacilitator, to promote national consensus on the Panama\nCanal issues. The successes already achieved in this area\ndemonstrate that the actions of the United Nations its\nsystem in Panama are effective and have an impact on the\nlife of the nation.\nThree months ago Panama ratified the Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea, the implementation of which has\nbecome more effective since the establishment of the\nInternational Seabed Authority and the International\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea. Panama, as a maritime\ncountry, welcomes these promising developments and hopes\nthat there will be further achievements in the application of\nthe Convention.\nThe Government of Panama has great expectations for\nits future participation as a member of the Governing\nCouncil of the United Nations Environment Programme and\nin the Commission on Sustainable Development. We will\nstrive to make our contribution and to prove our\ncommitment to overcoming environmental problems. The\nstrategic importance of issues associated with biodiversity\nis such that my Government hopes that new and\nadditional funds will be made available to promote\nactivities in this field. We have the same hope in\nconnection with climate change, the ozone layer,\ndesertification and the conservation of forests.\nIn the area of international peace and security, we\nreconfirm our agreement with those Governments that\nadvocate a total ban on the production, use, trafficking in\nand transfer of anti-personnel land-mines. With respect to\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which has\nbeen signed by Panama, we continue to hold the same\nview as in previous years. In this respect, we welcome\nBrazil\u2019s initiative to make the southern hemisphere a zone\nfree of nuclear weapons. This estimable initiative adds to\nthe efforts of Latin America and the Caribbean to foster\na world free of nuclear weapons, efforts that were\nlaunched with the signing and ratification of the\nTlatelolco Treaty.\nUpon learning of the response of the International\nCourt of Justice to the request issued by the General\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session, my Government\nwelcomed the backing given by that principal organ of\nthe United Nations to the negotiations on a ban on\nnuclear weapons, including tests. We signed the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty on the\nunderstanding that implicit in it is a commitment on the\npart of world Powers to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free\nworld.\nPanama has always supported those who believe that\nif a part of the funds absorbed by the arms industry could\nbe made available to combat poverty, ignorance and\ndisease, there would be positive changes all over the face\nof our Earth.\nPanama has already expressed in the United Nations\nits position and views on the problem of drugs, most\nrecently at the high-level segment of the substantive\nsession of the Economic and Social Council in June. We\nwould like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our support\nof Mexico\u2019s initiative, co-sponsored by the Rio Group, on\nconvening a special session of the General Assembly in\n1998, which would offer an opportunity to update the\nvarious debates, concepts, approaches and consensus\npositions on the issue of illicit drugs and related crimes.\nThe Government of Panama has made significant progress\nin developing the proposal presented to the Rio Group to\ncreate a multilateral centre in Panama to combat drug\ntrafficking and related crimes.\n9\n\n\nWe are glad to announce the recent holding in our\ncountry of the first international talks on the creation of that\ncentre, attended by Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico,\nPeru, Venezuela and Panama. We agreed at that meeting to\nhold another meeting in December 1996 to take decisions\non the training module included in the plans for the\nmultilateral training and research institute to combat drug\ntrafficking and related crimes. Another meeting will take\nplace early in 1997 to study and decide upon the\noperational module as a means of combatting drug\ntrafficking and related crimes, which is essentially civilian\nin nature and cooperating with the military forces that will\nlend additional support.\nIn a similar vein, the Panamanian Government also\nlends its support and solidarity to the international\ncommunity\u2019s struggle to combat terrorism. Terrorist\nactivity, no matter what the reasoning behind it may be, is\ncriminal and immoral, and exceeds all limits. Its sole face\nis that of fanaticism. Terrorism is the offspring of the\napocalypse, nihilistic and gratuitous in nature, capable of\ncrushing human freedom and claiming a terrible harvest of\ninnocent lives.\nOther topics on the agenda of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly are of particular interest to the\nGovernment of Panama. Negotiations on establishing an\nAgenda for Development oblige us not only to talk about\nthis but to act, prompted by the universal duty to cooperate\nwhich encompasses all individuals and all communities.\nThe common undertaking of sustainable development\nshould be carried out through shared responsibilities. For\nthis reason, we welcome the decision taken by Member\nStates to politically reactivate the Economic and Social\nCouncil. Now, what is needed is the political will to equip\nthe United Nations with an Agenda for Development which\nwill not limit development solely to its economic\ncomponent: though that is necessary, it is not enough.\nDevelopment should also provide the key part of common\nwell-being and be placed at the service of purposes\nconsciously accepted by all, purposes that will enrich the\nlives of all, purposes that will enhance the creative capacity\nof every individual and be securely grounded in a human\ndimension which implies faith in oneself and paves the way\nfor progress.\nWhatever approach is taken in addressing the major\nissues on the agenda of this fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly, the human being, his hopes and\nsufferings and the obstacles and opportunities he faces to\nimprove the quality of his life, should always have\nprecedence. In spite of the dazzling clarity with which we\nperceive this certainty, it would seem that we sometimes\nlose sight of the fact that the human individual is the\nultimate focus of this Organization and of all the\nagreements and plans of actions that we arrive at within\nit and stemming from it. All our decisions should be\ndesigned to meet the demands, needs, requirements and\ninterests of human beings.\nThis requires a revitalization of the ethical side of\nthe United Nations. My delegation appreciates the\nendeavours of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali. He has placed his unquestioned talent and\nefforts at the service of the Organization. His unswerving\ninternationalism and his commitment to world peace and\ndevelopment mean that Panama takes great pleasure in\nexpressing its gratitude for his work.\nA year ago we were welcoming the effort made by\ntwo great men who were struggling tirelessly to\nconsolidate peace agreements and move towards peaceful\ncoexistence in the Middle East. Today one of those men\nis no longer with us. Panama wishes to express a\nposthumous tribute of recognition to Yitzhak Rabin, a\nmartyr of the peace process between two peoples,\nPalestine and Israel, with which our people and our\nGovernment have deeply-rooted friendly relations because\nthe children of those peoples live together on our soil and\nare helping us to build a better country. Now that\nfratricidal struggle is casting both nations into mourning,\nPanama reaffirms its support for all the initiatives and\nresolutions that will strengthen peace and promote\ntolerance.\nWe are very concerned about the events which took\nplace as a result of changes effected in the Holy Sites of\nJerusalem, to which the Security Council referred in its\nresolution 1073 (1996) on Saturday, 28 September 1996.\nThe Security Council called for an immediate cessation\nand reversal of all acts that had resulted in the\naggravation of the situation and that had negative\nimplications for the Middle East peace process. It\nlikewise called for the safety and protection of the\nPalestinian civilians to be ensured. Finally, it called for\nthe immediate resumption of negotiations within the\nMiddle East peace process on its agreed basis and the\ntimely implementation of the agreements reached.\nAnother matter of concern to us relates to the\nChinese people, a people with which Panama has\nmaintained relations since very early in the last century.\nMy country has benefitted from a continued migration\nwhich, from the building of the interoceanic railway to\n10\n\n\nthat of the Canal, has contributed to our development and\nto the fashioning of our national identity. This deep-rooted\nand lasting relationship with the Chinese people has\nstrengthened our nation\u2019s and our Governments\u2019 support for\nthe principle of the universality of the United Nations.\nPanama maintains diplomatic relations with the Republic of\nChina and feels bound to state that those relations have\nbeen fruitful and beneficial. They have always been\ncharacterized by respect and have been receptive to and\nincorporated the interests and needs of both sides. For this\nreason, we feel that our relations are exemplary in the best\npossible sense.\nOn the other hand, in a few years\u2019 time Panama will\nassume full responsibility for the interoceanic Canal and, in\nthe context of that responsibility, Panama must\nacknowledge that the People\u2019s Republic of China is one of\nthe main users of the waterway both in terms of the number\nof vessels and in terms of the volume of cargo originating\nin or destined for the People\u2019s Republic of China. We are\nencouraged by the fact that a significant number of Chinese\ncitizens and companies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait\nlive and work in harmony in Panama, where they have won\nthe respect and affection of Panamanians because of their\ndiligent hard work. We are convinced of the validity of the\nprinciple of one China, and we reaffirm our support for the\nefforts of both parties to unify the Chinese people. We\nreiterate our conviction that they will achieve that purpose\nin a framework of mutual respect that gradually helps to\nbuild trust between the two parties and create a favourable\nenvironment for Chinese reunification.\nThe question of Security Council reform, the increase\nin the number of its members and other related matters is\nof irrefutable importance for the United Nations, as is the\nquestion of the strengthening of the role of the United\nNations. It is unacceptable to try to change the membership\nof the Security Council solely on the basis of supposed\nessential features that make certain countries more suitable\nthan others to join decision-making organs and hold seats\nin the Security Council. Because of the functions it\nperforms, today\u2019s state of affairs and a moral commitment\nto the future of the United Nations, we call for a reform of\nthe Security Council that will provide regional\nrepresentation, an increase in both membership\ncategories \u2014 permanent and non-permanent \u2014 and\nequitable distribution.\nThe Government of Panama regards the Italian\nproposal as a democratic approach that responds to the\nconcern for representativity. We were encouraged by the\nwillingness to negotiate, with a view to achieving\nconsensus, voiced by the Italian Minister for Foreign\nAffairs last week from this rostrum. In the issues of\nSecurity Council reform and the strengthening of the role\nof the United Nations, the best possible ideas and loftiest\npurposes should come into play. We wish to see a better,\nmore effective and more representative Security Council.\nWe would also like to see opportunities to participate in\nthe United Nations go hand in hand with the\nresponsibility to act to ensure international peace and\nsecurity and for these to be seen from the perspective of\ntheir relationships with democracy and development. The\nPanamanian Government has decided to reaffirm its\nsupport for Japan and Germany having permanent seats\non the Security Council.\nI could not conclude without fulfilling my duty as a\nPanamanian to reiterate before this world Organization\nthat Panama is ready to assume sovereign control over the\nPanama Canal in 1999, with all the administrative,\noperational and security responsibilities entailed in the full\nimplementation of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties.\nPanamanians\u2019 shouldering of the main responsibility for\nthe Panama Canal will coincide with the advent of the\ntwenty-first century. We shall march resolutely into the\nnew millennium, looking forward to a promising future in\nwhich it will become clear that Panama\u2019s universalist\nvocation has never wavered, and we strongly reaffirm that\nvocation.\nPanama\u2019s universalism, I am proud to say, is an\nethical one, capable of absorbing the most diverse\ncurrents of thought and human action, whether from the\nNorth, South, East or West. Our geography made us this\nway, and our history opened us up to the world \u2014\nobviously, commercially, but above all culturally.\nAs of 31 December 1999 Panama will be better\nintegrated in the world because it will be able to make\nfree use of its entire territory for the integration of its\nnation. We shall then have to cope with the tremendous\nneed to make full use of our potential and abilities and to\nfully exercise our rights and fulfil our responsibilities. On\n31 December 1999 the Panamanian nation will be at the\ncentre of an excitement sparked by the joining in our\nveins and souls, of the past and the future, of the\nstruggles of generations, of joy and suffering and of the\nmany endeavours that all bear the same name, a name\nthat designates a common objective, a single mission that\nmany times engendered fervour and even heroism.\nIn the twenty-first century, Panama will still be a\nsmall country. What will be different, I repeat, is the full\n\n\n\nintegration of the Panamanian nation in its territory, the\nsimple but intense and far-reaching meeting of a nation\nwith the entirety of its territory. The existence of an\ninteroceanic waterway, the Panama Canal, in that territory\nwill prompt us to pursue, step up and deepen our efforts to\nestablish the right approaches and institutions to complete\nour sovereign life as a nation and to facilitate the fulfilment\nof our universalist vocation. That universalism will make it\npossible for us to continue to participate in the realities of\na globalized and interdependent world with the desire to\nmake it a source of mutual enrichment, openness, initiative\nand creativity.\nIt is a fortunate historical coincidence that on\nWednesday of this week, 2 October 1996, the General\nCouncil of the World Trade Organization (WTO) decided\nto accept the report of its subsidiary organ concerning\nPanama\u2019s accession, thus ensuring its entry as a full\nmember of the World Trade Organization. We welcome the\nfact that, with the accession of Panama, all countries in the\nLatin American region have become members of the WTO.\nWe all aspire to see a United Nations that will be\nready to deal with present and future problems. Panama\nhopes to contribute to the vital consensuses and aspires to\nbecome part of the necessary renewal of the United\nNations. As part of the Panamanian experience since the\ncreation of the United Nations, I personally have taken part\nin the Organization\u2019s intergovernmental machinery often\nenough to be able to speak of faith. With faith in the\nUnited Nations, we have often been capable of moving\nmountains of mistrust and misunderstanding, which have\ncovered the world in a landscape of conflict and deadlock.\nThanks to that faith in the United Nations, today we can\nspeak of new generations of human rights and new\ngenerations of peacekeeping operations, which, in the view\nof men and women of my generation are proof that the\nUnited Nations represents a victory over the erosive effects\nof time and history.\nMy delegation believes that the United Nations has\naccomplished wonderful tasks through its constructive\nconsideration of various manifestations of human diversity\nand through the taking of decisions that give them a\nproductive, secure and peaceful place on Earth.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, allow\nme, Sir, to express my delegation\u2019s congratulations upon\nyour election to the high position of President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session.\nThe Afghan trauma, which was imposed by others\nand endured by the Afghan people, continues to have\ndisturbing consequences for our nation. For the world, it\nmay be just another trouble spot. But for Afghans, it\nmeans agony, pain, loss, psychological trauma and an\nunknown future. We must not forget that there is still\nhope. It lies in the international connection between me\nand other representatives and, through them, to their\ncountrymen. The United Nations was built on that dream\nand today, that connection is once again being made \u2014\nit is the fifty-first connection.\nTwo tragic dates will stand out in the recent history\nof Afghanistan: 27 December 1979 and 27 September\n1996. Both were black days that trigger bitter memories\nin the minds of all patriotic Afghans. The first date\nreminds them of the occupation by the former Soviet\nUnion and the second, of another occupying force, backed\nby another neighbour.\nThe force occupying parts of our homeland today is\nknown as the Taliban \u2014 a name that became very\nfamiliar to the General Assembly at the previous session.\n3\n\n\nWhat was the Taliban\u2019s first act when it captured Kabul? It\nwas to attack not a military garrison, but the United Nations\noffice in Afghanistan. Its first act was to breach the sanctity\nof the United Nations compound, in violation of all\naccepted international norms and laws.\nThat is the Taliban. As European Commissioner,\nEmma Bonino, said yesterday, the Taliban is a force that\nthreatens to take Afghanistan back to the dark ages.\nNumerous international media reports from Kabul draw a\npicture of an organization supported from abroad, imposing\na draconian system on a terrified people. The Taliban have\nordered schools and universities to close and stopped all\neducation and employment for women. There are numerous\nreports from the media, the United States authorities and\nthe United Nations on the role of the Taliban in a $75\nbillion heroin export industry in Afghanistan.\nOn 1 October 1996, The New York Times said that the\n1 million people who live in Kabul alone had been plunged\ninto the\n\u201clabyrinth that is Taliban rule\u201d.\nOn 3 October 1996 the Reuters news agency said that,\nwhile the Taliban has tried to seek international recognition,\nit has been greeted with \u201csuspicion \u2014 and fear\u201d. In just\ntheir first week in Kabul, the Taliban earned the\ncondemnation of Amnesty International.\nThese are not the words of the Afghan Government\ndescribing the Taliban occupation \u2014 these are the words of\nAmnesty International:\n\u201cDespite statements from their leadership\nsuggesting moderation, it is clear that Taleban guards\nare busily implementing a reign of terror in Kabul ...\nFamilies are afraid to go out into the streets, afraid to\nanswer their doors, and afraid that their loved ones\nwill suffer the brutal consequence\u201d\nof Taliban rule. Amnesty International accuses the Taliban\nof seizing, in house-to-house searches in the capital, up to\n1,000 prisoners, who were forced to walk over the front-\nline minefields.\nFrench television showed the Taliban storming into the\nKabul museum, where they destroyed many artifacts, relics\nand statues that were unique. Those artifacts and statues\nbelonged to the Buddhist era and are irreplaceable.\nI am talking about the Taliban, which is\noverwhelmed by foreign-fomented hatred, mandated by a\nforeign-crafted agenda and committed to the annihilation\nof the political, social and economic fabric of\nAfghanistan. It is an organization whose display of terror\nin Kabul breaks all records. In short, the Taliban are\nmercenaries \u2014 an illegal and illegitimate force that has\nbeen imposed on the Afghan people.\nOnce again, foreign interference is the main cause of\nthe continued conflict in Afghanistan. The current state of\nterror and chaos, touching the lives of every living soul\nin Kabul, is the direct consequence of that interference.\nWe have at our disposal hard evidence that we will\nsubmit in due course to the Security Council for\nappropriate consideration. What could prove that there is\nforeign interference better than the foreign militias, which\ninclude some officers, who were recently captured on the\nbattlefield by the armed forces of the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan?\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan firmly believes that\nthe so-called Taliban is a perfect example of a mercenary\nforce as defined by the International Convention against\nthe Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of\nMercenaries, adopted by the General Assembly in 1989.\nWe are not denying the existence among the Taliban of\nAfghan youths who were raised across the border and\nattended religious schools there, but it cannot be stated\ntoo clearly that the main corps of the Taliban military\nstaff consists of officers and militia forces from beyond\nour borders, paid by military-industrial magnates trying to\noverthrow the Islamic State of Afghanistan.\nThe United Nations General Assembly, on 21\nDecember 1995, adopted a resolution which condemned\nany State that permits or tolerates the recruitment,\nfinancing, training, assembly, transit and use of\nmercenaries with the objective of overthrowing the\nGovernment of any State Member of the United Nations,\nespecially that of a developing country.\nThe Charter of the United Nations, in various\nArticles, urges all Members to develop friendly relations\namong themselves and to refrain in their international\nrelations from the threat or use of force against the\nterritorial integrity or political independence of any State.\nOn the occasion of the commemoration of the\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations on 24\nOctober 1970, the General Assembly approved the\n4\n\n\nDeclaration on Principles of International Law concerning\nFriendly Relations and Cooperation among States. The first\nprinciple declares that States shall refrain in their\ninternational relations from the threat or use of force\nagainst the territorial integrity or political independence of\nany State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the\npurposes of the United Nations.\nThe Seventh Islamic Summit Conference in\nCasablanca on 13 December 1994, the Conference of Heads\nof State and Government of the Non-Aligned Countries on\n18 October of 1995 in Cartagena de Indias, the General\nAssembly resolution on Afghanistan of 19 December 1995\nand the Twenty-third Islamic Conference of Foreign\nMinsters on 9 December 1995 held in Conakry, Guinea, all\ninsist vigorously on the principle of non-intervention and\nrespect for the territorial integrity and independence of\nAfghanistan and on a peace process based on genuine intra-\nAfghan dialogue.\nIt is a matter of great disappointment that persistent\nappeals to the United Nations made by the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan to send a fact-finding mission to inquire into\nand investigate the level, degree and nature of foreign\nintervention in Afghanistan remain unanswered.\nLast year, we presented facts about the Taliban from\nthis rostrum. Our plight went unheard. We are afraid, given\nthe accounts of documented facts by the press and our clear\nstand on the legacy of the Taliban, that our plight might go\nunheard once more. That will be even more catastrophic\nthan the Taliban take-over itself.\nThe latest reports, as recent as yesterday, reveal some\nshocking realities and facts about the Taliban attacks on the\nareas surrounding Kabul, the capital. Allow me to unveil\nthe screened and concealed crime that the Taliban, assisted\nby their outside sponsors, committed very recently. Exactly\n26 days ago, on 11 September 1996, intelligence sources of\nthe Defence Ministry of the Islamic State of Afghanistan\nintercepted and recorded a Taliban radio transmission\nbetween Nangarhar and Kandahar. That transmission says\nthe following:\n\u201cGive regards to the victorious Mullah Shukrullah ...\nTell him that new APR weapons have already been\nbrought to Kandahar. You should immediately send\nthese arms, which are gas weapons, through Torkhan\ntowards Nangarhar because we have organized a\ngroup of Taliban with special gear and are waiting for\nthe said weapons. We can capture large areas with\na single round.\u201d\nOn 17 September, just six days later, I personally\ntook this report, submitted to me by the Ministry of\nDefence, and presented it to the State Supreme Council,\nconvened under the leadership of Mr. Rabbani, the\nPresident of Afghanistan, in Blandage bunker, just north\nof Kabul, the capital. I still remember an overwhelming\nstillness occupied the room after I submitted the report.\nAfter a brief calmness, a member of the Council\nremarked that maybe the report had been passed around\nto demoralize State troops; hence, not enough attention\nwas paid to the issue.\nYesterday, we obtained a shocking \u2014 and I repeat,\nshocking \u2014 report from the headquarters of the\nGovernment in Taloqan, which reminded me of the\nSupreme Council meeting. Officials of the Islamic State\nof Afghanistan recorded radio conversations by the\nTaliban in the front line around evening on 26 September,\nthe night before the Taliban take-over of Kabul. The\nfollowing assurances were reported:\n\u201cReassure the leaders that the new weapons have\nhad good results in Lata Band, Bande-Ghazi and\nPuli-Charkhi.\u201d\nThese areas, for the information of the\nrepresentatives, are located to the east of Kabul, the\ncapital.\nMore staggering realities are provided by the\neyewitness reports of those who saw the areas afterwards.\nThese eyewitnesses have reported that they saw most of\nthe corpses of the Government troops laying on the\nground without any sign of injury from a bullet or arsenal\npenetration in their bodies. However, they did reveal that\nthey had noticed that the Government troops had bled\nfrom their noses, eyes and ears. Mr. Muslim, a veteran\ncommander of the Government, who witnessed similar\nsituations during the Soviet occupation, has remarked that:\n\u201cThe Taliban advance in the front line completely\nsurprised me. I then realized that the Taliban must\nbe in possession of some kind of weapons more\nadvanced than we had seen, possessed or known.\u201d\nMr. Muslim, the commander, continues:\n5\n\n\n\u201cChemical weapons hadn\u2019t crossed my mind until\nthe evening of 26 September during the Taliban\u2019s\nfierce attack on Lata Band. I received a radio\ntransmission that a large number of our men were\nbeing lost and even when I commanded the rest to\nretreat, I heard no reply. I contacted my headquarters.\nI was ordered to examine the front line. One hour had\npassed since my initial contact with the front line\nwhen I arrived there. Then I saw Commander Saboor,\nlying dead on the battle ground. I only noticed blood\naround his nose and ears. Saboor was a close friend of\nmine. Suddenly, I had a flashback of the Red Army\nusing similar weapons during the jihad. I really\nwanted to take his body, which had no trace of\nexternal injury, back with me. But the intensity of\nfighting did not give me the chance.\u201d\nBased on this account, it is the strong conviction of\nthe Islamic State of Afghanistan that the foreign sponsors\nof the Taliban have provided them with some type of\ninternationally banned gas or chemical weapon which were\nused in the Taliban onslaught for the capture of Kabul, the\ncapital, where they encountered strong resistance.\nWe are bringing this tragic episode to the attention of\nthis Assembly and therefore appeal to the international\ncommunity immediately to assign a team of inquiry to\ninvestigate the case to which I have referred.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan has continuously\nprovided information to the United Nations Special Mission\nand to the Security Council about the military acts of the\nTaliban, which have systematically refused to accept the\nUnited Nations peace process.\nIn a letter to the Secretary-General of the United\nNations dated 5 September 1995 (S/1995/767), the\nGovernment of Afghanistan warned the international\ncommunity about the dangers of the fragmentation and\ndisintegration of Afghanistan and of the possibility of the\nTaliban military advances getting out of control.\nIn the letter to the Secretary-General dated 14\nSeptember 1995, the Islamic State of Afghanistan\nforecasted\n\u201cthe outcome of this new tension as alarming and\nperilous\u201d\nand earnestly called for the prompt dispatching\n\u201cof a fact-finding mission to western Afghanistan in\norder to report during the consultations to the\nSecurity Council\u201d. (S/1995/795, p. 2)\nThe Secretary-General, in a letter dated 22\nSeptember 1995, assured that,\n\u201cThe United Nations remains committed to the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan\nand opposed to all external interference in your\ncountry. I am using the mandates entrusted to me by\nthe Member States to do all I can to resolve the\nsources of conflict which contribute to instability in\nAfghanistan. I shall continue to pursue a\ncomprehensive approach to the overall peace\nprocess, in which the Special Mission will continue\nto play the main United Nations role. I ask that you\ncontinue to cooperate with it.\u201d\nIn a letter dated 27 September 1995 to the Secretary-\nGeneral, the Islamic State of Afghanistan stated that,\n\u201cTaliban not only undermined peace and\ntranquillity in the western parts of the country, but\nin the meantime, posed an external practical menace\nto the territorial integrity of Afghanistan.\u201d\n(S/1995/823, annex, p. 3)\nand that,\n\u201cthe most reasonable and practical way to peace, and\nappropriate atmosphere for a peaceful transfer of\npower to an elected authority enjoying the\nconfidence of the people, is first and foremost the\nneed to ease off the present crisis of confidence'\u201d.\n(ibid.)\nIn the general debate of 4 October 1995, we declared\nthat attempts by\n\u201creactionary groups to destabilize a moderate Islamic\nsystem which believes in democracy and human\nrights, are wrong in their assessments and\ncalculations. Such foreign circles may think that\nafter the usurpation of power by the Taliban all will\ngo well for them. In fact, they will add a further\nproblem, especially by bringing onto the scene a\nfaction which has no factual presence on\nAfghanistan\u2019s political scene. These circles should\nbe aware that the peace and security in the capital,\nthe actual relative peace and stability in the country\n6\n\n\nand in the region, would be jeopardized by such an\nerroneous miscalculation. The same error was made\nby the former Soviet Union in 1979.\u201d (Official\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session,\nPlenary Meetings, 19th meeting, p. 10)\nAs far as the activities of the United Nations Special\nMission are concerned, we suggested, in a letter dated 30\nSeptember 1995, that the efforts of the Secretary-General\n\u201cand those of Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri, Head of\nthe United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan,\nwould benefit from the establishment of a contact\ngroup on Afghanistan composed of States, but not the\nones immediately involved, as well as of interested\norganizations.\u201d (A/50/510, annex, p. 2)\nIn a letter dated 12 October 1995, we warned that,\n\u201cThe different leaders of the Taliban have several\ntimes declared their rejection of the United Nations\nSpecial Mission\u2019s action in proposing to them to\naccept a ceasefire. They have also rejected the\nproposals for peace talks with other parties to the\nconflict.\u201d (S/1995/866, annex, p. 2)\nIn a letter dated 12 November 1995, we informed the\nSecretary-General that,\n\u201cOn 11 November 1995, the Taliban launched as\nmany as 170 rockets on the civilian-populated sectors\nof Kabul, as a result of which 37 innocent lives were\nlost and more than 52 civilians wounded, while\nimmense damage was inflicted upon public property.\u201d\n(A/50/748, annex, p. 2)\nThis is why in a letter dated 16 November 1995\n(A/50/760) addressed to the Secretary General, the Islamic\nState of Afghanistan inquired about the identity of the\nTaliban, their ideology and goals, their rejection of the\npeace process and their negative attitude towards the United\nNations.\nAs a result of the heavy bombardment of the capital\nby the Taliban on 26 November 1995, the Secretary-\nGeneral expressed his concern about the escalation of\nfighting and called upon all parties to cooperate with the\nefforts of the United Nations Special Mission, then headed\nby Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri, aimed at achieving an\nimmediate ceasefire and promoting negotiations among the\nparties on a transitional mechanism for the transfer of\npower, to achieve a just and durable settlement acceptable\nto all Afghans.\nDuring 1996 Afghanistan continued to keep the\nUnited Nations well informed about the atrocities\ncommitted by the Taliban in a letter dated 19 January\n1996 (S/1996/44).\nOn 9 April 1996 the Security Council held two\nmeetings on Afghanistan. During the meetings the\ndelegation of the Islamic State of Afghanistan provided\nadequate information on the role of the so-called Taliban\nin causing turmoil in Afghanistan and threatening the\npeace and stability of the region. This was recognized by\nthe Security Council in a statement to the press on 13\nDecember 1995.\nIn a letter dated 22 August 1996 addressed to the\nSecretary General, the President of the Security Council\nstated that the members of Security Council,\n\u201cexpress their strong view that the warring parties\nshould renounce the use of force and settle their\ndifferences by peaceful means, through negotiations.\n\u201cThe members of the Security Council are\nconvinced that the main responsibility for finding a\npolitical solution to the conflict lies with the parties\nand that all States must refrain from interference.\u201d\n(S/1996/683, first and second paragraphs)\nThe Taliban have consistently taken a rejectionist\nattitude and still act against the letter and the spirit of all\nSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions and\ndecisions.\nGiven this account, I must say that this is the time\nto look back and see who is responsible for the ongoing\nhuman tragedy in Afghanistan. Was it not the lack of any\nappropriate response by this Organization to the\nintransigent attitude of the Taliban that encouraged and\nenabled them to see the tunnel wide open and to pursue\ntheir designs crafted by military-industrial magnates from\nabroad?\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan had continuously\nwarned the United Nations about the possible outcome.\nWho is to blame, and could we consider it a conspiracy\nof indifference or a conspiracy of victimization?\nRegardless of which one it may be, the blood of Afghans\nhas been spilled. One thing manifested by the indifference\n7\n\n\nthus far is that Afghan blood is not cheap; rather, it is\nworthless.\nLet us go back to the drastic events that took place\nduring the last couple of weeks. The Government forces\nevacuated the capital in order to prevent a bloodbath. The\nTaliban invaded Kabul on the morning of 27 September\n1996. The Government authorities relocated their\nheadquarters and offices in Taloqan, the capital of the\nnorthern province of Takhar.\nResistance against the Taliban is not limited only to\nthe Panjshir Valley, where the Taliban are conducting\nwidespread and extensive battles, targeting civilian areas. In\nmany other parts of Afghanistan, under the rule of the\nTaliban, there exists the potential for resistance. Soon we\nwill hear about uprisings.\nIn today\u2019s circumstances, the objectives of the Islamic\nState of Afghanistan have not changed, and I would like to\nemphasize once again our firm commitment to General\nAssembly resolution 50/88 on Afghanistan, which was\nadopted by consensus on 19 December 1995.\nThe provisional setback of one party in the conflict\nand the territorial gain of one side could not mean that\npeace would prevail in the country. Military occupation\ncannot bring about conflict resolution. On the contrary, the\nescalation of tension once again necessitates a negotiated\nsettlement of the conflict through the mechanism\nformulated in operative paragraph 4 of resolution 50/88 B\nof 19 December 1995. This provides a solution to the crisis\nin Afghanistan through the United Nations peace process.\nA ranking United Nations official expressed his\nconcern by stating in The Los Angeles Times of 5 October\n1996,\n\u201cIt\u2019s frightening [that] this is going to be the\nGovernment, because these men have obviously had\nno experience but fighting.\u201d\nThe Taliban, who have invaded the capital city of\nKabul with cross-border military assistance, will not be able\nto ensure the national unity of Afghanistan, especially in\nthe light of what they have done during the first days of\ntheir military rule in the capital. The Taliban, in spite of\nbeing Pashtuns, neither agree with the majority of Pashtuns\nof the country nor with Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Turkmen,\nBaluchis, Nooristanis and others.\nThe Afghan leaders, intellectuals and scholars cannot\nagree with the regressive and backward views of the\nTaliban. Many religious leaders of the country do not\napprove of their attitude and deem it incompatible with\nthe needs of Muslims in the modern world. They all\nconsider them unacceptable tools of foreign intervention.\nThe military rule of the Taliban must not be\nconsidered final or accomplished. Those foreign quarters\nwhich have provided financial and military assistance to\nthe Taliban will not be able to subsidize and finance their\nrule permanently.\nThe Taliban are lacking any vision or ability for the\nobjective of economic and social rehabilitation in\nAfghanistan. They lack any coherent and systematic\nthinking or projection of the vast needs of today\u2019s\nAfghanistan. Many of their leaders consider the teachings\nof modern science and technology contrary to religion.\nThey consider science to be sacrilege. The Taliban, who\nstill believe the earth is flat, are not the people for\nAfghanistan, not when we are about to enter the twenty-\nfirst century.\nYet the outside sponsors of the Taliban are\nattempting to cover up their actual identity and nature,\nthus soliciting a kind of legitimacy for this illegitimate,\nobscurantist and terrorist group. Any relation established\nwith the Taliban may be interpreted by the Taliban as\ntolerance by the international community. Allowing this\nto happen would be an affront to the principles of the\nUnited Nations, a seal of approval for terrorism, a\nlegitimization of foreign intervention and, indeed, an\ninsult to the human conscience.\nIn the name of the Islamic State of Afghanistan and\nthe victimized Afghan nation, I express gratitude to all\nthose countries that have expressed their concern and\ndisapproval of the occupation of the Afghan capital,\nKabul, by the Taliban, and the rule of terror in that city.\nDays after the occupation of Kabul, on 2 October\n1996, the Coordination Meeting of Foreign Ministers of\nthe member States of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference (OIC), at which I had the honour to speak,\nconvened at the United Nations in New York. In a final\ncommuniqu\u00e9, they expressed\n\u201cthe hope that the Afghan parties will peacefully\nresolve their political differences and collectively\n8\n\n\nwork for the restoration of peace and stability in the\ncountry\u201d.\nThe practical solution to the Afghan problem needs to\ninclude the following elements, in conformity with General\nAssembly resolution 50/88 B of 19 December 1995 on the\nquestion of Afghanistan: first, an immediate cessation of\narmed conflict and the declaration of a ceasefire; secondly,\nan invitation to all Afghan parties to the negotiating table,\nunder the auspices of the United Nations and with the\ncooperation of the OIC; thirdly, an agreement on the\ncomposition and establishment of a transitional Government\nof national unity and the creation of a credible, authoritative\nbody to which power would immediately be transferred;\nand, fourthly, the consolidation of the political process in\norder to ascertain the views of the people and solve the\nproblem through elections or through the convening of the\ntraditional Grand Assembly.\nOur basic views and main objectives are as follows:\nthe re-establishment of peace and stability, along with the\ncreation of conditions conducive to ensuring that the\npeoples of Afghanistan can live, in an atmosphere of law\nand order, on the basis of democratic values and respect for\nhuman rights, as required by an authentic and truthful\nvision of high Islamic principles; and the establishment of\na strong central Government on the basis of agreement\namong all Afghan sides that have the capacity to mobilize\nmasses and are able to secure the achievement of these\ngoals. This will allow Afghanistan to become once again a\npositive factor for peace and stability in the region to which\nit belongs.\nOnly a transitional Government of national unity\nwould be able to secure the national unity of the country\nand to allow the launching of the major task of\nreconstructing and rehabilitating Afghanistan. Such a goal\ncould not be achieved without the full participation of the\nintellectuals, scientists, experts and technocrats of\nAfghanistan, many of whom now live abroad. We are\nexpecting all countries that are in favour of peace and\nstability in Afghanistan to assist our people in order to\nachieve these noble objectives.\nUpon adopting the Charter of the United Nations 51\nyears ago in the city of San Francisco, the founding fathers\nof this global establishment declared the United Nations to\nbe based on the sovereign equality of all States. They did\nthis at a time when this principle was an ideal. The struggle\nfor freedom by many nations, together with millions of\nsacrifices, on the one hand, and the need in the twentieth\ncentury for natural interdependence between the members\nof this global family, on the other, proved more than ever\nthe righteousness of this principle.\nIt is apropos in this connection to quote His\nExcellency Mr. Herv\u00e9 de Charette, the Foreign Minister\nof France, who on 25 September stated from this rostrum:\n\u201cIf we are not careful, we are going to be living in\na world without criteria, without values, without\nreferences, in which some \u2014 the strongest and\nrichest \u2014 will be in a position to decide alone on\nthe future of the planet.\u201d (Official Records of the\nGeneral Assembly, Fifty-first Session, Plenary\nMeetings, 8th meeting, p. 18)"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset to congratulate Mr.\nRazali most warmly on his election as President of this\nsession of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\nI am convinced that his diplomatic qualities will\ncontribute greatly to the attainment of the objectives of\nthis session. It is my pleasure to express my gratitude to\nHis Excellency Mr. Diego Freitas do Amaral for the\nexcellent conduct and competence that he displayed\nduring his presidency of the previous session.\nDuring the five years that have elapsed since the\ndeclaration of our independence, and in the four years\nsince the Republic of Moldova was admitted to the\nUnited Nations, we have tried to show the whole world\nthat we are a country that is seeking a worthy place in the\ninternational community. My country\u2019s choice of the rule\nof law and a market economy has led to an increase in its\ncredibility at the international level. I should like to assure\nthe Assembly that the Republic of Moldova is irreversibly\ncommitted to the path of democracy, which is the best\nguarantee of sustainable development, peace and social\nprogress. I should like to stress that the process of\ndemocratic reforms in our country has been, and\ncontinues to be, supported by the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies, by the European organizations and\nby the entire international community. I take this\nopportunity to extend thanks for this assistance, which is\nessential for our programme of reforms.\nThe complex process of transition in the Republic of\nMoldova and in the countries of Central and Eastern\nEurope is facing difficulties that require additional means.\nThis reform has also created negative social phenomena,\nwhich have particularly affected the most vulnerable\ngroups of the population. To alleviate these undesirable\neffects, the Government has adopted and implemented\nmeasures of social protection. The difficulties that we are\nfacing in promoting economic reforms are created not\nonly by a lack of experience but also by a shortage of\ncommodities and financial and energy resources. In this\nrespect, I should like to stress the importance of support\nand encouragement offered to the Republic of Moldova\n26\n\n\nby the international financial institutions, by the United\nNations specialized agencies and by certain developed\ncountries. We will also need such support in the future to\nsmoothly carry out our reforms.\nIntegration into European economic and political\nstructures remains a priority of our foreign policy. We are\nconvinced that, given the objectives of economic and social\nreform, the development and deepening of relations with\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE), the Council of Europe and the European Union, as\nwell as close cooperation in the context of the Partnership\nfor Peace programme and the North Atlantic Cooperation\nCouncil, take on a new dimension. Such a process also\ncreates favourable conditions for the affirmation of the\nRepublic of Moldova as a sovereign and independent State.\nWe state our willingness to cooperate with regional\norganizations to ensure stability in Europe as well as peace\nand security throughout the world. The choice of permanent\nneutrality stipulated in our Constitution explains why the\nRepublic of Moldova is not participating in, and does not\nintend to join, the military structures of the Commonwealth\nof Independent States or of other regional organizations.\nThe conflict in the eastern part of my country remains\nan obstacle to democratization and to progress on economic\nreforms. We cannot ignore the continuing violations of\nhuman rights in the Transdnestr. The international\ncommunity has been informed of them many times. Despite\nour negotiations and many appeals of international\norganizations, we have yet to obtain the release of the\nmembers of the Ilascu group, who were sentenced and\nimprisoned illegally four years ago by the anti-constitutional\nauthorities of Tiraspol.We are concerned that the Moldavian\npopulation in the schools and institutions of this region of\nthe country are banned from using Latin characters in the\nstudy of their mother tongue.\nThis conflict still remains a central concern, despite\nnegotiations, despite the spirit of compromise of the\npolitical leaders, and despite their will to resolve the\nproblems in the eastern zone through peaceful means, in\ncooperation with international organizations such as the\nUnited Nations and the OSCE, and together with the\nassistance of the affected States, Russia and the Ukraine,\nwhich have expressed their willingness to be guarantors.\nThe Republic of Moldova believes that the only\nsolution to the conflict lies in the development of a draft\nlaw related to the special status of Transdnestr as an\nintegral part of a unified and indivisible State, in\naccordance with our Constitution. In the context of\nnegotiations, we have already signed several interim\ndocuments covering various aspects of the normalization\nof the situation in this region. We remain true to the\nprinciple of territorial integrity and of the sovereignty of\nthe State, which we will always respect. Unfortunately,\nthe authorities of the anti-constitutional republic are not\nyet ready to accept the principle of territorial integrity and\nof the sovereignty of the State.\nWe reaffirm our willingness to continue negotiations\nwith the authorities of Tiraspol in order to find a solution\nto the Transdnestr conflict.\nWe consider that the process of a peaceful and\ndefinitive solution to the conflict in the eastern zone of\nthe Republic of Moldova could be considerably\naccelerated through the immediate, complete, ordered and\nunconditional withdrawal of military units of the Russian\nFederation.\nWe are concerned by the fact that these foreign\ntroops continue to be stationed on the territory of the\nRepublic of Moldova, which is contrary to our\nconstitutional stipulation of the neutrality of our country.\nAlthough the agreement between the Republic of\nMoldova and the Russian Federation relating to the legal\nstatus, the method and the terms of withdrawal of Russian\nmilitary contingents stationed temporarily on the territory\nof Moldova was signed two years ago, the Russian State\nDuma has yet to ratify the agreement. We hope that the\ncompetent Russian authorities will accelerate the entry\ninto force and the implementation of the Moldovan-\nRussian agreement of 21 October 1994.\nAs regards to the revitalization of the United Nations\nand the reform of its structures in the spirit of\ndemocratization and in accordance of the latest world\ndevelopments, we note with satisfaction that the United\nNations as a guarantor of international peace, stability and\nsecurity has expanded its efforts through improving the\nmechanisms for maintaining peace and has intensified its\nactivities in the area of preventive diplomacy and the\nsettlement of regional conflicts, and has developed new\nconcepts and means for crisis management such as stand-\nby commitments and rapid-reaction forces. The Republic\nof Moldova welcomes the efforts of the Conference on\nDisarmament towards the adoption of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nAt present, goals likely to help overcome the\nfinancial crisis by finding the resources necessary for\neffective action by the United Nations are fundamental. In\n27\n\n\nour view, the reform of the United Nations must also cover\nthe financial aspect. We can attempt viable solutions only\nwith the participation of all Member States.\nThe Republic of Moldova is not indifferent to this\nsituation and will make efforts to meet its financial\nobligations. However, it is my duty to stress that we are\nobliged to bear an assessment that is calculated at a level\nwhich is exaggerated in comparison with our real\npossibilities. This calculation has led to a situation where\nthe scale of assessments for our country is higher than that\nof States with a similar level of development. It is high\ntime that we found an appropriate methodology reflecting\nthe capacity to pay of States. We hope that the spirit of\nfairness and solidarity that reigns in the United Nations will\nlead the General Assembly to recommend that the\nCommittee on Contributions revise and readjust the scale of\nassessment to the level of indices that would truly reflect\nthe parameters of the economies of Member States. In this\ncontext, the Republic of Moldova supports the proposal of\nthe European Union regarding the methodology regarding\nthe calculation of the scale of assessments, which we\nconsider to be fairer and more appropriate to the real\npayment capacity of all Member States than that which is\nused now.\nThe Republic of Moldova supports United Nations\nreforms aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the\nOrganization and its main bodies, considering that this\ninnovative process reflects reality and the changes which\nhave occurred in the international system following the\ncold-war era.\nAt the same time, the Government of the Republic of\nMoldova attaches particular importance to the role the\nSecurity Council plays in preventing the development of\nnew threats to peace and international security. Developing\nconflicts, acts of aggression and interference in the internal\naffairs of States threaten regional and international security.\nThe role of the Security Council in avoiding these dangers\nis of prime importance. Aware of this role of the Security\nCouncil as a collective decision-making body in the area of\npeace and international security, the Republic of Moldova\nconsiders that a change in its composition must be carried\nout without hindering its effectiveness.\nMy delegation feels that an increase in the number of\nseats on the Security Council should be carried out in a\nbalanced way including both permanent and non-permanent\nseats, which would provide access for new members from\nboth the North and the South. As regards new permanent\nseats, the President of our Republic, His Excellency\nMr. Mircea Snegur, proposed at the forty-ninth session of\nthe General Assembly that the status of permanent\nmember be given to the major economic Powers which\nplay an important role in economic affairs, such as\nGermany and Japan. As for the increase in the number of\nnon-permanent seats, we find the Italian proposal\ninteresting, as it reflects the interests of most States\nMembers of the United Nations and offers a well-\nconsidered solution to this question.\nThe Republic of Moldova is devoted to the\nprinciples and to the ideals of the Charter of the United\nNations, and greatly appreciates the activities of the\nUnited Nations, which for more than five decades has\nshown itself to be a forum for harmonizing the efforts of\nthe peoples of the world in order to maintain international\npeace and security and to ensure the development of\nrelations of friendship and cooperation among Member\nStates. The actions undertaken by the United Nations have\nfrom the very beginning pursued the goal of building new\nrelationships among countries of the whole world.\nAfter four years of activity as a full Member, the\nactions of the Republic of Moldova within the context of\nthe United Nations remain among the priorities of its\nforeign policy, aimed at giving our State a more active\npresence at the international level as well as at the\ndevelopment and intensification of relations of friendship\nand cooperation with all members of the international\ncommunity. The Republic of Moldova is in favour of\nharmonizing the interests of Member States.\nIn conclusion, I would like to express the hope that\nthe particular constructive spirit of the United Nations\nwhich reigns once again at this session of the General\nAssembly will enable us to respond to the challenges\nfacing the international community at this time. I am\nconvinced that the United Nations will remain a guarantee\nof international peace and security and of economic and\nsocial development worldwide. My delegation expresses\nits willingness to contribute to effective cooperation with\nthe delegations of all Member States in order to attain the\npurposes of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is with great pleasure that\nI take this opportunity to warmly congratulate you on your\nunanimous election as President of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-first regular session. Your election is a tribute\nnot only to your country, Malaysia, but also to you\npersonally. I am aware that you bring to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly wide experience in the field of\ninternational relations, from which we stand to benefit\nimmensely. I would also like to wish you every success in\nyour important duties. I would further like to affirm the\nreadiness of my delegation to cooperate with you in the\ndischarge of your duties.\nAllow me also to pay tribute to Mr. Diogo Freitas do\nAmaral of Portugal, who presided over the fiftieth regular\nsession of the General Assembly with great skill and\ndedication. His presidency did indeed enhance the\ndeliberative role of the General Assembly.\nFurthermore, my delegation would like to record its\nappreciation for the work of our esteemed Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, carried out under\ntrying conditions. Zambia greatly values the contribution of\nthe Secretary-General to the reform process of the United\nNations and can only hope that the entire membership\nwill give him a second term in order for him to complete\nthese reforms.\nThis session of the General Assembly is distinctive\nbecause it is being held in the aftermath of the historic\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, which we\nobserved last year. It will be recalled that in observing\nand celebrating that important event, we made solemn\ncommitments to steer the world body towards the\nprogressive development of a world community that\nwould be cooperating effectively in dealing with global\nproblems in the interest of humanity. We also agreed that\nthe United Nations should be more democratic,\ntransparent and responsive and should be the common\nproperty of all the people of the world, in whose name it\nwas created in the first place. We went on to state that we\nwanted all citizens of the world to have real ownership of\nthe Organization. We also set for ourselves economic and\nsocial goals. In some cases, we went as far as to agree on\nspecific time-bound targets by which progress would be\nmeasured. This session, therefore, marks the beginning of\na process of fulfilling these solemn commitments that we\nmade last year.\nCrucial to fulfilling these commitments is the issue\nof the reform of the United Nations, which is now under\nway. Reform and continuous renewal are indispensable if\nthe future of the Organization is to be secured. All of us\nhave to play our part with the hope and determination\nnecessary to carry forward the United Nations reform\n\n\nagenda with speed and thoroughness. In this way, we can\nwork towards strengthening the Organization and make it\nserve humanity more effectively. It is my conviction that\nthe United Nations can achieve greater success if we, the\nstakeholders, work towards creating a much improved\nOrganization.\nAs the twenty-first century approaches, the greatest\nchallenge facing the international community is to improve\nthe living conditions of the majority of people. Every\nhuman being must have access to opportunities that afford\na decent livelihood under conditions that are free from\nwant, disease, hunger and ignorance. The World Summit\nfor Social Development held in Copenhagen last year\nadopted a framework to deal with poverty and other social\nproblems. Far too many people, especially women and\nchildren, are vulnerable to marginalization and deprivation.\nWe need to invest more resources to end the conditions of\nendemic human deprivation existing in many parts of the\nworld today.\nThere are several other areas where we need to\nimprove the social conditions of life. The first ever World\nCongress on the Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in\nStockholm, Sweden, in August this year, presented in\ngraphic detail the atrocities being committed against\nchildren. Many young lives are being wasted in the huge,\nillegal international business of child prostitution and\npornography. As a civilized world, we cannot allow\nlifestyles that are attuned to the sexual abuse of children. It\nis the hope of my delegation that all countries of the world\nwill work expeditiously to implement the Agenda for\nAction adopted at the World Congress. In the same vein,\nthe international community must continue to protect and\npromote the rights of the child by implementing the\nprovisions of the Declaration and Programme of Action of\nthe World Summit for Children.\nThe United Nations has also articulated various\nprogrammes aimed at the improvement of the status of\nwomen and youth. Commitments contained in the Beijing\nDeclaration and Platform for Action, as well as the World\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\nBeyond, require the devoted attention of the international\ncommunity, especially with regard to empowerment\nstrategies in the critical areas of employment, education,\nhealth and participation in societal decision-making. It is\nincumbent upon us all to honour the commitments we made\nin the declarations and the programmes of action. My\ncountry has committed itself to the attainment of the\nobjectives contained in these documents. Women and\nchildren are invaluable resources that can be neglected\nonly at the world\u2019s own peril.\nIt is fitting that we begin this session shortly after\nthe adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT). Zambia supported the adoption of this\nTreaty because of our commitment to general and\ncomplete disarmament under effective international\ncontrol. It is in the same spirit that my country signed the\nPelindaba Treaty, establishing Africa as a nuclear-free\nzone, on 11 April this year. Zambia will be signing the\nCTBT with the hope that all other countries of the world\nwill do so as well, in the spirit of the traditional\nrecognition by the United Nations that disarmament is one\nof the priority questions of international relations. In this\nregard, Zambia would like to call on nuclear-weapon\nStates to inject a new spirit of commitment to ensuring\nnuclear disarmament, in accordance with article 6 of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nIn this connection, my delegation wishes to reiterate\nthe conviction that the time has indeed come for the\nconvening of another special session of the General\nAssembly, in 1999, devoted to disarmament. My\ndelegation believes that such a session would offer\nadditional possibilities for the international community to\nreview, from a perspective more in tune with the current\ninternational situation, the most critical aspects of the\nprocess of disarmament in the post-cold-war era.\nIt is common knowledge that in most of today\u2019s\nconflicts the most widely used weapons are small arms\nand light weapons. None is more menacing than land-\nmines, the use of which is widespread. Currently more\nthan 110 million of them are buried in various parts of\nthe world, mostly in developing countries. The world\ncannot continue to lose human lives from these lethal\nweapons. In this regard, my delegation fully supports calls\nfor the banning at the global level of the use, stockpiling,\nproduction and sale of anti-personnel land-mines for all\ntime. Zambia will therefore support initiatives, during this\nsession of the General Assembly, to effect such a global\nban.\nThe issue of small arms and light weapons brings\nme to the question of conflicts in various parts of the\nworld that our Organization has increasingly been called\nupon to resolve. The international community faces the\nchallenge of bringing peace in countries where warring\nfactions show, in some cases, irreconcilable ethnic\ndifferences and other forms of intolerance.\n2\n\n\nThe African region has its sad share of these conflicts\nthat have led to great loss of life, displacement of people\nand the disruption of vital economic activities. Burundi is\none such major challenge. The measures to restore the\nparliament in Burundi and unban political parties, which\nwere announced on 11 September by the military regime of\nMajor Pierre Buyoya, are steps in the right direction. My\ndelegation, however, wishes to underscore the point that\nchanges of Government should occur only through\nconstitutional and internationally accepted means.\nTherefore, unless and until a constitutional Government is\nestablished in Burundi, my Government will continue to\nwithhold recognition of the Buyoya regime. The immediate\naction of the countries of the Great Lakes region to impose\nsanctions on Burundi following the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of 25 July\n1996 deserves the commendation of the United Nations.\nThere is no doubt that this action is what has forced the\nmilitary Government in Burundi to restore the parliament\nand to unban political parties.\nWe are encouraged with regard to Rwanda by the fact\nthat the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has\nfinally been established and that its work has started. It is\nvitally important that the perpetrators of genocide in\nRwanda in 1994 should be brought to justice. This would\nserve as a deterrent to others who would otherwise be\ntempted to commit similar crimes. The re-emergence of\ngenocide, war crimes and other crimes against humanity\nshould be a source of great worry to the international\ncommunity. Such crimes should not be allowed to continue,\nbecause they violate fundamental human rights and strike\nat the very foundation of the international legal system.\nThe Economic Community of West African States\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) has done an admirable job\nof containing the situation in Liberia and preventing it from\ndegenerating further. We are now seeing more promising\nsteps towards the settlement of the conflict in Liberia. The\ngains achieved in Liberia can only be consolidated by the\ncontinued support of the international community for\nECOMOG so that the timetable adopted at the recent Abuja\nsummit can be effectively implemented.\nThe peace process in Angola is also on track, as\nevidenced by the quartering and disarmament, which are\nnow almost complete after some extensions. The Assembly\nis also aware that only two days ago the situation in Angola\nwas deliberated upon by Heads of State or Government of\nthe Southern African Development Community in order to\nbring the leadership of the Movimento Popular de\nLiberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola-Partido Trabalhista (MPLA) and the\nUni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola\n(UNITA) together. Unfortunately, the UNITA leader,\nMr. Jonas Savimbi failed to attend.\nEfforts to bring peace to Angola will nevertheless\ncontinue. The regional summit on Angola demonstrated\nthe strong commitment of the leaders of southern Africa\nto the resolution of the conflict in Angola. However, the\ninternational community needs to be continuously\nengaged in order to ensure that the situation is resolved.\nWe urge that the integration of former UNITA guerrillas\ninto the national army of Angola be speeded up to\nconsolidate the peace process. Zambia would also like to\nurge Mr. Jonas Savimbi and other UNITA leaders to be\nmore resolute in the implementation of the commitments\nthey made in the Lusaka Protocol.\nI wish to take this opportunity to commend the\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General on\nAngola, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, for the good work he\nhas done in the Angolan peace process. However, even\nwhen peace finally comes to Angola, it will be important\nfor the international community to provide assistance to\nthat country in areas that will facilitate rapid national\nreconstruction, such as mine clearance.\nThe issue of Western Sahara continues to be Africa\u2019s\nlast unresolved colonial question. My delegation believes\nthat it is not beyond the wisdom of this Assembly to\novercome whatever obstacles may be standing in the way\nof a referendum. We would therefore like to appeal to the\nprincipal parties to cooperate with the Secretary-General\nin finding a lasting solution to this problem.\nWith regard to Somalia, my delegation is concerned\nat the apparent lack of efforts by the international\ncommunity towards finding a lasting solution to the crisis\nin that country. The situation in Somalia is also not\nconducive to regional peace and security. We therefore\ncall upon the international community to seek ways and\nmeans through appropriate organs to assist the people of\nSomalia to reach accommodation with each other, just as\nwe call on the Somali factions themselves to work\ntowards a genuine political settlement so that peace may\nreturn to that country.\nThe situation in the Middle East is a source of great\ndanger to regional peace and security. We urge the parties\nto the conflict not to abandon but to consolidate the peace\nprocess brought about through sacrifice and painstaking\nwork. The violent confrontation that has taken place in\nthe past three days is a matter of grave concern to us.\nZambia still believes, however, that the parties will\n3\n\n\nharness the moral courage and the political will that are\nnecessary to return to the peace process. Zambia believes\nthat for the peace process to restart and gain momentum,\nthe new Government in Israel should respect and implement\nthe agreements already reached on the Middle East peace\nprocess, in accordance with the norms of international law.\nSince its inception, the United Nations has faced the\nchallenge of facilitating effective international economic\ncooperation. However, we have yet to attain a satisfactory\nlevel where countries of the world can pursue prospects for\ndevelopment through the machinery of the Organization.\nMultilateralism is indispensable to the management of the\nprocess of the globalization of the world economy that is\nnow going on. Major issues like foreign direct investment,\ncurrency stability, external debt problems, international\ntrade and commodity price stabilization require durable\nmultilateral cooperative arrangements.\nIt is the hope of my delegation that the current work\ntaking place at the United Nations on an Agenda for\nDevelopment, the strengthening of the United Nations and\nprospective new modalities for financing operational\nactivities for development will generate possibilities to\nimplement fully the provisions of Chapter IX of the Charter\nof the United Nations. It is also the hope of my delegation\nthat the reform of the Bretton Woods institutions will not\nfurther erode the capacity of the United Nations to deal\nwith economic questions.\nIt is, however, a matter of concern to my delegation\nthat United Nations agencies and departments are facing\nbudget cuts because of the continuing financial crisis of the\nworld body. Our concern is heightened by the fact that in\nMarch this year, the United Nations embarked on a decade-\nlong process of promoting African development through its\nSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa. The United\nNations, which is at the centre of the implementation of the\nSpecial Initiative, requires strong institutional capacities.\nThe continuing financial crisis is certainly going to erode\nthis institutional capacity further.\nThe Special Initiative and the Zambian economic\nreform programme complement each other. We hope that\nthis is also the case with other African countries. We are\nalso particularly happy that the Special Initiative gives\nprominence to peace-building, conflict resolution, national\nreconciliation and strengthening of the capacity for\ngovernance in the wide agenda of socio-economic\ndevelopment on the African continent. As is well known,\neconomic progress in Africa has all too often been\nundermined by conflicts.\nAs the international community supports African\ndevelopment, we once again draw its attention to the\nburden of external debt that is stunting African\ndevelopment. Both the Special Initiative and the United\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\nthe 1990s recognize that the major obstacle to sustained\neconomic growth and development is the problem of\nexternal debt. It is the expectation of my delegation that\ndeeper debt reduction going beyond the Naples terms can\nbe agreed upon in the near future. Deep debt reduction\nwill go a long way in facilitating domestic savings and\ninvestments in Africa, especially in the social sectors, and\nthereby reduce poverty, environmental degradation and\ndependency on aid.\nBefore I conclude, I should say a few words about\nthe political situation in Zambia. In November 1991, my\ncountry embarked on a multi-party democratic process.\nWe are almost at the end of the first five-year period of\ndemocratization. Zambia will hold presidential and\nparliamentary elections this year under conditions of firm\npolitical stability. We are determined to maintain this\nstability by ensuring that peace prevails throughout the\nelection period. The Movement for Multiparty\nDemocracy, which is currently running the Government,\nhas been unequivocal in condemning all forms of political\nviolence and intolerance.\nThere is no political crisis in Zambia. The people of\nZambia have continued with their daily lives in peace,\nsecurity and full confidence in the political process of the\ncountry. In order to demonstrate good faith in the conduct\nof the democratic process, the Government of Zambia has\ninvited international observers to participate in monitoring\nour elections. These are in addition to local independent\nelection monitors. It is our desire that as many observers\nas possible should participate in this process, which is\naimed at consolidating democracy.\nZambia believes that the ideals of the United Nations\nare indispensable to the development of the partnership of\ncountries. It is therefore the supreme duty of all of us to\npromote and uphold them. In this context, I would like to\nconclude by reaffirming the faith of my delegation in the\nideals of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first\nof all to congratulate the President most warmly on his\nelection to serve as President of the fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nI also wish to convey my thanks to the previous\nPresident, Mr. Freitas do Amaral, for the commitment, skill\nand poise with which he led our work at the last session of\nthe Assembly.\nI would also like to convey my appreciation to our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\nongoing outstanding work for our Organization since\nbeginning of his term.\nThe views of the Luxembourg Government on the\nmajor international issues are the same as those expressed\nby our European Union partners. They were presented to\nthe Assembly yesterday morning by Mr. Dick Spring,\nPresident of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs\nof Ireland.\nLuxembourg learned with great satisfaction that our\nGeneral Assembly, by an overwhelming majority, had\nadopted and opened for signature the resolution\ncontaining the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nYesterday, on behalf of the Luxembourg Government, I\nsigned that document, which marks substantial progress\ntowards the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the\ncreation of a safer and more humane world. I hope that\nthe parties concerned will continue to work to create the\nright conditions for the rapid entry into force of this\nTreaty.\nAlso in the area of disarmament, I support without\nreserve the United Nations work on the question of anti-\npersonnel landmines, which day after day, long after the\nguns have fallen silent in a conflict, continue to claim\ncountless victims. If there is any evil which must be\neradicated, this is it.\nI rejoice in the significant progress which has been\nachieved, in less than a year, in the conflict in the former\nYugoslavia. I welcome the holding of elections on 14\nSeptember, which marks a decisive stage for the future of\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnians, Serbs and Croats must\nnow organize their cooperation by first setting up\ncommon institutions.\nI regard these elections as a first, important step in\nthe framework of a process of democratization and\nstabilization that must be carried further. Its success will\ndepend above all on the Bosnian parties. It will also\ndepend on neighbouring countries, in particular Croatia\nand the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Lastly, it will\ndepend on the support of the international community. My\nGovernment is in favour of continued international\ncivilian and military action in order to create the\nenvironment required to preserve peace and prevent a\nreturn to war.\nLuxembourg is concerned by the check to the peace\nprocess in the Middle East that has followed the change\nof Government in Israel. We take the view that there is\n13\n\n\nno alternative to this complex and fragile process: the fruit\nof arduous negotiations. We urge our friends in Israel to\npursue this process, to comply with and execute the\ncommitments undertaken pursuant to the Oslo agreements\nand to avoid creating fresh obstacles. We fear that any\nother policy may generate further tension and once again\ntrigger a spiral of violence that would inflict suffering on\nall the peoples of the region. The alarming events that took\nplace on the West Bank today threaten to destroy the results\nof several years of effort to achieve a just and lasting peace\nin the Middle East.\nThe Luxembourg Government condemns the recent\nattacks launched by the Government of Saddam Hussein on\nthe Kurdish population of northern Iraq. It was inevitable\nthat measures would be taken to react to this fresh\noffensive. We call for a complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces\nand for full respect for the territorial integrity of Iraq. We\nhope that the implementation of the \u201coil-for-food\u201d\nresolution may take place without delay in order to relieve\nthe hardships suffered by the civilian population of that\ncountry.\nThe situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa, in\nparticular in Burundi, continues to give us the greatest\ncause for concern. I fully support the efforts of the United\nNations, in close cooperation with the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, to avert both the occurrence in Burundi of\na tragedy such as occurred in Rwanda and a deterioration\nof the situation which could plunge the region into war.\nOver the last year, the United Nations has substantially\ncut the number of its peace-keeping operations. This\nreduction in our activities and the set-backs that we have\nwitnessed in the past should not, however, diminish our\nefforts to enhance the United Nations capacity to avert,\nprevent the spread of and halt conflicts, and to save human\nlives.\nIt is utterly unfair to criticize the United Nations\nwhenever a peace-keeping operation runs into difficulties.\nMany of the shortcomings attributed to the United Nations\ncould be resolved if all Member States undertook to pay\ntheir contributions to our Organization and, especially,\nmake available to it the resources that it needs. For this\nreason, Luxembourg supports the ongoing work and\nreflection aimed at equipping the Organization with a rapid-\nintervention force that would enable it to react to crises in\na timely fashion. Where non-military means have failed, it\nshould be possible to deploy well-trained and properly\nequipped peace-keeping contingents in the field very\npromptly in order to give practical effect to the Security\nCouncil\u2019s decisions.\nGreater responsibility should henceforth be given to\nregional organizations. The Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) is nowadays playing a\nleading role in conflict management in Europe and the\nCaucasus. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO) in the former Yugoslavia and the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU) in the Great Lakes region are\ndoing the same. Other regional and subregional\norganizations in Africa, Latin America and elsewhere are\nperforming similar tasks with the support of the United\nNations.\nInternational security begins with the security of the\nindividual, with respect for his fundamental rights and his\nprotection against any violation of those rights, including\nthe actions of his own Government. Nothing, therefore,\ncan justify violations of human rights, which by their very\nnature have universal value. Our Organization plays an\nimportant role in developing international machinery\ndesigned to provide effective protection for human rights.\nThis role takes the form, among others, of the efforts to\ncarry out systematic investigations and enquiries with a\nview to sanctioning those responsible for violations of\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights.\nLuxembourg supports the early creation of an\ninternational criminal court, which would be a decisive\nstep forward in ensuring respect for the principles of\ninternational law.\nAmong the most vulnerable human beings are our\nchildren, and they therefore deserve special protection.\nThe adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild marks a major advance. Scrupulously applied, that\nConvention will be an invaluable instrument in\nsafeguarding children against physical and psychological\nviolence. In 1995 my Government proposed to the United\nNations a similar, indeed, a complementary initiative, to\neliminate the exploitation of child labour. I welcome this\nAssembly adoption of that proposal designed to come to\nthe aid of the tens of millions of children forced to work\nfrom an early age. This effort should be strengthened and\nfurther pursued. Luxembourg also hails the results of the\nStockholm World Congress on the Commercial Sexual\nExploitation of Children. My Government is resolved to\nfoster international cooperation in the prevention and\nsuppression of sexual exploitation of children in order to\neffectively protect and safeguard children at the\ninternational level against such criminal practices.\n14\n\n\nThe globalization of the world economy is bringing\nabout profound changes in international relations. A\nveritable revolution in information and communication\ntechnologies reducing geographic distances to nothing has\nled to a speeding up of business transactions and financial\nflows, as well as increased integration of markets.\nGenerally accepted ideas have been turned upside down,\nand serious questions have been raised even among\nindustrialized countries, where unemployment has grown to\nalarming proportions.\nAt the same time, we note that a significant number of\ndeveloping countries remain on the sidelines of\ndevelopment and remain in great poverty. At a time when\nour Organization proclaimed 1996 International Year for the\nEradication of Poverty, more than 1.5 billion human beings\ncontinue to live in a state of absolute poverty. We cannot\nremain indifferent to this situation. What should particularly\ndisturb us is the inequality gap, which is widening both\nwithin countries and between the countries of the North and\nthe South. This is a dangerous source of new tensions and\nconflicts.\nThe United Nations Development Programme\u2019s latest\nreport on human development speaks of worldwide social\nfragmentation. It underscores the widening disparities\nbetween rich and poor States and increased imbalances in\nsocieties between inhabitants of the same country. The\npopulation explosion and uneven access to the fruits of\ntechnological progress further compound these distortions.\nThis trend is likely to trigger increasingly massive\nmigrations within countries and from poor countries to\nricher ones.\nIn order to remedy this situation, I propose to develop\na new strategy based on four main courses of action. First,\nwe should provide follow-up to, and translate into\noperational activities, the results of the major conferences\nheld since the beginning of this decade in Rio, Vienna,\nCairo, Copenhagen, Beijing and, most recently, in Istanbul.\nThe World Food Summit scheduled by the Food and\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for\nNovember and the special session on sustainable\ndevelopment in the spring of 1997 are also opportunities to\ndefine an integrated programme of action to foster human\ndevelopment.\nSecondly, we must halt the persistent decline of funds\nmade available for development, a symptom of \u201cdonor\nfatigue\u201d. In each of our countries we must launch a new\nmovement of solidarity to benefit the poorest and least\ndeveloped countries. The Government of Luxembourg has\ndecided to increase year by year its contribution to\ncooperation for development. Our intention is to achieve\nthe target of devoting 0.7 per cent of our gross national\nproduct to official development assistance before the end\nof this decade. A significant portion of these funds will\nbe made available to the various funds and programmes\nof the United Nations system. This is not simply a\nquestion of solidarity and social justice on a world scale;\nit is, above all, a preventive policy designed to contribute,\nhowever modestly, to peace by encouraging development.\nThe third main course of action is to strengthen the\nUnited Nations capacity to act in the economic and social\nfield. That strengthening requires courageous reforms of\nits structures. Above and beyond the proposals of the\nSummit of major industrialized countries at Lyon, which\nI welcome, I advocate a single rigorous coordination\nstructure for all economic and social activities and,\nespecially, a concerted restructuring of the bodies and\nmandates concerned. In this context, I note with interest,\nthe proposal of the XX Congress of the Socialist\nInternational, which took place recently in this very\nbuilding, calling for the setting up of integrated economic\ninstitutions on the regional and international levels and for\nthe setting up of a United Nations economic security\ncouncil.\nFourthly, we must develop cooperation with the\nrepresentatives of organized civil society, which is to say,\nthe non-governmental organizations.The participation of\nnon-governmental organizations in international\norganizations reinforces, in a sense, the political\nlegitimacy of those international bodies. The\nrepresentatives of civil society nowadays play a key role\nin the activities of the United Nations system, whether in\nthe promotion of human rights and democracy, in\nhumanitarian assistance or in cooperation for\ndevelopment. They make an invaluable contribution not\nonly to the Organization\u2019s operational activities but also\nto its thinking processes, as attested to by the significant\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations in the\npreparation, holding and follow-up of the major world\nconferences organized by the United Nations.\nThis new dimension of our work was also\nhighlighted at the congress of the World Federation of\nUnited Nations Associations, whose fiftieth-anniversary\nmeeting, I am proud to note, was held in Luxembourg a\nlittle over a month ago.\nThe financial situation of our Organization continues\nto be a matter of grave concern. As of July, the United\n15\n\n\nNations cash flow was exhausted, and this situation can\nonly worsen between now and the end of the year.\nAny attempt at a radical reform of the system will be\nfutile if we continue to neglect the fundamental need to put\nit on an adequate and reliable financial footing. The United\nNations cannot discharge its important responsibilities\neffectively if it is reduced to constant worry about making\nends meet.\nAdmittedly, the Organization could do even more to\ncontrol its expenditure and enhance its effectiveness.\nGreater attention should be given, inter alia, to the question\nof establishing each State\u2019s assessed contribution, which\nshould be based on objective criteria and reflect each\ncountry\u2019s real ability to pay. However, the crisis will be\novercome only if each Member State fulfils its obligations\nby making full, timely and unconditional payment of its\nfinancial contribution. I therefore unreservedly support the\nproposals made by the European Union in this regard.\nIn the ongoing reform process, one aspect is of\nparticular significance. Within our Organization, the\nSecurity Council bears unique responsibilities as the organ\nentrusted with preventing and resolving conflicts.One of the\ngreatest lessons to be learnt from the experiences and\nsetbacks of recent years is that Security Council members\nmust, if they wish to preserve its credibility, demonstrate\ntheir determination to enforce their decisions, once taken.\nThe credibility and effectiveness of the Council with\nregard to peace-keeping and international security will be\nreinforced by the establishment of more open, transparent\nand collegial decision-making processes while maintaining\nclose consultation with the countries supplying mat\u00e9riel and\ncontingents. The not-insignificant progress made in this\nrespect in the recent past should be integrated into the\nsystem.\nIn addition, the Council\u2019s legitimacy, and probably the\nquality of its decisions, would also benefit from a\nreadjustment in membership. The enlargement of the\nCouncil should take into account the ability of member\nStates to contribute to peace-keeping and to the\nachievement of the Organization\u2019s goals. A better balance\nmust be struck between industrialized and developing\ncountries.\nThe passing of the bipolar world has freed our planet\nfrom the ideological, political and military fetters that\nimpeded to an extraordinary degree our capacity to act.\nRelieved of the threat of global confrontation and nuclear\nholocaust, we are now faced with a series of worldwide\nproblems, old and new, that includes underdevelopment,\nenvironmental degradation, the proliferation of all kinds\nof weapons, terrorism, ethnic conflicts, drug trafficking,\nviolence and crime in all its guises.\nLuxembourg is convinced that the solution to those\nproblems lies not in isolationism, nor in nationalism, nor\nin fundamentalism of any description. We would also be\ndeluding ourselves were we to put our trust solely in the\nmarket and private initiative to remedy all humanity\u2019s ills.\nOnly through an approach based on cooperation,\nsolidarity, tolerance and mutual esteem can we tackle\nthose problems successfully at both the regional and the\nworld levels.\nThis has been the approach of the European Union\nand its member States, which have succeeded in attaining,\nin Europe, a level of stability and prosperity hitherto\nunknown. The approach is based on the concept of\ndemocracy and of a market economy that is not\nuncontrolled but socially responsible, one in which the\nState fully shoulders its responsibilities in the areas of\nhealth, education and social justice. The system requires\nconstant adjustments, but its principles and bases are not\nsubject to debate. Other parts of the world have also\nsuccessfully entered into a process of cooperation and\nregional integration.\nOn the world level, the United Nations is the only\ntruly universal Organization. We must work at this level\nto make a contribution vital to the solution of global\nproblems, one that will complement the efforts being\nmade at the regional level.\nThat is the new and important responsibility that\nbecame evident in the course of the events and meetings\nthat occurred the world over in commemorating the\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations last year. There\nwas emphasis on the need to set up new structures and to\nreform the United Nations, to give it the requisite capacity\nfor review, action and cooperation.\nIt is our hope that, with a heightened awareness of\nthe interests of all mankind we, the representatives of the\nStates Members of the United Nations, will succeed in\ndisplaying the vision, courage and political resolve needed\nto make our Organization an effective instrument capable\nof facing the challenges of the third millennium.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, first of\nall, to congratulate Mr. Razali Ismail, as a representative of\na State with which Turkmenistan has exceptionally warm\nrelations, on the occasion of his election to this high post.\nI should like also to express confidence that his vast\ndiplomatic experience in close association with the United\nNations will enable him to effectively guide the work of the\ncurrent session, which is called upon to accomplish a\nnumber of historic objectives.\nThe President's opening statement reaffirms that our\nexpectations will come true. Here, I should like to express\nour appreciation to Mr. Freitas do Amaral for his work\nduring the preceding session of the General Assembly,\nwhich has become an integral part of Turkmenistan\u2019s\nhistory by dint of its unanimous adoption of the resolution\non the permanent neutrality of my country. Speaking from\nthis rostrum on the eve of the adoption of that resolution,\nHis Excellency Saparmurad Niyazov, President of\nTurkmenistan, emphasized that Turkmenistan would take all\nthe necessary steps to reaffirm its complete adherence to\nthe principles of the United Nations by making a\nconstructive contribution to the stabilization of the\nsituation in our strife-torn region, by peace-building and\nby serving the interests of cooperation within our region\nand at the inter-regional level. During the past year,\nTurkmenistan has taken steps to achieve this goal by\nplaying host to three rounds of talks between Tajik\nfactions in Ashgabat, by providing assistance to the\nMission of the Secretary-General\u2019s special envoy for\nAfghanistan, and by hosting a number of major\ninternational forums.\nHaving entered the world community of nations as\nan independent State on the eve of the twenty-first\ncentury, Turkmenistan, like other countries, has found\nitself facing the need to accept the challenge of the times\nso typical of the turn of centuries. That is why we have\nfocused our efforts on the international arena, striving to\nbecome part of the worldwide process with its new trends\ntowards unity based on national statehood and\nsovereignty. A policy of constructive neutrality has\nbecome our response to the challenge of the epoch.\nTurkmenistan is an Asian country whose destiny has\nbeen to become one of the actors involved in the all-\nEuropean process. We view this factor as a unique chance\nto cooperate with the Europeans within the framework of\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE), the European Union and other organizations, and\nto promote better understanding and the improvement of\nNorth-South cooperation.\nToday the international community confronts\nproblems requiring new approaches and innovative\ndecisions, profound analysis and forecasting. In this\nrespect, we would like to propose that, under the auspices\nof the United Nations, an international centre for political\nstudies be established in Turkmenistan that would carry\nout studies on the political and economic situation in our\nregion. The work of the centre should correspond to the\nnew geopolitical realities, and the centre should have the\ntask of elaborating specific strategic recommendations in\nthe interests of global peace and security. It is no secret\nthat analysing a situation from a distance often leads to\nincorrect conclusions and projections.\nConfrontation between blocs has become a thing of\nthe past. Today geo-economic regions have emerged as\nthe main actors in the political arena. Classifying States\naccording to their size and might, which infringes on the\ninterests of small and medium-size States, has become\n23\n\n\nobsolete. Within the existing system of international\nrelations, all States should be able to structure themselves\nwithin the framework of universally accepted rules, but they\nshould do so according to their own tenets and principles.\nIt is in this context that we support the initiatives aimed at\nintroducing appropriate changes in the functioning of the\nUnited Nations, its bodies and sister organizations.\nThe United Nations Charter stipulates that the Security\nCouncil bears primary responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. We share the view that\ntoday the notion of security has undergone a radical\ntransformation and includes an entire set of equally\nimportant political, economic, environmental, social,\nmilitary and other components. Proceeding from this\nassumption, we endorse the proposal that membership of\nthis main body of the United Nations should be enlarged,\nwithin reasonable limits, so that it may ensure that this\ninternational process is manageable and controllable. Of\nequal importance is the question of balanced and adequate\nrepresentation in the Security Council of States from both\nthe North and the South.\nToday\u2019s Turkmenistan is a country with a transitional\neconomy undergoing profound social and political changes.\nIn this respect, we hope that \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d\nwill be finalized during the current session, which will help\nto establish a system of priorities and assistance to States\npursuing such national development programmes. It is\nhardly possible to overestimate the role of the United\nNations, because it is precisely this mechanism that should\nensure the utmost objectivity and tolerance towards such\nprocesses. Newly independent States did not emerge out of\na vacuum. Each one possesses its own specific features,\nunique national and geographic characteristics, historical\nties and psychological patterns. Each one has the right to\nchoose its own model of development and State system.\nProceeding from this assumption, we support the view\nthat diversity is integral to the world. However, though all\nStates are subject to international law, the aspirations of all\nfor development and prosperity cannot be programmed\naccording to a single standard or world view. The main\nchallenge of the twenty-first century is to ensure that all\nMembers of the United Nations can look at one another\nfrom the point of view of unity in diversity. We are\ntherefore grateful to the United Nations and to States\npossessing global political and economic potential for their\nsupport and understanding.\nTurkmenistan possesses colossal natural resources. It\nhas one of the richest deposits of hydrocarbons in the\nworld \u2014 I refer to the Caspian basin as well as to other\nareas of my country. One of the major tasks facing us is\nthe establishment of a pipeline infrastructure that, in\nconjunction with the existing system, will ensure supply\nof our gas to Europe and Asia. We are glad that\nTurkmenistan\u2019s interests as an exporter coincide with the\ninterests of European and Asian consumers. We are happy\nthat neighbouring countries \u2014 Iran, Afghanistan, Russia,\nTurkey, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakstan \u2014 do not\nhave any differences with respect to this issue.\nIn this context I would like to touch on several\nissues relating to the Caspian Sea. Turkmenistan, like all\nlittoral States, is concerned about its future and the\nprospects for its resources. We believe that there is no\nplace for unilateral decisions or dictates on this issue.\nWhat is required is the establishment of a system of full\ntrust and interaction among the Caspian Sea States for the\nsake of the common interests and prosperity of each\nindividual State. The forthcoming Conference of Foreign\nMinisters of the Caspian States to be held in Ashgabat\nwill serve as the forum for discussion of all those\nproblems and will prepare a platform for a Caspian\nsummit meeting.\nTurkmenistan is opposed to any military activity in\nthe Caspian Sea. It wishes to ensure a regime of free\nnavigation with respect to the national borders of every\nlittoral State. The wealth of the Caspian Sea, its unique\nbiological and mineral structure and fragile ecological\nsystem call for a comprehensive and balanced approach,\nfree from short-term profit or political advantage. We do\nnot doubt that all Caspian Sea States will be able to find\nthe best alternative on the basis of common sense and\nrespect for the interests of each country involved in the\nname of the common goal of peace and security.\nThere is one area of cooperation with the United\nNations in which Turkmenistan has a special interest: the\nstruggle against drug distribution and trafficking.\nTurkmenistan is waging a relentless fight against this evil\nand has established a State coordination commission. At\nthe beginning of this year Turkmenistan joined the 1961\nSingle Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971\nConvention on Psychotropic Substances and the 1988\nUnited Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.\nTurkmenistan attaches great importance to its cooperation\nwith the United Nations International Drug Control\nProgramme, and has signed a bilateral agreement with it.\nIn May 1996 Turkmenistan, together with other countries\nof Central Asia, and in cooperation with the United\n24\n\n\nNations International Drug Control Programme, signed a\nmemorandum on regional cooperation concerning control of\nillegal production, trafficking and abuse of narcotic drugs.\nWe need to make extraordinary efforts in order to control\nthe situation, roll back the spiral of evil and reverse the\nsituation whereby the problem of drugs grows in proportion\nto the efforts made to combat it.\nTurkmenistan is actively cooperating with the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) and the United Nations in developing democratic\nprocesses so as to bring up new generations free from the\nold psychological stereotypes and doubtful ideological\nvalues. Democracy, human rights, people\u2019s rights to\nproperty and legal protection are all universal notions.\nHowever, it is not enough simply to understand their\nrelevance; it is necessary to implement them in real life\nonce and for all. What we need is patience and time to\nallow such understanding to be translated into practical\nreality. That is why Turkmenistan has created an institute\nfor democracy, human rights and statehood development,\nwhich is called upon to develop its own model of a\ndemocratic society, relying on the best European and Asian\nexperiences and drawing on the knowledge of international\nexperts. One does not have to be a specialist in order to\nunderstand that, no matter how perfect a model proposed\nfrom outside may seem, it might not be effective when\napplied to a traditional Oriental society such as exists in\nTurkmenistan, a country that has inherited values from\nancient civilizations and the culture of Islam. There is also\na specific mentality among its people, who have for\ncenturies fought for their survival and have eventually\nacquired the chance to be independent and have their own\nnational identity.\nThe agenda of the current session includes an item\ndealing with the development of cooperation between the\nUnited Nations and its bodies and the Economic\nCooperation Organization (ECO). During the last summit of\nthat organization, which was held in May 1996 in the\ncapital of Turkmenistan, my country assumed the\npresidency for the next two-year period, and it intends to\nexert every effort necessary to implement the large-scale\nprogrammes of this organization, which now comprises 10\ncountries.\nThe ECO is a purely economic organization with no\npolitical strings attached. It members share a common view\non this matter. Similarly, we believe that only the\nacceleration of economic development and the improvement\nof cooperation among States can bring well-being and\nprosperity to the peoples of the region. However, a number\nof political preconditions are indispensable for developing\neconomic interaction so that it can be effective and\nfruitful. I believe that a climate of political trust is the\nfirst requirement. If such a climate becomes a constant\nfactor in our relations, it will contribute to the\nadvancement of new, bold initiatives and specific projects.\nTo put it plainly, we must profess a philosophy of mutual\nunderstanding and trust. It is only under such conditions\nthat our projects can be successfully implemented. That\nis especially important because conflict situations persist\nin the ECO region, in Tajikistan and Afghanistan.\nTurkmenistan firmly believes that these two ancient and\nwise peoples are capable of overcoming the syndrome of\nlingering mistrust and difference. We fully support the\ninitiative of the United Nations and the efforts of\nneighbouring countries aimed at a peaceful settlement.\nAs for Afghanistan, we consider it important that the\nconflict there has moved from being in a category of\nforgotten conflicts to the centre of international efforts.\nBy conducting constant consultations with the leaders of\nneighbouring countries and the Secretary-General, the\nPresident of Turkmenistan, Saparmurat Niyazov, has\nexpressed Turkmenistan\u2019s readiness to take an active part\nin the search for an Afghan settlement. The fate of many\nglobal economic projects hinges on peace in Afghanistan,\nin particular the supply of energy resources to actively\ndeveloping energy markets in Asia.\nNext month Turkmenistan will celebrate the fifth\nanniversary of its independence. Today we can discern\nmore clearly the perspectives and understand better in\nwhat areas we should develop cooperation with foreign\npartners. We can clearly see and evaluate the situation at\nhome, in the region and the rest of the world.\nAccumulated experience enables us to say that\nTurkmenistan has found its place in the international\ncommunity, both politically and economically. By\nconsistently and progressively\n25\n\n\nmoving towards the democratization of our society and the\nestablishment of market mechanisms in the economy, our\nState is becoming integrated into the worldwide process. By\nclosely interacting with foreign partners and pursuing a\nvigorous foreign policy, we are confident that these tasks\nwill be implemented promptly and efficiently."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI congratulate\nMr. Razali on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. We are more\nthan convinced that his vast experience and diplomatic\nskills will prove to be vital assets at this session of the\nAssembly. I assure him that my delegation will cooperate\nfully with him in the fulfilment of his onerous\nresponsibilities.\nFurthermore, I would like to pay tribute to his\npredecessor, Professor Diogo Freitas do Amaral, who\nsteered the work of the Assembly through its historic\nfiftieth anniversary in a commendable and honourable\nway.\nOur tribute also goes to the Secretary-General\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali for his distinguished leadership of\nour Organization during the past year. We are especially\ngrateful to him for his tireless efforts to enhance the\nOrganization\u2019s role in maintaining international peace and\nsecurity as well as in promoting international economic\ndevelopment and cooperation.\nAt the last session of the General Assembly, when\nwe celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, we witnessed the largest-ever gathering of Heads\nof State and Government. On that occasion, the world\nleaders made a historic reaffirmation of our commitment\nto the purposes and principles of this Organization as\nenshrined in the Charter. Besides taking stock of the\nprogress made and the lessons learnt during the past 50\nyears, the world leaders endeavoured not only to\nrecapture the vision of the founding fathers of the United\nNations, but also to chart the institutional framework and\noperational parameters that could enhance the\nOrganization\u2019s relevance and effectiveness in a changed\ninternational landscape. My delegation sincerely hopes\nthat we will all be able to take full advantage of this\nrenewed commitment to the Organization to ensure that\nthe United Nations system as a whole is reformed,\nrevitalized and rendered more efficacious, transparent,\naccountable and democratic.\nThe United Nations, as the universally accepted\nmatrix of multilateralism, must, in the post-cold-war era,\nplay a vastly expanded role in the domain of peace-\nkeeping and make a positive contribution to the new\nphenomenon of globalization and its increased levels of\neconomic and social interdependence, as well as the\ntechnologically fuelled transnational linkages among the\ncountries of the world. The Organization therefore faces\nan inescapable imperative for reform and revitalization.\n16\n\n\nIn this regard, my delegation is deeply perturbed by\nthe slow progress made by the Open-ended Working Group\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council. We in\nAfrica maintain that the present arrangement, in which\nAfrica and Latin America have no permanent\nrepresentatives on the Security Council, while Asia has only\none, is unjust and antidemocratic and must not be allowed\nto continue. Those three regions should each have at least\ntwo permanent seats, with incumbents enjoying the same\nrights and privileges as the present permanent members.\nAdditional non-permanent seats should also be allocated to\neach of those regions so as to ensure equitable geographical\nrepresentation proportionate to the numerical strength of\neach region in this Organization.\nIn other areas of reform, our primary objective should\nbe to reaffirm the role of the General Assembly as the\nhighest decision-making body in the entire United Nations\nsystem. Any process of restructuring, revitalization or\nstrengthening should necessarily redress the erosion of the\nprinciple of the accountability of all principal and\nsubsidiary organs and specialized agencies of the United\nNations to the General Assembly. My delegation will\ntherefore seek resolutely to uphold the authority of the\nGeneral Assembly as enshrined in the Charter and,\nconsequently, will oppose any proposals or\nrecommendations that might lead to the usurpation of the\nauthority of the General Assembly under any guise or form.\nAccordingly, we will not agree to authorizing the\nSecretariat to amend, postpone or cancel any official\nprogramme activities without the express approval of the\nGeneral Assembly, whose prerogative it is to give, change\nor withdraw the mandates of such programme activities.\nMy delegation is of the strong view that reform should\nnot necessarily be equated with the downsizing of the\nUnited Nations system. We also feel that an optimally\nstreamlined and strengthened United Nations system will\nnot necessarily be responsive to the needs of its\nmembership as long as it is subjected to chronic cash-flow\nproblems. The appalling record of some Member States that\ndishonour their financial obligations to the United Nations\nand our endless lamentations over the resultant financial\ncrises have clearly brought into question the credibility of\nthe Organization and the commitment of its membership. In\nour view, the time is long past for us to re-examine all the\nefforts that we have been exerting in an endeavour to\nidentify and agree on the formulation and mechanisms to\ndeal with the current financial crisis that has beset the\nOrganization. Unless Member States take serious steps to\nclear their arrears and improve their payment pattern by\nremitting their assessed contributions promptly, in full and\nwithout conditions, the United Nations will continue to\ndither on the brink of bankruptcy and its efficacy will be\ntotally compromised. It is imperative that we, the Member\nStates, create a capacity for the Organization to fulfil the\nmandate we have given to it.\nThe United Nations\u2019 role in maintaining international\npeace and security must of necessity have a global thrust\nin both the geographical sense and the conceptual\nframework. Peace-threatening conflicts in any part of our\nglobal village should never be seen to attract differential\nattention depending upon their geographical location,\nstrategic interest, ethnic complexion or such other narrow\nconsiderations of the big Powers.\nThe much-belated intervention and subsequent\nfailure of the United Nations in Somalia and its half-\nhearted interventions in Rwanda, Burundi and Liberia\nhave exposed the Organization to harmful criticism, which\nhas led to a further decline in its credibility. United\nNations peacekeeping efforts in Africa have generally met\nwith mixed fortunes. We have yet to see the Namibian\nand Mozambican success stories repeat themselves in\nseveral other trouble spots on the continent.\nAlthough the peace process in Angola continues to\nrun behind schedule, we are persuaded that the seeds of\nlasting peace have been sown in that country. We need to\nredouble our efforts in urging the Angolans to persevere\nalong the present bumpy road of peace on the basis of\nnational reconciliation and unity.\nAlthough the humanitarian situation in Somalia has\nimproved somewhat since the intervention of the United\nNations, that country remains in political turmoil from\nwhich it cannot rescue itself fully without the sustained\ninvolvement of the international community. We therefore\ncall upon the international community, through the United\nNations, to review its current minimalist approach to\nSomalia, explore new possibilities for constructive\nengagement and give peace another chance.\nIn Burundi, the fundamental challenge of having\ndemocracy with security has now been compounded by\nthe need to stop generalized violence and to return the\ncountry to constitutionality. The United Nations should\nsupport the sterling efforts of Burundi\u2019s neighbours to\nassist that country to achieve peace and stability. The\ntragedy of genocide in Rwanda must not be allowed to\nrepeat itself in Burundi. No!\n17\n\n\nIn Liberia, brute force and violence must not be\nallowed to triumph. The parties should be made to honour\nthe peace agreement already reached through the good\noffices of the Economic Community of West African\nStates. The people of Liberia have suffered enough. The\nUnited Nations must send a clear message to the warlords\nin that country that our common humanity may soon impel\nus to try them for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nWith regard to the stalled peace process in Western\nSahara, it is imperative that the international community,\nthrough the United Nations, honour the spirit and letter of\nthe commitment it made to the disenfranchised people of\nthat territory and ensure that a free and fair United Nations-\nsupervised referendum takes place there on the basis of the\nUnited Nations Settlement Plan for Western Sahara.\nIn the Middle East, we appeal to the new Government\nof Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization to\ncontinue on the path of peace and reason, as espoused by\nthe late Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, who\npaid with his life that the two peoples might live together\nin peace and harmony. Renewing the construction of\nsettlements on Palestinian land is no contribution to peace.\nIt undermines the peace process. There is no alternative to\npeace. We therefore urge the parties to remain committed\nto the peace process until Palestinian self-determination and\na Palestinian State become realities. It is only in this\ncontext that the security of Israel can be guaranteed.\nCommitment to peace has remained the centrepiece of\nthe Non-Aligned Movement. Thirty-five years ago, the\nfounding fathers of this Movement had a vision of a world,\ninter alia, living in peace and harmony, free of nuclear\nthreat and super-Power rivalry. Two days ago, we had\noccasion to commemorate that vision. We found it to be as\nrelevant and powerful today as when it was first articulated\n35 years ago. We recommitted ourselves, among other\nthings, to pursuing the goal of a world at peace, free from\nthe threat of weapons of mass destruction. We reaffirmed\nthat complete nuclear disarmament is a sine qua non for the\nsurvival of humanity on our planet. We therefore appeal to\nall nuclear Powers to agree to ban the production, testing\nand use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and other\nweapons of Armageddon.\nTo enhance this Organization\u2019s accountability and\ncredibility, the decision-making process with regard to\nUnited Nations peace-keeping mandates must cater to an\nincreased role for the general membership of the\nOrganization, starting with troop-contributing countries.\nFurthermore, efforts such as those which entail preventive\ndiplomacy and post-conflict peace-building, as spelled out\nin the Secretary-General\u2019s report, \u201cSupplement to an\nAgenda for Peace\u201d, clearly fall within the domain of the\nGeneral Assembly. Moreover, it is our view that the\nUnited Nations is the only Organization which is uniquely\ncharged with a global mandate to maintain international\npeace and security. This means therefore that regional\npeace-keeping efforts can only complement and not\nsubstitute the leading role of the United Nations.\nThe United Nations should also enhance its role in\npromoting international cooperation in other spheres of its\ncompetence, particularly that of trade. Only a few months\nago, the international community celebrated the successful\nlaunching of the World Trade Organization, following\nprotracted multilateral trade negotiations. For this new\nmultilateral trade regime to work, it is imperative that\nmember States resist the temptation to initiate practices or\npolicies that seek to compromise the sovereignty of other\nmember States or to reintroduce colonialism in another\nguise. Developed countries should live up to their\ncommitments and abandon protectionist policies if all\ncountries are to benefit from the new trading\narrangements. Improved market access and increased\nforeign direct investment must be accompanied by new\nand innovative ways to tackle the debt burden of\ndeveloping countries, with a view to finding a\ncomprehensive and once-and-for-all solution to the debt\nproblem.\nGiven the negative economic trends in some of our\ncountries, the developed countries and international\nfinancial institutions should seriously consider debt-\nforgiveness for low-income developing countries. Such a\ncourse of action would stop the flight of much-needed\nresources from these countries and create new possibilities\nfor real savings for investment and growth. I wish to\naffirm that we, the developing countries, fully accept and\nrecognize that we bear the primary responsibility for our\nown development; we have accordingly undertaken\nvarious economic structural adjustment reforms, often at\nenormous social and political cost. These ambitious and\npainful reforms could flounder if developed countries fail\nto complement these sterling efforts by taking decisive\nmeasures to reduce the stock of our debt and by removing\nthe wall of protectionist barriers. We also call on the\ndeveloped countries to take decisive measures, as a matter\nor urgency, to increase the flow of official development\nassistance, private investment and the transfer of\ntechnologies to developing nations.\n18\n\n\nIn a few days, world leaders will assemble in Rome\nfor yet another world summit. This time, the international\ncommunity will focus its attention on the important\nquestion of food security and the good health of the people\nof the world. Unfortunately, even the increased food\nsupplies in the world are inaccessible to more than 1.5\nbillion hungry people who are acknowledged to be living in\nabject poverty. We cannot accept that the legacy of hungry\nand malnourished people is what our generation will\nbequeath to the twenty-first century.\nWe expect development to bring food to our dining\ntables, clean water into our homes, better housing,\nimproved health and security to all our children. The\npresent trend towards globalization and the deepening\ninterdependence among economies should foster a universal\nfeeling and sense of belonging to the global village whose\nconcept we have now come to take for granted, but whose\nbenefits accrue to only a few countries.\nOnly last week, this Assembly carried out a review of\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\nAfrica in the 1990s. In the statements made by\nrepresentatives of African countries, it was made\nabundantly clear that the international commitments made\nin 1991, like those made at the launching of United Nations\nProgramme of Action for African Economic Recovery and\nDevelopment 1986-1990 earlier, had not been fulfilled. We\ntherefore call on the international community, and our\ndevelopment partners in particular, to mobilize the requisite\nfinancial resources to augment our efforts and give fresh\nimpetus to the realization of the goals set out in United\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\n1990s.\nWhen the founding fathers of the United Nations\noutlined the purposes and principles of this Organization,\nthey envisioned a United Nations that would\n\u201cbe a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in\nthe attainment of these common ends.\u201d\nAs we seek to enhance the relevance of this\nOrganization to the world today, it is imperative that we\nunderstand that the vast majority of the people of this world\nexpect the United Nations to be a principal actor for\nprogress and change, and to be equipped to play an\neffective and leading role in improving the economic and\nsocial situation of the world\u2019s citizens. As we\ncommemorate the International Year for the Eradication of\nPoverty, we are alarmed at the growing extent of abject\npoverty, which now engulfs 20 per cent of the world\u2019s\npopulation. That poverty is the root cause of most of the\nworld\u2019s social ills, including strife and peace-threatening\nconflicts, cannot be overemphasized. We appeal to\nGovernments the world over to respond in earnest to the\nclarion call of the Copenhagen world social summit and\nto spare no effort at both the national and international\nlevels, to roll back the advancing scourge of poverty.\nIt is needless to stress that the elimination of poverty\nand the attainment of the broader goal of sustainable\ndevelopment will remain impossible to achieve unless\nnations show renewed political resolve to implement\npolicies aimed at enabling humankind to better manage\nand live with its environment, as agreed to at the Rio\nde Janeiro summit and at subsequent Conferences. The\never-dwindling natural resource base, global warming,\npersistent droughts and desertification are eloquent\nreminders that humankind\u2019s current destructive processes\nof growth are pushing our planet towards the precipice.\nUnder these circumstances, the search for safer,\nenvironmentally sound and sustainable approaches to\ndevelopment, including the utilization of new and\nrenewable resources, has become more urgent now than\never before.\nOnly last week, leaders from 103 countries, from all\nregions of the world, heeding this historic challenge of\nour time, gathered in Harare, Zimbabwe, for the first-ever\nWorld Solar Summit to map out strategies aimed at\npromoting the development and utilization of solar and\nother forms of renewable energy. In recognition of the\nimportant role that solar energy can play in the\nadvancement of socio-economic development and in\nreducing environmental degradation, the Summit adopted\na comprehensive World Solar Programme 1996-2005 with\na view to creating effective mechanisms to speed up and\nfacilitate the use of solar energy. We call upon the United\nNations Secretary-General, the specialized agencies of the\nUnited Nations, non-governmental organizations and the\ninternational community at large to lend the necessary\nfinancial and other forms of support to the Programme to\nenable it to succeed.\nIn June 1997 another conference of equal\nenvironmental significance, the International Convention\non Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), will convene\nin Harare. The challenges facing this conference will by\nno means be small. Global conservation strategies and\npolicies have to be implemented in the national interest\nand within the means available for the benefit of each\ncountry. We in southern Africa have adopted effective\nconservation policies over the years that have seen the\n19\n\n\ngrowth of our elephant herd beyond the levels our\necosystem can support. It would be unfortunate, and indeed\nan irony of our times, if we, who have conceived and\nsuccessfully implemented innovative wildlife conservation\npolicies, should find ourselves being penalized for our\nsuccess and the failure of others. The international\ncommunity has an obligation to adopt new, dynamic and\nflexible policies that would enable countries such as South\nAfrica, Namibia, Botswana and my own country to reap the\nbenefits of their wildlife conservation successes. To act\notherwise would be counter-productive and an injustice to\nthe noble cause of wildlife conservation as a whole. My\ncountry intends to make constructive suggestions on this\nsubject at the CITES meeting next year.\nTo remain relevant and effective, the United Nations\nmust stay at the centre stage of global activities. Its\nworldwide responsibilities cannot be delegated; nor can its\nCharter-enshrined priorities be subordinated to issues\nextraneous to its purposes and principles. We are taken\naback by the efforts of those who seek to prescribe to the\nUnited Nations a reform exercise that would force the\nOrganization to diminish and to reorient its Charter-\nenshrined role in promoting development to the Bretton\nWoods institutions, the World Trade Organization and the\nblind forces of the market. The Charter envisaged an\nidentifiable role for the United Nations in promoting\ndevelopment, which is a prerequisite for, and the ultimate\ncorollary of, peace.\nMy delegation maintains that the United Nations is\nuniquely placed to play a policy-making and resource\nidentification role. Its decisions must necessarily set the\npace and direction for other institutions such as the Bretton\nWoods institutions and the World Trade Organization.\nIn conclusion, the strength of the United Nations lies\nin its universality and its impartiality in implementing its\nmandate to promote peace and security, economic and\nsocial development, human rights and international law as\noutlined in its Charter.\nWhereas the Organization has clearly played a\nsignificant role in the containment and settlement of\ndisputes through peace-keeping activities, and in the\nexpansion and codification of international law, it has\nlargely failed to have any significant impact on the\ndevelopment process in developing countries. The few\ndeveloping countries that have managed to score any\nbreakthroughs have done so in spite of the United Nations.\nAs the General Assembly outlines its medium-term plan for\nthe period 1998-2003, my delegation, together with others,\nwill seek to ensure that the development process,\nparticularly Africa\u2019s economic recovery and development,\nis underwritten by the Organization\u2019s irrevocable\ncommitment.\nFinally, let me turn to the agenda item dealing with\nthe election of the Secretary-General of this Organization.\nSince it is an item on the agenda of this Assembly, it is\nimperative that Member States freely express their views\non this matter. We of Africa have a clear and\nunambiguous position. We believe that it is Africa\u2019s turn\nto provide a Secretary-General. We have had one term so\nfar and, following the normal practice, are entitled to a\nsecond term. The African leaders, meeting in Yaound\u00e9,\nCameroon, this year, endorsed the candidature of the\nincumbent, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\nWe stand ready to engage all Members of this\nOrganization in the process of finalizing consultations on\nthis subject.\n\n\n\n"

The organs\nof this body were dissected and properly examined and the\nfindings were encouraging. The prevailing opinion is that\nthe strengths of this institution far outweigh its weaknesses.\nHowever, we cannot be complacent. As our Prime Minister,\nthe Right Honourable Sir James Mitchell, said when he\naddressed the fiftieth session:\n\u201cLiving institutions, like anything biological, need the\nnurture of fresh nutrients, fresh ideas. A living thing\neither improves or perishes.\u201d (Official Records of the\nGeneral Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings,\n40th meeting, p. 49)\nMr. Razali has assumed the presidency after the period\nof stock-taking and at a time when we look with renewed\nconfidence towards the United Nations. His passion for\ninnovation will serve him well. As he presides over this re-\nenergized body, I wish to congratulate him on his election\nto the presidency. Let me take this opportunity to extend\nto his predecessor our best wishes and deep appreciation\nfor the competent manner in which he presided over the\nlast historic session.\nAs the twenty-first century approaches, we must ask\nourselves the following questions: What of the future?\nWill our children survive? Will we be at peace with our\nfellow men?\nThe picture looks bleak. We are still plagued by\npersistent poverty, disease, hunger, environmental\ndegradation and spiritual pollution, wanton acts of\nterrorism, the drug menace, domestic disturbances and\nregional conflicts.\nThere is still hope so long as we see each other as\nfriends and neighbours rather than as competitors. If we\npool our resources for the enhancement of mankind, the\nworld will be a much better place.\nWe have witnessed over the past year a trail of\nterrorist destruction and death. In our view, all terrorists\nare cowards who rely on fear and destabilization to\nachieve their sinister ends. What triumph can there be in\nthe murder and disfiguring of innocent people? This is\nobviously the product of sick minds. These faceless\ncriminals who perform these acts, sometimes with the\ntacit approval of authority, have no place in the\ncommunity of nations.\nMy delegation is calling for another conference to\ndeal with the root causes of terrorism. Such a conference\nmust involve this entire body so that the views of small\nand mighty nations on the matter can be expressed. As\nthe new century approaches, our children must be able to\nplay in public parks without having to look over their\nshoulders. When we travel, we must be able to view the\npassengers next to us as new-found friends rather than\npotential executioners.\nWhy do we continue to stockpile weapons of mass\ndestruction? The aim of these weapons is to kill. Killing\nhuman beings should not be regarded as a sport. Life will\nalways be man\u2019s most treasured possession. In our\npeaceful region, we are strangers to the world of such\ndeadly arsenals and will continue to denounce their use.\nWe are delighted to be associated with the passage of the\nAustralian resolution on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty. Any step, however small, towards the curbing\n14\n\n\nof the arms race and the eventual elimination of weapons\nmust be viewed as positive.\nOne of the most formidable challenges of our time is\nthe protection of the environment. The threats which\nconfront us are daunting; global warming, desertification\nand deforestation are among the many. Environmental\nprotection is the key to our survival. Mankind is faced with\na choice: either save the environment or perish.\nThe suffering in Burundi, Somalia, Liberia, Rwanda\nand Bosnia cannot go unnoticed. The international\ncommunity can do much more to help the dispossessed and\nthe hungry of these troubled lands. After all, should we not\nbe our brother\u2019s keeper?\nI come from a small but proud country. Our people\nbelieve in industry and hard work. The banana industry is\nthe mainstay of our economy. But our very existence is\nunder serious threat from forces larger and more powerful\nthan ourselves. I speak not in anger, only in pain and\nhelplessness. How else can we feel when those who have\nthe capacity to help us seek our destruction? If the forces\nof indifference and greed were to succeed, our society\nwould be thrown out of gear and the democracy which we\nso cherish will go up in flames.\nOur entire population has been sensitized to our\nbanana woes and the people have vented their frustration by\nwriting thousands of letters to those who may hold the key\nto our survival. We wish to thank all those who have come\nto our assistance, be they in Europe or elsewhere, and we\nsincerely hope that they will continue to lend a helping\nhand.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is deeply concerned\nabout the use of illegal drugs and drug trafficking. The\nmagnitude of this problem transcends national boundaries\nand calls for increased cooperation on a multilateral level.\nThe influence of the drug barons runs very deep.\nSometimes they take on the characteristics of power elites.\nWe firmly believe that renewed international efforts can go\na long way towards the eradication of this menace, which\ncontaminates both body and mind.\nWhile we welcome the recent elections in Bosnia, we\nare troubled by developments in the Persian Gulf. We\nsincerely hope that the situation will normalize itself as\nsoon as possible, since an escalation of the crisis would be\nof benefit to no one.\nThe Middle East is another area of concern. We\nhope that the recent peace talks between the Israelis and\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization will bear fruit.\nMuch has been achieved over the past two decades and it\nis expected that the next century will bring peace to the\ntroubled people of these ancient lands.\nI now turn my attention to the vexing question of the\nresumed participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan\nin the United Nations. This founding member of the\nUnited Nations has been excluded from this body for a\nquarter of a century. How does one reconcile this with the\nprinciples of parallel representation of States and of\nuniversality? It is time for the Republic of China on\nTaiwan to be readmitted to this body. In our view, the\ncountry not only possesses the attributes of nationhood,\nbut it is well endowed to contribute to the development of\nMember States of this body. Its economic success is a\nmodel for developing countries. The country has also\nmade democratic strides. I wish through this forum to\ncongratulate the Republic of China on Taiwan on the\nholding of its first direct presidential election. It is really\na triumph of the democratic process. All States have not\nembraced this process.\nDespite the adoption and entry into force of the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, we are shocked by\nthe incidence of gross violations of the fundamental rights\nof the child. Sexual abuse, prostitution and child labour\nare but a few of the problems that dehumanize our\nchildren. My delegation joins in the call for measures to\nbe taken, not only for the universal ratification of the\nConvention, but also for the effective implementation of\nthis instrument.\nThere has been much discussion about the reform of\nthe Security Council. Brilliant ideas have been put\nforward from all quarters. Our own view is that the\nSecurity Council must be restructured to reflect an\nequitable geographic distribution. After all, big Powers do\nnot have a monopoly on knowledge or truth. And in this\nbody, all nations should be treated as equals.\nHistory has saddled the United Nations with a heavy\nburden of responsibility and, as we look towards the\ntwenty-first century, we must seize every opportunity to\nachieve the goals and ideals enshrined in the Charter.\nThere is a great deal to be done in the area of social and\neconomic development, but we can do it once we have\nthe political will and the unity of purpose.\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

These phenomena affect less-favoured and\nsocially advanced countries alike, leading to social\ndiscrepancies and situations in which some manage to\nplan their own development, while others, deprived of job\nopportunities, fail.\nDevelopment issues are inextricably intertwined with\nthe destiny of nations. They change the face of countries\nand peoples and exacerbate the pressures on the less-\nfavoured and most populous regions of the world. This is\na real and constant threat to peace.\nIn some cases, the situation is aggravated by the\nfragility or, even worse, lack of democratic institutions.\nHere, power is wielded as an end in itself and not as an\n6\n\n\ninstrument for achieving the common ideal. Societies and\nStates tend to withdraw into themselves, their only concern\nbeing to retain their strength and power. Sometimes those\nwho hold the power do not bother to meet the needs of a\nrapidly changing society, except when forced to preserve\nthe necessary consensus.\nOur Organization should spare no effort to help\ncountries and peoples alike to redress the balance and\nremedy these errors.\nThe items on the agenda for discussion at the fifty-\nfirst session of the General Assembly are of paramount\nimportance and deserve the utmost attention and impartial\nand thorough analysis, since they pertain, on the one hand,\nto the peaceful coexistence of peoples and, on the other, to\nthe existence and the structure of the Organization itself.\nUltimately, peace and coexistence depend on and are best\ngoverned by this institution.\nAll efforts must be pooled to improve, update and\nrender the United Nations more effective. This objective\ncan be achieved through a reform of the system inspired by\nequality, justice and wider democracy and aimed at\nensuring broader participation and the fair sharing of duties\nand powers among all Member States.\nSan Marino pledges itself to fulfilling the tasks derived\nfrom its United Nations membership, while benefitting from\nthe opportunity to participate actively and make its\ncontribution to the various bodies of the United Nations.\nUndoubtedly, the strengthening and enhancing of the\nUnited Nations require a review of the composition, role,\nfunctioning and powers of the Security Council. This\nreview process, however, is proceeding very slowly and at\ntimes reveals inadequate understanding, cooperation and\nacceptance of the views of others.\nWe are convinced that the Security Council must\nadjust to the changes brought about by historical events\nand, consequently, to the expanded membership of the\nUnited Nations itself, whose character and essence are\nclearly becoming increasingly universal. San Marino\nbelieves that the Security Council must increase its\nmembership, since, as it stands today, it no longer reflects\nthe world\u2019s reality, nor does it promote a rotating system in\nwhich all States, irrespective of their size, are equally\nrepresented and can participate and make their own\ncontributions.\nAs regards the decision-making process of the\nSecurity Council, we believe that the maintenance,\nexercise and potential extension of the right of veto must\nbe carefully reconsidered. Fortunately, we are living in an\nera characterized by dialogue, debate, discussion,\nproposals and the search for joint solutions. These are the\ninstruments which we should resort to, rather than the\nright of veto. Over 50 years of activity and progress allow\nand entitle us to reconsider other instruments that, having\nproved useful in dealing with initial difficulties and tragic\nsituations, are no longer necessary for further growth and\nconsolidation.\nLastly, special attention should be paid to the\ndevelopment and interpretation of the Security Council\u2019s\nrules of procedure, with a view to adopting a more open\nattitude and a larger involvement of States in discussing\nthe issues at stake. In this context, let me call on all\nMember States to intensify their efforts to find a\nuniversally acceptable solution.\nIs this all mere utopia? If it is, then we must not\nforget that those who have committed themselves to\nserving their countries and the international community\nhave a duty to translate this utopia rationally into a\npolitical design, without neglecting or ignoring other\npeople\u2019s expectations. Only in this way will that utopia\nbecome a real political design based on the principles of\nresponsibility, equality and justice.\nI wish to express the deepest satisfaction of the\nGovernment of the Republic of San Marino at the\nadoption of the resolution on the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty, which my country cosponsored. Today,\nI have the honour of signing this Treaty on behalf of my\ncountry. We hope that all States will become loyal Parties\nto the Treaty and cooperate in the elimination of nuclear\nenergy for non-peaceful uses, so that future generations\nmay inherit an environmentally sound planet.\nGiven its geographical location in Europe, San\nMarino is particularly attentive to the evolution of the\npeace process in the Mediterranean area, especially in the\nMiddle East, where the earlier general enthusiasm has\nbeen overshadowed by disenchantment and frequent\ndifficulties. Fortunately, hope, however weak and volatile,\nis still alive. The Middle East still needs the international\ncommunity\u2019s commitment and encouragement to proceed\nto a peaceful settlement of long-standing and more recent\ndisputes that are the cause of division and uncertainty.\n7\n\n\nIn the speech I delivered at the fiftieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, I stressed, on behalf of the Government\nof San Marino, the need to reconsider the instrument of the\nembargo, its effectiveness and repercussions, especially in\nthose cases where, in the absence of armed conflict,\ninternational isolation alone has proved a valid moral and\npolitical means of international pressure. In this regard, it\nis with satisfaction that I note that the elimination of\ncoercive economic measures as a means of political\ncompulsion has been placed on this session\u2019s agenda. The\nGovernment of the Republic of San Marino is confident\nthat the debate will lead to a proper examination and\nresolution of the problem, so that innocent people who are\nalready suffering are no longer the main targets of these\nmeasures.\nThe Republic of San Marino firmly believes that the\nUnited Nations, like the Council of Europe and the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, must\nremain the most appropriate forum for producing concrete\nresults and enhancing the mechanism of fruitful dialogue\nand the exchange of ideas. The most daunting challenge is\nstill that of preserving future generations from the scourge\nof war by reaffirming human dignity and promoting free\nand equitable social progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffDuring the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\n13\n\n\nUnited Nations, States renewed our faith in the ideals of the\nCharter of this Organization. This means that past\nexperience has given us a new vision of the world, a keen\nawareness of the interdependence of nations, all of which\nseek to live in a work committed to peace, freedom and\njustice.\nIt is with this conviction that my delegation extends to\nMr. Razali Ismail the warmest congratulations of the\nGovernment of Zaire on his election as President of the\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly. We would also\nlike to congratulate his fellow Assembly officers. And we\nalso congratulate Mr. Razali\u2019s predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral. The competence and\nintelligence he showed as he guided the work of the fiftieth\nsession earned him the Assembly\u2019s appreciation.\nWe would also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to\nthe Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and to\nthe members of the Secretariat, for their untiring efforts to\nensure the proper functioning of our Organization and for\ntheir clear-sightedness and courage. Zaire also takes this\nopportunity to express its support for Mr. Boutros-Ghali as\nhe stands for a second term as Secretary-General. This must\nbe our position. His predecessors from other continents had\nthis opportunity; Africa cannot accept otherwise.\nDuring this half century, our free nations have won the\ngreatest victories in the fields of national liberation and\npolitical independence. However, as we come to the end of\nthe twentieth century, we still face major challenges in the\neconomic, cultural and social fields, as well as in the area\nof international peace and security.\nPeace, freedom and stability together constitute an\nindispensable prerequisite for development. No part of our\nEarth, no country in the world, can be really secure while\nthere are still outstanding hotbeds of tension. And, today,\nsuch hotbeds are on the increase, in Africa, in Asia and in\nCentral and Eastern Europe.\nThe situations in Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia, Liberia,\nYugoslavia, Afghanistan and the Middle East are all causes\nfor the concern weighing on international peace and\nsecurity. The United Nations, which is already seized of\nthese issues, should continue its efforts with the\nencouragement of every one of us.\nIn Angola, a neighbouring country to Zaire, my\ndelegation can see positive developments in the domestic\nsituation. The integration of Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a\nIndepend\u00eancia Total de Angola (UNITA) forces into the\nAngolan National Army should be promoted and\nencouraged for the good of the entire population of\nAngola.\nFor more than two years, Zaire has lived with the\ntragedies of Burundi and Rwanda, which have lead to a\nmassive influx of refugees from these two countries onto\nits territory. This grave situation, for which my country is\nnot responsible, has caused and continues to cause us\nconsiderable human, material, environmental and other\nforms of damage. In this respect, the international\ncommunity has been inexplicably reticent in its actions,\nas if Zaire should shoulder this burden alone and\nindefinitely. Zaire is indeed constantly being denigrated\neven to the extent that it is often falsely accused of\nsupporting armed activity within Rwanda and Burundi. A\nmemorandum from the Government of the Republic of\nZaire on the lack of security in northern and southern\nKivu has already been submitted to the Secretary-General.\nA few days ago, the Zairian towns of Bukavu, Uvira and\nsurrounding districts were shelled by armed elements\nfrom Rwanda. The Assembly has heard Rwanda\u2019s\npernicious and false representation of the facts. Inter-\nethnic massacres occurred in Rwanda in 1959, 1962 and\n1972, not to mention 1994. This genocide in Rwanda was\ndesigned, developed and executed in detail and with\ndelight by Rwandans against Rwandans, and by that I\nmean by past and present leaders in power in Kigali.\nMembers can now understand why Rwanda, nursing its\nplanned aggression against my country, has refused to\nsign the non-aggression pact patiently negotiated by all\nthe States of Central Africa, including Rwanda.\nFrom this rostrum, my delegation solemnly declares\nthe following: First, Zaire does not accept and will never\nagain accept to act as anyone\u2019s scapegoat. Secondly, Zaire\nwill do all it can to defend the security of its population\nand its borders, and will call on its people and its friends\nin its defence. Thirdly, Zaire is always prepared to\ncooperate with the neighbouring Governments and\npeoples of Rwanda and Burundi to ensure the voluntary\nand dignified return of refugees to their respective\ncountries. Failing this, following the example of certain\nEuropean Governments with respect to refugees and\npeople without documentation, Zaire will have no choice\nbut to begin the enforced and unconditional return of such\npeople to their countries of origin.\nFourthly, as President Mobutu stated last year in this\nforum, Zaire will never accept the de facto transformation\nof a part of its territory into a \u201cHutuland\u201d, whether\nthrough a challenge to its territorial integrity or through\n14\n\n\nthe establishment of refugee settlements on its territory.\nAnyone considering that can forget it.\nFifthly, given the sacrifices endured by its people,\nZaire calls on the international community to implement\nfully the agreements that have been signed, and General\nAssembly resolution 49/24 of 2 December 1994 on special\nassistance to countries hosting refugees. Finally, Zaire\nreaffirms the position it stated at the Copenhagen World\nSummit for Social Development regarding the holding of a\nworld conference on refugees and displaced persons to find\na comprehensive and lasting solution to the refugee\nquestion, which has disastrous consequences for\ndevelopment, human relations and human rights.\nThe political, economic and social situation in Zaire\nhas deteriorated over six long years of transition. Despite\nthis difficult situation, Zaire has made it a point of honour\nto pursue its democratic process, committing itself to\nreestablishing the authority of the State, rebuilding the basic\ninfrastructure, improving the country\u2019s economic, financial\nand monetary situation, ensuring the security of persons and\nproperty and observing human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms.\nTo date, Zaire\u2019s main task has been to organize free,\ndemocratic and transparent elections. This is why it has set\nup a National Electoral Commission which is now ready to\nget down to work, as observed by the delegation recently\nsent to Zaire by the Secretary-General. Furthermore, the\ndraft electoral law and the bill on the organization of a\nconstitutional referendum are also currently under\ndiscussion by the Parliament of Transition. Zaire wishes to\nreaffirm before the entire world that the democratization of\nits political system is irreversible, regardless of the\ndifficulties facing our country. For these reasons, the\nGovernment of Zaire calls on the international community\nto give it effective support in the establishment of these\nnew democratic institutions by June 1997 at the latest.\nDemocracy can only develop and last in a country that\nenjoys economic development that allows for the protection\nand promotion of human rights. Some human rights were\nbeing promoted in Zaire long before the democratization\nprocess. Thus, for example, despite the many social and\ncultural constraints, Zairian men and women enjoy political\nand vocational equality, including in terms of remuneration.\nThe noble mission of the United Nations Commission\non Human Rights certainly merits our encouragement. Zaire\nhas nothing to hide, and has thus accepted and accredited\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s human rights representative, whose\noffice is in our capital, Kinshasa. Nonetheless, Zaire\ndeplores and vigorously condemns the malicious use of\nthe human rights issue for political ends, as can be seen\nin the unfounded and unwarranted accusations levelled\nagainst it at each annual evaluation session of the\nCommission on Human Rights in Geneva.\nPreventive diplomacy should be the very basis of\npeace-keeping operations. However, preventive diplomacy\nwould be meaningless if the international community\nwere not to grant it a standing, mobile military sector that\ncould be deployed wherever international peace and\nsecurity were to come under threat. Thus, in the\nframework of the United Nations Standing Advisory\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa, the\ncountries of this subregion, with the exception of Rwanda,\nsigned the non-aggression pact at the latest Organization\nof African Unity (OAU) summit in Yaound\u00e9.\nIn this first year of the second half-century of the\nUnited Nations, safeguarding peace and cohesion among\npeoples are issues of vital importance to all of us. Zaire\nconsiders the adoption of the resolution recommending\nsignature of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nat the fiftieth session of the General Assembly to be an\nimportant step towards comprehensive nuclear\ndisarmament. We do, of course, recognize that this is not\na perfect Treaty. It lacks the firm commitment of nuclear-\nweapon States to renounce the use and threat of use of\nsuch weapons in their relations with other States. It also\nlacks a precise timetable for complete destruction of\nexisting weapons. It does not mention the banning of\nnuclear tests in laboratories, which is the most\nsophisticated modern way of developing such weapons.\nDespite these imperfections, Zaire joined those\ndelegations that sponsored the resolution, and it voted in\nfavour of the text proposed. I wish to announce officially\nthat Zaire will sign this text tomorrow, 4 October.\nFrom this rostrum we appeal to the nuclear-weapon\nStates to put aside their selfish interests and to commit\nthemselves firmly to the new path set out by the Treaty,\nso that the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons can\nbecome a living reality and so that nuclear weapons will\nno longer threaten future generations, as they have done\nsince the end of the Second World War.\nWe cannot be at peace with ourselves if we fail to\ntake firm action for conventional disarmament as well.\nI come from a region where the merchants of death\nhave dumped tons and tons of conventional weapons that\n15\n\n\nkill people daily. We urge countries that manufacture and\nsell these instruments of death to stop taking satisfaction in\nthe positive balance sheets of their international trade,\nwhich includes arms sales. This is a shame for all mankind.\nTo those who would give lessons of morality and ethics, we\nwould insist that they look at the way they live and stop\nsowing death and suffering. Life and happiness are the most\nfundamental of human rights.\nIn addition to disarmament, worldwide elimination of\npoverty is fundamental to the strengthening of peace and\nthe realization of comprehensive, sustainable development.\nAt the dawn of the third millennium, it is deplorable to note\nthat more than a billion people today live under conditions\nof unacceptable poverty and are outside the mainstream of\neconomic and social progress because of imbalances in the\ninternational economy.\nMy delegation hopes that, to remedy this situation, the\nNorth-South dialogue will be guided more by the\nimperatives and interests of mutual advantage and benefit,\nas well as by genuine interdependence. Solidarity demands\nfairer prices for commodities, access to the markets of\ndeveloped countries, easing the debt burden and increased\nofficial development assistance so as to ensure sustained\ngrowth and sustainable development.\nLast year we commemorated our Organization\u2019s\nfiftieth anniversary. That occasion was an opportunity for\nus to focus on the possibilities for an appropriate reform of\nthis Organization, which is unique in its mission and its\nimpact. I would like to offer my country\u2019s reflections on\nthis subject.\nWe are now living in a period of extraordinary\ncontrasts. Despite the historic successes of our Organization\n\u2014 including independence for many countries, the peace\nprocess under way in the Middle East, the end of the South\nAfrican saga and the perceptible tendency of the United\nNations towards universality \u2014 we must observe with some\nbitterness that areas of tension have flared up worldwide,\nsparking anarchy, despair, poverty and death.\nFor this reason, Zaire believes that the Security\nCouncil, which is the United Nations body that has\nforemost responsibility for maintaining international peace\nand security, and which by its present membership is no\nlonger representative, should be expanded and its\nfunctioning improved. In this exercise, the main concern\nshould be to correct the clear imbalance in that body.\nExpansion of the Council should take into account the will\nof many countries to become members and the importance\nof safeguarding its effectiveness. It should avoid making\nit a body dependent on the General Assembly. For that\nreason, we think that equitable geographic representation\nwould appropriately remedy the glaring imbalance in the\ncurrent representation of the Security Council. We\nencourage the international community to give deep\nthought to this question and not to forget that one\ncontinent \u2014 Africa \u2014 is at the greatest disadvantage with\nthe current composition of the Council.\nWe refuse to be dragged into the dispute over the\nveto power of permanent members. We are against the\nemergence of a category of permanent second-class\nmembers in the Security Council.\nThere is a need to look for ways to improve the\nfunctioning of the Security Council. It is inconceivable\nthat a State that is concerned in a question being\ndiscussed in the Council can participate only in a formal\nmeeting \u2014 if there is one \u2014 to hear the decision made.\nIf the State were officially involved in the informal\nconsultations on that issue, its direct contribution to the\nmembers of the Council could enable them to adopt\ndecisions that would be well thought out and realistic\nrather than being imposed.\nWe must have the courage to put an end to the anti-\ndemocratic character of this important United Nations\nbody. All the parties involved should be given the\nopportunity to defend themselves before the members of\nthe Council. This is a basic rule of the administration of\njustice.\nWe take note of the report of the Open-ended\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\nSecurity Council, and we encourage it to pursue its\nconsideration of this matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I congratulate you,\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-first\nsession of the General Assembly and pledge to you the full\nsupport of my delegation.\nDuring the past fiftieth-anniversary year, the States\nMembers of the United Nations have reaffirmed their\nsupport for the fundamental purposes and principles of the\nOrganization. The momentum created by the anniversary\nmust now be used to adapt the Organization to new\nrealities. To this end, both structural and financial reforms\nmust be undertaken, setting priorities and reallocating\nlimited resources. But the point of the exercise must not be\nsimple cost-cutting. What we need above all is a stronger,\nnot a weaker, Organization, better capable of dealing with\nthe enormous global challenges of the twenty-first century.\nThere is no alternative to the United Nations. The\nfurther evolution of the Organization is therefore inevitable.\nBut the Organization will not evolve in a commonly\nacceptable direction under duress. Agreement on and\nimplementation of necessary reforms will only be achieved\nin a spirit of dialogue and accommodation.\nThis applies not least to the ongoing work to adapt\nthe Security Council. Changes in its composition and\nworking methods should remain a priority. The Council\nmust better reflect political and economic realities in a\nrapidly changing world. Its continued effectiveness\ndepends on a constructive contribution by all its members,\nas well as on equitable representation and manageable\nsize. There should be a geographically balanced expansion\nof seats in both the permanent and non-permanent\ncategories, including permanent seats for Germany and\nJapan. We should ensure that small and medium-sized\nStates have the possibility to be represented in the\nCouncil.\nThe United Nations system must be strengthened\nfurther in the fields of economic and social policy and\ndevelopment. The revitalization of the Economic and\nSocial Council is important if the Council is to serve as\nan important venue for coordination and policy-making on\nissues which affect our daily existence. Iceland is a\ncandidate for election to the Economic and Social Council\nfor the next term and is prepared to contribute\nconstructively to the work of the Council and to the\ndebate on its future.\nThe signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT) this week will be remembered as an\nimportant step towards limiting the nuclear-arms race and\nsetting us on the path of genuine nuclear disarmament. I\n\n\nwould like to urge Member countries to sign and ratify the\nTreaty as soon as possible.\nThe proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of\nmass destruction is of continuous concern to the\ninternational community. Unconditional and universal\nadherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT), the chemical weapons and biological\nweapons Conventions, and now the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is a critical step towards\neliminating weapons that threaten life on our planet.\nBut the horrors associated with weapons of mass\ndestruction must not blind us to the widespread suffering\ncaused by increasingly destructive conventional arms.\nLandmines especially are a growing menace,\nindiscriminately maiming and killing innocents no less than\ncombatants. Iceland strongly supports a comprehensive ban\non the use, production and export of anti-personnel\nlandmines.\nIn the aftermath of the cold war, it has become\nincreasingly clear how prolonged regional conflicts can\nhave serious international implications. Events in Iraq are\nonly the most recent example. Such conflicts need to be\naddressed in a comprehensive manner by the United\nNations. In addition to the important function of the\nSecurity Council, the wider United Nations system should\nbe employed more actively to prevent armed conflicts as\nwell as to assist in the reconstruction of societies emerging\nfrom war. Vigilance towards threats or acts of aggression\nwhich can erode regional or international stability is a\nnecessary part of such preventive activity. International\nterrorism is aggression by unconventional means. Its\nvictims are mainly civilians. The use or sanction of\nterrorism by individual States is unacceptable. The action\nof the international community should properly reflect the\nuniversal abhorrence of alliances between terrorists and\nindividual States.\nThe sinister scheming of terrorists and organized crime\nis of growing concern, not least since it is frequently based\non illicit drug trafficking. The United Nations can do much\nto enhance international cooperation in crime prevention\nand in the suppression of drug trafficking across national\nboundaries. Iceland supports the holding of a special\nsession of the General Assembly in 1998 devoted to drug\ncontrol.\nThe international community must move swiftly to\nenhance respect for relevant human rights instruments in\nareas of conflict. The establishment of international war\ncrimes tribunals is a step in the right direction, provided\nthey receive the cooperation necessary to fulfil their\nmandate from all parties concerned.\nThrough a series of international conferences, the\nOrganization has, during the past few years, addressed the\nmost important issues facing humankind. These\nconferences have highlighted both the enormity of our\ntask and the complex interrelationship between the\nvarious global issues we are often called upon to deal\nwith, be they absolute poverty, environmental degradation,\noverpopulation, human rights abuses or social injustice.\nHaving concluded this unprecedented series of\nconferences with the second United Nations Conference\non Human Settlements in Istanbul last June, we owe it to\nfuture generations to join hands and spare no effort to\nimplement the decisions reached.\nUniversal human rights are the foundation on which\nwe base the work of the United Nations. This includes the\nsafeguarding of gender equality and the rights of the most\nvulnerable groups in society: the poor and the disabled.\nChildren are increasingly the target of atrocities in war\nand of human rights violations. Six years after the World\nSummit for Children we still must do a better job of\nhonouring our commitments to children. In this context,\nIceland welcomes in particular the recommendations of\nthe Stockholm World Congress against Commercial\nSexual Exploitation of Children and wishes to see them\nfollowed up as soon as possible.\nHunger and malnutrition are shameful phenomena on\nthe eve of the twenty-first century. With the resources at\nits disposal, the international community should be able\nto provide food security for the whole of mankind. The\nforthcoming World Food Summit will hopefully secure a\ncommitment at the highest political level to rapidly\nachieve this objective.\nAs a country owing its survival and prosperity to the\nharvesting of living marine resources, Iceland has\nconsistently underlined the potential of the oceans as a\nmajor source of nutrition. Icelandic fisheries have\ndeveloped experience and technology which could benefit\nothers. The Government of Iceland is prepared to\nfacilitate international cooperation in this field. Iceland\nhas contributed actively to the establishment of\ninternational law governing the protection and sustainable\nutilization of the oceans. The United Nations Convention\non the Law of the Sea has already proven to be a historic\nsuccess in the field of international law and remains\namong the greatest achievements of the United Nations.\n2\n\n\nThe seas and the ocean floors are the depositories of\nenormous resources. The agreement of the international\ncommunity on an extensive legal framework on this subject\nis therefore a major accomplishment. The Convention offers\nthe prospect of resolving serious conflicts on the uses of the\nseas which could be detrimental to international\ncooperation. The Convention has already provided the basis\nfor further agreements, such as the recently concluded\nAgreement relating to the Conservation and Management of\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.\nIceland has actively participated in the adoption of the\nGlobal Programme of Action for the Protection of the\nMarine Environment from Land-based Activities. Pollution\nof this sort is responsible for over 80 per cent of all marine\npollution. In order to facilitate the implementation of the\nProgramme, a draft resolution on institutional arrangements\nwill be addressed by the General Assembly at this session.\nHowever, major challenges remain. Controlling the use\nof persistent organic pollutants needs to be addressed.\nIceland welcomes the proposal put forward within the\nUnited Nations Environment Programme to establish an\ninternational committee in 1997 with the aim of reaching a\nglobal agreement on this question.\nThis year, Iceland celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of\nits membership in the United Nations. We have strongly\nemphasized constructive participation. This reflects our\nbelief in the importance of multilateral cooperation for\nsmaller States and, in particular, in the hopes and\naspirations attached to the world Organization.\nThe United Nations is ideally capable of achievements\nin specific areas which are beyond the reach of national or\nregional authorities. However, it will never attain the\ncapacity to meet all expectations. As Member States debate\nreforms, I would like to emphasize the importance of\nsetting priorities and making them well known. The shaping\nof a new United Nations suited for the twenty-first century\nmust be complemented by vigorous information efforts with\nthe aim of ensuring continued public confidence and\nsupport.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I, at the outset, extend\nthe congratulations of my delegation to you, Sir, upon your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nfirst session. In your endeavours, based on your rich\ndiplomatic experience, you may count on the assistance and\nsupport of the Hungarian delegation.\nLet me also pay tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for his extremely able\nleadership throughout our historic fiftieth session.\nThe diversity of challenges facing the community of\nnations, the difficulties associated with finding proper\nresponses and the importance of building up supportive\nnational and international constituencies are hardly likely to\nsend multilateralism into oblivion. Yet, in this time of\nchange, and despite the forceful tendencies of globalization,\ninterdependence and integration, no single applicable\napproach is at hand for political leaders. Given its unique\nrole and capacities, the United Nations can be the\nprincipal vehicle by which the international community\nselects and addresses problems requiring a universal\nresponse.\nThis Organization, however, cannot and should not\nmicro-manage the solution to all the urgent problems of\nour contemporary world. Times have changed and so\nmust the United Nations. In several instances, the\ninternational community may act much more efficiently\nthrough regional organizations or specialized agencies.\nWhat is essential, however, is that the nations forming\nthis Organization stand up with one strong voice when the\npurposes and principles of the Charter are put to the test.\nViolations of international law, human rights and\nfundamental freedoms should be matched with legitimate\nand adequate responses by the international community,\nacting through the United Nations.\nThe issue of multilateral disarmament and non-\nproliferation remains a legitimate concern for the United\nNations. Last year, we were pleased by the indefinite\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons. This important step not only\nconstituted a major building block in the complex web of\nour non-proliferation and disarmament efforts, but served\nas a catalyst to forge consensus around the future\ndirection and dynamics of this process. As a result of\nsustained and responsible work in the Conference on\nDisarmament, it became possible to finalize the text of\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\nHungary stood fully behind this compromise text, which\ncaptures the diversity of views and approaches while still\nconstituting a coherent and forward-looking document.\nOpening the Treaty for signature was, indeed, a\nlandmark. Hungary was among the first countries to\nsponsor resolution 50/245. I signed the Treaty on the day\nafter it was opened for signature. This Treaty is not the\nend of the process. There is a need for further systematic\nand progressive efforts towards nuclear disarmament and\nnon-proliferation, and the CTBT must be given its due\nplace in that process. In this context, we join those who\ncall for its smooth entry into force, thereby allowing the\ndisarmament process to proceed.\nHungary also consistently seeks to contribute to the\nstrengthening of stability and security through cooperative\nefforts at both regional and bilateral levels. Building upon\nour intensified relations with the European Union, we\nlook forward to the early beginning of negotiations on our\n7\n\n\naccession to the European Union. We hold the firm view\nthat the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) will expand stability and security in\nEurope and will strengthen trans-Atlantic partnership and\nsolidarity. Hungary, in its bilateral relations with\nneighbouring countries, is striving to contribute to the\nestablishment of conditions enabling them all to be full\npartners in the institutions of Euro-Atlantic integration. We\nremain convinced that, with an enlarged NATO and an\nexpanded European Union, the United Nations will have\neven more efficient and helpful regional partners.\nThe crisis in the Balkans has proved to be a painful\nand dramatic litmus test of the resolve of the international\ncommunity. The United Nations has also had to draw its\nown conclusions from the tragedy. The mission of the\nUnited Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern\nSlavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium is currently making\nprogress on the road to the peaceful reintegration of the\nregion into Croatia, while securing respect for the human\nrights of all its inhabitants and the rights of national\nminorities in the region. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the\nrole and determination of the Implementation Force (IFOR)\nis indispensable for guaranteeing the implementation of the\nDayton Agreement. The cooperation, through IFOR,\nbetween NATO, the United Nations, the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of\nEurope in responding to the different facets of this major\nchallenge is an innovative paradigm for future conflict\nresolution and crisis-management efforts.\nWe strongly believe that a solid international presence\nis required to allow democracy and stability to take firm\nroot in the region. Hungary continues to provide the\nnecessary logistical and transit facilities to IFOR forces and\nUnited Nations peace-keepers and is contributing to the\nstrength of both IFOR and the United Nations International\nPolice Task Force. The return and reintegration of refugees\nand displaced persons \u2014 including those who found shelter\nin Hungary \u2014 pose a continuing challenge to the\ninternational community. The establishment of democracy\nand the rule of law should be accompanied by\nreconstruction and rehabilitation, thereby facilitating the\nconditions of safe and orderly return. Citizens should be\nassisted by the international community in their efforts to\ncreate and activate democratic institutions in which good\ngovernance and accountability will force war criminals out\nof the political mainstream. We see the work of the\nTribunal in The Hague as an essential component of the\nDayton peace process and the cooperation extended to it as\nan important indicator of the willingness of the parties to\nfollow through on both their Dayton commitments and\ntheir obligations under the Charter.\nExperience of the recently held elections in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina suggests that keeping to the schedule\nagreed at Dayton was a sound decision. We remain\nconcerned, however, at the ethnically divided voting\nresults. This only highlights the urgency of proceeding\nwithout undue delay to the building-up of a unique\ninstitutional infrastructure for the country and of\nfacilitating the holding of municipal elections in a more\nstable political environment.\nWe are now in a period of reflection with regard to\nUnited Nations conflict-prevention and crisis-management\ncapabilities. In our view, the United Nations, as it\ncontinues to live up to its responsibilities under the\nCharter, ought to craft its response strategies more\ncarefully. The preventive capacity of the United Nations\nshould be further strengthened. A sound early warning\nsystem, combining political, military, humanitarian,\nhuman rights and economic areas, would broaden the base\nof options and enhance the chances for success in the\nearly detection of conflict situations. An early\ninternational monitoring presence in itself has a major\ndeterrent effect. In-depth information on a given situation\nwould catalyse diplomatic efforts and help trigger a broad\nconsensus on the course of action.\nSpecialized agencies and regional organizations, such\nas the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope, are of primary importance in defusing sources of\ntension through creating appropriate and efficient response\nmechanisms. The United Nations, while fully discharging\nits responsibilities under the Charter for the maintenance\nof international peace and security, can authorize and thus\ngive legitimacy to these endeavours as well as to actions\nto be taken by ad hoc coalitions of the able and willing.\nThe building-up of regional peacekeeping and peace-\nbuilding capacities, as well as the increase of the\noperational character of some key activities of specialized\nagencies, are among the avenues that have to be more\nfully explored.\nThe reform agenda of the United Nations has been\nput in motion against the background of these new\nchallenges and opportunities. Despite considerable\nprogress in identifying the main areas of change within\nthe different negotiating structures, we are seriously\n8\n\n\nconcerned that the overall reform process has lost most of\nits dynamics. While we should not allow that individual\nconsensual elements of the reform process be held hostage\nto progress in unrelated issues, there seems to be an evident\nneed to reach a political agreement, at least on the basic\nphilosophy of the major premises of the reform agenda.\nHungary is aware of the difficulties that make real progress\nso hard to achieve. It stands ready to help reinvigorate the\nmomentum for change and to make genuine United Nations\nreform an early reality.\nPromotion of the international protection of human\nrights is a fundamental component of my Government\u2019s\nforeign policy and one of the essential tasks conferred upon\nthe United Nations by its founders. Despite the remarkable\nresults achieved in the standard establishment and building-\nup of implementation machinery, there is still much to do\nin maintaining our determination to act in defence of human\nrights, wherever abuses may occur. Chronic underfunding,\nlack of efficient coordination and the sometimes evasive or\nuncooperative attitude of several Governments only\nunderline this urgency, which was finally recognized when\nhuman rights were made one of the programme priorities of\nthe United Nations. In our view, the United Nations, despite\nthe important advances made, such as the establishment of\nthe post of High Commissioner for Human Rights, is still\nnot sufficiently equipped to deal with the latest and gravest\nof human-rights challenges: those emanating from ethnic\nconflict, civil strife, government breakdown and the\ncollapse of the rule of law.\nThe importance of safeguarding and monitoring the\nobservance of the rights of national or ethnic minorities is\nstill too often disregarded and put in the context of political\nexpediency. Lack of full respect for the rights of minorities,\ntogether with the absence of necessary political, legal,\ninstitutional and administrative guarantees, are among the\nroot causes of many of the conflicts on our agenda.\nToday, as we witness the growing importance of\nhuman-rights operational activities, the timeliness of the\nconcept of preventive peace-building comes to mind. This\nimplies not only an enhanced human-rights preventive and\nmonitoring capacity of the United Nations, but also the\nright combination and use of the assets at our disposal,\nfrom early warning to preventive protection. The practice\nof financing some United Nations human-rights field\noperations from the peace-keeping budget and a greater\ncoordinating role for the High Commissioner for Human\nRights may be two of the avenues which deserve our full\nattention.\nI wish to underline the fact that the way in which\nthe United Nations tackles the crucial global problems\nmankind is facing will greatly determine the quality of the\nimminent next century. Let me refer, in this context, to\nthe importance of some of the problems on the agenda of\nthis session. Sustained efforts to combat international\nterrorism, transnational crime or illicit drug trafficking are\nrequired from all of us in order to preserve the\ninternational legal order, the present achievements and\nfurther potential of democracy and development. The\nUnited Nations has an important role in coordinating\nefforts to ensure that those involved in terrorist activities\nfind no safe haven and expect a vigorous response from\nthe international community. Transboundary criminal\nactivity and drug-related money-laundering require the\nstrict application of the law by strong, independent\njudiciaries. Our task is to make use of the advantages of\nmultilateral cooperation in this field.\nThe Republic of Hungary stands ready to work in\npartnership with Member States to promote efficient\nmultilateral action and to translate into deeds the noble\nideals set forth in the Charter of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to extend the\nwarmest congratulations of my Government to the\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session\non his election. I would also like to express our deep\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas\ndo Amaral, whose leadership during the fiftieth session\nwas a valuable asset for the Organization.\nI also seize this opportunity to express my deep\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for his dedication to his duties since 1992.\nThe Foreign Minister of Ireland, as President of the\nCouncil of the European Union, delivered a statement to\nwhich my Government fully subscribes, as it does to the\nUnion\u2019s memorandum. I would like, however, to\nelaborate further on some issues that are of particular\ninterest to my country.\nLet us remember the message delivered by the world\nleaders during the special commemorative meeting of this\nbody: the Organization needs to undergo a serious\nreorganization in order to be ready to confront the\nchallenges of the years ahead. The political commitment\nof the Member States and the contribution of adequate\nresources constitute two fundamental prerequisites for the\nsuccess of the United Nations.\nUnfortunately, few noteworthy proposals have been\nput forward concerning the comprehensive modernization\neffort to enable the Organization to become more efficient\nand transparent in the fulfilment of its functions while\nrationalizing the use of its resources.\nIt is the Member States that have endowed the\nUnited Nations with its current features. Even if the\nOrganization\u2019s administrative weaknesses were fully\nremedied, the power of extensive correction and\nlong-overdue reform lies not in this building, but in our\nown capitals.\nAt this stage, we are faced with two alternatives:\neither curtail demands on the United Nations, giving it a\nreasonable chance of carrying out reduced policies within\nits existing resources, or recognize the need to improve its\ncapacities and grant it greater functions, as well as the\nnecessary means. Greece strongly advocates the second\npath, because the need for the world Organization is\ngrowing, not shrinking. Year by year, we move closer to\nmenacing demographic, socio-economic and ecological\nthresholds. The only chance we have to deal with\ntransnational problems is to work out transnational\n4\n\n\nresponses. We need to cooperate constructively towards\ncommon ends.\nIt would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for\nthe United Nations to face the current financial crisis if\nMember States were to deprive the world Organization of\nthe resources and assets that they have contractually\npledged of their own free will. In this context, it should be\nstressed yet again that no amount of savings will, by itself,\npermit the United Nations to be solvent, and that none of\nthe Member States, in particular those that play a major\nrole in the Organization\u2019s decision-making process and in\nthe definition of its activities, should have second thoughts\nwhen it comes to footing their part of the bill.\nLet us be clear: the whole reform is endangered by the\nlooming atmosphere of imminent financial collapse. Even\nworse, the United Nations, and all the principles that it\nstands for, are exposed to the danger of being discredited,\nperhaps forever, even in the eyes of its warmest supporters.\nThis is a much more fundamental issue than improvements\nto specific parts of the system, welcome and needed though\nthe latter may be.\nEarlier this year, the European Union outlined a\ncomprehensive package to address the financial crisis.\nFurthermore, Greece, on a national basis, responded\npositively to the Secretary-General\u2019s appeal and decided to\nincrease its annual contribution to the peacekeeping-\noperations budget, thus moving on a voluntary basis from\nGroup C to Group B of countries that contribute to the\nfinancing of the Organization\u2019s peacekeeping activities. As\na result, our contribution will increase by 500 per cent by\nthe year 2000, when the process of gradual reallocation will\nhave been completed.\nIt has become increasingly fashionable to argue that\nthe idea of a world community is alive in the human\nimagination, though not yet in the world of action; that the\nconcept of collective security has failed to take root because\nit does not reflect the spirit of the age; that the public\nmultilateral approach cannot be effective in conflict\nresolution, because there are no collective solutions to\nindividual crises; and that behind-the-scenes diplomacy,\nwhich pursues relatively modest goals, will always be better\nat keeping conflict within reasonable limits, because it will\ncompromise between what justice demands and what\ncircumstances permit.\nIn the light of past and recent experience, the Greek\npeople certainly do not have immoderate illusions in this\nregard. The case of Cyprus is a striking example of the\ninability of the international community to ensure\nimplementation of clear-cut United Nations resolutions\nand to tackle the problem of the ongoing occupation of\none Member State by another following an act of military\naggression. To cite just one other example, Greece is\nthreatened with war in the event it applies the provisions\nof the Convention on the Law of the Sea, which has been\nsigned by all Member States, except for the one that\nmade it clear that it would not hesitate to use force for\nthe maintenance and defence of its vital interests.\nHowever, it would be totally wrong to discard\nmultilateralism just because of the persistence of attitudes\nthat assuage consciences without solving the problems.\nWe have to strike a positive balance between vision and\nreality, because no society, and certainly not the\ninternational community, can aspire to human, economic\nand social development without a stable and legally\nappropriate framework.\nThroughout its existence, the United Nations has not\njust constituted the main, if not the only, incarnation of\nthe global spirit of hope. The principles enshrined in its\nCharter have established a code of conduct for States,\nwhich have the duty to contribute to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, to refrain from the threat\nor use of force, and to settle disputes by exclusively\npeaceful means and in accordance with international law.\nMoreover, the Organization itself has often been a\nsuccessful instrument for the prevention and management\nof conflicts.\nIf power politics are allowed to be deployed in the\npursuit of exclusive and narrow interests in a climate of\nconfrontation, if the world\u2019s resources are shared on the\nbasis of military power rather than of international treaties\nand conventions, if priority is not given to international\nlaw and international cooperation, and if we attempt to\nevade the responsibilities that we have all undertaken\nunder the Charter, however appealing and convenient that\nmight appear in the short term, we will sow the seeds of\nchaos, anarchy and rapid disintegration. The United\nNations offers the only framework in which to achieve\nthe important objective of enforcing international\nlegitimacy, provided, of course, that it improves its\ncapacity to deal with international problems and\nespecially to create an effective mechanism of collective\nsecurity.\nGreek-Turkish relations illustrate the need for such\nan improvement. The Greek Government sincerely desires\nthe establishment of normal good-neighbourly relations\n5\n\n\nbased on the principles of international law and respect for\ninternational treaties, which, however, Turkey seems\ndetermined to ignore. The Turkish Parliament unanimously\nadopted a resolution on 8 June 1995, which empowers the\nGovernment to use military force in case Greece exercises\nits legal right to extend its territorial waters in accordance\nwith the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nMoreover, the Turkish Government adopted the contents of\nthis resolution in direct violation of the United Nations\nCharter, which forbids the use of force or the threat of the\nuse of force in international relations.\nEven worse, in contravention of the Treaty of\nLausanne and the Treaty of Paris, Turkey laid claim at the\nbeginning of this year to the Imia islets in the Aegean Sea,\nwhich are Greek sovereign territory, and even supported\nthis claim by military means. This sets a very dangerous\nprecedent for the entire region. Turkey is attempting to\nsubvert the territorial status quo established more than 70\nyears ago and is backing its claims with the use of armed\nforce. Furthermore, the Foreign Minister, Mrs. Ciller, in her\ncapacity as Prime Minister, claimed in February that 1,000\nGreek islands and islets in the Aegean are Turkish, and that\nif Greece attempted to contest this \u201cfact\u201d, Turkey would\nconsider it a casus belli. A few days later she raised the\nnumber to 3,000.\nGreece has repeatedly called on Turkey to have\nrecourse to the International Court of Justice concerning the\nImia islets. Turkey, on the contrary, has lately challenged\nGreek sovereignty, even over the inhabited island of\nG\u00e1vdhos, south-west of Crete in the Libyan Sea, and\ndespite the outrageous nature of this claim, it has not\nunequivocally withdrawn it.\nWe see that Turkey wilfully violates the most basic\nprinciples of the international legal order and far from\nexhibiting any self-restraint, puts forth ever more\nprovocative claims against Greece. My country, on the\nother hand, not only scrupulously respects international law\nand treaties, but also demonstrates great self-restraint in its\nrelations with Turkey. There is no better example of this\nthan the fact that Greece has chosen not to react forcibly to\nthe massive violations of Greek airspace and the constant\noverflying of Greek territory on the part of Turkish\nwarplanes. This responsible stance should not, however, be\nmisinterpreted in any way. On the contrary, and despite the\nabsence of any real will on the part of international\ncommunity to uphold the principles enshrined in the United\nNations Charter, Greece is absolutely determined to protect\nits sovereign rights by all legitimate means, and the threat\nof force will not dissuade it from doing so.\nAs to the Cyprus issue, it is widely admitted that the\nstatus quo is unacceptable. Nevertheless, no progress has\nbeen achieved in the course of the last 22 years. Turkey,\nprovocatively defying consecutive Security Council\nresolutions is still occupying by force a considerable part\nof the island. At the same time, Turkey is flagrantly\nviolating basic human rights and freedoms of the Cypriot\npeople, while engaging in systematic plunder of the\nisland\u2019s cultural and religious heritage. Moreover, Turkey\ncontinues to systematically promote the illegal and\ncondemned practice of establishing settlers on the island.\nThe time has come to reach a just and viable\nsolution to the Cyprus problem based on the relevant\nUnited Nations resolutions and providing for a\nbicommunal bizonal federation with a single sovereignty\nand international personality and a single citizenship,\nwhile safeguarding the independence and territorial\nintegrity of the Republic of Cyprus.\nThe prospect of Cyprus joining the European Union\nis indeed an important new development, which creates\nconditions that should facilitate a comprehensive\nsettlement of the issue. The period until the start of the\naccession talks should in no way be left unexploited. At\nthe same time, the Greek Government welcomes any new\nideas and initiatives, whatever their origin may be, which\nwould contribute to a solution within the framework of\nthe United Nations resolutions. A basic factor for\nachieving a breakthrough, in our opinion, is the\ncoordination of all initiatives by the Secretary-General\nand his Special Representative.\nMeanwhile, the tension lingering on the island\ninvolves serious risks and creates additional complications\nwhich render the efforts for a settlement more arduous.\nTurkey and the pseudo-state, taking advantage of a\npeaceful demonstration by Greek Cypriots, proceeded a\nfew weeks ago, with the active involvement of the\nextremist terrorist Turkish group the Grey Wolves, to\nimplement a meticulously prepared plan which was\ncrowned by the murder in cold blood of two young\nCypriots and the injuries sustained by many others,\nUnited Nations peacekeepers included.\nThe aim was undoubtedly to demonstrate the\nexistence of an alleged international boundary on the\nisland. It was also to support the Turkish claim that the\ntwo communities cannot live peacefully side by side and\nthat the presence of the Turkish occupation forces is\ntherefore necessary for the protection of the Turkish\nCypriot community. But the truth is that both\n6\n\n\ncommunities can indeed coexist peacefully. So it was felt\nnecessary to call in extremist elements from mainland\nTurkey in order to implement this scenario and to try to\ncreate mistrust between the communities.\nIn the wake of those recent tragic developments we\nsteadfastly believe that the adoption of President Clerides\u2019\nproposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus, a proposal\nwhose importance has already been widely acknowledged,\nwill decisively contribute to defusing tension and will at the\nsame time meet the security requirements of all\ncommunities living on the island.\nIn a broader context, the search for a just and viable\nsolution to this complex international problem requires\ndecisiveness and perseverance. If the bicommunal dialogue\nis to have any chance of success, a minimum common\nground is indispensable, based on the relevant United\nNations resolutions. But if the other party does not show\nthe necessary political will, the international community\nshould at last live up to its political and moral\nresponsibilities. It should take action without delay and try\nto convince Turkey to abide by international law and\nwithdraw its troops from the island.\nWith regard to the Balkans, Greece\u2019s policy in the\narea is guided by the principles of the maintenance of\nstability, peace and security, the inviolability of\ninternationally recognized borders and full respect for\nhuman rights, including those relating to national minorities,\nin accordance with the relevant principles of the United\nNations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe. Greece supports the establishment of good-\nneighbourly relations and the development of close\neconomic ties with and among all Balkan countries. At the\nsame time, our systematic cooperation with the countries of\nthe Balkan peninsula contributes to the achievement of their\nlong-term goals of economic and political rapprochement\nwith the European Union and its institutions. We fully\nsupport and actively promote the European orientation of\nthese countries.\nMoreover, Greece has supported all international\ninitiatives aimed at further promoting Balkan regional\ncooperation, such as the conference of ministers of\nsoutheastern Europe \u2014 which convened this year in Sofia\nand which will meet again in Thessaloniki in June of next\nyear \u2014 the European Royaumont initiative and the United\nStates southeast European cooperative initiative. We believe\nthat in their complementarity, these efforts contribute to the\nstability, security and prosperity of the area.\nIn the context of regional cooperation I should also\nmention the Greek initiative for trilateral meetings of the\nministers for foreign affairs of Greece, Bulgaria and\nRomania, which took place at Ioannina, Greece in 1995,\nand, after that, in Varna, Bulgaria, on 16 and 17 March\n1996. The aim of these meetings is to bolster subregional\ncooperation, mainly in the fields of transport,\ntelecommunications and energy, as well as in the\ndevelopment of infrastructure.\nGreece was one of the founding members of the\nBlack Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) organization.\nGreece recently became a member of the Parliamentarian\nAssembly of the BSEC and participates actively in this\ninitiative that encompasses countries from both the\nBalkans and the Black Sea area and which can make an\nimportant contribution to the development and stability of\nthe wider region. One important achievement among\nothers is the establishment in Thessaloniki of the BSEC\nBank of Trade and Development which, is expected to\nstart functioning soon and contribute to the\nimplementation of specific projects of great interest to the\nregion.\nI will now try to give a brief assessment of my\ncountry\u2019s bilateral relations with each individual Balkan\ncountry.\nIn its relations with Albania, Greece actively pursues\nthe development of good-neighbourliness and cooperation\nin all fields, based on the respect of sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity, as well as full respect for human\nrights, including those relating to national minorities, in\naccordance with the principles of the United Nations and\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\nThe Greek minority in Albania constitutes a bridge\nof friendship and cooperation between the two countries.\nTo this end, encouraging steps are being undertaken by\nthe Albanian Government. Greece has actively supported\nAlbania in its efforts for reconstruction and development\nand has backed its association with international\norganizations. The visit last March of the President of the\nHellenic Republic to Tirana and the signing of a treaty of\nfriendship and cooperation between the two countries\nopened a new chapter in their relations for the benefit of\nthe two peoples.\nGreek-Bulgarian relations have continued their\nfruitful and constructive development marked by\nexchanges of visits at all levels. Recent crucially\nimportant agreements \u2014 among them one concerning the\n7\n\n\nopening of three new border check-points and another on\nthe waters of the Nestos river \u2014 give true meaning to their\ncooperation in the field of infrastructure, while being of\ndecisive significance for the future development of the\nregion's European orientation.\nGreece\u2019s relations with Romania have reached a high\nlevel during the last years. Visits at all levels, including one\nby the President of the Hellenic Republic, have taken place\nfrequently and close and broad cooperation in the economic\nand cultural fields has been achieved.\nGreece\u2019s goal is the establishment of close and\nfriendly relations with all countries that have emerged from\nthe former Yugoslavia. The traditionally close relations of\nGreece with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will be\nfurther strengthened through enhanced economic\ncooperation, especially following the suspension of the\nUnited Nations embargo, which inflicted heavy losses on\nthe Greek economy also. A multi-faceted development of\ntheir cooperation will help to redress the past.\nGreece\u2019s relations with Croatia and Slovenia have\nfollowed a steady upward trend. Greece has a great interest\nin the dynamic development of its relations with those two\ncountries in all fields, and I am glad to acknowledge their\npositive response as well. With regard to Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Greece fully supported the Dayton Peace\nAgreement and has actively participated in the efforts to\nimplement it fully. Timely and full respect of this\nAgreement is the best guarantee of the preservation of the\nintegrity, sovereignty and multiethnic character of that\nRepublic. The efforts of the international community to\nachieve peace in Bosnia must succeed. First must come the\nconstitution and proper functioning of the joint organs of\nthe Republic in order to expedite the return to full\nnormalization of life in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Greece\nhas established diplomatic relations with Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and participates in reconstruction plans with\nsubstantial economic aid.\nGreece expresses the wish that negotiations taking\nplace with The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\nunder the auspices of Mr. Vance on the issue of the name\nof that Republic will finally meet with success, so as to\nopen the way for a full normalization and the dynamic\ndevelopment of relations between our two countries.\nThe Middle East peace process is currently at a critical\ncrossroads. It is with shock and dismay that my\nGovernment is following the latest dramatic developments\nin the West Bank and Gaza. We express our deepest\nsorrow at the deaths that have occurred and our grave\nconcern about the future of the peace process. Greece\nurges all parties to demonstrate the utmost restraint and to\nrefrain from any action which might lead to a further\nescalation of violence in the occupied territories. In\nparticular, they must step back from any action that is\nbound to rekindle deep-rooted sentiments of mistrust and\nenmity on both sides.\nThere is no alternative for the peoples in the region\nother than a peace based on the principle of land for\npeace. There is no alternative to the peace process. If this\nprocess stagnates, there is a danger that it will unravel.\nThere is an urgency for both parties to resume efforts to\nfulfil earnestly their agreed obligations. Greece calls on\nthe parties to resume negotiations immediately on the\nbasis of the principles already accepted by them in the\nMadrid and Oslo agreements. We consider it of the\nutmost importance that the Israeli-Palestinian Interim\nAgreement be fully implemented, and that the talks on the\nfinal status of the Palestinian territories \u2014 including\nJerusalem \u2014 are speedily concluded together with the\nsolution of the two outstanding problems, namely,\nsecurity for all and social and economic development.\nFailure to proceed could lead to grave consequences\nas far as peace and stability in the whole region are\nconcerned. Peoples of the region should be guaranteed a\nsecure life within internationally recognized and safe\nboundaries. In this context, Greece believes that the\ninternational community must spare no effort to create a\nsolid basis for the political and economic survival of the\nPalestinian National Authority, thereby providing a source\nof hope for the Palestinian people. Greece will continue\nto support this effort actively. We are of the view that the\npeace process could be substantially promoted if those\nStates of the region which are directly concerned would\njoin forces with those actively participating in it. We urge\nthe implementation of Security Council resolution 425\n(1978) on Lebanon. Greece, who has actively participated\nin the Middle East peace process since its beginnings in\nMadrid, will continue to offer every possible support and\nassistance to the bilateral and multilateral negotiations\ntowards a comprehensive, final and just peace.\nThe expansion and improvement of the\nrepresentative character of the Security Council\nconstitutes one of the most urgent needs for reform in the\nUnited Nations system. While ongoing discussions have\nbeen focusing on adding to the permanent membership in\n8\n\n\norder to reflect changes in the global balance since 1945, as\nwell as on the right of veto and its use, we should not\ndisregard the long-term beneficial effects of allowing more\nnations to participate in the decision-making process of this\ncritically important body.\nIn this context, the Greek Government has decided to\npresent its candidature for one of the two non-permanent\nseats allocated to the Group of Western European and other\nStates in the Security Council for the period 1999-2000. It\nshould be noted that Greece, a founding member of the\nUnited Nations, is one of the very few Western countries\nthat have served only once as a non-permanent member of\nthe Council, and that was more than 40 years ago. Greece\nis located at a crossroads in the Balkans and southeastern\nEurope, a region that should be given the opportunity to be\nrepresented on and to participate actively in the Council.\nMy country\u2019s firm and unconditional commitment to the\npeaceful settlement of disputes, in accordance with the\nfundamental principles of international law and the Charter\nof the United Nations, offers all the necessary guarantees\nthat its election will indeed serve the cause of international\npeace and security.\nOn the eve of the third millennium, an affirmation of\npeace and cohesion among peoples must, more than ever\nbefore, constitute the primary legacy to bequeath to future\ngenerations. It befits the United Nations to be the\ndepository and guarantor of this legacy. It rests with\nMember States to make solidarity, security and\ndevelopment their watchwords for concrete action and their\nbattle cry in the fight against discord and injustice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It is a major contribution to the non-\nproliferation of nuclear weapons, in particular, and\ndisarmament in general.\n10\n\n\nTaking into account the historical experience of the\nworld community and striving to attain the highest human\nvalues, the Government of Azerbaijan, in the person of\nPresident Heydar Aliyev, having unified the nation, is\nheading with determination along the path of democratic\nreform, since only a climate of peace and national accord\nbased on respect for civic rights and human liberties can\nensure the overall development of the individual and society\nand create conditions conducive to normal interaction with\nthe world at large and the country\u2019s achievement of\ndemocratic political, economic and humanitarian standards.\nHowever, every aspect of life in my country has been\nseriously affected by the aggression of the Republic of\nArmenia. The occupation of about 20 per cent of the\nterritory of Azerbaijan and the seizure and plunder of towns\nand villages, including tens of thousands of objects taken\nfrom households, industry, agriculture, the infrastructure\nand the social sector, continue to inflict enormous damage\non the Azerbaijani State. \u201cEthnic cleansing\u201d has been\ncarried out in the occupied territories. The country faces an\nextremely serious humanitarian situation. The number of\nrefugees and displaced persons has passed the one million\nmark, a figure that is catastrophic for a country with a total\npopulation of 7.5 million.\nStill, we continue to consider peaceful negotiations\nwithin the framework of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk process to be the\nonly way to settle the conflict. It was for that reason that\nAzerbaijan, despite the continuing occupation of its lands\nand the presence of enormous numbers of refugees and\ndisplaced persons, consented to the ceasefire which has\nlasted for more than two years.\nThe Republic of Armenia, endeavouring to consolidate\nthe gains from its past aggression, refuses to recognize\nAzerbaijan\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity and thereby\nentirely discredits one of the fundamental principles of\ninternational law as a basis for settlement. That refusal has\nbecome a major obstacle to the achievement of peace.\nI would like to reconfirm our clear compromise\nposition on the settlement, which envisages the assurance\nof unconditional and immediate implementation of the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions and OSCE decisions\nregarding the conflict. The package of our proposals to\nspeed up progress in the Minsk process towards the\nachievement of a comprehensive settlement consists of\nthese elements: the withdrawal of Armenian forces from all\noccupied territories of Azerbaijan, including the Shusha and\nLachin districts; the return of the Azerbaijani population to\ntheir previous places of residence, including the Nagorny-\nKarabakh region of Azerbaijan; ensuring equal security,\nmonitored by the OSCE forces, for the Armenian and\nAzerbaijani populations who have suffered as a result of\nthe armed conflict; and guarantees that autonomy will be\ngranted to the entire population of the region constituting\nAzerbaijan.\nAt their meeting on 22 April 1996 in Luxembourg,\nheld within the framework of the conclusion of bilateral\nagreements on partnership and cooperation between\nAzerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia and the European\nUnion, the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia adopted\na joint communiqu\u00e9 expressing their agreement that the\nresolution of the conflict will make a substantial\ncontribution to regional stability and security as well as to\nthe socio-economic development of the peoples of the\nregion.\nIn reflecting on the establishment of a security\nsystem at the regional and pan-European levels, we would\nlike to emphasize that in our view the forthcoming OSCE\nSummit in Lisbon constitutes a real opportunity for the\nelaboration of basic principles for the settlement, not only\nfor the settlement, not only of the Armenian-Azerbaijani\nconflict, but possibly also other conflicts in the OSCE\narea. The relevant provisions of the Summit\u2019s final\ndocument, agreed at the highest level, could play a most\nimportant role in the positive development of negotiations\nboth within the OSCE Minsk process and in all other\ncurrent mediatory efforts of the OSCE.\nFor several years since the end of the cold war\nactive discussions have been taking place in the world on\nthe transformation of international relations. These\ndiscussions are held at different levels and touch upon\nalmost all aspects of life of the world community. The\nUnited Nations, as the leading international organization,\nis the main forum for gathering and testing a majority of\nideas related to a vision and understanding of processes\ntaking place in the world in recent years, and the\npossibilities for their implementation in the name of\nhuman progress.\nIn recent years these have been wide discussions on\nan increase in the membership of the Security Council or,\nin a broader context, on its reform in the light of the\nsubstantial increase in the membership of the United\nNations and the major changes in international relations.\nIn this regard, it is important to take into account the\nneed to maintain and even strengthen the ability of the\n11\n\n\nSecurity Council to respond adequately to threats of\ninternational peace and security.\nAzerbaijan supports the candidatures of Germany and\nJapan as potential permanent members of the Security\nCouncil. At the same time, the question of equitable\nrepresentation of all regions among the permanent members\nshould not disappear from the agenda. In this context, it\nshould be noted that many other ideas and proposals have\nbeen put forward, in particular by Italy and a number of\nother States, which must be thoroughly studies.\nAzerbaijan fully supports the efforts undertaken by the\ninternational community in response to the alarming\nincrease in terrorist acts in recent years. We unequivocally\ncondemn, as criminal and unjustifiable, all acts, methods\nand practices of terrorism, wherever and by whomever they\nare committed, including those that jeopardize friendly\nrelations among States and peoples and threaten the\nterritorial integrity and security of States. Azerbaijan\nsupports the establishment of a specialized international\norganization to combat terrorism.\nAzerbaijan attaches crucial importance to the process\nof integration into the global economic system, and\nconsiders it one of the main requisites for the formation of\na multidimensional, dynamic market economy and an open\ndemocratic society. For this purpose legislation has been\nadopted to strengthen market economy principles, notably\nthrough laws on private property, free enterprise, banking\nactivities, foreign investment protection, and so on.\nEconomic reform in Azerbaijan and the implementation of\neconomic projects are being carried out in active\ncollaboration with the Bretton Woods institutions. Concrete\nmeasures have been worked out and are being implemented\nto shape State economic policy for the transitional period.\nThey include the reform of the monetary and credit system\nand the development of pricing and tax policies. A three-\nyear programme to privatize State enterprises has been\nlaunched. To achieve this goal Azerbaijan actively\nencourages foreign investment, and has embarked on a\nconsistent course of liberalization of foreign economic\nactivity, the gradual elimination of non-tariff restrictions,\nand encouragement of national exports.\nThe Azerbaijan Republic agrees on the need for the\nstructural reform and financial normalization of the United\nNations. In this regard, I would like once again to draw the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s attention to the problem of the\nassessment of fair contributions to the United Nations\nbudget that will reflect the real capacity of States to pay.\nWhile we welcome the decision of principle to abolish the\nsystem of limits, we nevertheless consider that the long-\nwindedness of this process is resulting in the deterioration\nof the financial situation of the newly independent States,\nincluding Azerbaijan, which is obliged, in order to clear\nits debts to the United Nations budget, to cut down on the\nalready very meagre programmes of social support for the\npopulation, particularly refugees and displaced persons.\nThe Government of Azerbaijan would also like to\ndraw particular attention to the need for fair\nrepresentation of the new independent States within the\nstaff of the United Nations. While we are aware of the\ndifficulties the Organization is now experiencing, we\ncannot accept a situation in which Azerbaijan is still not\nrepresented in the secretariats of the United Nations and\nits specialized agencies.\nThe economic reforms carried out in Azerbaijan are\naimed largely at improving the social situation of the\npopulation. However, the monthly income of a\nconsiderable portion of the population is below the\nsubsistence level, given the persisting economic\ndifficulties in a country with an economy in transition,\nwhich have been aggravated by the burden of providing\nthe necessary assistance to the refugees and displaced\npersons.\nIn such a situation, great importance attaches to\nspecial humanitarian and other forms of assistance from\nthe United Nations, its specialized agencies and donor\ncountries, including assistance for the rehabilitation and\nreconstruction of a number of regions of Azerbaijan that\nhave suffered as a result of military action. While\nexpressing the deep gratitude of the people of Azerbaijan\nfor the assistance provided, we appeal to donor countries\nnot to reduce its scale.\nI am confident that the United Nations will continue\nto do its best to act as a catalyst in the achievement of\npeaceful coexistence among States, and to reinforce the\nnotion of the interdependence of national aspirations and\nthe common welfare of humanity, thus creating conditions\nconducive to the political stability and sustainable\neconomic development of States.\nThe potential exists to reinforce and strengthen the\nwork of the United Nations. We are increasingly\nwitnessing the expansion of the Organization\u2019s sphere of\nactivity, when it goes beyond the bounds of the traditional\nconcept of maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity and tackles more diversified tasks. Activities such\nas electoral assistance, the provision of special\n1\n\n\nhumanitarian assistance, human rights monitoring,\nassistance in nation-building and the creation of conditions\nfor the sustainable development of States have begun to be\nassociated around the world with the United Nations today.\nIn concluding, I should like to recall the well-known\nmaxim: \u201cThe best world is a world that belongs to all, and\nit becomes possible only through the efforts of all.\u201d So let\nus unite our efforts for the sake of building such a world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me express my appreciation for the honour\nof addressing the Assembly. On behalf of the Government\nand people of the Republic of Uzbekistan, I offer my\nsincerest congratulations to Ambassador Razali Ismail of\nMalaysia on his election as President of the fifty-first\nsession of the General Assembly. I am sure that his\npresidency will enable us successfully to solve many of\nthe urgent issues on the international agenda. I also take\n16\n\n\nthis opportunity to extend our appreciation and gratitude to\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, President of the historic\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly, for his valuable\nguidance and personal involvement in the resolution of\nissues the world was facing during that period.\nWe consider the safeguarding of peace and stability in\nCentral Asia and the sustainable development of the region\nas the most important goal of our cooperation with the\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies. In this context,\nI would like to outline a number of problems and to make\nseveral proposals.\nFirst, regarding regional security, we are of the view\nthat we need to move through regionalism towards the\nglobal: global peace can be achieved through stability in the\nvarious regions of the world. Regional conflicts are\nincreasingly the direct source of such dangerous challenges\nand threats as terrorism and violence, the illicit arms trade\nand drugs trafficking. That is why the main focus of\nUzbekistan\u2019s initiatives aimed at ensuring security in the\nCentral Asian region is finding ways to settle the conflict\nin Afghanistan and to stabilize the situation in Tajikistan.\nOne of the most important elements of these initiatives\nis an embargo on arms deliveries to Afghanistan. We\nwelcome the start of a discussion of this problem in the\nSecurity Council and support proposals for a comprehensive\napproach and for the convening of an international\nconference \u2014 where, in our view, the main role should be\nplayed by the United Nations. Halting arms deliveries to\nAfghanistan is an indispensable condition for any peace\nprocess. An embargo does not mean just any sanctions\nagainst Afghanistan; it has to be directed towards those who\ncontinue to supply weapons to the area of conflict. The\ninability of Afghanistan\u2019s forces to control its borders\nrequires efforts on the part of the international community\nto ensure that arms deliveries are ended.\nI would like to underline particularly that the Republic\nof Uzbekistan, more than any other nation in the world,\nseeks to return to age-old traditional relations of friendship,\ncooperation and mutual trust with neighbouring\nAfghanistan. This is the only aim guiding us in our\ninitiatives to promote peace in the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan. We want Afghanistan to be a stable,\nindivisible State, open to the outside world for the sake of\nprogress and prosperity. I take this opportunity to appeal\nonce again to the Secretary-General, and to the Presidents\nof the Security Council and the General Assembly to do\ntheir utmost to resolve the Afghan conflict, which poses a\nserious threat not only to regional security but also to for\nglobal security.\nWe continue to believe that Central Asia has its own\ncharacteristics; the positive or negative development of\nevents there can be a catalyst for positive changes or a\ndestructive factor affecting the situation far beyond the\nregion.\nSecondly, we must enter the twenty-first century\nwith a new vision of questions of peace and security in a\nrapidly changing world. The promotion of world peace is\naccompanied today by intensive debates and disputes on\nthe expansion of the membership of various international\nbodies and on models for comprehensive world security\nin the twenty-first century.\nWhile welcoming these aspirations, we must note\nthat each sovereign country in this multi-polar world has\nthe right to decide for itself, in accordance with its\nnational interests, and with its regional identity taken into\nconsideration, whether or not to enter a given union,\nirrespective of the position of more powerful countries.\nThere is no place for domination or monopoly on the part\nof other, more powerful, countries in resolving this\nproblem.\nThirdly, as regards our position in relation to the\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS), we consider\nthat the CIS countries can successfully cooperate within\nthe framework of the Commonwealth on a multilateral\nand bilateral basis. At the same time, we believe that the\nCIS cannot be treated as a unit under international law. It\nis unacceptable to let the CIS be transformed into a\npolitical or indeed a military-political bloc. Otherwise, the\nworld community will inevitably slide back down into\nglobal antagonisms and confrontation. For Uzbekistan,\nthis is fundamentally unacceptable.\nFourthly, Uzbekistan continues to support the\ncomplete elimination of nuclear weapons and views as\nhistoric the decision to conclude the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted under the auspices of\nthe United Nations, and the beginning of the signature\nprocess of the Treaty. We consider this event to be a\nmost important stage in liberating humanity from the\nthreat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nFor our part, the relevant work is being carried out\nto establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Asia within the\ninternational non-proliferation system. We believe that the\n17\n\n\ninitiative of the President of Uzbekistan will soon find more\ndetailed interest in the Security Council.\nFifthly, I would like once again to draw the attention\nof Member States to ecological problems, whose\ndimensions go beyond State borders. I would especially like\nto say a word about the problem of the Aral Sea. There\nhave already been a great number of scientific studies and\ninternational conferences, including several on the\nsustainable development of the Aral Sea countries.\nHowever, to our great disappointment, we do not see any\nmovement from statements to practical deeds. I would like\nto note that Uzbekistan supports and considers as timely\nGreat Britain\u2019s proposal on the adoption of a special\ndeclaration condemning terrorism in all its forms.\nFor a more effective functioning of United Nations\nmachinery in all areas of activity, we consider it necessary\nto reform a number of United Nations organs, including the\nSecurity Council. This is in line with today\u2019s realities. The\ngeo-strategic balance of power raises the question of the\nexpansion of the number of permanent members of the\nSecurity Council. We are convinced that such States as\nGermany and Japan today are fully equipped to be\npermanent members of the Security Council.\nUzbekistan stands for the constructive reform of the\nUnited Nations. In this context, together with other States,\nincluding Italy, whose proposals deserve serious attention,\nwe express our sincere desire to ensure that the United\nNations is a reliable instrument for maintaining universal\npeace and stability.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset I should like\nto congratulate Ambassador Razali Ismail on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session.\nThe Liechtenstein delegation is confident that his leadership\nwill strengthen the United Nations ability to pursue the\npurposes and principles of the Charter.\nOne year after the celebration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, it is appropriate to take\nstock once again of the achievements and shortcomings of\nour Organization and, first and foremost, to define the\nmeasures we have to take in order to face the challenges\nthat lie ahead of us. One of the recurrent topics at the\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly was the call for a\ncomprehensive and effective reform with a view both to\nenhancing the efficiency of the United Nations and to\nreducing the costs of its work.\nI wish to express my appreciation for all the efforts\nthat have been made by the Secretariat to meet this need,\nparticularly to the Department of Administration and\nManagement and to the Office of Internal Oversight\nServices, which have made an important contribution in this\nregard. However, it remains a fact that more needs to be\ndone in order to cope with the financial crisis the\nOrganization continues to struggle with. Even though there\nseems to be a consensus concerning the need for further\nsuch action, we were not able, during the fiftieth session of\nthe General Assembly, to reach agreement on the measures\nthat are so urgently needed. In our view, it is of the utmost\nimportance that the high-level working group on the\nfinancial situation established by the General Assembly\nshould adopt, during the fifty-first session, proposals for a\nsolution of the financial crisis, including the payment of\narrears. I should like to take this opportunity to express the\nsupport of the Government of Liechtenstein for the\nproposals that have been put forward by the European\nUnion in this respect.\nWe support ongoing efforts with a view to a reform\nand enlargement of the Security Council. We are of the\nview that the reform of the Security Council should be\nconsistent with the principle of the sovereign equality of\nall States, as enshrined in the Charter. Liechtenstein\nagrees with those Member countries that have said that\nwith regard to the distribution of new permanent seats,\nthe financial and other contributions to achieving the\npurposes of the Organization as well as a balanced\ngeographic distribution should be adequately taken into\naccount.\nAnother area of crucial importance for the future\nwork and credibility of our Organization is peacekeeping\nactivities, which attract the particular interest and concern\nof the world community. The experience of the recent\npast has made it very clear that the United Nations needs\nto be better equipped in order to respond effectively and\nquickly to prevent situations that threaten international\npeace and security. If we are to enhance the credibility of\nthe United Nations as a whole and the effectiveness of\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations, we have to\nensure that every such mission is given a clear mandate\nand vested with the funds necessary for its full\nimplementation. Very useful proposals to that end have\nbeen made by the Secretary-General in his report entitled\n\u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d. We have noted with satisfaction\nthe progress made by the Working Group established by\nthe General Assembly to discuss the Agenda for Peace,\nand the provisional agreements reached by two of the four\nsubgroups dealing with specific aspects of the Agenda for\nPeace. I wish to express my hope that the two other\nsubgroups, which have to discuss the very important\nquestions of preventive diplomacy and peacemaking, and\npost-conflict peace-building, respectively, will also be\nable to conclude their work soon, so a comprehensive\nagreement on the Agenda for Peace can be adopted.\nSome of the events that have taken place over the\npast few years have made it very clear that more attention\nshould be given to preventive diplomacy, which can avert\nhuman suffering and reduce costs considerably. One of\nthe situations where determined preventive action is\nurgently needed is the one that has arisen in Burundi,\nwhere patterns of large-scale violations of human rights\nand the risk of a further worsening of the situation\n10\n\n\ncontinue to exist. It is indeed disturbing to note that the\ninternational community has not been able to take all\npossible measures to prevent a further deterioration of this\nsituation.\nLiechtenstein made its own contribution to the\nfurthering of conflict prevention by introducing an initiative\non the right of self-determination before the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. It has been stated\nmany times that the vast majority of armed or other violent\nconflicts today are no longer conflicts between but within\nStates. Such conflicts often have their roots in tensions\nbetween communities living within States, and the thrust of\nthe initiative of Liechtenstein is aimed at finding peaceful\nsolutions to such situations before one of the parties\ninvolved resorts to violence. It seems to us that the right of\nself-determination, the exercise of which has played a\ncrucial role in the history of the United Nations,\nprogressively needs to be seen outside its traditional context\nand should be further developed and adapted to the\nconditions that prevail in today\u2019s world.\nMany cases of intra-State conflicts have made clear\nthat it is timely and necessary for the international\ncommunity to develop mechanisms that will enable\ncommunities living within States to exercise the right of\nself-determination in flexible ways and in accordance with\nexisting international law. The Liechtenstein research\nprogramme that was established at Princeton University as\npart of the contribution of Liechtenstein to the celebration\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is intended\nto provide further know-how for, and assistance in,\ndeveloping such mechanisms, and I should like to take this\nopportunity to thank all those countries that continue to\nsupport us in this endeavour.\nAs a small State, Liechtenstein attaches the utmost\nimportance to strengthening international law and to\neffective disarmament. We therefore actively supported the\ndraft resolution, submitted by Australia on behalf of a large\nnumber of countries, that enabled us to adopt the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) after\nlengthy and very difficult negotiations in the Conference on\nDisarmament. The CTBT will take us one step further\ntowards achieving our goal of a world free of nuclear\nweapons. The Government of Liechtenstein is of the view\nthat it is a crucial step. Tomorrow, therefore, I will sign the\nCTBT on behalf of Liechtenstein, and I would like to\nexpress our hope that as many countries as possible will do\nthe same.\nOne year ago we met in Beijing and unanimously\nadopted a Declaration and a Platform for Action that\nrepresent a new international commitment to the goals of\nequality, development and peace for all women in the\nworld. In Liechtenstein we are in the process of preparing\nthe implementation of the Platform for Action, which\nincludes, inter alia: motivation for women to enter\npolitics and to present their candidatures; specific\nacademic and vocational guidance for girls; measures to\nfacilitate the compatibility of professional and family life;\nand sensitization towards the problem of violence against\nwomen and children.\nPeace is a prerequisite for the attainment of equality\nbetween women and men. Unfortunately, aggression and\narmed and other types of conflict persist in many parts of\nthe world. Women rarely have any role in the decisions\nleading to armed conflicts, but they contribute to a large\nextent to preserving social order in times of war and\narmed conflicts. We believe that women could and should\nplay an increased role in conflict resolution, and we\nwould particularly welcome more women being appointed\nas Special Representatives of the Secretary-General.\nThere has been a dramatic growth in the need for\nhumanitarian assistance in recent years. The United\nNations system, playing a major role in the field of\nhumanitarian relief, has been tested almost to breaking\npoint by recent crises. Complex emergency situations\nhave resulted in increased demands on scarce resources.\nThere has been criticism that as a result of concentration\non emergency relief, little effort was made to devise\nrecovery programmes. The humanitarian community will\nhave to play an important role in ensuring the transition\nfrom relief to rehabilitation. We should not forget,\nhowever, that it has been only four years since\nhumanitarian action provided by the United Nations\nsystem was given structure and coherence.\nAnti-personnel land-mines, with their immensely\ndestructive effects on individuals and communities around\nthe world, are a humanitarian tragedy. Innocent civilians,\nin particular women, children, refugees and displaced\npersons, are at greatest risk. Furthermore, mines impede\nthe rehabilitation and reconstruction of societies torn by\nwar. In keeping with its mandate to develop and promote\ninternational humanitarian law, the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has continuously\ncalled attention to weapons whose effects threaten to\nundermine that law, and we commend the ICRC for its\nefforts in that respect. I wish to reiterate our call for a\ntotal ban on these deadly weapons.\n\n\n\nWe hope that, during this fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly, we will be able to strengthen the United\nNations, which has been indispensable to the international\ncommunity for more than 50 years, and to enhance its\ncredibility in the eyes of the peoples whom our\nOrganization represents.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like first of all to congratulate\nAmbassador Razali on his election to the presidency of\nthe Assembly and to wish him every success in his work.\nIt would seem that after half a century, the debate on\nthe meaning, importance, role and timeliness of this\nOrganization has become increasingly impassioned. It\ncould be said that the United Nations is on trial.\nIt may be that some of the criticism is justified. It is\naccused, for instance, of having a large bureaucracy, and\nit is said that there is a proliferation of situations\nrequiring the deployment of military forces to pave the\npath for peace, which is also a path riddled with war.\nThese situations came about without the consent of the\nMember States, who must all bear their share of the costs.\nThis enlarged bureaucracy, added to the expenses of\nmilitary peacekeeping, increases the financial burden of\nthe weaker countries. Yet, it seems to be the strong\ncountries that most resent and denounce this burden.\nNevertheless, to thoroughly assess and evaluate what\nthe United Nations is and what it represents, we would\nhave to compare it to another such organization of its\nkind, one that had brought together nearly 200 sovereign\nStates, led them by the hand through 50 of the most\nenigmatic and dangerous years of history and remained a\npoint of reference when all the ideological references had\ncollapsed. And that other organization has never existed.\nAs far as we know, humanity has never lived\nthrough 50 continuous years of peace, yet 51 years have\npassed without a tremor of generalized conflict like the\nones that once seemed to be cyclical. Even though\nmisunderstandings and aggressions appear on one\ncontinent or another, based on deep-seated racial,\nreligious or political hatred, and leading to genocide or\nlocal wars, we cannot speak of a conflagration, especially\nwhen the will of the people of all regions rises above\nthese wars, committed to the restoration of peace.\nThe international community, in varying degrees, has\nstarted to review its greatest Organization, and it has\nfocused its attention first on the Security Council.\nFortunately, the creative imagination of States has\nsuggested various ways to change it in order to make it\nmore representative of the new world realities and, of\n13\n\n\ncourse, to make it more efficient. My country follows this\nprocess with enormous interest, aware that the Security\nCouncil will be the centre of balance of the world system.\nIn the meantime, this long period of relative peace has\nallowed for the rise of European integration, which is\nperhaps the greatest political achievement of our century. It\nhas made possible the growth of daring and vigorous\ntechnological civilizations in Asian countries as well as\nunderstanding and growth in the Latin American region,\nwhich today has become, thanks to this understanding,\nhumankind\u2019s most promising abode. In this framework,\nVenezuela has broadened its ties with and deepened its\ncommitments to the great causes of our time, such as the\nenforcement of human rights, truly representative\ndemocracy, integration as an economic and political culture\nof our modern era and disarmament as a guarantee of world\nsecurity. Tomorrow, on behalf of my country I shall\nproudly sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nMy country hopes that the criticism levelled at the\nOrganization will justify itself by leading to logical plans to\nreform and revitalize it. Its success must be definitively\nestablished in the implementation of human rights, in the\nfight against terrorism and in the alliance to exterminate\ndrug trafficking and connected activities. A special session\nof the General Assembly has been called on this latter topic\nat Mexico\u2019s urging.\nIn his current report on the work of the Organization,\nthe Secretary-General refers to the territorial controversy\nbetween Venezuela and Guyana. I must note that this\ncontroversy lies within the framework of the 1966 Geneva\nagreement signed by both countries in order to reach a\npractical and lasting solution to this dispute. In a spirit of\ndialogue and cooperation between the two parties, we\nappealed to the Secretary-General\u2019s good offices and are\nnow applying one of the mechanisms for the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes provided for in the United Nations\nCharter. We are therefore surprised that this case is\nexpressly mentioned in the chapter on conflict situations.\nAs a Latin American, I must recognize that, thanks to\nthis lasting peace, my region, a scion of Europe, and its\ncreature in many respects, has resumed friendly relations\nwith its natural metropolis after 80 years of world wars that\nhad separated us and created a rift in the cultural patterns\nthat had governed us for centuries.\nOf course, numerous threats linger on. The so-called\nweapon-States that have the financial resources to spark a\nregional conflict that can multiply and spread are still there,\nuntouched by democratic norms and mostly driven by\nfanaticism. In countries where no one would have\nimagined it, the danger of racial discrimination returns\nlike a nightmare. At the very centre of the most cultured\ncontinent, we have witnessed a war and a genocide that\nwe would angrily condemn in Cambodia or in Rwanda,\nand among countries that have been an world example of\ntolerance and coexistence for centuries. The followers of\ntwo religions that are virtually the same confront and\nexterminate one another almost daily.\nAt the same time, the conditions of exchanges, the\ngoals of good policies and the miracle of modern\ncommunications lead to a free flow of trade, technology,\nscientific models and human movement, both through\ntourism and through commercial interests. All this is\nbringing humanity together as a whole, using information\nto express an impassioned interest that is beginning to be\nwidely known as globalization.\nThe Organization still has to overcome the\nprophecies and schemes of pessimistic traditions,\naccording to which natural law dictates the existence of\nwars, diseases and other disasters as a fateful necessity to\nregulate population growth and as an incentive to devise\ntechnologies and scientific developments in the escalation\nthat Malthusians see in their observation of nature.\nPeace is the primary purpose of the United Nations;\nwar is the recourse most commonly used by humanity to\ntry to solve imbalances and resentments. And we have\npeace, ceaselessly troubled but always re-established as\nfar as and wherever possible. But we must remember that\nwar is the most chronic of recidivists, since greed and\nambition feed on it.\nWe might say that what this Organization needs to\nsolve universal strife, poverty and untrammelled\npopulation growth is a human resource development and\nsystematic education project to do away with the fragile\nethics of our time and to teach all nations the art of\nliving \u2014 and living together. Fears, suspicions and\nanimosities are engendered by ignorance among people\nand nations.\nI speak on behalf of a country whose most important\nnatural resource has endowed it with power and economic\neuphoria on the one hand, and plunged it into acute\npsychological depression on the other. That resource is\noil, of which we hold the largest and most secure reserves\nin the Western world. Since oil legally belongs to the\nState, as do all underground resources, the State finds it,\n14\n\n\nprocesses it, sells it and distributes its revenues as services.\nLittle by little, the old agricultural country became used to\nstretching out a hand to receive from the State gifts of\nprotectionism, subsidies, scholarships, credits and even\nundue largesse, all of which used to come from the land as\na reward for labour.\nFor more than two generations Venezuelans relied\nexclusively on oil, disregarding personal effort. At times,\nthe State demagogically encouraged this dependency and\npromoted idleness, thus leading to ethical complications\nborn of collusion between politics and the economy. This\nis the deep-seated reason for the so-called Venezuelan\ncrisis. It is different from others because it is not economic\nbut moral, and can only be solved by a return to honest\nbehaviour and personal endeavour, which requires a great\ndeal of time and effort.\nThis is what the Administration of President Rafael\nCaldera is striving for. After trying to reverse the enormous\nevils he inherited, using measures that were not too harmful\neconomically for the weakest sector, on 15 April, he\ndecided to open up the economy and incorporate prevailing\nmarket economy values through the Venezuelan Agenda.\nHe was careful, however, to establish a programme to\nabsorb the enormous shock this opening causes\ntransitionally on the majorities accustomed to the old State\npaternalism. After a brief period, we are emerging from this\nunique crisis, which cannot be and could not have been\nresolved by a simple decree, as other crises, since it\nrequired and still requires a change in habits in order for\npeople to learn to be self-sufficient. The case of Venezuela\ncould recur in other countries characterized by State\npaternalism.\nIf we look closely at the so-called social crisis that all\nLatin American countries suffer, we can see it is due to a\nlack of training. We used to say that education was the\nuniversal solution to all problems, and it is. But at a time\nwhen Latin American society has become unhinged because\nof peasant migrations undoing the social and moral order,\nwith the ensuing marginalization brought about by a change\nin customs leading to the degradation of the family, both\neducation and training are absolute necessities.\nThe breakdown of the traditional home deprives\npeople of the essential ethical values that used to be learned\nfrom the mother. Nowadays, the State must replace the\nhome and the mother, in preparing the inner self of its\ncitizens. It is evident, therefore, that training and education\nare of primary importance since the human being\u2019s inner\nself must be strengthened in order to rebuild the family\nunit, which gives coherence, pride and courage to a\nsociety. Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the Liberator of America, grasped\nthe whole problem when he said, \u201cMorality and\nenlightenment are our first necessities\u201d. Perhaps the whole\nworld today suffers the same evil and has the same needs.\nThe United Nations, through its specialized agencies,\nis carrying out innumerable programmes, studies, trials\nand experiments to solve the daily tragedy of our human\nspecies. This is becoming more and more complex since\nthe efforts are aimed at an already deformed being,\nincapable, therefore, of living in harmony with others.\nIf we were to agree that the chain connecting home,\nprimary school, secondary school, university, and life\nbroke down some time ago, and that it is missing its first\nlink, without which all else is pointless and without\nfoundation, we would invest at the very roots of human\nlife the economic and scientific resources needed to form\nhuman beings from the start, enabling them to grow,\nendowed with the values that would make them citizens.\nLatin America, born unaware of racial hatred,\nreligious conflicts and territorial greed, with an indivisible\nspirit made up of a combination of influences that move\nin the same direction on the freest and broadest of stages,\nis hurt by the fact that its real problems today are social\nones, brought on by the error of political regimes that\nignored the discipline of education or doubted its\nundeniable primacy.\nDemocracy has taken root in Latin America as in no\nother part of the universe as a consequence of political\ndesire. Nevertheless, we are not satisfied, because\ndemocracy must mean the eradication of age-old ills and\nconstitute, more than merely a system to elect\ngovernments, a cogent civilization.\nWe aspire to a democracy transparent in its conduct\nand effective in its achievements to continue offering it as\nan alternative to the ancient dictatorships. This explains\nmy country\u2019s perseverance in attaining an honest and\nclean democracy. In this regard, we have proposed a\nconvention against corruption, which has been approved\nat the hemispheric level. Strangely enough, it would be\nthe first of its kind in the world, which goes to show how\nstrongly entrenched this vice is: it has gone unpunished\nby dictatorships and democracies alike throughout time\nand around the world.\nThe day is not distant when this instrument, limited\nnow to our hemisphere, will encompass our whole\n15\n\n\nOrganization, since the crime it prosecutes is not\nexclusively American but takes root in many countries on\nall continents. During the last substantive session of the\nEconomic and Social Council, Venezuela, together with\nArgentina, the United States and other countries, sponsored\na United Nations declaration on corruption and bribery in\ntransnational commercial activities, which is clear proof that\nthe fight against unpunished corruption prospers in the\nworld.\nIf the United Nations, aware that the key to universal\nchange lies in training and education, were to inspire and\nlead an in-depth study of what makes a human being, of the\nway societies that break into conflict or serve as models for\nothers are defined by the sum of their members; if the\nUnited Nations were to use the United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to add a\nuniversal teaching component to all its cooperation\nprogrammes, then the true ethical and human redemption of\nsociety would begin.\nFree of prejudice and with sufficient resources, Latin\nAmerica, a melting pot of customs and races, could serve\nas a laboratory to show how the human species can\nstraighten its spine of ethics, which has been so twisted in\nso many places. Our America as a whole is a welcoming\nplace for peace, since there are no elements of unease or\ninsecurity other than social asymmetries \u2014 not the\nasymmetries of blood-lines, but those of dire poverty, born\nof the incapacity to transform and distribute our plentiful\nnatural resources.\nWe are living a unique moment in history. In a short\ntime, without violence, we have seen great empires come to\nan end, the elimination of the cruellest jails of human\nthought, the liberation of all wills and the opening of the\ngreatest opportunity peoples have ever had to reorganize\nthemselves in accordance with hopes and desires that were\nlong repressed or thwarted by violence of all sorts.\nAs Marguerite Yourcenar says in her biography of\nHadrian, referring to the religious perplexity of the great\nEmperor: in his lifetime the old gods no longer existed and\nChrist had not yet arrived. Humanity\u2019s present spirit seems\nto be similar: free, but still dazed and hesitant to adopt a\nnew order from a new mould; but, above all, free, although\nat this fateful moment great leaders might be lacking.\nThe United Nations holds and reflects this feeling \u2014\nhovering between jubilation and disbelief \u2014 like a prodigy\nstanding before the panorama of infinite possibilities of\nwhat we can create with the fertile dreams of our era.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt\nis a very special pleasure for Brunei Darussalam to greet\nyou, Mr. President, as a close friend and neighbour.\nPlease accept our warmest congratulations, both to you\n7\n\n\nand to all Malaysians, on your election. May I also express\nour appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Freitas do Amaral\nfor his leadership during our fiftieth session.\nOur fiftieth anniversary has come and gone. We still\nremember the many fine statements made last year. Now,\nhowever, we have to give them practical substance. In this\nregard, Mr. President, I was very interested in your recent\nstatements on the role of the General Assembly. I was\nparticularly pleased that you emphasized practical economic\nand social development.\nIt was also most encouraging to hear you say that you\nintend to do all you can for the cause of United Nations\nreform. Like you, I feel that the General Assembly must\nnot be paralysed by the analysis of reform. We need\nconcrete proposals from our working groups. Then we can\nspend our time on the hard work of building consensus.\nThe need is urgent. Tension and conflict within\nnations are growing. At the same time, the United Nations\nis increasingly being asked to solve problems in many new\nareas of international concern \u2014 social, economic and\nsometimes even criminal \u2014 that transcend national borders.\nIt is also expected to address the deep-seated causes of\nfuture instability, the widening gap between North and\nSouth and the allied problems of overpopulation and\nurbanization, which have been so sharply exposed by this\nOrganization at recent conferences. Above all, it has to face\nthe results of these problems in the form of mounting\nintolerance, violent aggression and, all too often, extremism\nand terrorism.\nIn trying to do all this, its resources are overstretched.\nFor this reason, I would like to thank the Secretary-General,\nhis representatives and all those who are serving this\nOrganization in the field, often in extremely difficult\nconditions. Their work represents a deep commitment to the\ncause of peace and stability in the world and I admire and\ngreatly appreciate it. However, I also tend to think that\nmaybe we are asking them to take on new tasks with old or\noutdated tools. If they are not provided with the means to\nmanage our affairs well, then we in the United Nations are\nat fault.\nIn this respect, the tragedy of Bosnia is a warning to\nus. Certainly, we in Brunei Darussalam welcome recent\ndevelopments and will continue to give our strong support\nto the new Government in Bosnia. At the same time, I feel\nthat all of us in this Assembly should recognize the extent\nto which the events of the last five years reveal our own\nshortcomings.\nWe hope that the Security Council will now begin to\ninsist that all agreements be resolutely kept. We would\nlike to see it acting firmly against political pressure from\nany quarter and ensuring that nothing is allowed to stand\nin the way of the peoples\u2019 recovery.\nI say this with particular concern as we are now\nfacing what could become another emblem of failure for\nus: the current situation in the Middle East. Until quite\nrecently, this was a problem which had defied solution\nsince the earliest days of this Organization. Then, at last,\na peace agreement was reached which gave us a realistic\nglimpse of hope. Even though we realized that it would\nbe a very difficult process, we felt optimistic. However,\na new Government in Israel now appears to be\nchallenging the very basis on which our own hopes for\npeace were founded. The solutions that appeared to be\nwithin the grasp of the parties directly concerned are\nunder threat. Rather than becoming more manageable, the\nscope of the so-called Middle East problem has now\nextended to include the people of Iraq.\nIt is consequently with great concern that Brunei\nDarussalam adds its voice to the many who wish to\nimpress on the leaders of Israel the need to continue the\npeace process, not just by making statements, but in the\nfull spirit of the agreements reached in Madrid and Oslo.\nWhat I have briefly described represents the sum of\neconomic, social and political problems, which in our\nview calls for a new approach on our part. This can only\nbe developed, we feel, when the United Nations is\nreformed. I say this because we are seeing the emergence\nof a new type of international community, far more\ndiverse than the one our founders knew. At the same\ntime, it is one which is being drawn even closer together\nthrough the advance of technology and\ncommunications \u2014 the \u201cglobal village\u201d of popular\ndescription.\nThere are many reasons to welcome this. It could\nmean that we all learn to acknowledge and appreciate our\ndiversity and to take on the best aspects of a real village.\nHowever, there is no guarantee. Villages are not always\npleasant places to live in. They have their darker side.\nModern technology may well encourage neighbourly\ncooperation, but it is just as capable of enhancing the\nhostile elements of primitive village life. It could set up\na permanent division between the developed and the\ndeveloping worlds.\n8\n\n\nThat is why I feel it is essential for us to find an\neffective new approach to the tremendous changes taking\nplace today. As members know, this is what we are trying\nto develop in South-East Asia. The way we have chosen\nhas enabled us to promote programmes aimed at preventive\ndiplomacy and economic cooperation in our region. It has\nalso meant that we have been able to offer some wider\nassistance to the cause of South-South cooperation.\nThese are specific measures with practical aims and\nthey are producing clear results, but they also have a\nbroader and deeper effect. They enable us not only to\nmanage the diversity of our region, but also, at a very\nhuman level, to learn to appreciate each others\u2019 differences\nand enjoy the challenge of working together.\nBy way of example, I would like to commend our\nfriends and colleagues in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar for\ntheir intention to join the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN). They are making a lasting contribution\nto peace and stability in our region. We are therefore\ndelighted to be on the verge of seeing the whole of South-\nEast Asia working together in cooperation.\nWhat this has led to in terms of strengthening\ninternational peace and security is illustrated by our very\nextensive dialogue process. One practical result of this in\nour region was the signing of the South-East Asia Nuclear-\nWeapon-Free Zone Treaty at the last ASEAN summit. This\nis a Treaty which we would like all nuclear-weapon States\nto join as a commitment to peace in our region. It was in\nthis spirit that we endorsed the resolution on the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, passed by this\nAssembly earlier this month, as a first step towards\nworldwide nuclear disarmament.\nWhat we are trying to stress is the need for inclusion,\ndrawing together all parties to a problem, working towards\nconsensus rather than demanding compromise and bringing\neveryone into the mainstream of decision-making. The kind\nof results we hope for were shown just this month in the\nachievements of the Government of the Philippines and the\nleaders of the Moro National Liberation Front through the\ngood offices of Indonesia. Their efforts brought to an end\nmore than 20 years of violence and hostility, and I would\nlike to congratulate all the parties involved.\nWe see this as reflecting the need that lies behind the\nstrong calls that many Member States have made for reform\nof this Organization. It acknowledges that aggression must\nbe dealt with firmly, but it also recognizes what has been\ntragically impressed upon us all over the past few years in\nEurope, Africa and Asia. It is what guides all our work in\nour region and, I suggest, must be the starting point for\nany new approach to the conduct of international affairs\ntoday. It is the knowledge that, if we do not accept and\nwillingly embrace diversity, there is a price to be paid\nand it is unacceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am happy to\nacknowledge a Malaysian as the President of the General\nAssembly, a first for Malaysia. We are thankful to all\nMember States for their support, especially the members of\nthe Asian Group, which endorsed Malaysia\u2019s candidature\nearly.\nI would like to think that the selection has to do\nwith Malaysia\u2019s efforts and involvement, with the United\nNations and globally. Within three years of Malaysia\u2019s\nindependence, we were involved in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations in the Congo. Today in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, Malaysia is perhaps the only developing\ncountry participating in the peacekeeping forces led by\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), paying\nin full the cost of our involvement. Malaysia will continue\nto participate in international activities, United Nations-\nsponsored or otherwise, combining altruism with\nenlightened self-interest.\nThis time last year, there was much celebration as\nthe United Nations attained its fiftieth year. Amid the\ncelebrations extolling the achievements of the United\nNations, there were serious concerns expressed about the\nrelevance and effectiveness of this Organization and the\nneed for democratic reforms so that the United Nations\ncould better fulfil the purposes and principles of the\nCharter. The fiftieth anniversary came and went and,\ndespite the extravaganza, very little has been achieved.\nThe Organization itself remains far removed from\nthe aspirations of the peoples of the United Nations,\nwhich it is supposed to promote and protect. Hopefully,\nthe tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina will, with\ninternational help, be on the mend, but Palestine\u2019s hopes\nand aspirations have been undermined by the new Israeli\nGovernment, which is backed, unfortunately, by some\nWestern Powers, and is backtracking on painfully\nnegotiated agreements. At this moment, a rash decision by\nIsrael not only imperils further the peace process, with\nlives being lost, but can inflame and outrage Muslim\nStates and Muslim society if the sanctity of the Al-Aqsa\nMosque is defiled. In Africa, Somalia, Rwanda and\nLiberia remain on the razor\u2019s edge of survival, and\nBurundi awaits United Nations and regional initiatives to\navoid a catastrophe. And there are countries such as\nAfghanistan, victims of the cold war, abandoned by the\nmajor Powers, needing help to reconstruct and overcome\nthe destruction wrought by war. And what will be the fate\nof tiny Chechnya and its valiant people, facing the full\nonslaught of mighty Russia?\nWhile some developing countries become\nfragmented and marginalized, the process of accruing\npower and benefits continues with the major countries,\naided by their control of the Security Council, their\nmonopoly on nuclear power and their economic high\nground. One sees various twists and turns, double\nstandards and selectivity, as the dictates of domestic\n6\n\n\npolitics overrule justice and humanitarianism in\ninternational affairs. Commitment to multilateralism is so\nqualified and investment in the United Nations so tentative\nthat common needs have often been sacrificed.\nNow, as the General Assembly begins its fifty-first\nsession, we urge again that the international community\nwork collectively for substantial change, reflecting a more\nequitable sharing of political and economic power. This call\nfor reform is made even more urgent when we consider that\nthe premises by which international relations are conducted\ntoday continue to perpetuate a grossly unjust system.\nThe systematic abuse of power by the major countries\nhas continued. They apply selective sanctions and double\nstandards on the developing world to promote their narrow\nnational interests. Clearly disregarding multilateralism, with\nits inherent qualities of mutual respect and shared interests,\nthe North continues its vice-like grip on all spheres of\ninternational activity, including politics, international trade,\ndevelopment, the environment and the media to name a\nfew.\nElitism exercised by the major countries is frequently\ncloaked in the guise of globalism or of serving the common\ninterests of nations. However even a cursory examination\nof this brand of globalism reveals it to be sanctimonious, if\nnot hypocritical. For example, under the pretext of\nsafeguarding international peace and security, the nuclear-\nweapon States maintain their right to destroy, or threaten to\ndestroy, all life on this planet. Yet these countries deny\nothers even the right to use conventional weapons for self-\ndefence.\nMalaysia deeply regrets the lack of a consensus on the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty but welcomes its\nsubsequent adoption at the fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly. We worry about nuclear aspirations in our\nregion and in Israel. To a large extent, the refusal of the\nnuclear-weapon States to adopt a timetable for nuclear\ndisarmament is responsible for this situation and seriously\nflaws the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nMalaysia is encouraged by the recent International Court of\nJustice Advisory Opinion on the legality of the threat or use\nof nuclear weapons. To render the Court\u2019s finding\nmeaningful, there should be serious efforts made towards\naccelerating the process of nuclear disarmament, including\nthe early convening of a special session of the General\nAssembly devoted to disarmament.\nWhile these major Powers advocate peace and\ncondemn arms races by others, their industries aggressively\ndevelop and promote the sales of defence technologies\nand weapons of death. Like a drug dealer supplying his\nhelplessly addicted victims, the northern-based arms\nindustries keep poor countries mired in a cycle of poverty\nand insecurity, laying waste vital human skills and\nresources.\nPerhaps such political elitism comes naturally to\nthese powerful countries, many of which were imperial\nPowers before. A clue as to their priorities for the global\nagenda is to be found in the recent communiqu\u00e9 of the\neconomic summit of the Group of Seven. Reform of the\nUnited Nations, in particular the Security Council, as an\nurgent issue, gave way to the pre-eminence of the\nglobalization of the world economy. And so, the Security\nCouncil remains a blunt instrument of the foreign policies\nof the permanent members.\nIn the context of a globalized world, much is made\nof the terms \u201cinterdependence\u201d and \u201cmutual interests\u201d.\nMultilateralism has been elbowed aside. Yet\nmultilateralism is the foundation of the international\nrelations and cooperation which the United Nations\nsymbolizes. From now on, globalization will take over\nand nations will lose their sovereignty.\nConsider the current financial crisis that faces this\nOrganization. The United Nations is on the verge of\nbankruptcy, being held to ransom by its major donor\ncountry, the wealthiest nation in the world. That country\nrefuses to meet its assessed and legally due contributions,\nyet insists on maintaining its hegemony on global\nmanagement.\nThe major Powers\u2019 solution to the United Nations\nstalemate is to speak of revitalizing the United Nations as\nif they were conducting a corporate downsizing exercise.\nWhile it is important to end bureaucratic inefficiencies\nand the wasteful use of resources, we should be mindful\nthat the United Nations is not a business.\nOverconcentration on internal-management issues can\ndeflect the attention of the United Nations from its major\nglobal responsibilities. While Malaysia is critical of the\nUnited Nations and its leadership, we cannot but regret\nthe tendency of major Powers to assign the United\nNations complex tasks, missions impossible, without clear\nmandates and authority or adequate resources. How does\nthe United Nations undertake peacekeeping operations\nwithout the authority or the means to keep the peace?\nWe find the inequities of power-sharing in the\nUnited Nations to be intolerable and view with alarm\n7\n\n\nprevailing trends towards weakening this Organization\nfurther. Already, the centre of gravity for all principal\neconomic decisions that affect developing countries lies in\nthe undemocratic Bretton Woods institutions, the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) and of course the self-appointed\nGroup of Seven.\nStrengthening multilateralism requires a reform of the\nBretton Woods institutions, which dominate the\ndevelopment scene. These institutions are operating against\ntheir general mandate. Decision-making is undemocratic\nand untransparent. Despite their specific mandates to\nfacilitate development and regulate the international\nmonetary system, these institutions are used to discipline\nthird-world countries and to act as debt collectors for the\nrich North. It is salutary to note that the World Bank\ncollected a net amount of $7.2 billion in 1995 in debt\nrepayment over and above what it disbursed in aid to the\npoor indebted countries and raked in a profit of almost $1.5\nbillion. The International Monetary Fund has now become\nan enforcer of the dictates of market lenders and is\nassuming the role of a global rating agency.\nThe majority of poor developing countries are saddled\nwith unsustainable levels of debt that preclude them from\na share of world prosperity and growth. Debt servicing on\ncurrent scales is untenable and debtor countries, as a\nconsequence, can do little to alleviate their poverty and\nmisery. The chilling numbers speak for themselves - more\nis spent on servicing debt than on financing basic\nprogrammes for health care, education and humanitarian\nrelief.\nThe reductions in the commitments for concessional\nassistance by almost all the industrial countries mark a\nturning point in international development cooperation.\nBluntly put, the rich have reneged on solemn commitments\nand pledges. The cut-backs in pledges for the replenishment\nof international development assistance and the\nunwillingness to clear earlier arrears, triggered by a\nunilateral decision of the major contributor to scale back its\ncontributions, have led other donors to scale back their\ncontributions as well.\nNow that the concept of globalism is so intimately\nlinked with international trade, it is important critically to\nexamine the realities of this so called \u201cfree trade\u201d. The\npainfully long history of the Uruguay Round negotiations\nshould have forewarned us that the WTO, although\nestablished as a rules-based multilateral organization to\nregulate international trade, will become answerable only to\nthe world\u2019s wealthiest economic Powers. Like the Bretton\nWoods institutions, the WTO remains outside any\nrelationship of accountability to the far more democratic\nUnited Nations General Assembly.\nDuring the Uruguay Round, the developing countries\ndiscovered that, instead of negotiating international rules\non trade in manufactured goods, the rich countries of the\nNorth had widened the agenda and pushed for\nliberalization in economic areas where they clearly have\nan advantage, in particular, financial services and\ninvestments.\nEven though some countries of the South have\nbenefited from the liberalization of trade \u2014 and Malaysia\nis one of them \u2014 the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade (GATT) nevertheless harbours new threats to\ndeveloping and newly emerging economies. Not only\nhave the poor countries of the South to struggle uphill\nmerely to meet the basic needs of their peoples, but they\nare now bullied into adjusting their economic policies to\nmeet their new obligations under GATT so that northern-\nbased corporations can penetrate and capture their\nmarkets. The poor may not reserve their markets for\nthemselves even when they have no capacity to penetrate\nthe markets of the rich.\nFair competition and level playing fields are only for\nthe rich. For example, their attempts to link the\nenvironment and labour standards to trade in\nmanufactured goods is a clear attempt to deny developing\ncountries their meagre competitive advantage. The\nrelationship between trade and labour standards emerged\nnot because of a concern for the well-being of workers in\npoor countries, but as protectionist moves aimed against\ngrowing and competitively-priced imports from the South.\nTo compound this unfair interpretation of the\nmultilateral trade rules, we find that, when it comes to the\ntransfer of technology, the northern countries take a\nfiercely anti-liberal stand, insisting that all WTO member\nStates compulsorily introduce a set of national laws to\nprotect intellectual property rights. Since most patents are\nowned by the North, this in effect means legal protection\nof their technological monopoly and a drastic curtailment\nof the right of developing countries to have access to new\ntechnology.\nIt appears, therefore, that the northern interpretation\nof \u201cfree trade\u201d and \u201cliberalization\u201d are slogans that in\nreality mean liberalization when it benefits the North but\nprotectionism if it can block the South. Thus, while goods\nand capital are permitted and encouraged to move around\n8\n\n\nthe globe, labour and technology may not. Even as we are\nasked to submit to GATT rules and the WTO, we find one\ncountry blatantly undermining the WTO by enacting\nextraterritorial laws that must be submitted to by all nations\nand their companies on pain of excommunication.\nThe GATT also fails to protect the genetic resources\nof the South while allowing genetically modified materials\nto be patented. We now have a situation where theft of\ngenetic resources by western biotech transnational\ncorporations enables them to make huge profits by\nproducing patented genetic mutations of these same\nmaterials. To what depths have we sunk in the global\nmarketplace when nature\u2019s gifts to the poor may not be\nprotected but their modification by the rich becomes\nexclusive property?\nThere are of course many winners and losers in the\nworld of the WTO, but we are concerned that the major\nlosers will soon again be the poorest and most marginalized\ncountries. A small number of developing countries, like\nMalaysia, have benefited. But let me point out that our\ngains have been achieved through thrift, productivity and\nthe ingenuity of our people, hard-earned fruits of our\nlabour. Lest it be forgotten, our new-found prosperity has\nalso benefited those in the developed countries. Our\nproducts are competitively priced, thus contributing to\nlower inflation in the rich countries. Our prosperity has\nprovided vast and expanding markets for the goods of rich\ncountries, thus creating jobs and helping to lower their\nunemployment rates.\nThe term \u201cglobalization\u201d has become the buzzword of\nour times. In the G-7 communiqu\u00e9, globalization was touted\nas\n\u201ca source of hope for the future ... responsible for the\nexpansion of wealth and prosperity in the world.\u201d\n(A/51/208, annex II, para. 2)\nHowever, some would argue that globalization, with its\nobjectives of breaking down borders and sucking the\ncountries of the world into one single economic entity, has\neclipsed multilateralism or attempts to masquerade as the\nsame thing. Indeed, globalization has been described by the\nrich as a\n\u201cnew global partnership for development\u201d. (ibid.,\nannex II, IV)\nIf the current behaviour of the rich countries is\nanything to go by, globalization simply means the breaking\ndown of the borders of countries so that those with the\ncapital and the goods will be free to dominate the\nmarkets. Colonies in the former British Empire will\nremember \u201cImperial Preference\u201d when they were made\nthe exclusive markets of the metropolitan Power.\nGlobalization can mean just that, except that the world\nmarket will belong to the rich nations. Linkages to\nnon-trade issues will prevent the poor from ever\nchallenging the rich, in the same way that the colonies\nwere not allowed to industrialize.\nWe do indeed live in a brutal and unjust world,\nwhere the astonishing developments in science and\ntechnology and our increasingly sophisticated knowledge\nbase are not matched by the ability of Governments to\nmarshal forces to overcome the social and economic\ninequities of their countries. The facts and figures are\nwell documented and widely known, but they are worth\nrepeating just to jog our conscience \u2014 if we still have\none. What are the universal values of this globalized\nworld when increasing numbers of people in both the\nNorth and South live in abject poverty? A fifth of the\nhuman race \u2014 1.3 billion people \u2014 lack access to the\nmost basic necessities, such as food and clean drinking\nwater, while preventable hunger and disease kill 35,000\nchildren throughout the world every day. The 1996 United\nNations Development Programme\u2019s Human Development\nReport states that, in the past 40 years, the richest 20 per\ncent of people have seen the differential between\nthemselves and the poorest 20 per cent double.\nAre we expected to believe in the sincerity of the\nrich countries when they talk about a new global\npartnership and the achievement of sustainable\ndevelopment, when the fact is that, today, we have over\n20 million environmental refugees in addition to an equal\nnumber of traditional refugees? Why should the\ndeveloping countries accept the twisted lexicon of\nnorthern development-speak when \u201cdevelopment\nassistance\u201d means that the net flow of wealth from poor\ncountries to rich has increased to at least $400 billion a\nyear when the terms of trade, transfer pricing, debt\nservicing and the brain drain are taken into account.\nWading through the obstacles of this strife-torn\nworld is a critical dilemma that faces the international\ncommunity today. It is one of international leadership and\nthe failure to deal with these critical issues. Instead, we\nwitness a persistent abnegation by the major Powers of\nthe responsibilities that accompany the rights and\nprivileges of such authority. We must determine the type\n9\n\n\nof world and society we want to live in, and this should be\nbased on truly universal values.\nAs we approach the next millennium and as the\npre-eminence of transnational forces has blurred the\ndefinition of national sovereignty, we must seriously\nquestion why a powerful minority is still allowed to\nbankrupt and coerce the majority to meet its narrow\neconomic and political needs. The poor are no longer\nindependent. They have already lost control over their own\ncurrency. And now they have lost their borders too.\nFreedom of the press is touted as a basic democratic\nprinciple. But control of the media by a handful of western\ncorporations has made nonsense of this principle.\nProclaiming to be windows on the world, the western\nmedia, manipulated and censored by those in control,\ninvariably manage to distort reports so as to put anything\nhappening in the South in the worst possible light.\nAnything positive in the developing countries is ignored.\nThe growth and influence of electronic, satellite and\ninformation technology is astounding. But its impact poses\none of the biggest political and ethical challenges of our\ntime, subverting and distorting our social consciousness.\nThe elites of the North and the South have become blind to\nthe enormities of reality. Events and people are stripped of\ntheir context, so that we become less capable of recognizing\nthe common humanity and equal rights of all the people in\nthe world. Pictures of poverty and inequality are no longer\nreceived with moral outrage, but have become simple facts\nof life. Thus begins the process of dehumanization and\ndisengagement from the rest of human society.\nAlthough without a doubt the information age will\nbring cheap and easy access to knowledge and education\nand facilitate worldwide business, its abuse is already\naffecting the moral values of the world. Smut and violence\ngratuitously distributed by criminals in the North are no less\npolluting than carbon dioxide emissions nor less dangerous\nthan drug trafficking.\nIf one great Power can apply its laws to citizens of\nanother country it considers to be guilty of drug trafficking,\nwhy cannot countries with different moral codes extradite\nthe traffickers of pornography for legal action under the\nlaws of the offended countries? Why cannot there be\ninternational laws and international courts to punish those\nwho spread filth and incite racial hatred and racial\nviolence? Before the whole world sinks deeper into moral\ndecay, the international community should act. Abuse of the\nubiquitous Internet system must be stopped.\nThe monopoly of the electronic media by the North\nshould be broken. As it is, we are getting slanted news,\nmade worse by broadcasters interpreting in favour of their\nown or their countries\u2019 interests. As usual, the poor\ncountries with no role in operating the international media\nhave become the principal victims of world news\nnetworks. Not only are distorted pictures of our countries\nbeing broadcast, but our own capacity to understand what\nis happening is being undermined. In the past, Western\nmissionaries spread the Gospel. Today the media has\ntaken over, and all our cherished values and diverse\ncultures are being destroyed.\nThe United Nations has not always been a failure. In\nits early years it helped to dismantle the empires of\nWestern European countries. Malaysia is grateful to it, for\nit too won freedom because of the moral suasion of the\nUnited Nations. But the United Nations now seems blind\nto what is being done to Iraq and Chechnya. One great\nPower continues its vendetta against Iraq, firing missiles\nat distant targets to bring the Iraqi leadership to its knees,\noblivious to the sufferings of the besieged Iraqi people.\nAnother Power has shut the gates of mercy on the\nChechens, and with rockets and bombs has killed\nindiscriminately and with appalling brutality in order that\nChechnya should remain part of an empire. How much\nmore should the Chechens suffer before the Security\nCouncil takes notice? Where are the vaunted defenders of\nhuman rights who claim that national borders will not\nstop them?\nIt is a fact that every year many statements are made\nat the United Nations that lament the crises of poverty,\nthird-world debt, human rights abuses, conflicts and wars,\nsocial disintegration and environmental degradation. It is\nalmost boring. And yet nothing much has been done\nwhich could bring about an amelioration of this sad state\nof affairs.\nPerhaps it is because the processes of\nintergovernmental consensus decision-making of the\nUnited Nations are tedious and frustrating. Perhaps it is\nmismanagement by the Governments of so many poor\nnations which afford many excuses for the rich not to\nhelp.\nIt is of course easy to use the United Nations as a\nforum to unmask the hypocrisies of both the North and\nthe South, but it is more difficult to work collectively to\nimplement change and solve problems. Still, Malaysia\nbelieves that this repetitive criticism is valid and\nnecessary, that international injustice and oppression\n10\n\n\nshould not be swept into the dustbins of history. I would\nlike to say again that Malaysia strongly believes in the\nmultilateralism of the United Nations and is prepared to\ninvest in this international Organization with all our\nstrength, beliefs and moral fibre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the delegation of the Central\nAfrican Republic, I should like to express our warmest\nand most heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Razali Ismail on\nhis election to the presidency of this session. His proven\nskill in international affairs assures us that our work will\nbe crowned with success. I would assure him of my\ndelegation\u2019s cooperation.\n19\n\n\nWe also wish to extend to the outgoing President,\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, the deepest appreciation of\nthe delegation of the Central African Republic for the\ncompetence with which he served the Organization\nthroughout his mandate.\nLastly, I should like to pay a heartfelt tribute to the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for his courageous and tireless work, work\nwhich does honour to Africa and which is often performed\nin a hostile context, to have the principles of the United\nNations Charter prevail in all circumstances. The work of\nour Secretary-General deserves to be encouraged and must\ncontinue.\nThe evaluation of the United Nations 50 years of\nexistence revealed the Organization\u2019s continuing\nshortcomings in the accomplishment of its mission.\nHowever, the end of the cold war, which allowed us to\nglimpse a new era in international relations, opened\nprospects for renewed cooperation commensurate with the\nhopes that emerged at the end of the world\u2019s division into\nblocs. In that connection, the United Nations was at last to\nrediscover its capacity to handle relations among States on\nthe sole basis of the application of the principles that have\nbrought us together here in this Hall.\nOpposing tendencies continue to vie for attention at a\ntime when we must, with shared resolution, ensure respect\nfor an international rule of law. The world today has\nchanged. The aspiration to wider freedom and greater\nrecognition of equality is stronger than ever before.\nThus, the delegation of the Central African Republic\nbelieves that the shortcomings and limitations of our\nOrganization, like those inherent in any human endeavour,\nmust be rectified, and they can be, if States give priority to\nconcerted action, to dialogue and a shared search for\nsolutions to the world\u2019s problems. Together, we will be\nbetter able to establish the universal values of the United\nNations. Indeed, that is our principal task.\nThe wider advent of democracy, its affirmation and its\nimplantation are of course primarily the choice of a people.\nHowever, democracy, which is a universal value, is also the\nstruggle of all democratically minded people who share its\nideals, and the struggle of the United Nations, whose very\nestablishment was a response to an international order of\ndictatorship and terror with the tragic consequences we all\nknown. We are therefore in duty bound to create true\nsolidarity so as to ensure the defence and spread of\ndemocracy.\nThis is an appropriate time for me to dwell for a\nmoment on the case of my own country, the Central\nAfrican Republic.\nIn the space of one month, a country that was\nalready very far advanced in negotiations to conclude an\nagreement with the Bretton Woods institutions was to\nundergo two mutinies that proved to be attempts at coups\nd\u2019\u00e9tats. The world was presented with a shocking and\nunfamiliar picture of my country, erasing the efforts of\nthe national community to turn its back on its past and\nwiping out the efforts of Central Africans to devote\nthemselves, within the framework of their sovereign\nchoice, to the search for the means of developing the\nCentral African Republic, with its vast potential in\nmining, agriculture and livestock and with its abundant\nrainfall.\nThere were deaths, there was destruction, but above\nall there was an attempt, by force of arms, to impose the\nwill of a tiny fraction of the nation on the majority. The\nlong struggle of the Central African nation freely to\nchoose its leaders at the ballot box was about to be\nobliterated without any legitimacy or legality whatsoever.\nCentral African democracy is three years old. It is\ndeveloping in very difficult economic circumstances, and\nit must find within itself the necessary spirit of\nconfidence, solidarity, hard work and organization. The\naffairs of state of this young democracy must be given the\ntransparency needed for good governance and the\nconfidence to build at last a country whose potential will\nenable it to provide its children with a healthy future.\nThat is the constant message that President Ange-\nF\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9, our Head of State, has expressed to his\ncompatriots ever since assuming office in the Central\nAfrican Republic. But there is still a long road to follow,\nand one strewn with pitfalls, before we can arrive at the\ntranquillity of older democracies that makes military\nadventurism inadmissible.\nWhile this destiny is mainly the responsibility of\neach country, the Central African Republic believes that\ndefence of the universal values of freedom and equality\nis also the responsibility of all democrats, whether or not\nthey are States. That is why I would like to take this\nopportunity to express the gratitude of the Government of\nthe Central African Republic to those friendly countries,\nespecially France, the United States of America,\nGermany, Gabon, Chad, Zaire, Congo, Senegal, Togo,\nBenin, Mali, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Sudan, which gave their\n20\n\n\nsupport, in the name of the principles of democracy, to the\nchoices of the Central African Republic and its institutions\nduring this difficult period. That same appreciation is\nextended to the Secretary-General of the OAU, and above\nall to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his\nunambiguous and courageous position in defence of\ndemocracy.\nCollectively, the Central Africans overcame this\ndifficult stage in the history of their country because in\ndark moments they always had the spirit to find a solution\nto preserve the essential, the unity of the country,\nreinforced by a common language, Sango.\nSince then, the Central African Republic has been\nworking to find ways and means to strengthen the peace\nand security it has restored. Hence, with the participation of\nfriendly countries such as France, Gabon, Senegal, and Mali\n(with the contribution of its former President Amadou\nToumani Toure), the Government has organized national\nstructures for defence. It recently convened an important\nseminar, with the support of the United States of America\non the role of the military in a democracy. This meeting\nserved to draw attention to the place of the army within the\nnation; in other words, in a republic the armed forces must\nbe under civil authority.\nAnother dimension of restoring peace and security is\nthe relaunching of the economy. My country wishes to pay\ntribute to the promptness with which countries such as\nFrance, the Republic of China and Germany and bodies\nsuch as the United Nations, through the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) intervened, either\nproviding direct support for the re launch or helping to\ndevelop an emergency programme leading to a joint\nmeeting of donors in Bangui. The pledges made during that\nmeeting were encouraging and we hope for further such\noffers of support during the round table planned for 1997.\nBut it is the intention of the President of the Republic,\nAnge-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9, to reach an agreement with the\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. This\nintention has been repeated and will be pursued.\nThe course taken in international relations since the\nend of the cold war should prompt States to turn to\nmultilateral cooperation and United Nations principles\nshould come fully into play in crisis settlement. This should\napply to the question of the Middle East, where the current\npeace process must be pursued and concluded without\ndelay. It should also apply to the situation in Rwanda and\nBurundi, where regional initiatives must also back up\ninternational efforts, in the Western Sahara, in Angola and\nin Liberia, where it should be possible to implement the\nUnited Nations plan of action.\nThe firm political will of all continues to be\nnecessary to achieve this, with a constant search for\nmechanisms that build and strengthen confidence among\nStates. In this respect, the signing of the non-aggression\npact among States members of the United Nations\nStanding Advisory Committee on Questions of Security\nin Central Africa will certainly contribute, if observed, to\npreserving good-neighbourly relations among the\nsignatories and will free the dynamic elements in one of\nthe richest regions of the world for integrated\ndevelopment efforts.\nIn that same spirit, during this session the Central\nAfrican Republic intends to sign the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which it fully supported at the\ndraft stage.\nPolitical will presupposes the strengthening of the\nUnited Nations authority and its universal nature. That\nauthority flows from its rightful place in the world, a\nworld that has changed to such an extent since the\nestablishment of the United Nations that the working\nmethods of its organs need to be adapted. The United\nNations is no longer accorded the status it had during the\ndecolonization movement. There has been a loss of regard\nfor the United Nations, especially since the division of the\nworld into hostile blocs came to an end. States,\nparticularly the powerful ones, prefer to resolve problems\noutside the United Nations, or consider that the\nOrganization should merely endorse their decisions. The\nUnited Nations should not be used as a tool in this way;\ntherein lies the root cause of the powerlessness of which\nit stands accused.\nThe restructuring efforts begun two years ago must\nbe pursued and stressed in order to achieve rational and\nreal structural reforms allowing the Organization to\noperate more efficiently in various areas, beginning with\nthe Security Council. The Security Council should include\ncountries from both the North and South that can provide\nthe financial and political resources needed by the\nOrganization to defend peace. From this standpoint, the\nCentral African Republic delegation supports the\ninitiatives taken by Germany and Japan. The economic\nweight of these countries and their activities to promote\ndevelopment and peace give them an outstanding place in\ninternational cooperation today.\n21\n\n\nWhat is more, the democratization of international\nrelations also involves a strengthening of the universalist\nnature of our Organization, because the United Nations,\nwith its mission to bring together all States and civilizations\nof the world, can no longer refuse to admit States,\nespecially if those States are able to meet the obligations\ninherent in the status of Member.\nI should like to raise here the question of the Republic\nof China in Taiwan. My delegation regrets that this\nquestion is once again not on our agenda this year. Yet the\nfirst consequence of the end of the cold war was the\nreassessment of questions associated with this period, for\nexample the issues related to General Assembly resolution\n2758 (XXVI), which artificially deprives the Republic of\nChina of its place in the United Nations. This is a flagrant\ninjustice that should be redressed by the international\ncommunity, which can surely not allow a sovereign and\nindependent State, in which free and democratic elections\nhave recently been held, to be indefinitely excluded, with\nits 21 million inhabitants, from United Nations activities.\nThe European Parliament has recognized this. Last July it\nadopted a proposed joint resolution requesting the United\nNations to study the possibility of participation by the\nRepublic of China in the activities of bodies that report to\nthe General Assembly.\nFurthermore, there are many challenges facing the\nworld today requiring the general mobilization of all States,\nincluding the Republic of China, whose participation in\nefforts for peace and development throughout the world is\nalready highly appreciated. The delegation of the Central\nAfrican Republic therefore appeals to the General\nAssembly\u2019s wisdom and realism and invites it to examine\nthe question during its next session so that the Republic of\nChina in Taiwan can resume its seat in the United Nations.\nIt has been said time and again that the world has\nbecome a global village, characterized by an intermingling\nof cultures, ideas, economies, markets, norms of behaviour\nand the ever more rapid coming together of peoples, despite\nthe barriers imposed by frontiers. My delegation believes\nthat the acceleration of the process of globalization will\nlead to an increasingly integrated approach to development\nmanagement so as to find a global solution.\nGiven the proliferation of internal conflicts and\nregional tensions, the harmful effects of economic disorder,\nthe spread of the AIDS pandemic, the rise of crime and\nterrorism, violations of human rights, the ever-widening\ninternational character of drug-trafficking networks and the\ndeterioration of the environment, there is no single area of\ninternational relations that does not require a collective\neffort on the part of States if it is to be mastered.\nThe Central African Republic would like to\nemphasize the issue of the AIDS pandemic. This problem\nrequires the keen attention of the entire international\ncommunity, because no solution is near. The small size\nand youthfulness of the country\u2019s population explain why\nthe Government is paying special attention to this\npandemic, and to the question of health in general. That\nis why we believe that agencies such as the World Health\nOrganization, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and the\nUnited Nations Population Fund must be encouraged.\nFor the delegation of the Central African Republic\nthe hope that has been placed in the will of States to\nmobilize for this vast international cooperative action will\ntruly make it possible to embark on the second 50 years\nof the United Nations in a way that will avoid the pitfalls\nexperienced during the first 50 years of its existence.\nIn our lives as human beings there are always times\nwhen we need to look within ourselves, and at our\nexistence, to see exactly what must be done and in what\ndirection to go. It is the responsibility of States to make\nof the United Nations what they want it to be, taking\naccount of its failings, weaknesses, limits and\nshortcomings.\nStates today must do all they can, with a constant\neffort of political will, to support our Organization so that\nmultilateral cooperation has full scope. The defence of\npeace and the promotion of sustainable development\nduring this time of globalization cannot succeed\notherwise.\nThe delegation of the Central African Republic\nwould like to share with the other members of the\ninternational community the hope that, during the next 50\nyears, the world will embark resolutely on the path laid\ndown by the founding fathers of the Organization. An\nimportant part of the attainment of the principles and\nvalues of the Charter will be the implementation of the\nproposals made by our\n22\n\n\ndynamic Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, through the\nAgenda for Peace, the Agenda for Development and, above\nall, the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on\nAfrica."

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, please\naccept our heartfelt congratulations on the assumption of\nyour high office. Your unanimous election is a tribute to\nyour great country, with which we enjoy friendly and\nfraternal relations. It is also a testimony to your diplomatic\nskills and personal standing in this world forum, where, on\nso many occasions, you have articulated most persuasively\nthe concerns of the international community, particularly\nthose of the marginalized and vulnerable. You are assured\nof the unstinting support of my delegation in the discharge\nof your very heavy responsibilities.\nI should like to convey to your predecessor, the\nPresident of the General Assembly at its historic fiftieth\nsession, His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, our\nappreciation for a job well done.\nI should also like to pay a special tribute to our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. In a very\nreal sense, he is the first Secretary-General of the post-\ncold-war period, and has had to contend with issues and\nproblems that were perhaps furthest from the minds and\nintentions of the founding fathers of our Organization. To\nhis high office he has brought to bear clarity of vision\nand purpose, and a remarkable ability \u2014 as we have seen\nfrom two seminal reports, on the Agenda for Peace and\nthe Agenda for Development \u2014 to present complex\nanalyses and facts in a simple, distilled form. For nearly\nhalf a decade, he has handled what was once described by\none of his predecessors as \u201cthe most impossible job on\nthis earth\u201d with verve, dignity and integrity.\nOver two decades ago, the father of our nation,\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, addressed the\nGeneral Assembly at its twenty-ninth session, soon after\nBangladesh\u2019s entry into the United Nations as a fully-\nfledged Member. In his speech he outlined some cardinal\ntenets, the basic focus and thrust of our foreign policy,\nand our domestic priorities. These hold good even today,\nin a world that has undergone radical transformation. As\nBangabandhu stated, our foreign policy is based on the\nprinciples of peaceful coexistence and friendship towards\nall.\nOur political party, the Awami League, has only\nrecently been returned to office, through the process of\ngeneral elections, after a gap of more than 20 years. As\nwas stressed by our leader at the twenty-ninth session of\nthe General Assembly, our total commitment to peace is\nborn of the realization that only in an environment of\npeace can our people concentrate their energies and\nresources in combating the scourges of poverty, hunger,\ndisease, illiteracy and unemployment that still beset a\nlarge proportion of humankind. We naturally place special\nimportance and emphasis on the development of good-\nneighbourly relations with the countries of our region, on\nthe basis of universally accepted principles of peaceful\ncoexistence, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity and non-interference in each other\u2019s internal\naffairs. We identify wholeheartedly with the aspirations\nand hopes of developing countries in general, particularly\nthose belonging to the Non-Aligned Movement, and share\na special affinity with the fraternal member States of the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). We share\nwith our development partners the goal of improving the\nquality of life of our people, and our relations with them\nare of the greatest significance to us.\n5\n\n\nThe existence of friendly and good-neighbourly\nrelations does not necessarily preclude the emergence of\nproblems. What these can ensure, however, is that the best\nof political will, goodwill and good intentions are brought\nto bear in seeking solutions to any outstanding problems or\nany new ones that may arise. Such an approach would go\na long way towards resolving any differences or disputes.\nOur outstanding problem with India over the sharing\nof the waters of the Ganges River is not unknown to this\nforum. Water resources play a predominant role in the\nsocio-economic development of a country. For Bangladesh,\nthe availability of fresh river water in adequate volumes is\nindispensable for purposes of agriculture, irrigation,\nfisheries, river traffic, maintaining ecological and\nenvironmental balance and preventing the intrusion of\nsalinity. The importance that we attach to this issue cannot\nbe overemphasized and we have resumed bilateral\ndiscussions with India, in an atmosphere of mutual\nconfidence and trust, to resolve this vexed problem\namicably and equitably so that our legitimate concerns can\nbe met.\nOn the subject of water resources, I should like to\ndigress a little from the purely national and also bilateral\ncontext, because the shortage of fresh water resources is\nnot, let me emphasize, unique or peculiar to Bangladesh or\nour region. Even from the international perspective, it is an\nissue of primal significance. According to a recent strategy\npaper of the Committee on Natural Resources of the\nEconomic and Social Council, by the year 2025, 52\ncountries with a total population of more than 3 billion\npeople will be water-stressed or face chronic water scarcity.\nThe problem has as much to do with the availability of\nfresh water in the overall global context as with the fact\nthat such resources, even when available in abundant\nquantities, may be found in the wrong places or are\navailable at the wrong times. The problem, therefore, is\nintimately and intricately linked to efficient water\nmanagement.\nThe question of water is not new to the global agenda\nand, since the Mar del Plata Conference in March of 1977,\nthere have been international programmes on water-related\nissues. It has not, however, in our view, received the\npriority that it deserves. An international code of conduct\nfor water-sharing was provided for in the Mar del Plata\nAction Plan and, as the strategy paper of the Committee on\nNatural Resources suggests, an international code of water\nethics is needed more urgently today than ever before as a\nguide to help countries in their efforts to reach bilateral and\nmultilateral agreements. The paper also suggests an\ninternational convention on freshwater resources along the\nlines of those that already exist on biodiversity, ozone\ndepletion and climate change. In particular, the paper\nstresses that the United Nations should develop principles\nand ethics on sharing the joint planetary freshwater\nresources. These are ideas that, in our view, warrant\nserious consideration by the world community.\nReverting to the subject of our Government\u2019s\npriorities, let me just add that, in the domestic sphere, like\nall other developing countries, we are striving for a\nhuman development paradigm that will prioritize people,\nespecially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sectors.\nWe will pursue a programme of reforms with emphasis\non our domestic considerations: poverty alleviation and\neconomic growth with social justice. The social sectors\nwill receive special attention.\nThe 1990s has been a period of democratic renewal.\nOur Government firmly believes that it is as important,\nand perhaps more difficult, to live up to great principles\nand ideas as to fight for their realization. That is why we\nshall strive to strengthen our polity through institutions\nand laws.\nThrough constitutional amendment, an important\ninnovation for democratic institutions and practice was\neffected in Bangladesh, following overwhelming popular\ndemand, prior to our general elections in June. Three\nmonths before general elections are to be held, the\nGovernment will demit office and hand over power to a\nnon-partisan and neutral caretaker Government to be\nheaded by the most recently retired Chief Justice of the\ncountry and comprised of eminent apolitical personalities\nappointed on his advice, keeping in mind the sensitivities\nof the major political parties. The principal mandate of\nthe caretaker Government will be to ensure free and fair\ngeneral elections to be conducted by an independent\nconstitutional authority, the Election Commission. Foreign\nobservers were welcome to observe the electoral process,\ncompletely unhindered, in 1996 and 1991. Reports\nsubmitted by international observers can be of help in\nidentifying any shortcomings or gaps that may exist and\nalso contain constructive suggestions for improvement.\nThese steps are the national equivalents of confidence-\nbuilding measures between and among States.\nDemocracy, of course, goes well beyond the holding\nof periodic general elections. It is a continuous process\nand even a culture and ethos, which above all denote a\ncertain approach and attitude to governance. We in\nBangladesh see democracy as more than a laudable and\n6\n\n\ndesirable objective. In the long term, democratic and\naccountable government affords the most efficacious and\nstable medium to develop the economy of a State and to\nachieve prosperity for its people. The very apposite point\nhas been made, however, that democracy cannot on its own\nbe a panacea for the diverse problems that confront many\ncountries. There must also be effective international\ncooperation and a supportive external economic\nenvironment if the major socio-economic problems are to\nbe meaningfully addressed.\nThe cold war is now truly behind us and the object\nnow is to win the peace. Peace is not simply the absence of\nwar, but should encompass every human condition,\nnecessity and amenity that make for a civilized and\ndignified life. It is inseparable from security and is the flip\nside of development. Political, economic and social issues\nare today intimately and intricately intertwined. Political\ninternationalism without economic internationalism can only\nbe likened to a house built upon sand. Most emphatically\nin this day and age of interdependence, no nation can\nachieve its fullest development alone. This is an area where\nthe United Nations and the United Nations system clearly\nhave a constructive role to play.\nThe main purposes of the United Nations, as outlined\nin Chapter I of the Charter, include the achievement of\ninternational cooperation in solving international problems\nof an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character\nand also to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of\nnations in the attainment of these common ends.\nThe Bretton Woods institutions are, of course, major\nplayers in the field of development policy and research.\nThere is also, in our view, a patent need and ample\njustification in the Charter provisions for the United Nations\nand the United Nations system to play a meaningful role in\nglobal macroeconomic policy and strategy formulation. The\nUnited Nations is the universal forum for dialogue and\ndecisions on such issues. This is an area in which, in\nparticular, a revitalized Economic and Social Council can\nplay a constructive and fruitful role. While the United\nNations economic role provides special focus on\noperational, welfare and humanitarian activities, there is\ncertainly a need for greater harmony and coordination\nbetween the United Nations systems on the one hand and\nthe Bretton Woods institutions on the other.\nOn the subject of development, let me reaffirm that a\nsupportive external environment is an indispensable\nsupplement to national efforts and policies. Poverty is\narguably the prime source of world disorder and needs to\nbe addressed, inter alia, through sustained and enhanced\nflows of resources from the North to the countries of the\nSouth. The gap between North and South is widening at\nan ominous rate. In 1890, the wealth of each European\nwas twice that of a South Asian. Today, the gap is 70-\nfold. In 1960, the per capita gross national product of the\nrichest 20 per cent of States was 30 times higher than that\nof the poorest 20 per cent. By 1989, the gap had widened\nto 60 times. By 1994, only four countries members of the\nDevelopment Assistance Committee (DAC) had reached\nthe United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national\nproduct as official development assistance. The average\nfigure for DAC countries actually fell from 0.31 per cent\nin 1993 to 0.30 per cent in 1994. The least developed\ncountries\u2019 share of world trade has plummeted in two\ndecades from 0.8 per cent to a mere 0.4 per cent.\nThe problems of the 48 least developed countries\ncontinue to deserve special consideration on the global\ndevelopment agenda. The Mid-term Global Review of the\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countries\nfor the 1990s has pointed to the limited progress made in\nthe implementation of commitments by our development\npartners. The development initiatives of the least-\ndeveloped countries are stunted by problems associated\nwith formidable structural adjustment programmes, the\ndecline of an already low level of development resources,\nand the extremely low level of exports compounded by\nlimited market access. The debt-relief measures taken thus\nfar have remained grossly inadequate. We urge our\ndevelopment partners to adopt specific and concrete\nmeasures to redress these problems. We welcome the\nstatements of several delegations that asked the removal\nof barriers on the products of the least developed\ncountries. We believe that, at the forthcoming Ministerial\nMeeting of the World Trade Organization in December,\nevery participant will work to remove all obstacles to\ntrade from this vulnerable group of countries.\nThe problems of developing countries are also, at\none remove, the problems of the whole world, because\nprosperity, like peace and stability, is in the final analysis\nindivisible. For developed countries, assistance to the\ncountries of the South will surely constitute an investment\nin a more secure, stable and, I have no doubt, eventually\nprosperous third world. The marginalization of developing\ncountries would be morally indefensible, politically self-\ndefeating and economically counter-productive. The\naspirations of the South and the prosperity of the North\nare emphatically not mutually exclusive.\n7\n\n\nAs the first United Nations Secretary-General put it,\nthe United Nations was as strong an Organization as the\nrepresentatives in San Francisco could agree upon. Half a\ncentury later, the United Nations remains the indispensable\nlinchpin of any international order, a role for which it is\nuniquely conditioned, equipped and mandated. I should like\nto stress here that an effective and credible United Nations\nis even more vital and relevant for the smaller and more\nvulnerable States than for the more powerful ones.\nIn today\u2019s vastly altered world, the United Nations and\nits system offer even broader promise than what its\nfounding fathers could have envisioned. However, like all\norganizations, the United Nations system is also subject to\nthe Darwinian dictum of \u201cadapt or perish\u201d. Much thought,\neffort and work are therefore being devoted to the goal of\nmaking the United Nations more attuned and responsive to\nchanging times and requirements, charting its future course\nand defining its new emphases and priorities.\nThe United Nations areas of responsibility should\nclearly cover problems or issues between States, especially\nthose that are pandemic in range and global in consequence.\nEnvironmental degradation, human rights, burgeoning\npopulations, the situation and rights of women and children,\nthe depletion of non-renewable natural resources, drugs,\nmigration, international terrorism and corruption in\ninternational business could very well \u2014 in addition to\nissues of international peace, security and development \u2014\nbe the topical objects of United Nations policies and\nactions. We would, of course, want a United Nations that\nis streamlined and focused, open and accountable, with\nprofessional management systems and structures.\nOn the subject of Security Council reform, a number\nof proposals have been mooted, including a wide-ranging\none by Italy. There is a broad convergence, if not\nconsensus, on the idea that the overall size of an expanded\nCouncil should not exceed a figure in the low or mid-\ntwenties. An agreement as to whether expansion should\ncover only the non-permanent category or both categories\nof seats, or could even include a new semi-permanent\ncategory, still continues to elude us. It is our view that\nthree aspects of the issue should be given priority.\nFirstly, the smaller and the more vulnerable States that\nby definition pose no threat to international security have\nthe most vital stakes in the United Nations. Their interests\nand concerns may not be overlooked in any restructuring of\nthe Council. Experience also shows that smaller countries\nwith no vested interests have played a more constructive\nrole as Council members in general.\nSecondly, the objective of any reform and\nrestructuring should be a more effective and dynamic\nCouncil. Nothing should be allowed to detract from this.\nThirdly, the moral dimension in determining criteria\nfor possible new categories of membership or for any\naddition to permanent ranks should be given due\nconsideration. This would include a country\u2019s\ncommitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter,\nto democratic government and the essential freedoms,\nhuman rights and, in general, respect for United Nations\ndecisions.\nThe Secretary-General is the most visible symbol\nand personification of the United Nations and the United\nNations system. We see him as something more than the\nchief administrative officer of the Organization, as\nstipulated in the Charter, because he also has important\npolitical responsibilities. A former Secretary-General was\nof the view that the Secretary-General should be of help\nin\n\u201cfilling any vacuum that may appear in the systems\nwhich the Charter and traditional diplomacy provide\nfor the safeguarding of peace and security\u201d.\nWhile efforts are being made to enhance the\neffectiveness of the General Assembly, the Security\nCouncil and the operational arms of the United Nations\nsystem, we could perhaps consider ways of strengthening\nthe office of Secretary-General. One idea that we would\ncommend for consideration is the establishment of a\ncommittee, along the lines of the General Committee of\nthe General Assembly, that the Secretary-General could\nconsult, formally or informally, collectively or by\nindividual member, on important administrative and\npolitical issues. Such a committee would serve useful\npurposes, particularly in ensuring the rightful role of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nFirst, it would ensure closer interaction and exchange\nbetween the Secretary-General and the General Assembly.\nSecondly, it would provide the Secretary-General the\nbenefit of dispassionate counsel and a feel for the\nthinking of Member States on issues in an institutional\nmanner. And, thirdly, it would make for greater\ntransparency in decision-making.\nThe objective of any reform and restructuring\nexercise is a strengthened United Nations that is\ninstitutionally better equipped to fulfil its mandate.\nReforms, however, can only supplement, not be a\n8\n\n\nsubstitute for the political will to do what is right and\nwarranted by the purposes and principles and other\nprovisions of the Charter. Over the years, when the United\nNations has floundered or failed, the predominant reasons\nwere more often, unfortunately, the lack of political will\nrather than insuperable local difficulties or institutional\nlacunas.\nI should like to touch very briefly upon the dismal\nfinancial situation of the United Nations, which has become\nvery serious indeed. Member States have every right and\neven a duty to demand the best value for their money. The\nUnited Nations, however, must be provided the wherewithal\nto discharge its responsibilities. We welcome the United\nStates commitment to meet its financial obligations to the\nUnited Nations and to pay its arrears over a five-year\nperiod.\nSome interesting suggestions on United Nations reform\nhave emanated from the Group of Seven Summit in Lyon\nearlier this year. These envisage some savings from the\nremoval of overlap, improvement in the effectiveness of\nsome agencies and commissions, and consolidation and\nrationalization of certain programmes. I have no doubt that\nthe Fifth Committee and perhaps the Advisory Committee\non Administrative and Budgetary Questions will look\nclosely at these proposals. We, of course, welcome the\nsuggestion that any savings from such reforms are planned\nto be reinvested in development programmes.\nA more realistic perspective of the expenditures\nincurred by the United Nations is afforded by comparing\nthe United Nations budget with expenses incurred in certain\nactivities by national or even local Governments. For\nexample, in 1992, the United Nations regular assessed\nbudget was about the size of the New York City Fire\nDepartment budget. In 1994, the cost of the entire United\nNations system, including all emergency operations, was\nover $10 billion, or about $2 per capita of the planet\u2019s\npopulation. The expenditure on arms in the same year was\nabout $150 per capita.\nWhile every scope and avenue for greater cost-\neffectiveness should be explored, it is difficult to escape the\nconclusion that the United Nations gives good value for\nmoney. Expenditures on peacekeeping and the United\nNations system are in a real sense an investment in peace\nand security.\nDisarmament has always been accorded a very high\npriority in the United Nations. In particular, the question of\nnuclear disarmament has always received the highest\npriority. With the end of the cold war, there is an\nincreasing awareness of the need to address this issue in\nall earnestness. The indefinite extension of the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) last year\nand the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty by an overwhelming majority in the General\nAssembly are welcome steps towards the ultimate goal of\nnuclear disarmament. The International Court of Justice,\nin its recent Advisory Opinion on the issue of nuclear\nweapons, stressed the obligation\n\u201cto pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion\nnegotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its\naspects under strict and effective international\ncontrol\u201d. (A/51/4, para. 182 (f))\nLike chemical and biological weapons, nuclear\nweapons must be outlawed. In the post-cold-war world,\nthey have became an anachronism. They do not enhance\ninternational security and can only imperil world peace.\nFor Bangladesh, the pursuit of general and complete\ndisarmament is a fundamental principle of State policy.\nAs a new member of the Conference on Disarmament, we\nare fully prepared to play a constructive role towards this\ngoal. Bangladesh, together with most members of the\nG-21, has submitted a proposal in the Conference on\nDisarmament on the elimination of nuclear weapons. This\nhas been circulated as a Conference on Disarmament\ndocument. We accept that substantial reductions are being\nmade under START I and START II in the nuclear\narsenals of the two major nuclear Powers. The\nuncomfortable fact remains, however, that even after\nSTART II is completed by the year 2003 at the latest,\nthere will still be more nuclear warheads in existence than\nin 1970, when the NPT came into force. The need to\nmove speedily towards a third START treaty and beyond\nis very obvious.\nPeacekeeping continues to be a most significant area\nof United Nations activity. The United Nations has indeed\nachieved some notable successes in peacekeeping\nmissions in recent times, examples of which include those\nin El Salvador, Cambodia, Haiti, Mozambique and\nAngola. Bangladesh is proud to play an active role in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping activities. Our peacekeepers\nhave shed their blood and sacrificed their lives in the\ncause of peace throughout the world.\nThere is room for cautious optimism on the issue of\nBosnia and Herzegovina. We sincerely hope that the\nDayton Agreement will be implemented in its entirety and\n9\n\n\nthat a genuine peace will return to that beleaguered region.\nBangladesh will continue to support all efforts towards this\nobjective through regional as well as multilateral forums.\nRecent developments in the Middle East have been of\nconcern to us all. Bangladesh expressed its grave concern\nand outrage at the recent violence and killings that took\nplace in the West Bank and Gaza and the disrespect shown\nto the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque. We call upon all concerned\nto honour their commitments under the peace accord with\na view to finding a comprehensive and lasting peace in the\nMiddle East, which Bangladesh believes will enable the\nemergence of a Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its\ncapital. The Government and the people of Bangladesh\nstand by President Yasser Arafat and our Palestinian\nbrethren. We also reaffirm our commitment and support to\nthe Arab and Palestinian cause.\nIn a very real sense, the United Nations belongs to the\nentire human family. Over the years, it has been a potent\nmoral force and an influence for the good. It remains the\nonly credible vehicle that can move the world towards the\ngoal of international peace and prosperity. The institution\nof the United Nations itself, comprised of Member States\nlarge and small, attests to mankind\u2019s wisdom and desire for\npeace. We have every confidence and hope that, in the\ncrucial years ahead, a revitalized United Nations will\ncontinue to play an effective role in deciding the\ntranscendent policy issues of the day.\nDifferences between peoples, countries and nations can\nand do exist, and yet all share a common vision, hopes and\naspirations. Good men and women all over the globe must\nsurely dream the same dreams of lasting peace and\nhappiness.\nOver 50 years ago, a great world leader \u2014 one of the\narchitects of the Atlantic Charter and one of the first\npersons to use the term \u201cUnited Nations\u201d \u2014 made an\nimpassioned plea for peace when he wrote:\n\u201cWe are faced with the pre-eminent fact that if\ncivilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science\nof human relationship \u2014 the ability of peoples of all\nkinds to live together and work together in the same\nworld at peace.\u201d\nPresident Roosevelt did not live to speak those words,\nwhich he wrote for what would have been his last address.\nHis words are surely relevant even today.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first to congratulate Mr. Razali Ismail\non his election to the post of President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-first session. We consider this to\nconstitute recognition by the community of nations of the\ngrowing role being played by Malaysia on the world\npolitical and economic scenes.\nThe Republic of Tajikistan\u2019s accession to full United\nNations membership five years ago marked a new page\nin the history of my country\u2019s relations with the\nOrganization. Five years is, of course, a short period in\nhistory, but for our country they have been crucial. For\nthe Tajik people, whose history over the past millennium\nhas been full of tragic events, they were fraught with\nserious ordeals. These years saw both our breakthrough to\nsovereignty and one of the most tragic periods of our\nmodern history: the civil war. Indeed, the question was\nwhether one of the newest Member States was to continue\nto exist on the world map.\nThe people of Tajikistan answered this question\nthemselves, but the historical cost of the survival of the\nyoung State, which became the object of massive\naggression from united extremist forces, including attacks\ncarried out from the southern borders of the\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS), was very\nhigh.\nIt is already clear today that the conflict imposed on\nthe Tajik people \u2014 an enormous human tragedy \u2014 was\naimed at undermining the newly emerging foundations of\nthe State and interfering with economic growth and\nmarket reforms and hence the country\u2019s independent\ndevelopment along a general democratic course. The scale\nof the conflict and the degree of involvement of forces\nfrom the territory of a neighbouring State posed a threat\nto peace and security on the Asian continent as a whole.\nFortunately, in its difficult struggle for political survival,\nTajikistan was not left to fend for itself. The CIS\nStates \u2014 primarily Russia and the central Asian\ncountries, as well as the United Nations and the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\nsupported the Republic and continue to do so.\n23\n\n\nToday, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan\nis concentrating its efforts on tasks whose successful\naccomplishment will make it possible to reconstruct the\nsocial and economic infrastructure of the southern part of\nthe Republic, which was devastated by the civil war; to\nreintegrate the disrupted regional sectors of the national\neconomy on a new basis; and to convert the distorted\ncentralized national economy that we inherited into a\nmodern market economy.\nThese tasks, difficult enough in their own right, are all\nthe more complex because of a chronic shortage of our own\nfinancial resources. Thanks to the donor States, the United\nNations specialized agencies and other international and\nregional organizations, Tajikistan continues to receive\nhumanitarian support. The overall volume of the assistance\nreceived, however, is insufficient, while the economic\nsituation inside the country continues to be very\ncomplicated.\nWe note with satisfaction that, given these\ncircumstances, authoritative international financial\ninstitutions have been understanding about our growing\nneeds. As a result, the Government of Tajikistan, supported\nby the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, is\nmaking deliberate efforts to intensify the reforms, create a\nmarket economy in the country and integrate the national\neconomy into the world trade and economic system.\nA solid basis for progressive and sustainable\ndevelopment is being created in the country step by step.\nThat is why the Government of Tajikistan is particularly\ninterested in the adoption by the General Assembly at this\nsession of decisions dealing with assistance to countries\nwith transitional economies, taking into account the relevant\nprovisions of the Agenda for Development. We also hope\nthat the decisions of the most recent special session of the\nCommission for Social Development will be fully\nimplemented.\nAs the Assembly may know, the Commission\nemphasized once again the necessity for United Nations\nfinancial organizations to mobilize resources in support of\nthe national efforts of the developing countries to\nimplement the Copenhagen Declaration on Social\nDevelopment and the Programme of Action of the World\nSummit for Social Development. This important Declaration\nacquires special significance on the eve of the first United\nNations Decade for the Eradication Poverty (1997-2006).\nThe stabilization of Tajikistan\u2019s economy is not only\nthe key to satisfying the pressing social and economic needs\nof our people, but would without a doubt promote the\nprocess of national conciliation, social consolidation, and\nthe strong and healthy formation of democratic\ninstitutions in the country as a whole.\nAs a post-socialist State at the very beginning of its\ndemocratic rejuvenation, the Republic of Tajikistan values\nhighly the international experience it has accumulated\nwithin the United Nations. Such experience helps\nGovernments to develop and strengthen new democracies.\nDrawing upon this rich international experience, my\nGovernment is purposefully taking important\nconstitutional steps towards creating an open society.\nFirmly and consistently committed to the course of\ndemocratic development pursued by the President of the\nRepublic of Tajikistan, Mr. Emomali Rakhmonov, the\nGovernment of my country promotes the involvement of\nthe broad mass of the population in social, political and\neconomic reform processes through such mechanisms as\nreferendums, national elections to representative bodies,\nrenovation of the judicial system and every possible\nencouragement of openness.\nAn important practical step towards the further\ndemocratization of society was taken with the adoption of\nthe treaty on national reconciliation in Tajikistan, initiated\nby the President and social organizations of the country.\nThis treaty was signed by the leaders of the absolute\nmajority of political parties, public movements, national\nassociations and religious communities. We consider it to\nbe a universal, basic document of national reconciliation\nthat defines viewpoints for the formation of a State\nproviding for the equal and full participation of all\npolitical and regional forces in national public life.\nThe people of Tajikistan made a deliberate choice in\nfavour of democratic reforms and they are not going to\ngive them up voluntarily. However, the course is full of\nobstacles, which my Government is resolved to overcome\nin the interests of achieving the main goal: the formation\nof a civil society.\nOne of the main problems hampering our building of\na new society is an undeclared small war in the far south-\neast of Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghan border, which\nhas been imposed on the Tajik people by the opposition\nIslamic Revival Movement of Tajikistan. The intransigent\narmed wing of the opposition is increasing tensions in the\ncountry by torpedoing the agreements reached at the inter-\nTajik talks. By constantly and flagrantly violating the\nTajik-Afghan sector of the southern border of the\nCommonwealth of Independent States, it is inflicting pain\n24\n\n\nand suffering on the civil population and causing irreparable\ndamage to the unique wildlife of the Pamir region.\nThe leadership of Tajikistan believes that the road to\npeace in the country lies through the continuation of\ndialogue and the resolution of existing differences through\nconstitutional legitimacy and only by political means. The\nRepublic of Tajikistan sincerely appreciates the active\nhumanitarian mediation of the United Nations, which is\nsearching for ways to resolve the conflict peacefully. My\nGovernment greatly values the personal contribution made\nby the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, his\nSpecial Representative, Mr. Gerd Merrem, and the United\nNations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan to the settlement\nof the conflict.\nWe greatly appreciate the significant contribution\nmade to the peace process by other international\norganizations, as well as by the States attending the talks as\nobservers.\nIn particular I would like to note the constructive role\nplayed by the Russian Federation. It has given us\nsignificant and considerable assistance in protecting\nTajikistan\u2019s border and ensuring security in general. We see\nthis assistance as a strategic measure aimed at preventing\nthe southern border of the Tajik part of the CIS from being\nviolated. This task is being carried out by a group of\nRussian border patrol troops in Tajikistan, comprised for\nthe most part of Tajik youths, and the collective\npeacekeeping forces with the participation of Uzbekistan,\nKazakstan and Kyrgyzstan.\nIt is appropriate to recall that the leadership of\nTajikistan and the States whose military contingents are part\nof the collective peacekeeping forces of the CIS have\nrepeatedly asked that these forces be granted the status of\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operation. I do not think this\nrequest is any less urgent today.\nWe are well aware of the fact that the only\nprerequisite for effective dialogue is the moral willingness\nof the opposing sides to reach a possible compromise. The\nGovernment of Tajikistan has repeatedly demonstrated its\ngood will by trying to meet the other side half-way and to\nbreathe new life into the negotiating process whenever\nnecessary. We will not tire of walking this, the only road to\npeace. At the same time, we consider the demands made by\nthe opposition for an equal division of power and,\nparticularly, the dismantling of existing State bodies as a\ncondition for national reconciliation to be unrealistic and\ndesigned deliberately to lead to deadlock.\nThe Government of Tajikistan is fully determined\nlogically to finish what it has started and to find a\nmutually acceptable formula for peace in the country.\nAnd if the opposition takes a similarly constructive stance\nand strictly adheres to the Tehran ceasefire agreement,\nthen there is hope that the Ashgabat agreements will lead\nto real political results and bring the long-awaited peace\nto Tajik soil. A striking illustration of this is the\nagreement reached on 16 September this year between the\nGovernment Commission and the opposition\u2019s field\ncommanders that brought peace, fragile though it may be,\nto this long-suffering land.\nThe efforts of my Government to achieve peace\nwould be even more fruitful were it not for the remaining\ntensions in neighbouring Afghanistan, where the situation\nis a humanitarian tragedy of a truly global scale. We\nwould welcome efforts by United Nations Member States\nto find new ways to settle the conflict in Afghanistan. It\nis not only our geographical neighbour but also a country\nlinked to Tajikistan by centuries-old historical and\nspiritual ties. While expressing grave concern at the latest\ndevelopments in neighbouring Afghanistan, we support\nthe steps taken by the Security Council and the General\nAssembly aimed at promoting a peaceful resolution of the\nAfghan conflict.\nThe Republic of Tajikistan, for its part, is ready to\njoin forces with other members of the international\ncommunity and contribute to this constructive process,\nwhich may have a positive influence and help stabilize\nthe situation along the Tajik-Afghan border.\nFrom this high rostrum, I cannot but express my\ngratitude to the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for its constructive\nand fruitful participation in solving a humanitarian\nproblem: that of our refugees who have found themselves\nin Afghanistan as a result of the civil war. The three-year\nUNHCR operation in Tajikistan has ended with success.\nDuring this comparatively short period of time, with\nUNHCR assistance in finding a comprehensive solution\nto this issue, most Tajik refugees have returned to their\nhomeland. With the support of UNHCR, the Government\nof Tajikistan renovated about 18,000 houses for the\nreturned refugees. Programmes are being implemented, in\ncooperation with the United Nations Development\nProgramme, to encourage the development of small\nenterprises, promoting social and economic conditions that\ncan help repatriates gradually to adapt.\n25\n\n\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and the World\nHealth Organization have made great and invaluable\ncontributions to health care and disease prevention for\nwomen and children in Tajikistan.\nAt the same time, we cannot but be concerned for the\nseveral thousand Tajik refugees still in Afghanistan. Their\nreturn to the homeland is being prevented by the armed\nopposition, which is linking their return to the resolution of\npolitical issues not directly related to this purely\nhumanitarian act. We hope that, with the international\ncommunity\u2019s assistance and the support of the States\nconcerned, a rapid and definitive solution can be found to\nthis major problem.\nIn this regard, I wish to express our support for the\ndecisions of the Conference on Refugees, Returnees,\nDisplaced Persons and Related Migratory Movements in the\nCommonwealth of Independent States and Relevant\nNeighbouring States held in Geneva in late May this year.\nIt is very important that the decisions taken at this session\nof the General Assembly support the programme of action\nadopted at the Geneva conference.\nWe are also concerned at the fact that military training\nbases of fighters belonging to the armed Tajik opposition\ncontinue to operate, without hindrance, on the territory of\nthe Islamic State of Afghanistan, itself a country that has\nbeen plagued by civil war for almost two decades.\nThis is where provocative cross-border sorties are\ncarefully planned and new victims of terror and violence,\nincluding among the civilian population, are determined.\nNor is it merely armed fighters that cross the Tajik-Afghan\nborder. Beyond Pyandzh, drug manufacturing is out of\ncontrol and drug trafficking and the sales of drugs to other\ncountries, even to other continents, are consistently on the\nrise.\nCriminal elements and groups from certain regions in\nAfghanistan illegally circulate arms, thus undermining\nTajikistan\u2019s State security. It is well known that terrorists\nof every stripe have always fed off the drug trade and\nillegal arms sales. We, like other States, are particularly\nalarmed at the close relationship between some terrorist\norganizations and the illegal drug trade.\nDrug addiction has long been one of the most terrible\nsocial scourges on Earth. In Tajikistan, which has become\none of the world\u2019s \u201chot spots\u201d in terms of the distribution\nof drugs coming from outside the country, we understand\nonly too well the danger posed by drug abuse and illegal\ntrafficking to people\u2019s lives, health, dignity and economic\nprosperity, as well as to the political stability of a State.\nThe consequences of these criminal acts can be felt\nnot just in Tajikistan or the CIS, but far beyond the\nCommonwealth borders. All this poses a real threat to\npeace and stability throughout the Central and South\nAsian region, including Afghanistan.\nThe Government of Tajikistan expresses its grave\nconcern at terrorist activity around the world. We need a\nunited front to curb the destructive wave of terror and\ndrastically intensify the common struggle to prevent\nterrorism from emerging in any form. It is particularly\nnecessary to create a reliable barrier against terrorists\u2019\nattempts to gain access to weapons of mass destruction.\nWhile unconditionally condemning all manifestations\nof terrorism, the Government of Tajikistan feels that the\ntime has come to turn anti-terrorist cooperation under the\nauspices of the United Nations to practical action. In this\nregard, we must make full use of the resources of\nregional organizations.\nDuring the half a century of its existence, the United\nNations has proved its viability; at the same time,\nhowever, it has reached the threshold of certain\nindispensable changes in its structure and activities. We\nfeel that, in today\u2019s unstable and transitional international\nconditions, the role of the United Nations should steadily\ngrow.\nIn our opinion, it is important to approach reform in\na pragmatic way, concentrate on those issues that are ripe\nfor resolution and maintain a reasonable balance between\ninnovation and those mechanisms that have proved their\nefficiency. The most important thing is to enhance\ncoordination within the framework of the United Nations;\nto focus efforts on such priorities as peacemaking,\nhumanitarian crises, human rights, sustainable\ndevelopment and support to States with transitional\neconomies; and to monitor strictly the use of limited\navailable resources.\nThe Government of Tajikistan feels that the integral\nelement in comprehensive United Nations reform is the\nquestion of the further enhancement of the role of the\nSecurity Council as the most important instrument for\nmaintaining and strengthening international peace and\nsecurity. It is also our opinion that the expansion and\nrenewal of the Council must be carried out in keeping\n26\n\n\nwith Charter criteria for Council membership and the\ncurrent status of its permanent members.\nWe think that the Security Council would be made\nmore representative by adding not only some candidates\nfrom among the industrial Powers, such as Germany and\nJapan, but also some representatives from Asian, African\nand Latin American countries. In this connection, the\nproposal made by the delegation of Italy is of great interest.\nIn the autumn of 1995, when leaving United Nations\nHeadquarters in New York, the leaders of the community\nof States once again affirmed the determination of their\nGovernments to fight for the realization of our common\nideals of peace and development, justice and sovereign\nequality and respect for human rights and basic freedoms,\nincluding the right to development. At that time, we\nadopted a historic Declaration as a commitment to the\npresent and future generations of the Earth to exert our\njoint efforts to prevent a resurgence of both cold and hot\nwars and large-scale and small-scale conflicts in our\nglobal world.\nThis is why we all have a great deal of creative\nwork ahead of us \u2014 for the sake of all mankind and for\nthe benefit of the future of our planet Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We have made progress as countries from\nvarious parts of the world have joined us in an effort to\npreserve Antarctica as the last natural heritage of mankind.\nHis country\u2019s efforts in regard to the betterment of the\nglobal community are deeply admired by my countrymen,\nand it is with a sense of genuine cordiality that we refer to\nMalaysia as a friendly and brotherly country. Permit me\nalso to extend sincere thanks to the outgoing President,\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, who so ably led\nthe historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\nOn 7 July of this year Hurricane Bertha passed\nperilously close to Antigua and Barbuda, and our twin-\nisland State sustained some damage. Small island\ndeveloping States like ours are subject to various natural\ndisasters \u2014 earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and hurricanes.\nIn 1974, we experienced an earthquake that measured 7.8\non the Richter scale and caused considerable destruction. A\nvolcano on the island of Montserrat, some 50 kilometres\nfrom our shores, has been active for the past 15 months.\nOur people live in constant fear of fall-out and tidal waves\nfrom a major eruption.\nThe natural phenomenon presently plaguing Montserrat\ncould be a prelude to a disaster that can destroy small\nislands globally. Evidence of the warming of the planet has\nclearly emerged, and extreme weather events have become\nmore frequent and intense. Last year, Hurricane Luis\nunleashed its fury on our country for 48 hours and was\ndeclared to have been the worst storm of the century.\nHurricane Marilyn followed in its wake, intensifying the\ndamage. Indeed, we remain grateful to the countries and\ninstitutions that provided various forms of assistance to\nhelp in the reconstruction.\nIn addressing the General Assembly of the\nOrganization of American States this year, our envoy\nnoted that development is not sustainable if a score of\nstorms and hurricanes are to trample through our region\neach year. Carbon dioxide emissions caused by the\nburning of petroleum, coal, wood and gas since the start\nof the Industrial Revolution in western Europe 200 years\nago have begun to place the survival of small islands in\njeopardy. Harmful production, wasteful consumption and\ndangerous disposal patterns continue to characterize the\nbehaviour of the largest industrialized States. We must\ntherefore reduce carbon dioxide emissions to the agreed\nToronto targets. Together, let us address the challenge so\nthat we may bequeath to future generations a better and\na safer world than we inherited. Our demise will only\nsignal the beginning of the end of a marvellous\ncivilization, more creative and more inventive than any\nthat has gone before.\nBetween 1 and 15 July Antigua and Barbuda played\nits part at the human settlement Conference, Habitat II, at\nIstanbul, and we urge that the Istanbul Declaration and\nPlan of Action be adhered to. It must be recognized that\nit is in the cities and towns of the new urban world,\nwhere most of us will ultimately live and work, that most\neconomic activity will take place and goods be produced.\nIt is where most pollution will be generated and national\nresources consumed, with an impact felt far beyond city\nlimits. Moreover, it will be in the cities and towns of this\nurban world that growing social tensions and conflict,\nrooted in poverty and the maldistribution of resources,\nwill be resolved, and where the key to true human\nsecurity will be found.\nThe problems of urbanization are not limited to the\nmore endowed countries. We too, despite our small size,\nhave to cope with the varying patterns and outcomes that\ndemand responses that have at times threatened to\noverwhelm us. Nevertheless, I am happy to report that in\nAntigua and Barbuda we have made considerable progress\ntowards control and adequate regulation.\n1\n\n\nUnder the guidance of the Development Control\nAuthority and the Central Housing and Planning Authority\nmajor initiatives have been undertaken, with assistance from\nthe United Nations Centre for Human Settlements and the\nUnited Nations Development Programme. The Government,\nin partnership with other sectors of society, is playing a\nmultiple role in improving living and working conditions on\nan equitable basis to enable all its citizens to enjoy\nadequate shelter, affordable basic services and sustainable\nhuman settlements.\nThe Government of Antigua and Barbuda not only\nperforms the functions of a national policy-maker and\nhousing administrator, but also serves in the capacity of\nlender and developer. In those roles, it has ensured that\ninterest rates are kept at reasonable levels and that\nrepayment periods for loans are as long as 20 years. In its\nregulatory role, the Government of the Labour Party has put\nforward development standards, stipulated building\nprocedures and integrated land and shelter policies with\nprogrammes for reducing poverty and assuring employment,\nfor environmental protection, for improvement in education\nand health, and for providing clean water and sanitation\nfacilities.\nThis is indeed a strange and puzzling world. With\nreference to sustainable development, a myth has gathered\nmomentum that maintains that the developing world is\nmaking significant forward strides. World Bank data,\nhowever, demonstrate that over 60 per cent of the countries\nin which the United Nations and other bodies have\ndevelopment assistance operations have witnessed declines\nin real per capita income over the decade ending in 1994.\nJames Gustave Speth, the Special Coordinator for\nEconomic and Social Development, in a forceful and\nmoving presentation at the opening of the 1996 substantive\nsession of the Economic and Social Council, noted two\nmajor ironies of the current situation. He declared that now\nthat the world is freed from distorting effects on\ndevelopment cooperation, just when the development\nassistance community has learned so much more about how\nto succeed and do its job well, just when the needs of the\ndeveloping world are growing rapidly and dramatically \u2014\njust at this precise time, the resources that are needed for\ndevelopment cooperation are shrinking rapidly and\ndramatically. In the past four years, real development\nassistance has declined by 20 to 25 per cent.\nThe other irony is that just when there is a better\nunderstanding of the essential links between peace and\ndevelopment cooperation, just when the United Nations is\ncalled upon to assume much greater responsibilities in the\nfollow-up to conferences and in post-conflict peace-\nbuilding and other areas, just when the United Nations is\nreforming and strengthening itself to do these things, the\nOrganization finds itself threatened by a financial crisis\nthat afflicts both its assessed and its voluntary\ncontributions. Indeed, Speth sees the above as not only\nironies, but as tragedies of our era.\nThis, the major international Organization, is\nrestructuring itself and endeavouring to undertake\nmeaningful reform. While it may be true that the existing\nfinancial crisis is primarily a crisis of payment, there is\nno denying the fact that there is unnecessary waste being\ngenerated here, whether in regard to the duplication of\nwork detail, the excessive copying of documents, the\nscheduling of numerous meetings destined to accomplish\nnothing or to a myriad of other undesirables. Financial\nconcerns are not, however, the only issue of which the\nworld body is seized. Reform is being undertaken in a\nmulti-pronged manner, which in itself will be a long\nprocess that can be justified in a Benthamite way by\nemphasizing the greatest good for the greatest number.\nAt present, even though the discussions have been\nconsidered to have made progress, there is not even the\nglimmer of a discernible outcome in regard to the\n\u201cQuestion of equitable representation on and increase in\nthe membership of the Security Council and related\nmatters\u201d. Although consensus exists on expanding the\nCouncil, the manner in which that can be achieved\nequitably remains to be resolved. Antigua and Barbuda is\nfirm in its declared position that any expansion should\ninclude developing countries and that both the African\nand the Latin American and Caribbean Groups should be\nrepresented. Similarly, Antigua and Barbuda would like\nto see certain restrictions placed on the use of the veto.\nWe understand that all efforts at restructuring and reform\nin the United Nations, however, should be focused on\neconomic growth and development.\nIn this whole process of misunderstandings, the\nregional commissions are being placed under attack\nthrough cut-backs and in some instances calls for their\ndissolution. This is particularly hard on those of us who\nare being served by the Economic Commission for Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean (ECLAC). We see ECLAC as\na regional organization that has already reformed itself\nand should not be penalized by calls for further reforms.\nECLAC has rendered valuable service through\n\n\n\nsubprogrammes on economic development, social\ndevelopment, international trade, development financing and\ntransport, industrial, agricultural, and technological\nmodernization, environment, natural resources and human\nsettlements, statistics and economic projections, the\nintegration of women into development, regional integration\nand cooperation, economic and social planning and\npopulation. In all of these fields, ECLAC collaborates with\nthe Governments of the Americas in the investigation and\nanalysis of public policy, provides technical assistance and\ntraining, and promotes regional cooperation.\nFor those of us in the Caribbean it is imperative that\nECLAC be fully sustained to continue to assist us in these\nand other areas. This is set against the backdrop of the\npressures that are being brought to bear on the Caribbean\nregion, which Prime Minister Lester Bird described at the\nmeeting of Heads of Government of the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) on 6 July. He spoke of the right-\nwing voices that are ready to impose upon the States of the\nCaribbean Community a new colonialism under a variety of\nguises, such as those of limited sovereignty and\nextraterritoriality. Indeed, the very economic survival of\nsome Caribbean States is threatened as a result of pressures\nbrought against countries whose sustenance depends almost\nentirely upon the production of a yellow fruit.\nMost of the countries affected by the banana dispute\nare former European colonies, and the continuation of their\nhistoric access to European markets is crucial to their\neconomic survival. Without some form of protection, the\nbanana industry in the CARICOM States would collapse,\nleading to severe social dislocation that would ultimately\nmanifest itself in political catastrophe.\nRecognizing the significance of banana production to\nsome of our economies, the European Union has a\nprogramme in which a small portion of its market is\nreserved for Caribbean producers, a portion that is less than\n10 per cent. This has certainly not been a major problem\nfor the big companies, for a handful of multinational\nconcerns still controls 60 per cent of the European market\nand 70 per cent of the overall market. However, it appears\nthat Bob Herbert, in an editorial of 13 May, was correct\nwhen he asserted:\n\u201cfor the multinationals, enough is never enough\u201d. (The\nNew York Times, 13 May 1996, Section A, p. 15)\nIndeed, for countries where literacy rates are in the\nninetieth percentile and where political prisoners are\nunheard of, it would be disastrous if the economies of\ntheir societies were to be destroyed through the\ndestruction of the banana industry.\nThe bleakness of the aforementioned situation is,\nhowever, offset by the ideas expressed at the Tokyo\nConference on Development Strategy in March of this\nyear, where it was posited that there is the will to sustain\na new global partnership and make it effective. There was\nconsensus that the issues that stretched beyond\nmathematical economics, that is, issues such as those\nincorporating poverty, the environment, the advancement\nof women and food security, had to be tackled at both the\nnational and international levels.\nIt was nonetheless brought out that many developed\ncountries are experiencing harsh financial difficulties that\nare imposing severe limits on their capacity to contribute\nto the international organizations. Thus, the nations of the\nworld had first to respond to the challenge of poverty by\nstriving for its eradication. Secondly, the key to success\nclearly lies in nations working together to build and\nimplement a development strategy to meet the challenges\nof the twenty-first century. Thirdly, in the process of\nworking out and implementing a new development\nstrategy, it is crucially important to reinvigorate the roles\nof the international organizations, and in particular that of\nthe United Nations.\nOf significant concern to developing countries was\nthe statement that in efforts to secure sufficient resources\nit is important to take steps in other policy areas such as\ntrade or technological transfer. In addition, the\nglobalization of the world economy makes it important to\npromote the development of human resources and the\ncapacity for institution-building in developing countries.\nIn its Human Development Report 1996, the United\nNations Development Programme acknowledged that,\nalthough some countries are experiencing unprecedented\neconomic growth, the quality of human development does\nnot always reflect that progress. While many countries of\nthe developing world are struggling with the implications\nof trade liberalization and globalization, individuals within\nthese societies are faced with a complementary struggle.\nThe sad fact is that as long as selective liberalization\nbetween countries remains, individuals within countries\nwill find it more difficult to escape the downward spiral\ninto the depths of poverty. It hardly takes a stretch of the\nimagination to recognize, therefore, that an early\ninvestment in building human capacity is incumbent upon\n3\n\n\nany society wishing to achieve economic and social\ndevelopment that is both equitable and sustainable.\nWhile it can truly be said that the 1990s signalled the\nend of the cold war and witnessed the dissolution of a\nbipolar world, the conflicts we are witnessing today are\nlocalized and appear to be gathering momentum as a result\nof ethnic, religious and civil considerations. There is clearly\nan upsurge of micronationalism, which fosters separatist\nconsiderations. There is much social disruption, mass\nstarvation and the spread of contagious diseases. Of an\nextremely frightening nature is the fact that access to\nvictims is often rendered difficult or impossible. There is\nclearly a deepening lack of security for relief personnel and\nsupplies. Clearly, there is a need for the demobilization of\nparamilitary groups, for demining and for an intensification\nof peacemaking, peacekeeping and peace-building.\nIt must be recalled that the United Nations came into\nexistence to ensure peace among nations. With that in mind,\nwe should be prepared to take steps beyond a Non-\nProliferation Treaty and a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty and move towards the elimination of weapons of\nmass destruction within a time-bound framework.\nResponses to the myriad of desperate problems have\nto be interdisciplinary in nature, for there is no single\nUnited Nations agency that can control, pacify, and\nrehabilitate effectively.\nRecognizing the dangers of increased international\ncriminal activity in the region, Antigua and Barbuda is\nworking with its neighbours and expects to receive\nadditional assistance from bilateral and multilateral sources\nto initiate a national drug and money-laundering control\npolicy. Priorities of the policy include legislative and\nregulatory reform, increased interdiction activities, technical\ntraining, preventive health and public education and\ntraining. Given its multidimensional nature, the drug\nproblem is one that the United Nations system is\nparticularly well equipped to address.\nHowever, working alone, the Organization is helpless\nto tackle this scourge that cuts across all sectors of society,\nimpacting on families, health and economic activity. There\nneeds to be greater coordination among nations if the blight\nof narcotics is to be tackled in a meaningful way. Strong\nand determined efforts within certain countries will be\nseriously undermined if there is not a united global\napproach to manifestations and practices that will destroy\nnot only the fabric of our societies but the lives of\ncountless individuals.\nThe plague of terrorism must be controlled. The\nappeals of two South Asian nations to have an\ninternational convention against terrorism must be heeded.\nOften, terrorism is linked to narcotics. Not only do the\nStates of the eastern Caribbean have fears of subversion,\nthey are also concerned by the intense violations of ports\nand harbours and the corresponding graft as their\ncountries serve as transit points.\nIn concluding, I would like to say that as the\nrepresentatives of the global community we have to live\nup to the trust placed in us by our constituencies.\nMultilateralism must be paramount as we strive toward\nways and means for better management of our planet. We\nmust agree on common values for common survival. Our\nconstituents are calling for an end to senseless violence\nand for the re-emergence of concepts of compassion and\nequity. They are asking for our dialogue to be creative\nand forward-looking.\nThe peoples of different regions must be prepared to\nmake sacrifices and to suppress the barriers that divide \u2014\nbarriers such as hatred, selfishness and bitterness. Let us\nnot forget the words of Philip Vundla, an executive of the\nAfrican National Congress, who said:\n\u201cWhat you achieve by violence, you will need\ngreater violence to maintain. Those who say the\nanswer is bloodshed have other people\u2019s blood in\nmind, not their own.\u201d\nHowever, the fundamental need in regard to\nadvancement remains that of economic reality. Michel\nCamdessus of the International Monetary Fund reminded\nthe leaders of the G-7 countries on 24 June that:\n\u201cToo many refusals to grant development assistance\nhave the alibi that such funds are wasted. This\nslippage, as well as the so-called donor fatigue, must\nbe vigorously combated if the international\ncommunity wishes to be in a position to keep the\npoorest countries from marginalization and to steer\nthe world away from the tensions and crises that\nextreme poverty cannot but engender whenever it\noccurs. Marginalization is not inevitable, and every\ncountry has its opportunity in this globalized world.\u201d\n4\n\n\nMy country recognizes the fact that we are in an era\nof unprecedented change and opportunity, a period in which\nscientific developments and technological achievements\nseem almost miraculous and offer an improved quality of\nlife. The United Nations should become embedded in\nreality and push the critical issues involving destitution and\nsocial injustice to the centre of both national and public\ndebate.\nAntigua and Barbuda takes pride in and cherishes the\nUnited Nations and we believe that it has been judged,\nunjustly, more by its failures than by its successes. But the\nwork done in regard to health, human rights, peacekeeping\nactivities, disaster mitigation and assistance to developing\ncountries presents an enviable record.\nThe United Nations has the capacity for achievements\nin areas beyond the reach of national or regional authorities.\nSubsequently, the nations that comprise this body must\nredouble their collective commitment to translating vision\ninto reality. In this way, we will thrust the United Nations\nmanfully forward into the dawning twenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAs we begin the\nsecond half of the United Nations first century, we are\npresided over by a diplomat whose distinguished career\nhas included service in four of the world\u2019s five great\nregions. He has demonstrated skill and ready humour in\nhis work as the Permanent Representative of Malaysia. I\nnote with some amazement his most recent achievement:\ngetting this Assembly to begin each meeting promptly on\nschedule. This bodes well for our efforts here.\nMr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal presided over the\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly with the intellect\nand distinction characteristic of his career as a\nparliamentarian and teacher of law. We are in his debt.\nLast year, I saluted the Secretary-General, as well as\nthe women and men of the Secretariat, the specialized\nagencies and other bodies of the United Nations for their\nextraordinary work during this difficult time in the\nOrganization\u2019s history. The Solomon Islands applauds\nthem all. It is difficult to persevere in the face of harsh\nand unjustified criticism and insufficient financial\nresources while engaged in the complex task of\nrevitalizing the United Nations to meet the needs of a\nworld in rapid transformation.\nThis morning, on behalf of the Solomon Islands, I\nsigned the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT). I was especially pleased to do so because\nnuclear-weapons testing and disarmament are critical\nissues for the people of my country. During the fiftieth\nsession of the General Assembly, the Solomon Islands\nworked with its sister States of the South Pacific Forum\nand the Pacific basin for the adoption of resolution 50/70\nA on nuclear testing. Noting the international alarm over\nrecent nuclear tests and the potential negative effects of\nunderground nuclear testing on health and the\nenvironment, the General Assembly deplored all nuclear\ntesting and called for its immediate cessation.\n4\n\n\nThe islands and atolls of the Pacific Ocean were the\nsites of nuclear tests for 50 years. Peoples were displaced\nand fragile environments destroyed. We welcome the end\nof the nuclear-weapons tests, but when will the States who\nconducted them accept their responsibility for providing\nlong-term damage assessments and aid for resettlement and\nthe restoration of economic productivity?\nSolomon Islands also welcomes the signature of\nTonga, as well as the signature and ratification by the\nRepublic of Vanuatu, of the South Pacific Nuclear Free\nZone Treaty and the signing of its Protocols by France, the\nUnited Kingdom and the United States of America.\nLast November, the judges of the International Court\nof Justice heard two weeks of argument to assist them in\nrendering the Advisory Opinion requested by the General\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session on the question: Is the\nthreat or use of nuclear weapons in any circumstances\npermitted under international law? The Solomon Islands\nworked closely with the Marshall Islands and Western\nSamoa in developing and presenting to the Court, in\ncooperation with other States, the case that the use of even\nthe smallest nuclear weapon would violate international\nlaw, particularly humanitarian law. The landmark Opinion\nrendered by the Court on 8 July largely supported our\nposition. Regrettably, the nuclear Powers that argued\nagainst us at the International Court of Justice see it\notherwise. We look forward to the debate on the Advisory\nOpinion, which is on the agenda thanks to the initiative of\nMalaysia.\nThe indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the creation of\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zones in Africa and South-East Asia,\nthe finding of the International Court of Justice, the General\nAssembly\u2019s adoption of the CTBT \u2014 whatever its\nshortcomings \u2014 and the report of the Canberra\nCommission indicate that a momentum exists for\nestablishing targets and timetables for the elimination of all\nnuclear weapons. Although the majority of States support\nthis, such States have no forum in which they can develop\ntheir ideas and formulate a strategy. Solomon Islands\nproposes the creation of a forum of non-nuclear-weapon\nStates. Committed to the elimination of nuclear weapons,\nthe forum would seek agreement on a unified approach to\nthe full implementation of article VI of the NPT and\nmonitor progress towards that end. Moreover, the forum\nwould work to give effect to arrangements such as the\nsouthern hemisphere nuclear-weapon-free zone and linked\nregional nuclear-weapon-free zones that could evolve into\na global nuclear-weapon-free system.\nSolomon Islands endorses the statement made here\nlast week by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\nMarshall Islands on behalf of the South Pacific Forum.\nSolomon Islands, a member of the South Pacific Forum\nministerial committee on New Caledonia, welcomes the\nprogress facilitated by France and the relevant parties in\nimplementing the Matignon Accords.\nFor the small island States of the Pacific, the\nenvironment, development and international trade are\nmatters of critical concern. The development of\ncomprehensive arrangements for the sustainable\nmanagement of our region\u2019s fisheries is urgently needed.\nSolomon Islands will soon sign and ratify the Agreement\nfor the Implementation of the Provisions of the\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982\nrelating to the Conservation and Management of\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.\nThe special session of the General Assembly to be\nconvened in 1997 to review Agenda 21 is also of great\nimportance to Solomon Islands. We seek practical ways\nto improve ongoing regional efforts to meet the Agenda\u2019s\ngoals.\nThe second assessment report of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a call to\nthe international community to speed up negotiations,\nrecognizing that such a global problem demands a\ncollective solution. Solomon Islands continues to support\nthe Alliance of Small Island States Protocol to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. If\nlower greenhouse gas emissions are not achieved soon,\nthe very survival of small island developing States will be\nthreatened. Moreover, the sustainable management and\nconservation of our forests are essential for the biological\ndiversity and economy of the country.\nIn the Pacific, where healthy coral reefs are essential\nfor effective coastal zone management, we are\ncollaborating in the international coral reef initiative and\nwill take part in our region\u2019s Year of the Coral Reef in\n1997. As valuable as these efforts are, what remains to be\ndone is formidable. The recent report to the United\nNations Commission on Sustainable Development on\nactivities to implement the Barbados Programme of\nAction in the Pacific region shows the range and\nmagnitude of the problems the citizens of the small island\ndeveloping States face.\nThe future of the Solomon Islands must depend on\na people-centred development strategy that uses a bottom-\n5\n\n\nup and top-down process of decision-making. With a\npopulation of fewer than 400,000 people of diverse ethnic\nand linguistic origins, 80 per cent of whom live in rural\nsettings on hundreds of islands arrayed over 1,600\nkilometres of ocean, no other system is workable. A major\nchange in our system of provincial government is designed\nto maximize rural community participation in planning and\ndecision-making. Overseas development assistance could,\ntherefore, be directed to where it is most needed. We are\nfostering public health, literacy and electrification. That is\nwhy the recent completion of our first solar-powered village\nis important for us. In implementing the Habitat Agenda,\nwe are encouraging self-reliance in village development.\nSolar and other renewable energy resources, such as water\nand wind, will further our economic, education and health\ndevelopment plans.\nSeveral weeks ago, the Internet reached the Solomon\nIslands. Personal computers in a growing number of our\nsecondary schools and the possibility of lap-top computers\nin the hands of teachers and students give new hope for my\ncountry\u2019s future. We are now using the World Wide Web\nto introduce the country to potential investors and tourists.\nPeace in our region is essential for sustainable\ndevelopment. Solomon Islands encourages the efforts of\nPapua New Guinea to resolve its Bougainville crisis\nthrough constructive dialogue with all the parties concerned.\nThe confidence-building measures have reduced the tension\nacross the border between Papua New Guinea and Solomon\nIslands.\nSolomon Islands, which patiently follows the debates\non reforming the United Nations, recognizes the difficulties\ninherent in making the Organization more effective. We\nsupport an increase in the non-permanent membership of\nthe Security Council on a regional basis and thank Italy for\nits valuable proposal. If the number of permanent members\nis also to be enlarged, the responsibilities of permanent\nmembership and the criteria for the use of the veto must be\nestablished and made transparent.\nThe fiftieth anniversary Declaration called for the\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly, the\nuniversal organ of the States Members of the United\nNations. Proposals have been put forward and debated.\nCalls for reducing the length of the agenda continue to echo\nthrough these halls. Yet, in the past few weeks, we have\nseen how vital the General Assembly can become when a\ndelegation skilfully and vigorously presses forward with a\ngreat issue and effectively marshals the support of many\nMember States. I refer to the extraordinary work of\nAmbassador Richard Butler and his Australian colleagues\nin mobilizing overwhelming support for the adoption of\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\nWhen the will and commitment are present, the General\nAssembly can act with brilliant effectiveness, winning the\napplause of a world hungry for security, peace and\nprosperity.\nSuch an achievement need not be rare. As the\nuniversal organ of the Member States, the General\nAssembly should be a force for democracy, transparency\nand universality. For example, the Charter permits the\nGeneral Assembly a much larger role in the selection of\nthe Secretary-General than it has exercised in the past.\nConfronted as we are with public action in this matter by\none of the great Powers, should we not now seek to make\nthe process truly democratic and open? Can we afford to\nleave this essential issue to last-minute bargaining behind\nclosed doors? Twenty-five years ago, the General\nAssembly at its twenty-sixth session adopted resolution\n2837 (XXVI), which recognized the unquestionable value\nof the general debate and said that it should continue to\nbe held every year and that the time devoted to it should\nbe utilized to the maximum.\nThe general debate offers a glimpse of how Member\nStates see the state of the world and the United Nations.\nListening to the statements in this great Hall, one is\nstruck by the spectrum of ideas and opinions they present.\nDiscussion would enhance their value for us, but we have\nnot established appropriate venues at which the views\noffered here could be thoroughly explored. Can we afford\nto deny ourselves the benefit of engaging our colleagues\nintellectually?\nTo move the General Assembly towards universality,\nSolomon Islands believes that substantially reducing the\nfloor rate in the scale of assessments, as has been\nproposed, would not only enable several countries in our\nregion to seek membership of the United Nations but\nwould help many developing countries to pay their annual\nassessments in full and on time.\nTwo themes have clearly emerged in our general\ndebate: Whatever its weaknesses, the United Nations is\nindispensable; but without sufficient resources and a\ndecisive commitment to true multilateralism, the\nOrganization cannot fulfil its obligations to the peoples of\nthe world. Solomon Islands and the other small island\ndeveloping States need this Organization. Whether the\nissue is investment, law enforcement, trade embargoes,\nfishing rights, hazardous waste dumping, natural disasters,\n6\n\n\nautonomy, independence or any combination of these, the\npeople of the small islands turn to the United Nations for\nsupport.\nWe and others spoke out on behalf of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan, which, barred from the United Nations\nand seeking unification with the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina, is attempting to enlarge its contribution to the\ndeveloping world through this Organization. Solomon\nIslands hopes that unification negotiations based on the\nproposals each party has put forward can begin in the near\nfuture.\nThe United Nations is dealing with important issues:\nthe Agenda for Development, the programmes of action\napproved at the world conferences, technical assistance, the\nSecretary-General\u2019s preventive diplomacy, the evolving\ninternational system for protecting human rights. In this\nrespect Solomon Islands especially thanks the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross for its efforts to rid the world\nof anti-personnel landmines and for its work caring for the\ndisplaced and searching for missing persons, including\nKuwaitis and Greek Cypriots who have still not been heard\nfrom, and many other people who have \u201cdisappeared\u201d.\nThese are life and death matters even for those of us\nwho live on distant islands. Through a commitment to\nequity, democracy and tolerance based on multilateralism\nand universality, an effective United Nations will serve us\nall for generations to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to begin by\nextending to you, Sir, my warmest congratulations on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly. We are\ncertain that your long experience, outstanding ability and\ndiplomatic skill will guide us successfully in our work at\nthis fifty-first session of the General Assembly. Allow me\nalso to thank your predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas\ndo Amaral, for his untiring efforts during the previous\nsession.\nAt last year\u2019s session, which marked the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, we reflected on the birth\nof the United Nations, assessed its development and\ninfluence on international relations to date, paid tribute to\nits achievements and identified some of its difficulties. At\nthe same time, we acknowledged that our main\nresponsibility for the future of the Organization is to\ninsure that it has the ability to address most effectively\nthe agenda of the twenty-first century.\nIn the Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth\nAnniversary of the United Nations, we agreed that\n\u201cIn order to be able to respond effectively to\nthe challenges of the future and the expectations of\nthe United Nations held by peoples around the\nworld, it is essential that the United Nations itself be\nreformed and modernized.\u201d (resolution 50/6,\npara. 14)\nNow, as we begin the fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly, we should take stock of what we have\nbeen able to accomplish and redirect our efforts to what\nremains to be achieved.\nIn 1996, we have continued our work towards the\ninstitutional and financial reforms needed to make the\nUnited Nations a more productive and dynamic institution\nso that it will be better able to perform its key functions\nand fulfil its mandates more effectively. In this regard, the\nfundamental priority must be to ensure that the financing\nof our Organization is placed on a firm and lasting base.\nMay I recall in this context that the Government of\nthe Republic of Cyprus is voluntarily contributing one\nthird of the total cost of the United Nations Peace-keeping\nForce in Cyprus and, in addition, has increased by one\n\nthird its contribution to United Nations peace-keeping\noperations in general.\nDuring 1996, various high-level working groups of the\nGeneral Assembly have continued their efforts on the\ninstitutional and financial reforms of the United Nations. I\nwould like to reiterate that we consider the work of these\nworking groups, covering a very broad spectrum of issues,\nto be extremely important. Such issues, ranging from the\nstrengthening of the main United Nations organs to the\nfurther development of an Agenda for Peace and an Agenda\nfor Development, deserve deep and profound priority\nconsideration.\nWe subscribe to the need to reform the Security\nCouncil, to expand it and strengthen its capacity to\ndischarge the duties assigned to it by the Charter for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. As for the\nreform of its working methods, we recognize, that although\nsignificant efforts have been made over the past two years\nto ensure greater transparency and broader consultations\nwith non-members, more remains to be done. A good\nprecedent has been established with the holding of briefings\nand regular consultations, including those with countries\nthat contribute troops to United Nations peacekeeping\noperations.\nThe reports of the working groups of the General\nAssembly and the proposals from Member States that we\nhave before us provide a good basis for further work. We\nall understand and accept the need to reform and revitalize\nour Organization. Our responsibility, then, is quite clear:\nLet us make even more vigorous efforts and display the\ncourage and political will required to reach a successful\nconclusion on these issues.\nThis year\u2019s international conferences \u2014 HABITAT II,\nthe World Food Summit and the United Nations Conference\non Trade and Development \u2014 have marked the completion\nof a comprehensive series of United Nations-sponsored\nconferences which covered the full range of civil, political,\neconomic and social issues that affect the peoples of the\nworld. We attach great importance to the successful\nfollow-up to United Nations-sponsored conferences and\ntheir impact on those areas of the world where the lack of\neconomic and social development often contributes to\nconflict. In this respect, we welcome next year\u2019s General\nAssembly special session, which will be devoted to the\nassessment and review of Agenda 21 and of the results of\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment. It will be a unique opportunity to take stock\nof what we have done so far to implement the\nrecommendations agreed upon in that all-important\nConference.\nAn area of particular concern in today\u2019s world is the\npersistent violation of human rights. The human rights\nagenda has for many years been dominated by efforts to\nestablish international standards. Our duty must be to\nimplement these standards unequivocally and to take a\nfirm stand against all forms of human rights violations in\nall cases. The full implementation of the commitments\nentered into will encourage those around the world who\nbelieve in the promise of the United Nations to help\nrestore and keep the peace, to promote respect for human\nrights, to expand and broaden social progress, and to help\nthose in urgent need. My country is fully committed to\nthe universal application and promotion of these\nprinciples.\nAnother area of particular concern to Member States\nis arms control and disarmament. Under the auspices of\nthe United Nations, the nuclear non-proliferation regime\nhas been further strengthened by the indefinite extension\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons. We warmly welcome the adoption by the\nGeneral Assembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty. This represents the international community\u2019s\ndetermination to bring to completion one of the most\nsought-after nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament\nmeasures in the history of the United Nations. But the\nTreaty is not the end of the process. There is need for\nfurther systematic and progressive effort in order to\nachieve our ultimate goal of the elimination of nuclear\nweapons and of general and complete disarmament under\nstrict and effective international control.\nAnother important development in the field of\ndisarmament and arms control is progress achieved\ntowards the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons\nConvention. Cyprus is in the final stages of ratifying this\nConvention. It is our hope that it will soon enter into\nforce. While recognizing that much more needs to be\ndone in the realm of conventional weapons, we are\nencouraged by the progress made during the review of the\nConvention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of\nCertain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed\nto Be Excessively Injurious or To Have Indiscriminate\nEffects and the agreement on Guidelines for international\narms transfers at this year\u2019s United Nations Disarmament\nCommission\u2019s session.\nWe fully share the view espoused by many that arms\ncontrol and disarmament are and will continue to be\n2\n\n\nessential components of international security, contributing\nto confidence-building and conflict resolution. It is in this\nspirit that we proposed, as part of a comprehensive solution\nto the Cyprus problem, the complete demilitarization of the\nRepublic of Cyprus, in which we have offered to disband\nthe National Guard of Cyprus and hand over all weapons to\nan international force in exchange for the complete\nwithdrawal of all foreign troops, as demanded by the\nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\nThis body is familiar with the Secretary-General\u2019s\nreport which characterizes the northern occupied part of\nCyprus as one of the most densely militarized areas in the\nworld. The presence of 35,000 Turkish troops and hundreds\nof tanks and other armaments constitutes a clear and\npresent danger to peace and security in Cyprus and in the\nregion. Recent events in Cyprus have highlighted this clear\ndanger as well as the urgent need to implement our\ndemilitarization proposal. This year\u2019s twenty-second\nanniversary of the invasion and occupation of substantial\nterritory of the Republic of Cyprus by Turkish forces was\nmarked by the brutal killings of two Greek-Cypriot\nunarmed demonstrators, witnessed on television screens by\nthe entire world, and the wounding of many others,\nincluding two United Nations peace-keepers, by the Turkish\noccupation troops and Turkish extremists imported from\nmainland Turkey to the occupied part of the island.\nTwo United Nations reports on these tragic incidents\nstate clearly that the responsibility lies with Turkey and the\nillegal Turkish-Cypriot regime, which used excessive and\nunwarranted force against unarmed demonstrators who were\nsimply trying to remind the world that for 22 years Cyprus\nhas remained a divided country whose people are still\nprevented by the Turkish occupation forces from returning\nto their homes and lands and from moving freely in their\ncountry. Furthermore, it has by now become abundantly\nclear that the Turkish action was orchestrated well in\nadvance and involved the import from Turkey of 3,000\nterrorists belonging to the Gray Wolves organization with\nthe goal of provoking bloody confrontation between Greek\nand Turkish Cypriots. This sinister plan was aimed at\ndemonstrating that the two communities cannot live\npeacefully together in Cyprus and therefore separatist and\npartitionist solutions should be sought.\nWhile we mourn and condemn the brutal murder of\nthe two unarmed Greek Cypriot protesters, we also feel\nsorry for the subsequent killing of a Turkish soldier and the\nwounding of another. We regret the haste with which the\nTurkish Cypriot leader, Mr. Denktas\u00b8, attempted to attribute\nresponsibility for this killing to the Greek Cypriot side\nbefore an independent United Nations investigation\npublished its findings. The recent tragic events, however,\nwill not cause us to waver from our commitment to seek\na peaceful solution of the Cyprus problem through\nnegotiations, as provided by the United Nations\nresolutions. These events only highlight the need to\nexpedite and increase efforts to find a just, lasting and\nworkable solution to the Cyprus problem.\nWe are encouraged by the rekindled interest and\nmore active engagement of the international community\nin the Cyprus problem, as witnessed by the appointments\nof Special Representatives from interested countries,\nincluding the appointment of the Secretary-General\u2019s\nSpecial Representative, Mr. Han Sung-Joo. We welcome\nall initiatives set out to reinforce the United Nations in\nthe search for a just and viable solution to the Cyprus\nquestion.\nVarious United Nations resolutions, and the United\nNations Secretary-General himself, have declared the\npresent status quo in Cyprus unacceptable, a view shared\nby the international community. The time has come to\nmake a further determined and sustained effort to solve\nthe Cyprus problem. To that end, the Government of the\nRepublic of Cyprus will be working earnestly and\nimaginatively with the United Nations Special\nRepresentative and with all others supporting its efforts to\nprepare the ground for negotiations on the main\noutstanding issues.\nAny settlement of the Cyprus problem should be\nbased on a State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty, an\ninternational personality and a single citizenship. Its\nindependence and territorial integrity must be safeguarded,\nand it must be composed of two politically equal\ncommunities, as described in the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions, in a bicommunal and bi-zonal\nfederation. Such settlement must exclude union, in whole\nor in part, with any other country or any form of partition\nor secession.\nThe security of both communities is a crucial issue,\nwhich would be helpful in finding a solution. It will be\nnecessary to devise effective guarantees; demilitarization\nand the stationing in Cyprus of an international force will\nalso be required. Demilitarization represents an important\ncontribution to this settlement.\nWe are prepared to embark on face-to-face\nnegotiations in 1997 once the ground has been sufficiently\nprepared to ensure success. We are not, however, willing,\n3\n\n\nafter 22 years of negotiations that have yielded no results\non the main issues of the problem, to embark on another\nround of fruitless talks. On the one hand, they destroy the\ncredibility of the negotiating process, and on the other, they\nkeep the attention of the international community focused\non the intercommunal constitutional aspect of the problem,\nthus overshadowing the real issue \u2014 the invasion and\ncontinued occupation, for 22 years, of substantial territory\nof the Republic of Cyprus by the Turkish forces.\nWe, for our part, will continue to do everything in our\npower to help the Secretary-General of our Organization to\nsucceed in his renewed efforts, through his newly appointed\nSpecial Representative, in the search for a lasting solution\nto the Cyprus problem.\nAt the same time the Government of the Republic of\nCyprus will pursue its application for membership in the\nEuropean Union, because such membership will have\nbenefits for both communities. While we hope to keep\naccession negotiations to the timetable already foreseen, we\nearnestly desire to reach a solution to our problem before\naccession.\nAt the beginning of my statement, I spoke of the need\nto reform and strengthen our Organization. From this\nrostrum, I have repeatedly underlined the importance of\nhonouring the commitments we enter into and of\nimplementing the decisions we take. I have stressed how\nessential it is to uphold the principles of the United Nations\nCharter and to hold to full account those who violate them.\nThe question of Cyprus continues to be such a case of\naccountability, due to the refusal of Turkey to implement\nsolemn Security Council and General Assembly resolutions\ncalling for, among other things, the respect of the\nsovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of\nthe Republic of Cyprus, the withdrawal of all foreign\ntroops, the return of the refugees to their homes and lands,\nthe respect of the demographic composition of the Republic\nand the restoration of the basic human rights and\nfundamental freedoms of the people of Cyprus. In fact, not\nonly has Turkey not implemented these resolutions, but it\nhas grossly violated them. Even the immense humanitarian\nproblem of the missing persons remains unresolved,\nperpetuating the tragedy of their relatives. All efforts should\ntherefore be exerted by the Security Council, and by all\nthose in a position to do so, to bring about a real change in\nTurkey\u2019s attitude.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations has\nhighlighted the need to maintain and reinforce our faith and\nthat of future generations in our Organization.\nImplementation of United Nations decisions will go a\nlong way towards achieving this lofty goal.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe delegation of the Republic of the Congo\nwishes to express to the President its warmest\ncongratulations on his election to lead the fifty-first session\nof the General Assembly.\nMy country is particularly pleased by this choice, as\nit attests to the international community\u2019s recognition of the\nconstant and active commitment of his country to ensuring\nthe triumph of the ideals of peace sought by the United\nNations. I have no doubt that under his guidance this\nsession will help humankind take new strides towards peace\nand progress.\nTo his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas\ndo Amaral, I would like to express our great appreciation\nfor all he did in spite of the trying international conditions,\nwhich were continually complicated by human actions.\nFinally, from this rostrum, my delegation wishes to\nwelcome the tremendous efforts of the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali over the past five years. All his\nwork has contributed greatly to the specific efforts of\nMember States to ensure that our universal institution is\nbetter able to meet the many challenges of our times and\nmore likely to avail itself of the many opportunities of the\ncoming century to ensure that humanity will prosper.\nThe idea of humankind prospering leads me to wonder\nwhether such a phenomenon can become universal at a time\nwhen, despite the efforts of the United Nations there are so\nmany differences between nations around the world, so\nmany contradictions and conflicting interests between rich\nand poor countries and, in Africa in particular, between\nthose who wield political power and those who seek it,\nfrequently using armed force.\nHowever, it must be emphasized that far from being\nthe by-product of a sombre period in the history of\nhumankind, the United Nations remains after more than half\na century, the best instrument for achieving and\nconsolidating peace, for the progress of humankind and for\npreserving diversity around the globe. It also remains a\nplace of legal equality between nations and a crucible of\nthe ideals of humanism in which the interests and the\ndestinies of all continents and all peoples should be fused\nbut not confused.\nThis being said, the vision of the founding fathers of\nthe United Nations is yet to become a reality. This is\npossible only if Member States are truly committed to\nstriving for such ideals. Is it Utopian for the increasingly\nfragile nations to do this when they are trying to find\ntheir own equilibrium? Unfortunately, it is very tempting\nto say yes, as our world is increasingly divided between\nthose who have knowledge and wealth and those who are\nsinking in ignorance, disease, war and poverty.\nIn saying this to this Assembly, I, who come from\na continent on the brink of oblivion, am not telling\nanyone anything new. I beg the Assembly\u2019s indulgence to\nrepeat the same prayer, the same cry of distress, already\nvoiced here, now and in the past, by our eminent\npredecessors.\nThey have said many times, more eloquently than I\ncan, that Africa, 51 years later, is an ailing continent at\nwhose bedside the commonly held notion of international\nsolidarity should be translated into resolutions and quickly\nfollowed by actions. The wealthiest countries will then\nhave helped thousands of human beings to join the\nmodern era through scientific and technological progress.\nThis is a major challenge that calls for foresight,\nhumanism and the mobilization of the richest countries if\nour world is to be in a better position to deal peacefully\nwith the stakes of the future in the North and the South.\nIn this connection, the process of the democratization\nand economic integration of Africa should be further\nencouraged and supported by the international community.\nThis is the basis for liberating all the creative African\nforces that used to be held in check by dictatorial regimes\nthat were not well disposed to fostering intellectual\ndevelopment.\nThe end of dictatorial regimes in certain African\ncountries and the spread of the democratization process in\nAfrica does not automatically mean the establishment of\ntruly democratic institutions, as the democrats in countries\nwith democratic systems may have wished.\nCaught between seeking its future and reconciling\nthe present with its past, Africa must, with universal\nsupport, find modern institutional means of curbing the\npolitical tension that frequently results from tribalistic or\n13\n\n\nclannish view of power, which in turn results in the civil\nwars that so hamper the continent in its march towards\npeace.\nSeen in this way, democratic pluralism should be a\nmeasure of our march towards progress and, at this stage,\nmake peace the stabilizing and constant factor of\ndemocratic institutions. It should also, and above all, ensure\nthat peace is a decisive factor in human development in\nAfrica.\nOur continent can no longer take democracy to mean\nthe mechanical imposition of some model of democratic\ninstitutions while forgetting our historical baggage or giving\nin to the temptation to undo with the stroke of a pen the\nbases of our social and cultural values.\nIt was by seeking a true balance between peace and\ndemocratic institutions that the President of the Republic of\nthe Congo was able to restore peace in our country after\ntwo years of civil war, following the democratic elections\nthat brought him to power. By this same philosophy, having\nintegrated members of the major opposing political party\ninto the Government of the Republic, Mr. Pascal Lissouba\nsupports the idea of a necessary period of democratic\ntransition. This period is one of adapting the various\npolitical actors to the needs of the democratic regime,\nparticularly to the principle of political change-over with\nthe preservation of our values based upon sharing, solidarity\nand respect for authority.\nWe are convinced that an approach based on the\nconcept of participatory democracy will make it possible to\nreduce the sources of conflict between those who have been\nelected by the people and those who have lost in\ndemocratic elections without affecting in the least the rules\nof the democratic regime, particularly the principles of\nequality, liberty and the right of the people to choose their\nmain leaders.\nWe think that African democracy, freed from the\ndangers of political individualism, the temptations of power\nfor oneself and the torments of tribalism, even with the\nlegacy of political systems of the past, can become a factor\nfor pacification, a fairer distribution of the fruits of\ncollective efforts and social and economic progress.\nIn this vision, the present weakness of our political\nsystems can be regarded as a phase in the democratic\ntransition to a modern developed Africa only if the\ninternational community fully realizes that democracy\ncannot prosper in poor countries, where politics were for so\nlong the road to social success, without exposing our\ncitizens to the political games of those for whom the\nadvent of democracy and its attendant competitive\nelections mean the end of the eminent position they enjoy\nin society thanks to the exercise of political power. The\nvarious civil wars that repeatedly cast a shadow over our\ncontinent are sad testimony to this reality.\nTherefore, assistance to promote economic\ndevelopment in African countries that are committed to\nthe democratization of their institutions will result in the\nemergence of new political classes that are protected from\nneed and that will be more likely to regard politics as a\nmeans of governing a community of men and women\nwho are bound by a territory and a common destiny than\nas the only means to get ahead in an economically poor\nenvironment.\nAs the Assembly can imagine, the economic\ndevelopment of Africa is a decisive factor for stability,\ndevelopment, pacification and democratization. The\ncurrent world economic situation is clear evidence that\nglobalization is inevitable. However, globalization could\nalso have serious drawbacks if measures are not adopted\nto rectify fundamental imbalances. Increased competition\nmeans poor countries, particularly those in the sub-\nSaharan region, will risk losing more market shares and\nwill be increasingly marginalized.\nIf it is first and foremost up to the African countries\nto demonstrate that their marginalization is determined\nonly by fate and that their current situation is merely one\nof those tragic aftermaths with which history has\nfrequently sprinkled the course of human events, then it\nis also up to the international community as a whole, in\nactive solidarity, to make a special commitment to\nsupporting the efforts of the African countries to deal\nwith the challenges before them.\nThis is why I must emphasize the role of\ninternational cooperation and, particularly, the importance\nof official development assistance for our countries. This\nassistance, important in principle, should be enhanced\nwith action, in accordance with commitments that were\nentered into, in order to meet the needs of the poorest\npopulations and to make Governments better able to meet\ntheir obligations. Unfortunately, the decrease in such aid\nruns counter to this view.\nMy country is pleased to note the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Special Initiative to help Africa, which\nreinforces the United Nations New Agenda for the\n14\n\n\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. The mid-term review\nfalls far short of our expectations, however. The Congo\nsupports the recommendations emerging from that\nassessment and hopes that the international community will\ndo its utmost to respect its commitments towards Africa.\nEarlier I mentioned the tragedies of the African\npeoples caused by civil war. My country, the Congo, which\nsince March 1995 has presided over the Standing Advisory\nCommittee of the United Nations on Security Questions in\nCentral Africa, would like to say how pleased it is to note\nthat in Angola, as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the\nparties are endeavouring to implement the peace agreements\nand are thus enjoying the support of the international\ncommunity. We must welcome the efforts of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) to settle the\nLiberian conflict, and we are pleased to note the signing of\nthe new peace Agreement, which, in the light of current\npolitical developments in that country, gives us reasons for\nhope.\nHowever, we are deeply concerned by the situation in\nsome other parts of the world. The recent, spiralling acts of\nviolence in the Middle East and the number of civilian\ncasualties have weighed heavily on the peace process. The\nRepublic of the Congo emphasizes the importance of an\nearly resumption of dialogue, with a view to continuing the\npeace process in the Middle East.\nThe Republic of the Congo welcomes progress in\nnuclear disarmament, particularly the opening for signature\nlast 24 September of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT). This historic act strengthens the extension\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) and will promote international relations based upon\npeaceful coexistence and trust between States. This is the\ncourse of action chosen by African countries in the\nPelindaba Treaty, which makes Africa a nuclear-free zone.\nWe must express our deep concern over the situations\nin Africa in which peace is threatened daily, both within\nnational borders and between States. By establishing the\nUnited Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security\nQuestions in Central Africa, the General Assembly has\nestablished a cooperative framework that will enable\n11 States from Central Africa to engage in dialogue in\norder to build confidence among themselves and establish\ntheir own machinery to facilitate the prevention,\nmanagement and settlement of conflicts in the subregion.\nThe first summit of the Heads of State and Government,\nheld on 8 July 1996 in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, led to the\nsigning of a non-aggression pact.\nWe want to express our sincere thanks to the\ncountries, particularly Japan, that have contributed to the\nspecial trust fund to implement the Committee\u2019s\nprogramme. That fund made it possible to hold in\nYaound\u00e9, under the auspices of the United Nations, a\nseminar for training specialized units of peace operations.\nI would also like to express the Committee\u2019s thanks\nto President Julius Nyerere for his role in finding a\npeaceful solution to the Burundi crisis. The Government\nof the Congo calls upon all parties to the conflict in\nBurundi, a fraternal country and a member of the\nAdvisory Committee, to regain control of the situation\nand to create through dialogue conditions for a return to\npeace and national reconciliation.\nBefore concluding, I would like to mention some\nrecent developments in the economic and political\nsituation in my country. Since the National Forum for the\nCulture of Peace organized with the support of United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO) in Brazzaville in December 1995 and the\nsigning of a peace pact among the various political\nparties, we are more than ever determined to address the\nmost crucial issues before our country, namely,\nconsolidating peace and combating poverty.\nAt the initiative of His Excellency President Pascal\nLissouba, all the Congolese political forces have signed\na framework agreement on census-taking with a view to\nprepare the second presidential election of our democratic\nera. The recently appointed Government is endeavouring\nto organize these elections in transparency, peace and\nrespect for deadlines. In order to meet its commitments\nthe Government of Congo will be able to count on the\nUnited Nations, friendly countries and all those who\npromote the consolidation of democracy in Africa.\nThe signing on 20 June of a strengthened structural\nadjustment mechanism with the International Monetary\nFund ensures that our people will support an economic\nand social recovery programme despite the many\nsacrifices it will entail. These efforts will be pursued with\nthe same commitment in the hope that our country will\nreceive the support of the international community at the\nround table of donor countries to be held at Geneva in\nNovember.\nCongo, freed from the burdens that have delayed its\ndevelopment for so long and mortgaged its future, will\nfinally be able to offer its people the peace and progress\nfor which they have been waiting so long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by conveying to the President my\nwarmest congratulations on his election as President of\nthis session of the General Assembly, which is\n12\n\n\nrecognition, not just of his personal qualities, but also of the\nleading role Malaysia is called on to play in a part of the\nworld that is characterized by the rapid pace of its\neconomic development and where we are engaging in joint\nefforts as members of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\nCouncil.\nMy country wishes to express its recognition of the\nspirit of rationality and moderation that has marked the way\nin which the President has discharged his duties in this\nperiod of restructuring as part of the complex task of\nmaintaining peace as the essential prerequisite for ensuring\na more just world free from discrimination of any kind and\naberrant xenophobia. As this is the moment of truth for the\nUnited Nations, we wish to express our hope that the work\nhe has done in guiding this Organization so far will\ncontinue so as to consolidate the restructuring process.\nIn the face of the two options that exist for resolving\nthe constant and recurrent crises that afflict the world \u2014\nlaw and justice on the one hand, force and violence on the\nother \u2014 Mexico has always opted for the former.\nWe are here not to engage in a mere ritual act, but to\nreiterate our full commitment to this common effort that we\ninitiated half a century ago. This commitment has to be\nrenewed every day, because peace and security are not free\ngifts bestowed once and for all, but values that have to be\nconquered and maintained from day to day.\nA year ago, the world\u2019s leaders came together in this\nforum to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of our\nOrganization. They reaffirmed the validity of the principles\nand purposes embodied in the Charter of the United Nations\nand agreed on new parameters for our collective activity.\nThe complex effort made in 1996 to ensure a proper\nfollow-up to them must continue to be our target for the\ncoming year.\nAlthough not with the forcefulness and clarity that\nwould be justified by current law and demanded by the\ninternational community, the International Court of Justice\nrecognized, in an Advisory Opinion of July this year, that\nthe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons run counter to\ninternational law. The Court also emphasized that\n\u201cthere exists an obligation on all States to pursue in\ngood faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations\nleading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under\nstrict and effective international control.\u201d\nThe General Assembly must give immediate effect to this\nby urging the initiation of negotiations on the subject in\nthe Conference on Disarmament.\nWhile we welcome this ruling, we do not agree with\nanother assertion of the Court within the Opinion that the\nthreat or use of nuclear weapons could be legal in the\nextreme circumstance of self-defence.\nThe Treaty of Tlatelolco, which Mexico promoted\nand for which it acts as depositary, was the first legal\ninstrument specifically to establish a nuclear-weapon-free\nzone in a densely populated region. Mexico will continue\nto encourage the strengthening of the regime established\nby this Treaty, which has undoubtedly served as a\nprecedent for other treaties establishing nuclear-weapon-\nfree zones throughout the world.\nMexico welcomes the recent addition of the new\nSouth-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone to those\nalready existing in the South Pacific and in Africa. We\nhope that we shall soon be able to add another nuclear-\nweapon-free zone in the Middle East, which would\nundoubtedly help to promote d\u00e9tente in that area. We\nfirmly support Brazil\u2019s initiative to proclaim the southern\nhemisphere of our planet a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\nOn 24 September, just a few days ago, Mexico\nsigned the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT). Despite the fact that its structure is not entirely\nsatisfactory, particularly with respect to its entry into\nforce, we signed it because we believe that it is a vital\nstep in a programme of action for the complete\nelimination of nuclear weapons, the ultimate objective of\nour efforts in this connection. Mexico and 27 other\ncountries members of the Conference on Disarmament\nhave already submitted a draft programme that we hope\ncan be considered as soon as possible. If we make enough\nprogress in this direction, it might even be possible to\novercome one of the main obstacles to the entry into\nforce of the CTBT, which is currently being hindered by\nthose obstacles mentioned earlier. Meanwhile, until the\nTreaty \u2014 on which we worked for almost two years of\nnegotiations \u2014 comes into force, we urge all countries to\nguide their actions in accordance with its text, even before\nits formal entry into force.\nIt is a matter of great concern that the two Powers\nacknowledged to possess chemical weapons have\npostponed ratification of the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling\nand Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction,\n13\n\n\nwhich took us 20 years to negotiate and requires only two\nmore ratifications to enter fully into force. We shall be\ninitiating consultations with a view to submitting a draft\nresolution on this subject. We urge the United States\nCongress and the Russian Federation to ratify the\nConvention as soon as possible.\nAlso on the subject of disarmament, we wish to draw\nattention to the fact that the President of Mexico,\nMr. Ernesto Zedillo, recently made two proposals at the Rio\nGroup summit in Cochabamba, Bolivia. The first concerned\nthe need to adopt a convention against the illegal arms\ntrade, which relates directly to the struggle in which we are\nall engaged against drug trafficking, crime and terrorism.\nThe second concerned the desirability of adopting measures\nfor the control of conventional offensive weapons in Latin\nAmerica with a view to avoiding arms races that would\ndivert resources essential to our economic development.\nWe welcome the Canadian initiative, to which Mexico\ngives its unreserved support, regarding the initiation of\nconsultations with a view to securing, as speedily as\npossible, a total ban on the deployment, transfer, production\nand stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines. We believe the\nmatter to be both important and urgent. Accordingly, we\npropose that this Assembly consider this issue in that light.\nIt is precisely because we do not see peace as the\nmere absence of war that we believe that international\npeace and security must be embodied in development and\nequity. Peace is inseparable from development; security is\ninseparable from prosperity. If we sow today for\ndevelopment, we shall reap the peace, security and\ninternational harmony that must mark the world of the next\nmillennium.\nAccordingly, Mexico enthusiastically supports the\nwork of the United Nations and its specialized agencies on\neconomic and social issues and, in particular, the adoption\nof an agenda for development as the basis of its efforts to\neradicate poverty.\nThat is why we view with growing concern the fact\nthat, in supposed support of freedom and democracy, action\nis being taken in the opposite direction through the adoption\nof laws in the field of trade \u2014 the nerve centre of\ncontemporary progress \u2014 that are extraterritorial in scope\nand in complete disagreement with the fundamental\nprinciples of international law. I would draw the\nAssembly\u2019s attention to the opinion of the Inter-American\nJuridical Committee of the Organization of American\nStates, distributed in document A/51/394, on the subject of\nthe so-called Helms-Burton Act. It argues convincingly\nthat this Act is not in keeping with international law. It is\nneither by means of blockades or exclusions, nor by the\napplication of sanctions on third countries that democracy\nand human rights can be promoted. Dialogue, inclusion in\nmultilateral forums, trade, investment and the exchange of\ninformation and persons have always proven to be the\nbest way to disseminate the values we all share.\nDrug trafficking has attained unprecedented levels\nworldwide, to the point where it has become one of the\nmost serious threats to the integrity of societies and the\nvery security of nations. Despite the vast resources\ndirected by Governments towards combating illicit drugs,\nthe power of the drug traffickers is increasing, as is the\nnumber of victims claimed by drug addiction and the\ncollateral damage caused to the social environment and\nthe economy. There is an urgent need to draw up and put\ninto effect measures and strategies which, on the basis of\ninternational cooperation and shared responsibility, will\nmake it possible to launch a comprehensive attack on this\nphenomenon and to do away with partial and subjective\nevaluations in rating the level of compliance of each\nGovernment in combating drug trafficking, or, still worse,\nin making use of this rating as a political weapon and\npressure tactic.\nWe trust that, in the course of this session, the\nGeneral Assembly will take a fundamental step to\nintensify the fight against drug trafficking by convening\nin 1998, on the recommendation of the Economic and\nSocial Council, a special session to assess the state of\ninternational cooperation in combating the production,\nsale, demand, trafficking and unlawful distribution of\nnarcotics, psychotropic substances and related activities.\nOnce the draft resolution on this issue is adopted, we\nshall have to get down to the task of preparing an\nappropriate agenda for that special session, incorporating\nthe specific ideas put forward in the Economic and Social\nCouncil and in this Assembly. In this connection, the\nstatement made on 23 September by the President of\nColombia, Dr. Ernesto Samper Pizano, is of special\ninterest.\nMexico recognizes and scrupulously respects the\nsovereign right of every nation to determine the rules and\nconditions for the admission of foreign workers to its\nterritory. Nevertheless, the situation of our nationals in\nforeign countries has become a source of legitimate\nconcern to all sectors of society in my country in\nresponse to the emergence of disturbing outbreaks of\nracism and xenophobia in some countries to which\n14\n\n\nmigratory flows are directed. We firmly reject all actions or\nomissions on the part of national and local authorities in the\nrecipient countries that may contribute to creating or\nexacerbating an atmosphere of violence and intolerance\nagainst such workers and their families. In our view, the\nmere existence of such a climate runs counter to the basic\nassumption of respect for the human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms of all. Mexico believes that this complex problem\nmust be approached in a way that goes beyond mere\nmeasures of repression and humiliation, but is rather\ncomprehensive, objective, broad in scope and responsive to\nregional and subregional characteristics.\nMy country is convinced that the early entry into force\nof the International Convention on the Protection of the\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their\nFamilies is certain to constitute an appropriate framework\nfor the protection of the rights of millions of people who\nemigrate in search of better living conditions. Moreover, we\nbelieve that it is necessary to draw up, as part of the effort\nto protect the human rights of migrants, minimum rules that\nwill protect them in any recipient country, regardless of\ntheir legal status and of the protection afforded them by the\nlaws of the country to which they emigrate. We shall be\nsubmitting proposals in this regard at the next session of\nthe Commission on Human Rights.\nMeanwhile, Mexico has been making a major effort to\nimprove the treatment and protection of the migrants\nentering our territory across the southern border. Moreover,\nthe Mexican Government has recently taken a decision to\nregularize the migratory status of more than 30,000\nrefugees, most of them Guatemalan, who have settled in\ncamps in the States of Campeche and Quintana Roo under\nthe auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees. In a joint effort with all the countries of Central\nAmerica \u2014 including Belize and Panama \u2014 and the United\nStates and Canada, Mexico has embarked on a campaign to\ncombat and punish illegal trafficking in persons, which has\nnow taken on the attributes of international organized\ncrime. We are also working to pass legislation at the\ncongressional level to increase the penalties and lengthen\nthe sentences for those found guilty of this illegal\ntrafficking.\nAs the Heads of State and Government of the so-\ncalled Group of 16, of which Mexico is a member,\nindicated on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, it is vital that we strengthen the multilateral\napproach to solving the problems that affect the community\nas a whole. We view with particular concern the lack of\nsubstantive progress in the various working groups\nresponsible for examining the main aspects of the reform\nof the Organization, and for this reason we should like to\npropose that efforts be concentrated in the following\nareas.\nThe capacity of the United Nations to prevent\nconflicts and resolve those that already exist must be\nenhanced. This would include, among other actions,\nbreaking the deadlock in the reform of the Security\nCouncil, whose primary responsibility is the maintenance\nof international peace and security. Secondly, measures\nshould be taken to strengthen the mechanisms for\nresolving conflicts and disputes by peaceful means\nthrough a convention on the subject. And, finally, the role\nof the Secretary-General in conflict prevention should be\nstrengthened. An example of what action by the\nSecretary-General can achieve is the important agreement\nsigned in Mexico City on 19 September between the\nGovernment of Guatemala and the general command of\nthe Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca, which\nwill make a significant contribution to the attainment of\nlasting peace in that country, and in which the\nSecretary-General and a group of friends, including\nMexico, participated.\nFrom this rostrum I wish to pay tribute to the work\nof the Moderator, which was essential to the signing of\nsix substantive agreements in the Guatemalan process.\nNow we are awaiting only the signing of a few\noperational agreements, which will lead to the early\nestablishment of a lasting peace in that country.\nWith regard to the reform of the Security Council,\nMexico considers it essential that in evaluating the\nproposals before us, account should be taken of the need\nfor that organ\u2019s composition to reflect the increase in the\nmembership of the Organization, while strictly respecting\nthe wishes of the countries of each region and the\nprinciple of equitable geographical representation.\nThe United Nations must also strengthen its\nactivities in the protection of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, again on the basis of the\ncontractual obligations entered into by each State, and in\neliminating any vestiges of colonialism or of\ndiscrimination on grounds of sex, religion, race or\npolitical conviction.\nOne of the most urgent and complex issues of the\nreform process is that of revising the financing system\nand the criteria for establishing the contributions of\nMember States. But let us be frank: the financial crisis\n15\n\n\nthe United Nations is experiencing stems primarily from the\nlack of timely payment of assessed contributions by a\nconsiderable number of countries. This situation must be\nnormalized as speedily as possible.\nThe maintenance of international peace and security\ncontinues to be the primary mission of the United Nations.\nBarely seven years ago, a sigh of relief marked the ending\nof the long night of the cold war. Hopes were reborn that,\nwith peace strengthened, confidence in the United Nations\nwould grow, the ambitions of dominance on the part of the\neconomically and militarily powerful countries would cease,\nand a spirit of tolerance and harmony, of equity and mutual\nassistance \u2014 indispensable for the building of a better\nworld \u2014 would soon develop. There was talk of \u201cpeace\ndividends\u201d. The reality has been more complex.\nMexico expresses its dismay at the violent incidents\nthat have occurred recently in the Middle East and joins the\nappeal of the international community to all parties\nconcerned to refrain from undertaking any actions that\ncould worsen the situation and provoke further clashes.\nSuch incidents constitute a dramatic reminder of the need\nfor the parties to redouble their efforts with a view to\nadvancing the peace process and ensuring that dialogue and\nreason prevail in the region.\nDespite the magnitude of the obstacles that have to be\novercome in order to ensure that human beings are\neducated for peace, Mexico maintains a profound faith in\nthe United Nations, whose structures must be strengthened\nif we truly wish to give it the necessary capacity to\ndischarge the complex and lofty tasks entrusted to it half a\ncentury ago, as well as those additional tasks it is charged\nwith almost daily.\nWith renewed optimism, we trust that human beings\nstill possess the resourcefulness and talent required to make\nthis world a worthy and just abode for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe are glad to see the\nGeneral Assembly, the key organ in the reform process of\nthe Organization, meet under a President who combines\nprofound knowledge of the United Nations with a\nreputation for strong leadership.\nMy colleague from Ireland has already outlined the\npositions of the European Union, which we fully endorse.\nI will elaborate on a few points to which Austria attaches\nparticular importance.\nWhen discussing the need for reform a year ago,\nHeads of State and Government expressed their political\nwill to give the twenty-first century a United Nations\nequipped, financed and structured to serve effectively the\npeoples in whose name it was established. However,\ninsufficient progress has been made so far in implementing\nthis commitment. While the Secretary-General, to whose\nspirited leadership of the Organization I should like to pay\na warm personal tribute, has undertaken a number of\nimportant reform initiatives, the Working Groups of the\nGeneral Assembly have made only limited progress. Much\nmore needs to be done. And we must always bear in mind\nthat reform is not mere downsizing, but pursuing our goals\neffectively and efficiently. Four principles should, in our\nview, guide our reform agenda. As the first priority and as\na precondition for reform, we must fulfil our financial\nobligations in accordance with the United Nations Charter;\nwe must give clear mandates and provide the necessary\nresources; we must ensure the competitiveness of the\nUnited Nations system; and we must eliminate duplication,\nwaste and mismanagement.\nWe should like to see strong United Nations leadership\nin the following areas.\nAs regards human rights, the results of the World\nConference on Human Rights form an integral part of the\ncoordinated follow-up to recent United Nations conferences.\nAustria will play an active role in preparations for the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights and the five-year review of the Vienna\nDeclaration and Programme of Action in 1998. Today,\nour main task is not to elaborate new international\nstandards in the field of human rights but to ensure full\nrespect for the broad body of existing norms and rules in\nall parts of the world. This requires the active\ninvolvement of the entire United Nations system. This\nincludes United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) projects on governance; the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund\u2019s efforts in the field of juvenile justice;\nprogrammes of the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice\nBranch of the Secretariat for the strengthening of criminal\njustice systems; and the integration of human rights\nelements into United Nations field missions. In the run-up\nto 1998, system-wide cooperation and integration in the\nfield of human rights have to be improved.\nAustria pays particular attention to the promotion\nand protection of minorities as a means both to prevent\nand to resolve conflicts. Respecting the rights of\nminorities is crucial for peaceful development and good\nneighbourly relations. The case of South Tyrol is an\nexcellent example. Half a century after the conclusion of\nthe 1946 Treaty of Paris between Austria and Italy \u2014 of\nfundamental importance for the survival of the Austrian\nminority \u2014 the South Tyroleans enjoy the protection of\na carefully regulated autonomy, which increasingly serves\nas an inspiration in comparable situations elsewhere.\nTurning next to drug control and organized crime, it\nis estimated that drug sales generate more than\n$120 billion annually, thus exceeding the gross domestic\nproduct of many United Nations Member States. This\neconomic power of drug traffickers is a serious threat to\nthe stability and the democratic and legal institutions of\nmany countries. Drug abuse also has severe social\nconsequences for societies and individuals. Therefore,\ndrug control must remain a top priority for the United\nNations. Austria will welcome the holding of a special\nsession of the General Assembly in 1998 devoted to this\nquestion. In order to make that session a success, we\nshould soon start our preparations at the national, regional\nand international levels.\nTrafficking in illicit drugs goes hand in hand with\ntransnational organized crime and money laundering,\nwhich can be fought only through intensified international\ncooperation. In this regard, we encourage closer\ncooperation between the United Nations International\n8\n\n\nDrug Control Programme and the Secretariat\u2019s crime\nDivision.\nI turn now to fight against the sexual exploitation of\nchildren. A phenomenon closely linked to organized crime\nis the sexual exploitation of children; this contemporary\nform of slavery can result in serious, life-long, even life-\nthreatening consequences for the physical, psychological\nand social development of children. The rights of children\nand women being at the very heart of our concern, we\nwould like in this respect to reiterate the importance we\nattach to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action as\nwell as to the recommendations of the recent Stockholm\nWorld Congress on Commercial Sexual Exploitation of\nChildren. We are convinced that only a global partnership\nuniting Governments, non-governmental organizations and\nrelevant United Nations agencies can bring an end to the\ntrafficking and exploitation of children and women for\nsexual purposes.\nPeace-keeping remains the international community's\nmajor tool to assist parties to a conflict in the\nimplementation of peace agreements or to provide a rapid\nresponse to complex emergencies. In view of lessons\nlearned from previous missions, we actively support the\nimprovement of the rapid deployment capability of the\nOrganization, including the establishment of a rapidly\ndeployable headquarters.\nCurrently, some 1,200 Austrians \u2014 troop contingents,\nmilitary observers, civilian police and civilians \u2014 are\nserving in United Nations missions and in the\nImplementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nWe will continue to participate in such operations. In this\ncontext, I am pleased to announce that my country will\nparticipate in the system of stand-by arrangements. We will\nalso continue to assist the United Nations in its efforts to\nimprove the quality of peace-keeping personnel through our\nparticipation in the United Nations training assistance team\nprogramme. International training centres in Austria offer\ntraining programmes for military as well as civilian\npersonnel. We have joined forces with the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) in the strengthening of conflict\nprevention and peace-keeping capacities in Africa.\nAs regards preventive diplomacy, over the last few\nyears, we have witnessed an increase in the deployment of\nsmall political field missions. They play an important role\nin the preventive diplomacy efforts of the Secretary-General\nand his Special Representatives, and in the coordination of\npeace-building initiatives. Austria encourages the Secretary-\nGeneral to make more use of this cost-effective instrument.\nWe therefore support his proposal to establish clear\nbudgetary procedures ensuring a sound and predictable\nfinancial basis for such missions.\nThe United Nations took the lead in developing the\nconcept of post-conflict peace-building. Today, not only\nthe United Nations but also the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) and the World Bank, the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) are elaborating concepts of how to assist in the\nconsolidation of peace and the prevention of the\nrecurrence of conflicts. The objective of peace-building is\npolitical, but it often requires action in the economic,\nsocial, humanitarian or human rights fields.\nThe broad variety of available instruments is amply\ndemonstrated by a recent survey of the United Nations\nsystem\u2019s capabilities in post-conflict reconstruction\ncompiled by the Vienna-based Reconstruction and\nDevelopment Support Unit of the Secretariat.\nThe ability of the United Nations system to act in an\nintegrated manner in peace-building represents a test for\nits overall ability to reform and to modernize. We call\nupon the Secretary-General to develop comprehensive\ncriteria and operational guidelines, including on the\nquestion of leadership for peace-building activities. We\nalso encourage the Secretary-General to intensify his\ncooperation with international financial institutions and\nother relevant actors in this field.\nAs regards regional conflicts, time constraints\nprevent me from addressing in detail the many situations\nin all parts of the world where the international\ncommunity, often under the leadership of the United\nNations, has attempted to bring conflicts and human\nsuffering to an end \u2014 as in the Great Lakes region of\nAfrica, Liberia and Afghanistan. I will limit myself to a\nconflict in our immediate neighbourhood, namely the\nsituation in the Balkans: in the former Yugoslavia.\nMy country follows developments there with both\ngreat hope and great concern. The implementation of the\nDayton Peace Agreement lags behind our expectations,\nespecially in the civilian field. However, we must not\noverlook the foremost achievement of this Agreement: the\nfact that a very brutal and bloody war was stopped and\nthat the road for Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s return to\nnormalcy was paved. It is an encouraging sign that\nballots, and no longer bullets, are in place.\n9\n\n\nThe elections held on 14 September represent a vital\nstep forward and indicate the Bosnian people\u2019s\ndetermination to continue with the peace process. The\nsetting up of common institutions, as foreseen by the\nDayton Agreement, is now the number-one task.\nNotwithstanding the primary responsibility of the parties\nthemselves to fully implement the Dayton peace accords, it\nis indispensable that the international community not\nabandon the country after the expiration of the IFOR\nmandate by the end of this year. We will have to continue\nto assist the people and authorities of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina in their efforts to rebuild a civil society and to\nstrengthen reconciliation among ethnic groups.\nSustainable management of environmental resources to\nensure both human progress and human survival poses a\nmajor challenge at the outset of the twenty-first century. At\npresent, we are compromising the ability of future\ngenerations to meet their own needs. The United Nations\nhas a crucial role to play in achieving a common\nunderstanding of sustainability and in promoting its\nimplementation. We therefore attach great importance to\nnext year\u2019s special session of the General Assembly on the\noverall review and appraisal of Agenda 21. The special\nsession should not only assess the implementation of the\nRio commitments, but should also elaborate a global\nconsensus on new important areas such as sustainable\nconsumption, production patterns, energy and transport.\nThe process of globalization also profoundly changes\nthe parameters of social development in all countries. The\nWorld Summit for Social Development took up this\nchallenge and agreed on a set of principles, goals and\ncommitments to enhance the benefits and mitigate the\nnegative effects of this process. We welcome the\ndetermination of the United Nations system to translate the\noutcome of the Copenhagen Summit into its operational\nwork for the benefit of all people.\nWe are striving nationally to meet our commitments\neven in times of budgetary cuts. I avail myself of this\nopportunity to recall the Austrian invitation to hold a\nregional follow-up conference to the social Summit in\nVienna at the end of 1997 or the beginning of 1998.\nMy next point is disarmament. A more cooperative\napproach to security is to provide a setting conducive to\ngiving new impetus to international disarmament and arms\ncontrol. Serious efforts must be undertaken to eliminate\nweapons of mass destruction and to strengthen the various\narms control and non-proliferation regimes. At the same\ntime, more attention should be devoted to areas of\nconventional disarmament, such as the United Nations\nRegister of Conventional Arms, small arms and arms\ntransfers, as well as to the further development of\nuniversal regimes of transparency in armaments. The\nWassenaar Arrangement, recently established in Vienna,\nwill make an important contribution to international peace\nand security.\nIn response to the human tragedy of civilian\nlandmine victims, Austria has been one of the first\ncountries to establish a total moratorium on anti-personnel\nlandmines, and is aiming for an agreement on a\nworldwide total ban on this scourge of humanity.\nThe approval of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty (CTBT) constitutes a milestone on our path\ntowards a more secure future, leaving behind the nuclear\nweapons competition that defined the cold war. Austria\nwelcomes the test moratoriums announced by all five\ndeclared nuclear-weapon States, and we call on all States\nto work on the rapid ratification of the CTBT in order to\nfoster nuclear non-proliferation and to spare this planet\nfurther ecological damage.\nThe organization for the CTBT and, pending entry\ninto force, its preparatory commission, will play a vital\nrole in verifying the implementation of the test ban.\nAustria considers it an honour to host such an important\ninternational organization and will contribute its share to\ncreating favourable working conditions. The position of\nVienna, which already hosts the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), as the centre of global nuclear\nnon-proliferation is further strengthened by the addition of\ncrucial nuclear verification facilities.\nThis fight can be won only by pursuing a double-\ntracked approach: on one track, non-proliferation is a\nprecondition for ridding ourselves of the risk of nuclear\ndestruction. On the other track, the nuclear-weapon States\nare called upon to honour their obligation under the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) to disarm their nuclear arsenals with the ultimate\ngoal of the complete elimination of these weapons.\nThe United Nations should continue to play a\nleading role in the progressive development of\ninternational law. Austria highly esteems the work of the\nInternational Law Commission. Currently the elaboration\nof a statute for an international criminal court is of utmost\nimportance. Austria strongly supports the early\nestablishment of the court, to end the widespread culture\nof impunity.\n10\n\n\nFinally, I would like to mention the United Nations\nOffice at Vienna: our strong commitment to the United\nNations also manifests itself in Austria\u2019s role as one of the\nheadquarters of the Organization. United Nations\nprogrammes and agencies based in Vienna represent highly\nimportant instruments in international efforts to meet new\nthreats to peace, security and development. I am referring\nto the key role of the International Atomic Energy Agency\nin preventing nuclear proliferation; that of the United\nNations International Drug Control Programme and the\nUnited Nations crime Division, which fight against drug\nabuse, money laundering, organized crime and corruption;\nof the Office for Outer Space Affairs, the principal United\nNations body for international cooperation in the peaceful\nuses of outer space; of the United Nations Industrial\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO), the central\ncoordinating agency for information, analysis, advice and\nassistance in the field of sustainable industrial development;\nand of the United Nations Commission on International\nTrade Law (UNCITRAL), the international centre for the\npromotion, harmonization and unification of the law of\ninternational trade. We would like to pay tribute to\nUNCITRAL for the able manner in which it is carrying out\nits task. The Austrian Government is looking forward to\ncelebrating the Commission\u2019s thirtieth anniversary on the\noccasion of its next meeting, in spring 1997 in Vienna.\nOver the years, the IAEA and the United Nations\nOffice at Vienna have understood the importance of\nbuilding a solid reputation for good and lean management.\nUNIDO has undergone drastic reforms, streamlining its\nsecretariat and clearly defining its priorities and areas of\nconcern. As one of the host countries of the United\nNations, we are particularly committed to the reform efforts\nbeing undertaken by these organizations and by the United\nNations system as a whole. We shall support all efforts to\nfulfil the commitments we all agreed on last year, to make\nthe United Nations fit for the twenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe current session of the United Nations General\nAssembly is taking place at a complex international time,\nmarked by worrisome developments that exacerbate the\nfeelings of anxiety and precariousness that plague the\nmajority of humanity. These developments result from the\nprofound historic changes that have occurred in recent\nyears, which at one time had given us hope for a new and\nimproved system of international relations that would be\nmore open to the concerns of all in matters of security\nand more receptive to development needs.\nThe transformation of the international economy and\naccelerated trends towards globalization have, to be sure,\nresulted in new, more complex relations, but have also,\ndue to certain harmful side effects, aggravated the\nimbalances and the dependency of many developing\ncountries, whose courageous economic reforms, achieved\nat the highest of costs, still confront a hostile\nenvironment.\nIn this new era of heightened interdependence, a lack\nof solidarity still characterizes international relations, and\nself-interest is persistent in terms of both security and\ndevelopment, emphasizing the lack of a mechanism that\ncan effectively narrow the growing gap between\ndeveloped countries \u2014 ever more prosperous and\nstable \u2014 and a developing world faced with poverty and\ndisorder of every sort.\nSuch observations emphasize that a real awareness\non the part of the international community as a whole,\nand of the developed countries in particular, is slow in\ncoming. They also confirm that piecemeal measures,\ntaken on an urgent basis, are not enough to compensate\nfor the lack of an overall approach to the global problems\nof our times.\n22\n\n\nAlso quite clear in this regard is the marginalization of\nthe mechanisms established to foster, channel and develop\ncooperation, solidarity and joint efforts among nations.\nIt is significant to note that on the heels of an\nanniversary session at which the commitment of States to\nstrengthen the authority of the United Nations was\nforcefully reaffirmed, the Organization is experiencing one\nof its greatest crises, notably due to restrictions on the\nresources it needs to accomplish its missions \u2014 and this at\na time when the demands on it have increased and when\nexpectations are growing that it will play a larger role in\npreserving peace, in promoting and developing international\ncooperation, and in emancipating peoples still under\ndomination. Hence the need for all States to discharge their\nobligations to our Organization, especially since it has\nembarked upon a courageous process of restructuring and\nreform designed to make it an instrument capable of\ngenerating and developing dialogue, cooperation and\nconfidence among nations.\nIt should be noted, in this regard, that democratization,\ntransparency and a better balance among its major organs\nall are requirements and basic objectives for a genuine\nreform of the institution and for ensuring the restoration of\nthe General Assembly\u2019s authority and the functions\nconferred upon it by the Charter \u2014 also a key objective in\norder to enhance the effectiveness of its action and restore\nits credibility.\nSimilarly, it is important, within the framework of the\nquestion of the expansion of the Security Council, to pay\nspecial attention to such crucial aspects as the transparency\nof its work, the representation on it of the Member States\non whose behalf it acts, and the links to be established with\nthe General Assembly.\nAlgeria, which has made a priority, in its foreign\npolicy, of strengthening the credibility and the authority of\nthe United Nations, naturally provides continuous political\nsupport and makes varied contributions to its activities, as\nshown by our participation in the success of certain peace-\nkeeping operations.\nThis is because our Organization remains the most\nappropriate framework for realizing our aspirations for\nshared security and development, at the very time when the\nrealization of the twin Agendas for peace and development\ncalls for respecting and strengthening its authority.\nHere I should like to pay a well-deserved tribute to\nour Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for his vision, his perseverance and the\ntireless efforts he has been making in the service of\nadapting the United Nations to the challenges of the\ncurrent era. His courage, his commitment, and the\nambition he has to reinforce the reach and effectiveness\nof the Organization at a particularly difficult phase in the\nevolution of international relations have gained him the\nsupport of the Organization of African Unity and the\nLeague of Arab States. My country reiterates its support\nfor him and wishes him every success at the head of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe dawning of a better-organized and more stable\ninternational order requires seeking joint responses to the\nmost dangerous threats to the security and development of\nour countries. These responses can emerge only through\njoint undertakings, greater solidarity and an effective\ncommitment to combat the most serious consequences of\nthe rise in intolerance and extremism and the denial of the\nmost basic principles of humanity.\nAmong these phenomena, international terrorism is\nmore than ever manifest, in its seriousness as a universal\nphenomenon, as a threat to the stability of nations and to\ndemocratic values in our societies, and as a new type of\nthreat to international peace and security. So combatting\nterrorism today requires effective international\nmobilization commensurate with the challenges of a key\nphenomenon which knows no limits or inviolable\nsanctuary.\nIt is fortunate that an international awareness of the\ndangers inherent in this scourge is beginning gradually to\nemerge. The international response, however, will to a\nlarge extent remain insufficient if it is not reflected in\nconcrete action in line with three requirements: the\nestablishment of true international cooperation; a show of\ngreater solidarity; and determination commensurate with\nregularly stated political commitments.\nIn this regard, the fight against terrorism should not\nbe ambiguous or selective, as it sometimes is. It should be\nmarked by a constant, unfailing mobilization of efforts to\ndismantle the criminal chain of terrorism, including those\nwho are perpetrators, those who are behind them, the\nvarious political networks and their sources of financing\nand supply, and the direct or indirect logistical support\ngiven by individuals, groups or States. The necessary\nconditions should be created for this. In this context,\nAlgeria supports the idea of holding an international\nconference on the fight against terrorism.\n23\n\n\nPromoting more stable and more balanced international\nrelations requires collective effort to improve the situation\nin areas of tension and conflict which threaten international\npeace and security. In order to be fruitful, these efforts\nshould be buttressed by a search for viable, lasting solutions\nto these conflicts and by increasing joint efforts and\nstrengthening existing frameworks for dialogue.\nFrom this standpoint, the crisis in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina was an example of how indecision and lack of\ndetermination on the part of the world community cost us\na great deal in tragedy and destruction. This long-suffering\ncountry is now, to be sure, embarking on the path to peace,\neven if still remains fragile, and strewn with many\nobstacles. We venture to hope, however, that its new\ninstitutional direction will insure for Bosnia and\nHerzegovina the peace it needs for stability and\nreconstruction.\nFurthermore, the promotion of international relations\nalso presupposes the strengthening of regional integration\nframeworks which today are the hallmark of an emerging\nnew system of international relations.\nIn its immediate environment, Algeria is actively\nparticipating in the establishment and consolidation of joint\naction for solidarity and cooperation with its neighbours,\nwith which it hopes to develop exemplary good-neighbourly\nrelations. In the Maghreb, the identity, aspirations and\ncommon mission of the peoples of the region, naturally,\nmake us desirous of retaining a plan for Maghreb unity as\na central element of my country\u2019s policy. This is an\nirreversible national priority.\nAlgeria\u2019s determination is an expression of faith in the\nfuture as is the ability of each of the Arab Maghreb Union\npartners to take advantage of the opportunities for relations\nwhich can be mutually beneficial and which can meet the\nlegitimate aspirations of our peoples. It is in this context of\na unified, homogenous and strong Maghreb that Algeria\nhopes to contribute to the beginning of a just and lasting\npeaceful settlement of the issue of Western Sahara. It is in\nthis regard too that Algeria continues to provide political\nsupport and human and financial resources to the\nSettlement Plan jointly put in place by the United Nations\nand the Organization of African Unity (OAU) with a view\nto holding a genuine, credible referendum which would\nguarantee the free exercise by the people of Western Sahara\nof its right to self-determination and independence.\nContinuing problems encountered in the\nimplementation of the Settlement Plan, and the uncertainty\nsurrounding the desired political solution of this conflict,\nrequire that we redouble our efforts to establish better\nconditions for a genuine peace framework. We are\nconvinced that this will be possible only if each and every\nparty fully discharges its responsibilities in the\nimplementation of the Plan. A rapid solution would only\nbe advantageous for the peace and concord to which all\npeoples in the region are entitled.\nThis means in particular that the two parties to the\nconflict \u2014 the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARIO\nFront \u2014 should become aware that forthright,\nconstructive and responsible dialogue can bring a solution\nto pending issues at the current stage, and can also help\nthem to prepare for the future.\nThis also means that the duty of the international\ncommunity, and of the United Nations in particular,\nshould be translated into a more sustained commitment\nand presence, and into a continued peace effort in line\nwith international responsibilities towards the people of\nWestern Sahara and their legitimate rights.\nThe establishment of the OAU Mechanism for\nConflict Prevention, Management and Resolution reflects\nthe determination of African leaders to make a decisive\ncontribution to reducing tensions and settling disputes on\nour continent. Thanks to this spirit, the painstaking efforts\nmade by the countries of the Economic Community of\nWest African States have opened up promising prospects\nfor a settlement of the conflict in Liberia through national\nreconciliation and a return to democratically elected\ninstitutions.\nAlgeria hopes for a return to calm, reconciliation and\nnational unity in Burundi, which are so crucial for the\nwhole region. We continue to encourage all efforts being\nmade by the countries of the Great Lakes region.\nThe lack of prospects for a settlement in Somalia\nand the international community\u2019s lack of interest are\nexacerbating the sufferings endured by the civilian\npopulation and are a source of great concern to us. While\nit is true that Somalians themselves must make a special\neffort, it is also the duty of the international\ncommunity \u2014 through the United Nations, the OAU and\nthe League of Arab States \u2014 to do everything possible to\nhelp in reconciliation and in the establishment of national\ninstitutions which could earn the embrace and confidence\nof all Somalians.\nIn the Mediterranean, Algeria has constantly worked\ntowards the establishment of a permanent framework for\n24\n\n\ndialogue and cooperation which would enable the coastal\nStates, without exception, to address their political, security,\neconomic and human concerns. We have always acted with\na view to defining a renewed operational machinery which\nwould organize and lead a future of stability and progress\nin the European-Mediterranean theatre. This is what\nmotivated Algeria to join the process begun in Barcelona.\nIn our view, this was an initial accomplishment, an\nimportant step towards the establishment of new European-\nMediterranean relations based on mutual confidence and\njoint actions, which will give tangible content to the\nindivisibility of security and development in the region.\nIn the Middle East, recent developments have in many\nrespects caused us concern and alarm. The Madrid\nconference created a historic opportunity for a peaceful\nsettlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict. In the name of good\nfaith and responsibility, the commitments entered into must\nbe respected. Algeria hopes to pursue its contribution to a\njust and lasting peace, and renews its commitment to the\nprincipals adopted by the Madrid conference: land for\npeace; the implementation of Security Council resolutions\n242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978); and respect for the\nnational aspirations of the Palestinian people. These\nprinciples are at the heart of the peace process and the basis\nfor our participation in it. Algeria believes that there is no\nalternative to a settlement based on the total withdrawal by\nIsrael from all Arab territories occupied since 1967 and on\nthe right of the Palestinian people to the establishment of a\nsovereign State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.\nToday, it is the duty and the responsibility of the\ninternational community, and in particular of the co-\nsponsors of the peace process, to show resolve and\ndetermination in continuing their efforts to promote the\nsuccess of the process \u2014 a process which has been\njeopardized by Israeli intransigence and back-sliding.\nThe improvement of relations between Arab States and\ntheir unity constitute an essential pillar of the peace\nprocess. The dawning of peace will depend to a large extent\non the mobilization of Arab potential and capacity in the\nservice of peace and to promote relations based on the\nprinciples of good-neighbourliness, the non-use of force or\nthe threat of force, and non-interference in the internal\naffairs of States. All of us, Algeria included, must reverse\nthe logic of confrontation, which has compromised relations\nbetween Arab countries since the Gulf war, and work\ntowards reconciliation on the basis of respect for\ninternational law.\nIn this context, the unjustified violations of the\nindependence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of\nIraq require an increased awareness on the part of the\nworld community of the risks inherent in such practices,\nwhich are contrary to international law, and of their\neffects on the stability of the region. Such violations,\nwhich Algeria rejects, have only increased the suffering\nof the Iraqi people, who have already been sorely tried by\nseveral years of sanctions which can no longer be\njustified.\nIn the same vein, Algeria remains concerned at the\ncontinuation of sanctions against our sister country, the\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, and by the sufferings these\ninvolve for the Libyan people, to which we would like to\nreiterate our full solidarity. Furthermore, Algeria renews\nits support for the restoration of the sovereignty of the\nUnited Arab Emirates over the Abu Musa islands and the\nLesser and Greater Tunb islands, which remain under\nforeign occupation. My country also expresses its\nsolidarity with Bahrain in the face of the increased\nforeign interference and threats to which it has been\nsubjected.\nAlgeria\u2019s actions with regard to disarmament stem\nfrom its conviction that the acquisition, stockpiling and\nincreased sophistication of arms, in particular high-\ntechnology weapons and weapons of mass destruction, do\nnot bring security, but undermine the essential\nestablishment of confidence among nations. Strengthened\nby this conviction, Algeria has shown \u2014 through concrete\ninitiatives taken at the international, regional and internal\nlevels \u2014 its commitment to strengthening the process\ntowards general and complete disarmament by eliminating\nweapons of mass destruction. In this regard, we recall our\nparticipation in the drafting and adoption of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as an initial\nstage for more substantial measures in this area.\nSimilarly, after having ratified the Convention on\nchemical weapons and adhering to the nuclear non-\nproliferation Treaty, on 30 March 1996 Algeria signed a\nsafeguards agreement with the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency.\nActing with similar responsibility, Algeria has helped\nAfrican efforts. These led to the adoption on 11 April of\nthe Pelindaba Treaty, by which the States Members of the\nOrganization of African Unity declared Africa a nuclear-\nfree zone. This African momentum should be encouraged\nby similar efforts to establish new zones, especially in the\nMiddle East, which remains a legitimate source of\nconcern for all Arab countries, in particular with regard\nto Israeli nuclear potential.\n25\n\n\nA better structured and more unified international\neconomic order is a precondition for international peace and\nsecurity. The globalization of economic, social and political\nproblems, the lack of coordinated management of\ninterdependent issues, the increase in global challenges, and\nthe weakening of national regulatory structures make it ever\nmore necessary to establish new structures for global\nmanagement within a framework of true democratization of\ninternational relations. In response to these objectives, the\ninternational community must shoulder more responsibility\nfor the many, interdependent links which hold it together;\nimprove its ability for a collective response to the challenge\nof development; and increase its support for these efforts.\nThe worsening of the external, bilateral and\nmultilateral debt crisis of developing countries; the erosion\nand unpredictable nature of resources from export earnings;\nrestrictions on access to markets; the lack of fairness in\ninternational trade; one-sided views which affect\ncooperation; and the unilateral nature of the world decision-\nmaking process: all these highlight in different ways the\nvarious obstacles which remain on the path to development.\nThis means that, in order to organize a common future\non a new basis, the international community must make\ndevelopment a greater concern, promote joint solutions for\nthe sustained growth of the countries of the South and\nensure their true integration in the world economy.\nIn this vein, the issue of development financing\ndeserves special attention in the context of the persistent\nexternal debt crisis in the countries of the South and the\ndrying up of funds for cooperation, since the approaches\ntaken to this issue thus far have been questionable, to say\nthe least. Imaginative and more global solutions must be\nfound to the external debt problem of the countries of the\nSouth and their access to international financing. It is also\nimportant to include in our vision of development the\nenormous potential of the expanding world trade expected\nfrom the fair and consistent implementation of the Uruguay\nRound agreements.\nThe first Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO), to be held soon in Singapore, will be\na good opportunity for the international community to make\na clear appraisal of the implementation of these agreements\nand to make the necessary corrections for a more\nsignificant and equitable participation of the countries of the\nSouth in international trade. It is through its predictability,\nstability, openness and transparency that the new world\ntrade system established by the WTO will become a true\nand forceful factor for development.\nThe international economic situation is still\ncharacterized by gaps that make the future of the world\nmore uncertain, given the increase in inequalities and the\nrisk of social rifts they entail. These gaps, which also\naffect developed countries faced with the severe problems\nof adjusting to unemployment and exclusion, show how,\nfaced with globalization, international society can only\nfind joint solutions to global problems, particularly those\nof growth and development. It is in Africa, where the\nsocio-economic situation is evolving more tragically, that\nthis dimension can be seen in all its gravity with the\nexpansion of abject poverty, the spread of disease and the\nthreat of impending famine.\nIt is on that continent that we find the greatest\nexpression of the categorical need for renewed and\nstrengthened international solidarity in a spirit of open-\nmindedness and partnership to help African countries in\ntheir efforts at the socio-economic restructuring necessary\nto lay the foundations for lasting political and social\nbalance and to open new prospects of hope for their\npeoples. It is in fact politically unacceptable and morally\nintolerable to continue to ignore the international threat\ninherent in the deterioration of the development crisis on\nthat continent.\nIn this vein, the new appeal made last March by the\nSecretary-General through a special initiative of the\nUnited Nations system for Africa deserves our full\nsupport, since it compels the international community,\nand, in particular the wealthy countries, to face up to their\nbasic responsibilities to our continent.\nIn a world that is constantly changing, we must\nundertake in all diligence and determination to work\ntogether to set new balances, enable mankind\nharmoniously to manage its interdependence and make the\ninternational economic environment more conducive to\ndevelopment.\nBy its very nature and unique mission, the United\nNations is the appropriate place to give an articulate, joint\nglobal response to these challenges. Who better than the\nUnited Nations can carry out such a task at a time when\nmanaging interdependence is more than ever at the heart\nof the problems of development and peace?\n26\n\n\nThat is why we should come to an agreement on the\ndevelopment programme proposed by the Secretary-\nGeneral. This programme should support United Nations\nefforts for Africa. This is why the criteria for streamlining\nand efficiency which accompany the reform process in the\nUnited Nations system in the economic and social spheres\nshould be made manifest in a joint quest for common\nobjectives in organizing the new system of international\nrelations. It is by doing so and by finding further\ninspiration in its Charter that the United Nations will avoid\ndrifting off track and will become a more effective\ninstrument for the orderly reconstruction of international\nrelations and thereby provide the necessary stability for\npeace and development."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of my delegation,\nSir, I take pleasure in extending to you our heartfelt\nfelicitations on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. We in the\nPhilippines and in the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN) derive special gratification from\ncongratulating you, a citizen of an ASEAN country, on this\ngreat honour.\nThe Philippines pays tribute to Secretary-General\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, who has led our Organization in the\nmost difficult circumstances.\nI must beg your indulgence, Mr. President, and that of\nour colleagues to speak briefly about recent events in my\ncountry, developments which we consider historic, opening\na bright new chapter in the history of the Philippines.\nExactly a month ago, on 2 September, the Philippine\nGovernment and the Moro National Liberation Front\n(MNLF), which had waged a rebellion for more than a\nquarter of a century, signed an agreement ending the\nconflict in Mindanao and establishing a zone of peace and\ndevelopment in that island-region.\nOn 9 September, Professor Nur Misuari, leader of\nthe MNLF, ran for and was elected to the office of\nGovernor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim\nMindanao, which is, by virtue of a plebiscite, composed\nof four provinces in which Muslim Filipinos are in the\nmajority.\nAt the same time, in accordance with the 2\nSeptember agreement, the Southern Philippines Council\nfor Peace and Development is being organized under the\nleadership of the MNLF to help promote peace and\ndevelopment in 14 provinces and nine cities in the\nsouthern Philippines. Thus has the Philippines opted for\nnational reconciliation as the only true road to peace and\ndevelopment.\nHere, I pay tribute and give thanks to the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), and to the\nOIC\u2019s Committee of Six on the Situation of the Muslims\nin the Southern Philippines, under the wise and vigorous\nleadership of Indonesia and with the especially active\ninvolvement of Libya, for guiding us along that road\ntowards the goal which we have now achieved.\nI mention this because I know that what is\nessentially a domestic development in the Philippines\nfinds resonance in other places and in the world at large.\nWe all know only too well that conflicts arising\nfrom ethnic and cultural differences are not unique to the\nPhilippines. But just as the Mindanao conflict was not\nunique, neither was the process of reconciliation that\n\n\nended it. We consider the settlement in Mindanao a\nreflection of the salutary trend towards peace and\nreconciliation in the world, as well as a modest contribution\nto it.\nIn South Africa, the racist abomination that was\napartheid has been abolished, and a multiracial Government\nbased on the rule of the majority and the rights of the\nminority has been put in place, lending new stability to\nsouthern Africa.\nIn the Middle East, nations in contention agreed to\ntake the road of peace. Regrettably, recent events have\nshown that the road is still strewn with obstacles. We retain\nthe faith that these obstacles are surmountable with good\nwill and a firm conviction that peace must not be destroyed\nagain in a land so revered by people of many faiths. Our\nmost fervent prayers go to the leaders and nations involved\nthat they may soon return to the path of mutual\nunderstanding, reconciliation, justice and peace, for both the\nPalestinian and the Israeli peoples.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, we can at least hope that\nthe Dayton accords, as well as the 14 September and\nsubsequent elections, will put behind us the singular horror\nof \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and lead to a situation where different\nethnic groups can live once again in peace and tolerance.\nIn this hemisphere, the Government of Guatemala and\narmed dissidents have achieved an accord of security and\njustice.\nIn our own region of South-East Asia, we look\nforward to the completion of a new Constitution by\nMyanmar that will provide a place in the nation\u2019s political\nlife for the nationalities that have for so long been in\nrebellion and for political groups of many persuasions.\nUnfortunately, inter-ethnic conflicts in far too many\nplaces continue to inflict suffering on innocent people \u2014\nnotably, for example, in Rwanda and Burundi.\nAround the world, simmering beneath the surface, are\ngrievances arising from growing disparities in economic\nwell-being and social status within States and nations.\nHowever, on a global scale, there is a clear trend towards\nreconciliation and tolerance. As it is within nations, so is it\nbetween nations. We may be witnessing a new era, one not\nonly of relative peace but also of close cooperation in\ndealing with the global challenges of today.\nThe cold war has ended, and with it the deadly\nreality of armed confrontation between nuclear-armed\nblocs.\nEven the old North-South economic divide is being\nsubsumed in a new global trading regime and in regional\neconomic arrangements, such as the Asia-Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation, in which the interests of both\ndeveloped and developing countries are taken into\naccount. These developments in reconciliation and\ncooperation give us hope that mankind can find the will\nto work together in meeting the old and new challenges\nthat confront the world as a whole.\nI see six major challenges that are central to the\nfuture welfare and the very survival of mankind.\nThe first has to do with the surfeit of weapons that\ncontinues to plague the world, particularly the continued\ndeployment and development of nuclear arms and other\nweapons of mass destruction, the expanding volume of\nthe traffic in conventional arms and the continued\nproduction and persistent use of especially injurious\ndevices of war.\nThe second lies in the potential for conflict over\nmaritime jurisdictions and resources and the need for\nstable maritime regimes. Another is mankind\u2019s continuing\nassault on the environment, putting into question the\nsustainability of the world\u2019s development. Yet another\nchallenge is the need to maintain the momentum of the\nliberalization of international trade while cushioning\nweaker nations and vulnerable sectors of society from its\nundesirable effects. The fifth challenge is the necessity of\nensuring human welfare and dignity within the nation-\nState and within society. The sixth and last is the growing\nmenace of organized criminal gangs purveying terror,\ndeadly weapons, illicit drugs, indentured labour, and the\nbodies of our women and children across international\nborders.\nWe have made significant progress in the control of\narms; but the world remains a dangerous place, and much\nwork remains to be done. We have extended indefinitely\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT). Many of us have signed the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty that the General Assembly\nadopted last month. But we should not stop there, for\nthese are but steps on the road towards complete nuclear\ndisarmament. We continue to call upon the nuclear-\nweapon States to take seriously their commitment under\n2\n\n\nArticle VI of the NPT to negotiate in good faith the\nabolition of nuclear weapons.\nTowards this end, the Philippines once more joins the\ncall for the parties to the NPT to draw up an international\nconvention prohibiting the use and threat of use of nuclear\nweapons. As another step, we reiterate the call for the\nconclusion of an international convention against the\nproduction and stockpiling of fissile materials.\nSir, last December in Bangkok, your Prime Minister\nand my President, together with the Heads of Government\nof the eight other countries of South-East Asia, signed the\nSouth east Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone Treaty. We\nurge the nuclear-weapon States to commit themselves to\nrespect this Treaty\u2019s provisions by adhering to its protocol.\nTogether with the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear\nWeapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of\nTlatelolco), the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty\n(Treaty of Rarotonga), the Pelindaba Text of the African\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, and that for Antarctica,\nthe South-East Asian Treaty is a major step towards a\nsouthern hemisphere free of nuclear weapons. We support\nthe political linkage among these nuclear-free zones, as was\nrecently proposed.\nOf particular concern to us is the unacceptably large\nnumber of innocent persons, including a disproportionate\nnumber of young children, killed or maimed by landmines.\nThe Philippines has ratified the Convention and its Protocol\nrestricting the use of excessively injurious weapons,\nlandmines, booby traps and similar devices. We have joined\nthe move towards a global ban on anti-personnel mines.\nIn this spirit, President Ramos while on a visit last\nDecember to Cambodia, a country ravaged by landmines,\nordered the immediate destruction of the Claymore mines\nwhich were then still in the inventory of the armed forces\nof the Philippines. Compliance with the President\u2019s\ninstructions has been completed.\nAnother potential threat to global and regional peace\nand security has been the developing scramble for\njurisdiction, resources and strategic position in the world\u2019s\noceans. This has been strongly evident in the situation in\nthe South China Sea, which for the most part is surrounded\nby South-East Asian States.\nFortunately, the international community has had the\ncollective wisdom to agree on a set of rules, primarily in\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to\ngovern the use of the sea. Not least, the Convention\nsubjects maritime jurisdictions to the rule of law, defining\nthe nature and limits of those jurisdictions and providing\nthe legal framework for their establishment and for\nnegotiating settlements where they overlap.\nThe world is threatened not only by weapons of war\nand by disputes over territory, but also by mankind\u2019s\nassault on the world\u2019s fragile environment. The\nPhilippines is firmly committed to the protection of the\nenvironment within its national jurisdiction.\nEnvironmental protection is a vital consideration in the\napproval of major development projects. We shall\nconserve the ecological integrity of the Philippines\nexclusive economic zone as well as of its internal waters.\nAs an archipelagic country whose exclusive economic\nzone extends to a portion of the South China Sea, the\nPhilippines places particular importance on preserving the\necological integrity of that body of water, and would\nwelcome the sharing of knowledge and experience gained\nfrom efforts to protect the environment in similar bodies\nof water elsewhere in the world.\nA potential threat to the environment arises from the\ngrowing use of nuclear energy in the generation of\nelectricity. This growth has been particularly rapid in East\nAsia, producing nuclear waste with corresponding\nrapidity. While nuclear power is relatively clean as a\nsource of energy, accidents in the operation of nuclear\nplants and in the disposal of nuclear waste can cause\ndevastation for the environment as well as for human\nlives. Equally damaging is the reckless manner in which\ndecommissioned nuclear power plants and nuclear-\npowered vessels are discarded. It is time for the\ninternational community to address this burgeoning\nproblem with the seriousness and urgency that it deserves.\nLast May, President Ramos proposed the possible\norganization of ASIATOM, an international body to look\ninto this concern in East Asia and to devise measures to\ndeal with it.\nAlong with the breakup of empires, the dissolution\nof hostile alliances, and the spread of the spirit of\nreconciliation within and between nations, one salutary\nglobal development in recent years has been the\nestablishment of an international trading regime based on\nthe increasingly free exchange of goods and services. This\ndevelopment was made possible by the embrace by nearly\nall the world of market forces as the most efficient way\nof creating wealth for the world\u2019s people.\nThe efficacy of this principle of international\neconomic relations has been demonstrated in South-East\n3\n\n\nAsia, where countries have opened up their markets to one\nanother, through the Free Trade Area of the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations, and to the world for the benefit\nof all. Next month the Philippines will have the honour of\nhosting the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation Council (APEC), including an informal\nmeeting of leaders of the 18 participating economies on the\nPacific rim.\nAt that meeting, we will consolidate plans of\nindividual APEC economies into a coherent Manila action\nplan for APEC that will free up and ease trade, and that\nwill attain the target set for free trade by the year 2010 for\nthe developed participants and by 2020 for the developing\neconomies. The plan includes ways of engaging in\neconomic and technical cooperation, particularly in order to\nhelp the less developed economies to adjust to the free-\ntrade regime envisioned in APEC.\nA few weeks after the APEC meeting, the first\nMinisterial Meeting of the World Trade Organization, to be\nheld in Singapore, will review the implementation of the\nUruguay Round agreements and seek to develop a work\nprogramme to sustain the momentum of global trade\nliberalization through further negotiations on specific\nsectors.\nThe Philippines is strongly committed to the opening\nup of its economy. In affirming this basic policy of our\ncountry, we must ask our economic partners, particularly\nthe developed ones, to desist from circumventing their own\ncommitments to a free international trading regime by\nproviding subsidies to their uncompetitive sectors and by\nextending them protection in the guise of labour rights or\nenvironmental conservation. We must reject this kind of\ntactic.\nWe must also urge that the subject and object of\ndevelopment \u2014 human beings, their welfare and dignity \u2014\nnot be overlooked. We also believe that the status of\nwomen is central to both economic growth and human\ndevelopment. The Philippines therefore calls upon all of us\nto carry out effectively and in full the Platform of Action\nadopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women and to\ndevote adequate resources to make this possible.\nIn accordance with our convictions on the status and\nrights of women, validated at the Beijing conference, the\nPhilippines has actively pressed for international action to\ncombat those scourges that plague the human race: violence\nagainst women and trafficking in women and children.\nBecause of the international dimension of these blights on\nthe human condition, the United Nations and the\ninternational community must keep them high on the\ninternational agenda until the human race is freed of\nthem. The Philippines and other countries similarly\nsituated have a special concern for women migrant\nworkers because of their peculiar vulnerability to violence\nand abuse.\nThe Philippines\u2019 stand on the rights of women and\nchildren rests on our people\u2019s deep conviction of the\ninherent sacredness of the rights of all human persons,\nfamilies and communities everywhere on this planet \u2014\ntheir rights to freedom, dignity, participation in their own\ngovernance and to development.\nOur lives, our well-being and our rights are\nconstantly threatened by the activities of transnational\ncriminal gangs. Some of these gangs traffic in drugs.\nSome steal and smuggle cars. Some deal in the illicit\nbuying and selling of arms. Others engage in terror for a\nvariety of causes. Still others traffic in women, children,\nor people eager for work.\nThe Philippines is prepared to consider the draft\nconvention proposed by Poland on measures to combat\norganized crime. We commend Poland for this timely\ninitiative.\nThe United Nations is the keystone of mankind\u2019s\nefforts on behalf of disarmament, the rule of law in the\nworld\u2019s oceans, the preservation of the Earth and its\nenvironment, economic and social development, the fight\nagainst organized crime, and the protection of human\nrights. Because of its central and growing importance in\nhuman affairs, the Philippines firmly believes that the\nUnited Nations must be constantly renewed and\ninvigorated to enable it to respond to the challenges that\nface each generation.\nThe Philippines favours the enlargement of the\nSecurity Council\u2019s permanent membership through the\naddition of countries that are politically and economically\nable and willing to assume the responsibilities of such\nmembership. At the same time, we believe in greater\nrepresentation on the basis of equitable geographical\ndistribution. The various innovative proposals now on the\ntable deserve close examination. But the issue of\nmembership cannot be considered in isolation; it has to be\naddressed in the context of reform of the Security\nCouncil \u2014 reform towards greater transparency and\ndemocracy of its working methods and reform towards a\nmore balanced relationship with the General Assembly,\n4\n\n\nwhich must retain pre-eminence in the affairs of the United\nNations.\nHowever, no structural changes in the United Nations\nwill be effective unless it is assured of the necessary flow\nof financial resources. Our Organization, no matter how\nmuch reform takes place, can function effectively only if it\nknows with reasonable certainty whether and when it can\npay its staff and meet the other obligations arising from\noperations that, after all, are mandated, often unanimously,\nby the Member States themselves.\nSimple mathematical calculations will demonstrate that\nthe financial crisis of the United Nations cannot be eased\nunless we all comply with the financial obligations that we\nfreely undertook. We must pay our dues in full, on time\nand without conditions. Specifically, the United Nations can\nrest on fairly stable financial foundations if all of us pay\nour contributions to the regular budget for each year by the\nend of January of that year.\nThe Philippines favours a revision of the scale of\nassessments for United Nations contributions so as to\nreflect current political and economic circumstances.\nHowever, logic and consistency dictate that similar\nadjustments be made in the shares of the countries affected\nin the capitalization of the international financial\ninstitutions, including the World Bank and regional\ndevelopment banks such as the Asian Development Bank.\nThe world\u2019s peace, stability and progress, and the\nwelfare and dignity of its inhabitants, depend in large\nmeasure on the United Nations \u2014 not on the Secretary-\nGeneral or the Secretariat alone. Although their role is\ncrucial, they depend above all on us, the Member States,\nwhich, together with our peoples, make up the United\nNations. We are the United Nations. Let us make it work.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like first of all, on behalf of the\ndelegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea,\nto congratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his election as\nPresident. We are pleased that Malaysia, an Asian\ncountry, has assumed the presidency of the fifty-first\nsession of the General Assembly. We believe that the rich\nexperience he has gained in the course of dealing with\ninternational issues will crown the current session with\ngood results.\nI should also like to express my gratitude to\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, the former\nPresident, for his great contribution to the success of the\nprevious session of the General Assembly. My\nappreciation also goes to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his efforts devoted to\nstrengthening the United Nations.\nThe building of a new world free from all forms of\ndomination and subjugation, and aggression and war has\nlong been the common and cherished aspiration of the\nworld\u2019s peoples. However, domination and subjugation,\nand subordination and inequality still predominate in\ninternational relations \u2014 even today, after the end of the\ncold war \u2014 and this constitutes a great challenge to the\n20\n\n\nrealization of world peace and security and the\ndemocratization of international society.\nRecent developments in the international arena are\neloquent proof of the fact that every country should firmly\nmaintain its independence in order to safeguard its national\ndignity and rights and to build a free and prosperous world.\nFor the Korean people, the last half-century has been\na period of struggle and progress in their efforts to\nconsolidate and develop our style of socialism and to\nreunify the divided country despite all kinds of challenges\nand difficulties.\nThough caught in the vortex of the complex and\nfluctuating international situation surrounding the Korean\npeninsula, the Korean people have been able to march\nforward continuously along the road to socialism \u2014 which\nthey themselves chose \u2014 without any vacillation,\ndisappointment or vicissitude, despite the fact that on an\nuntrodden and poorly paved path, every step is difficult.\nThis has been possible because they have firmly maintained\nindependence in all domains of state-building on the basis\nof the Juche idea, the political philosophy of the Korean\npeople.\nThe Juche idea, based on the philosophical principle\nthat man is the master of everything and decides\neverything, regards the popular masses as the driving force\nof the socio-historical movement, and identifies the people\u2019s\nstruggle for independence, sovereignty and development as\nthe way to realize their independence. We have carried out\nour independent policy on the basis of the Juche idea,\nrelying on the strength of our own people. In international\nrelations, we have firmly adhered to the principle of not\ninfringing upon the sovereignty of others and of not having\nour own sovereignty violated.\nAt a time when international relations and the situation\nare becoming increasingly complicated, it becomes ever\nmore important for a small country like ours firmly to\nmaintain an independent stand. The Juche philosophy,\ncreated by the fatherly leader Comrade Kim Il Sung, the\nfounding father of our socialist Korea, and our independent\npolicy, based on this philosophy, have been credibly\nfollowed by the great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il. The\ngreat leader Comrade Kim Jong Il has guided wisely all the\naffairs of our Party, State and army for more than three\ndecades, and thus has consolidated and developed our\nunique style of socialism into an indestructible one.\nThe leader and the people are firmly united in one\nidea and will, and the independent policy based on the\nJuche idea has deep roots in our territory. As a result,\nthere has been neither a political vacuum nor instability\nin our society, and our style of socialism is advancing\nvigorously, regardless of what others may say.\nIt is the greatest fortune and happiness for our\npeople to have the respected Comrade Kim Jong Il, the\noutstanding politician and iron-willed brilliant\nCommander, as the supreme leader of the Party and State\nand the Supreme Commander of the revolutionary armed\nforces. Under the wise leadership of the great leader\nComrade Kim Jong Il, our people will make their country\nprosperous and realize the fatherly leader's lifelong\nteachings on reunification, convinced of the victory of our\nstyle of socialism.\nWe hold that the question of national reunification\nshould also be settled in the interests of the Korean nation\nin the context of the maintenance of international peace\nand security, based on the specific conditions of our\ncountry. In view of current realities in the North and\nSouth of Korea, characterized by different ideas and\nsystems, national reunification through confederation is\nthe only way to achieve a great national unity\nindependently and peacefully, on the principle of neither\nside conquering or being conquered by the other. It is\nquite natural that the proposal for national reunification\nthrough confederation set forth by Comrade Kim Il Sung,\nthe fatherly leader of our people, enjoys worldwide\nsupport.\nThe pressing issue in the realization of national\nreunification through confederation on the Korean\npeninsula is the establishment of a new institutional\nmechanism for easing tensions and ensuring peace and\nsecurity. Since the Armistice Agreement, signed in 1953,\nand the Military Armistice Commission, the executive\nbody of the Agreement, remain paralysed by unilateral\nmeasures on the part of the United States, the\nestablishment of a new peace arrangement is imperative\nin order to avert the danger of accidental conflicts, and\nfor the maintenance of security on the Korean peninsula.\nAccordingly, in April 1994 the Government of the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea advanced a\nproposal for the establishment of a new peace\narrangement to replace the outdated system of Korean\narmistice in ensuring peace and security on the Korean\npeninsula. It also advanced in February of this year an\nepoch-making proposal to conclude an interim agreement\n21\n\n\nbetween the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the\nUnited States, a proposal that delineates in detail a new\npeace arrangement that takes account of the United States\npolicy towards Korea and the present status of Democratic\nPeople's Republic of Korea-United States bilateral relations.\nThe interim agreement may include issues concerning\nthe management of the Military Demarcation Line and\nDemilitarized Zone; ways of addressing cases of armed\nconflict and accidents; the composition, duties and terms of\nreference of a joint military body; and other issues related\nto the maintenance of security and order.\nThe United States and South Korean authorities,\nhowever, replied to our peace-loving proposal by\naggravating tensions with large-scale war exercises and an\narms build-up on the Korean peninsula. This situation\nurgently requires the establishment of a legitimate channel\nfor contacts between military personnel, with a view to\npreventing accidental armed conflicts and the recurrence of\nwar. It is on the basis of this consideration that the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea proposed to the\nUnited States working negotiations for talks relating to the\nconclusion of the interim agreement, and the establishment\nof an interim mechanism responsible for its implementation,\nbetween the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and\nUnited States military authorities, the real parties to the\nKorean Armistice Agreement.\nThere is no doubt that the conclusion of an interim\nagreement between the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea and the United States will constitute a breakthrough\nfor the negotiations on the signing of an agreement aimed\nat the maintenance of a durable peace, and it will, in turn,\neventually lead to the creation of an atmosphere favourable\nfor the implementation of the Agreement on Reconciliation,\nNon-Aggression and Exchanges and Cooperation, between\nthe North and South, adopted by the North and South of\nKorea.\nIf the United States is truly interested in the\nmaintenance of peace on the Korean peninsula, as it\nmentioned while proposing the \u201cfour-party talks\u201d, it should\nbe willing to withdraw United States troops from South\nKorea. On the other hand, the United Nations should take\nits own measures, without delay, to retrieve its name and\nflag from United States troops in South Korea, thus helping\nto establish a new peace arrangement on the Korean\npeninsula.\nThe existence of the United Nations Command in\nSouth Korea constitutes a legal obstacle to turning the state\nof armistice into a durable peace and terminating the cold\nwar on the Korean peninsula. The United Nations\nCommand was not established by a United Nations\nresolution. It is only a product of the cold-war era, which\ncame into existence through the abuse of the name of the\nUnited Nations. The United Nations Command has moved\ntowards dissolution without any United Nations\nresolutions during the post-war period, and consequently\nonly United States troops remain there today.\nThis stark fact presents a vivid illustration of the fact\nthat the \u201cUS-ROK Joint Command\u201d is usurping the\nhelmets of United Nations forces and the name of the\nUnited Nations.\nIn the past two years since the adoption of the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea-United States\nFramework Agreement, we have been sincerely fulfilling\nour obligations under the Agreement, as we have shown\nby freezing all of our nuclear facilities. For the full\nimplementation of the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea-United States Framework Agreement, which is\naimed at the fundamental resolution of the nuclear issue\non the Korean peninsula, the United States should, among\nother things, fulfil its obligations, including lifting\neconomic sanctions against the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea; and the present Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea-United States relationship of\nconfrontation should be transformed into a relationship\nbased on trust.\nThere is also a need for several other countries\npursuing unfriendly policies towards the Democratic\nPeople's Republic of Korea to change their attitudes,\nwhich would certainly be conducive to facilitating a\nresolution of the issue. We will make every effort to\nensure peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in\nthe region of North-East Asia.\nOn this occasion, I wish to express my deep\ngratitude to the Governments of various countries, the\naffiliated organs and specialized agencies of the United\nNations system, including the Department of\nHumanitarian Affairs, non-governmental organizations,\nand individuals for their moral, material and humanitarian\nassistance and encouragement to our people, which have\nbeen provided in the hope of removing, as quickly as\npossible, the damage caused in recent years by successive\nnatural disasters.\nIn order to eliminate the legacies of the cold-war\nera, which has been negated by history, and to enable all\n22\n\n\ncountries and nations to exercise their sovereignty on an\nequal footing, international society should be democratized.\nThe United Nations should, first of all, be restructured into\na democratized Organization. The restructuring of the\nUnited Nations should be undertaken in a way that will\nfully represent the interests of developing countries, which\nform the majority of United Nations Member States, and\nalso ensure the exercise of their sovereignty in the process\nof resolving major international issues.\nOnly when the United Nations is restructured will it be\nable to do its part in the maintenance of international peace\nand security and ensure democracy and impartiality in its\nactivities. The priority for the democratization of the United\nNations is to enhance the authority of the General\nAssembly, the body in which all Member States are\nrepresented equally. We consider that issues relating to\ninternational peace and security should be brought directly\nto the General Assembly for deliberation, and that a new\nsystem should be established to endorse Security Council\nresolutions on the use of force, sanctions and peace-keeping\noperations. Such measures would enable the Security\nCouncil to give full consideration to the interests of\nMember States and thus prevent the adverse effects suffered\nby many countries as a result of the implementation of\nSecurity Council resolutions.\nThe restructuring of the Security Council is the most\nessential element in the democratization of the United\nNations. There are a number of issues to be resolved in\nrestructuring the Security Council, and we consider it\nreasonable to proceed with the restructuring gradually,\nbased on the principle of first finding issues on which\nagreement can be reached and achieving consensus on each\nof them. From this viewpoint, we believe that consensus\nmay be reached on issues concerning the enlargement of\nthe non-permanent membership of the Security Council and\nthe improvement of its working methods, both of which\nhave already been agreed upon in principle by Member\nStates.\nIn this regard, our delegation considers that it is\npossible for Member States to agree upon, above all, issues\nsuch as offsetting the imbalance in regional distribution\nthrough an increase of more than 10 seats in the\nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council, to be\nallocated among the regions of Asia, Africa and Latin\nAmerica, and through providing the countries concerned,\nincluding the parties to disputes, with access to informal\nconsultations of the Security Council.\nJapan is taking advantage of the proposed\nenlargement of the permanent membership of the Security\nCouncil by attempting to become a permanent member\neven though, as a defeated State of the Second World\nWar, it has failed to make an appropriate apology or\nprovide compensation for its war crimes but, instead, is\ntrying to justify them after more than half a century has\npassed. This makes a mockery of Member States,\nparticularly the Asian countries.\nDisarmament \u2014 especially nuclear disarmament \u2014\nremains one of the most important problems for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We\nbelieve that the nuclear-weapon States should provide\nnegative security assurances to the non-nuclear-weapon\nStates, commit themselves to the non-use of nuclear\nweapons, and draw up and implement a timetable for\ntheir complete abolition.\nDespite the end of the cold war, regional, religious\nand ethnic disputes are being further aggravated in\nvarious parts of our planet, and consequently world peace\nand security are gravely disturbed and peoples are\nsuffering from untold misfortunes resulting from them. It\nis our consistent stand that disputes between countries and\nnations should be settled immediately through dialogue\nand negotiation in the interests of the parties concerned\nand in conformity with international peace and security.\nAt present, the maintenance of peace and security in\nNorth-East Asia is one of the most vitally important\nproblems. In order to ensure peace and security in North-\nEast Asia, the arms race and any attempt aimed at\nfostering military collusion with outside forces should be\nbrought to an end. However, the military collusion\nbetween the United States and Japan is being intensified,\nand furthermore, the United States, Japan and South\nKorea are becoming less disguised in their attempt to\nbuild up a tripartite military alliance by repeatedly\nlaunching joint military exercises in this region on the\npretext of North Korea\u2019s so-called invasion.\nIn particular, the arms race is further accelerated\nbecause the Japanese authorities are resorting to the\nunreasonable policy of trying to become a military super-\nPower, building up their arms and developing nuclear\nweapons. We strongly urge the Japanese authorities to end\ntheir confrontational acts against the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea, including an arms build-up under the\nveil of an \u201cimmediate response in case of emergency\u201d.\n23\n\n\nThe question of social and economic development is\ndirectly linked with international peace and security, and its\nresolution is therefore one of the important tasks before the\nUnited Nations. We hope that agreement will soon be\nreached on issues with regard to the implementation of the\ncommitment to official development assistance and the\nalleviation of external debt, thereby facilitating the\ncompletion of the Agenda for Development at the earliest\npossible date in the Ad Hoc Open-Ended Working Group\non an Agenda for Development.\nWe consider that reform of the United Nations in the\nfields of social and economic development should be\ndirected towards strengthening the agencies responsible for\ndevelopment cooperation under the United Nations system,\nthereby contributing to accelerating the implementation of\nthe declarations and action plans for the development of\ndeveloping countries.\nThe application of \u201cselectivity\u201d, which relates\ndevelopment cooperation and technology transfer to\nquestions of \u201chuman rights\u201d and \u201cterrorism\u201d, should no\nlonger be tolerated, and measures such as economic\nsanctions should be eliminated to ensure the economic\ndevelopment of Member States and regions.\nThe Government of our Republic, which regards the\nman-centred Juche idea as its guiding idea, is providing all\nits people with political, economic and cultural rights and\nlegally protecting the lives and dignity of human beings.\nWe reject the politicization of human rights, which abuses\nthe \u201cquestion of human rights\u201d in order to infringe upon\nthe sovereignty of other countries, and we oppose all\nforms of terrorism jeopardizing human lives, as well as\nany activities encouraging or assisting terrorist acts.\nToday, all justice-loving and peace-loving countries\nand nations are making active efforts to establish a new\nworld order and equitable international economic relations\nfor the twenty-first century. We express our appreciation\nto the Asian countries in their efforts to ensure peace and\nstability and to achieve common prosperity in their\nregions. It is good that the Asia-Europe meeting, held\nearly in 1996, agreed upon the strengthening of economic\nlinks and cooperation between the continents.\nWe support the Arab and Syrian people in their\neffort to strengthen unity and cooperation, and to achieve\na fair and comprehensive resolution of the Middle-East\nquestion, including the Palestinian issue, and we express\nsolidarity with the Libyan people in their struggle to\ndefend the sovereignty of their country.\nWe appreciate the efforts of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity to resolve social and economic issues and\ndisputes in the African region. We express solidarity with\nthe just cause of the Cuban people to lift the blockade\nagainst Cuba, and, with the Latin American people in\ntheir endeavours for peace and prosperity in their region.\nWe will continue as before to develop relations of\nfriendship and cooperation with all countries of the world\non the basis of ideas of independence, peace and\nfriendship and will endeavour to fulfil the obligations\nentrusted to us in the achievement of the common cause\nof humankind for world peace and security under the wise\nleadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il.\nThe delegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea will make sincere efforts towards the successful\noutcome of the debates on the agenda items before this\nsession of the General Assembly."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am pleased to speak before\nthe Assembly of this universal Organization, where virtually\nevery country in the world, small or vast, rich or poor, has\na voice, thus making democracy work in international\nrelations.\nAt the outset, I should like warmly to congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election to your honourable office. I note\nwith pleasure that your diplomatic career includes a term as\nAmbassador of Malaysia to my country. The delegation of\nPoland will do its best to assist you in your important\nfunctions. Let me also pay tribute to Mr. Diogo Freitas do\nAmaral, an eminent statesman from Portugal, for the\nexcellent manner in which he presided over the work of the\nAssembly during its fiftieth anniversary session. May I\nalso express the assurance of my highest appreciation to\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\nAs a representative of Poland, a country that has\nsuffered so much war, foreign occupation and partition in\nits history of more than 1,000 years, I feel entitled to\nconvey a simple message: peace is priceless, be it\ninternational, with other countries, or internal, among\nsocial partners. To endure, peace needs solid economic\nfoundations, sustainable development and growth. Yet\npeace remains a supreme value and a precondition of life,\nrightly recognized from the outset as a principal objective\nof the United Nations.\nMy country\u2019s very recent experience shows that it is\npossible to undertake a profound transformation of a\nwhole political and economic structure, to defuse a\npotential internal conflict through peaceful negotiation.\nHaving regained full national sovereignty, we were able\nto reshape our foreign policy in accordance with the\nnational interest, to reorient it towards the Euro-Atlantic\nstructures and to establish and strengthen good-\nneighbourly relations with the newly created and/or\nprofoundly transformed States that now surround us. Is\nthere another country in the world which, in just a few\nyears, has seen all of its neighbours, without exception,\nchange and not as a result of conflict? Sometimes we hear\nopinions on an alleged lack of stability in our region,\nCentral Europe. But it is not true. The case of Poland,\nwith its stabilizing influence in the region, tells quite a\ndifferent story.\n\n\nI am proud to report to you, Mr. President, that we\nhave accomplished a lot in the last seven years. Not only\nhave we built a sound foundation for a new economic and\npolitical system, but we have also succeeded in stopping\nour economic decline and have achieved, now for the fourth\nyear in a row, a high rate of economic growth, which has\nencouraged the media to add the Polish eagle to countries\nnicknamed \u201ceconomic tigers\u201d. This has been achieved\nthrough an enormous effort on the part of our people, who\nhave proved mature enough to pay the price of economic\ntransformation. We have opened up the economy and the\ncountry. Tens of millions of tourists are pouring in every\nyear, and millions of Poles travel abroad in all directions.\nWe have become an attractive place for foreign investment,\nwhich exceeds $10 billion, and we are working on further\nimproving the conditions in which investment can thrive.\nIt is not my intention to minimize the challenges we\nstill face. Yet I strongly believe in our future. The time has\ncome for Poland, which received help and encouragement\nfrom so many countries during its \u201cSolidarity\u201d revolution\nand its historic peaceful transformation based on a political\nand social contract, to offer its help to other countries that\nundertake great processes of transformation. We can share\nour experience, the services of our companies, and the work\nof our experts in various fields where transformation is a\nmust. As an Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD) member, Poland is determined to\nbecome much more involved than heretofore in assisting\nthe developing countries and those in transition.\nOur priority in terms of foreign policy is to join the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the\nEuropean Union. While seeking these memberships, we\ntreasure friendly relations and multifaceted cooperation with\nour neighbours, Russia among them. At the same time,\nPoland is fully conscious of its duty to carry its part of the\nobligations as a member of the world community, as\nmanifested by our active participation in the work of the\nUnited Nations and currently as a non-permanent member\nof the Security Council. For many years, Poland has\ntraditionally been among the 10 States fielding the largest\ncontingents in United Nations peace-keeping operations.\nPermit me to make a personal remark. I made the\nappeal \u201cLet Us Choose the Future\u201d into the slogan for my\n1995 election campaign. May I suggest making this\nappeal \u2014 choosing, and looking into, the future while\nlearning from our common past \u2014 here in the United\nNations? Old enmities and hatred, both among and within\nStates, should no longer cast a shadow on the construction\nof our common future.\nLet me give as an example Poland\u2019s proposal to\ndelete from the United Nations Charter the so-called\nenemy States clause. Indeed, Poland now has close,\nfriendly relations with its long-time adversary, Germany.\nAs a tribute to history, we plan to carry out soon joint\nmanoeuvres of German and Polish military units, and to\ncontemplate establishing a joint Blue Helmets brigade\nconsisting of Polish and German soldiers. Would that not\nconstitute the best signum temporis possible?\nThis Organization is in acute need of reform to adapt\nto the challenges of the next century. There is a pressing\nneed for the United Nations to confront the future. Its\nduty remains to make its Member States aware of global\nproblems as they arise, to analyse them, and to help\nresolve them through multilateral cooperation. To make\nthis happen, much more is needed than the mere\nrestructuring of its intergovernmental bodies and the\nSecretariat. Bolstering efficiency in carrying out United\nNations tasks through rational downsizing where possible\nand necessary is not the only major requirement. More\nimportantly, it is high time to adapt the United Nations\nwork programme through innovation and redeployment.\nFor instance, in Poland\u2019s view the United Nations\nshould enhance and upgrade its potential in the field of\nthe protection of human rights through the establishment\nof a General Assembly committee on human rights and\nhumanitarian affairs, while merging the existing Second\nand Third Committees into an economic and social one,\nand through the elaboration by the Secretary-General of\nan agenda on human rights. In addition, in a more long-\nterm perspective, the creation of a new main body such\nas a human rights council might be contemplated.\nThe United Nations is expected to help parties in\nconflict to reach agreement and achieve a just peace. But\npeace-keeping forces are useless if there is no will for\npeace in the hearts of fighters. It is necessary to\nencourage the easing of ethnic, religious and other\ntensions before they erupt, or if they already have, after\nresolving the conflict. That is why it is vital to expand\npreventive action, including diplomatic efforts and post-\nconflict peace-building as well as assistance for\nreconstruction and development. We are ready to offer\nour diplomats, international lawyers, and social and\neconomic development experts for preventive United\nNations missions and post-conflict assistance efforts.\nAt the same time it seems essential to address the\nquestion of United Nations rapid reaction, including rapid-\ndeployment potential, both in the headquarters and in the\n2\n\n\nfield. We have notified the Secretary-General of our intent\nto make available for the rapid reaction component of the\nstand-by arrangements our special GROM (Thunder) force,\nwhich proved itself in the Haiti operation. Poland considers\nit timely to re-focus the Organization\u2019s attention on\npreventive diplomacy and rapid-reaction capability. To\nprevent as much as possible and react as quickly as\npossible \u2014 this is what is increasingly needed in\ncontemporary conflicts.\nIndeed, do we always have to helplessly witness\nworldwide bloodshed and misery, so readily served up by\nthe media, and only afterwards try to help, when it is too\nlate and more costly, when more money brings less benefit\nand whereas an earlier joint action could have saved a lot\nof blood and tears for so many countries and peoples? Why\ndo we not ponder how to substitute a strategy of prevention\nand advance action for one of late reaction ex post facto?\nThis strategy could go beyond a conservative doctrine of\nthe maintenance of peace and security, covering a rapid and\nselective reaction to potential threats arising among and\nwithin Member States, as well as the consolidation of peace\nwhen it is painfully achieved.\nI turn now to the crucial issues of the post-cold-war\nera: disarmament, arms reduction and averting the spread of\narms through non-proliferation. Poland, which now holds\nthe presidency of the Conference on Disarmament,\nwelcomed with great satisfaction the submission to the\nAssembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty,\nand the adoption of the resolution, of which we were\namong the sponsors. We now look forward to the broad\nendorsement of the Treaty, which I had the privilege of\nsigning this morning. We must not allow the arduous\nefforts of so many States to be wasted. While keeping in\nmind the need for eventual nuclear disarmament, partial\nsteps towards that goal should be given full approval as\nthey bring it closer and make the world safer, as would the\nentry into force of another important legal instrument: the\nchemical weapons Convention. Chemical weapons are\nsometimes called the nuclear bombs of the poor.\nRecent conflicts, however, have shown that mass\ndestruction can also result from conventional arms, the\nstockpiles of which have grown enormously. That is why\nwe welcome the parallel focus on such arms, including so-\ncalled micro-disarmament, and an early total ban on the use\nof anti-personnel landmines.\nIf the United Nations wants to remain meaningful in\nthe key areas of its mandate, to be ahead of events,\nforeseeing and not merely reacting, slowly and\ninadequately, to what life brings with the astounding pace\ntypical of our times, it should grasp and cope with the\ninteractive relationship between peace, development and\nhuman rights protection.\nAll these changes can have the desired effect only in\nconditions of sustained financing of programmed\nactivities. Political will is not enough. The current\nfinancial crisis is propitious neither for the execution of\nsuch activities nor for reform. To enable the Organization\nto fulfil its statutory tasks and to reform, its financial\ncredibility needs to be restored. Member States should not\ndiscount innovative ideas for supplementary financing,\nwhich could enable more activities to take place,\nespecially in support of developing countries, those in\ntransition, and conflict-ridden countries. Since\nGovernments are more often than not reluctant to increase\ntheir dues or their voluntary contributions, or to allow any\nform of international taxation on their companies and\ncitizens, additional funds could be sought from the private\nsector.\nFor instance, the idea of a United Nations trust fund\nfinanced by tax-free donations, mainly from transnational\ncorporations, could be examined. After all, stability\ncombined with economic growth and social peace also\nbenefit such companies. Should their host Governments\ncreate encouraging conditions for them to contribute, such\nas common rules for tax reduction, the United Nations\nmight acquire additional sources of funding, especially for\nhumanitarian and development support activities. Such a\nsolution would in no way affect the governmental\ncharacter of the Organization if control over the allocation\nof the newly acquired additional resources rested with\nGovernments, and if no conditionality could be introduced\nby donors.\nI would now like to draw the attention of the\nAssembly to what I consider one of the most important\naspects of my statement. I witnessed the terrorist attack at\nthe Olympic Games in Atlanta in July, and cannot forget\nfaces expressing shock and tragedy.\nPoland is a country that has struggled over centuries\nfor its own freedom and that of others. We have finally\nachieved well-earned greatness and the benefits of\ndemocracy. However, our nation is also paying a heavy\ntoll for those benefits: open frontiers and increased\nmigration of people pose threats to the security and well-\nbeing of my compatriots. Organized crime distorts the\nimage of democratic societies on a national, regional and\n3\n\n\nglobal plane. To combat it, we need the solidarity of all\nStates, and a concerted effort by all of us.\nThe international community is faced with the growing\nthreat arising from seemingly unstoppable manifestations of\ntransnational organized crime and international terrorism,\nwhich menace both the material and institutional\nfoundations of our societies. What is especially dangerous\nfor us and for future generations is that in so many cases\nwe have been unable to bring criminals to justice. Justice\nhas been neither done nor seen to be done.\nI have received reports that my own country, and the\nwhole region, faces a steep increase in drug trafficking,\nslavery, trade in child sex, and money laundering.\nOrganized crime is a worldwide phenomenon. It brings\ntragedy and suffering to many \u2014 the immediate victims\nand other innocent people. But it does more: organized\ncrime leads to the creation of illegal associations and\nbusinesses that infiltrate and undermine legitimate economic\ninterests and political structures. Organized crime is like a\nform of corrosion in societies. Organized crime corrupts\nStates. Organized crime is a cancer in our communities, a\ncancer that we should fight together. Alone, we risk losing\nthe battle and endangering our security.\nI am convinced that only a worldwide effort under\nUnited Nations auspices has any prospect of stopping these\ncrimes, which threaten democratic freedoms and democracy\nitself. Poland believes, therefore, that the time has come to\nmake a concerted international effort to agree on, and\naccede to a comprehensive legal instrument: a convention\ndesigned to enhance cooperation between States and\nfacilitate the work of law enforcement agencies in fighting\ntransnational organized crime. I have the privilege to submit\nto this Assembly a draft framework convention against\norganized crime. It is annexed to the text of my statement,\nwhich has been distributed to members.\nThe Assembly will note that the draft convention deals\nwith illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances and\nmoney laundering; traffic in persons; counterfeiting\ncurrency; illicit traffic in or stealing of cultural objects;\nstealing and smuggling nuclear material, and the misuse or\nthreat of misuse of such material to harm the public;\nterrorist acts; illicit traffic in or stealing of arms and\nexplosive materials or devices; illicit traffic in or stealing of\nmotor vehicles; and corruption of public officials.\nThe draft text proposes a system of cooperation\nbetween Member States to combat organized crime. It calls\nfor States either to punish offenders or to extradite them.\nWe ask States to introduce criminal liability for people\nwho derive profits from organized crime, wherever such\nliability is not already clear. We believe that we should\nmake United Nations agencies and regional and global\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations play a\ngreater role in combatting organized crime.\nThe draft framework convention is by no means\ncarved in stone. We call on Member States to discuss and\nimprove the text. We hope that the Assembly will\ndetermine modalities to assure its speedy and successful\nelaboration. I am sure that our common effort will help to\nsave our societies from the scourge of organized crime.\nApproaching the end of the century, the planet is\nvisibly in turmoil despite the otherwise universally\nwelcomed end of East-West confrontation and of the\never-present threat of global conflict. Yet even in the\nheart of Europe, we are painfully aware of conflicts, wars,\ntragedies, massive disasters, famine and serious economic\ndifficulties. People often expect the United Nations to\noffer a miraculous remedy for all the evils of the world\nand to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the\ndignity and worth of the human person, and in the equal\nrights of men and women, and of nations large and small.\nIf we just adhere to the Charter, the high roads will\nbe clear, not only for our time but for the coming century.\nWe must not betray the high expectations held of the\nUnited Nations. For its part, Poland will not fail to\ncontinue to support the Organization. In today\u2019s\ninterdependent world, we need a global body to settle our\ndifferences and to ensure orderly global governance to\navert threats to humanity. There is no point in reinventing\nthe wheel. We are able to adapt what we already have to\nwhat we need now and in the years to come. In essence,\nwe are looking forward to a more united United Nations\nwhich has chosen the future. As an original Member\nState, Poland stands prepared to contribute its share to\nmaking such an endeavour a reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Sri Lanka and Malaysia have long enjoyed the\nwarmest ties of friendship. We congratulate the President,\nand offer him our unstinted support. We also wish to\nexpress our appreciation of the contribution made to the\nsuccess of the historic fiftieth session by His Excellency\nDiogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal.\nLast year at our Special Commemorative Meeting we\npledged to bequeath to the twenty-first century a United\nNations equipped, financed and structured to serve\neffectively the people in whose name it was established.\nThis pledge we must not fail to honour. The peoples of the\nworld will be watching us closely during this session and\nthereafter to see how well we are proceeding to redeem the\npromise we made last year in such fine phrases and\nrhetoric.\nThe financial constraints confronting the\nOrganization have tempered the once heady enthusiasm\namong nations for radical reform. Sober pragmatic\nconclusions now seem inevitable. Yet we must remember\nthat our task, as Sri Lanka\u2019s President pointed out last\nyear, is to:\n\u201cenhance the capacity of the United Nations, rather\nthan merely effect economies and scale down its\nscope.\u201d (Official Records of the General Assembly,\nFiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 35th meeting,\np. 9)\nA viable resource base for the United Nations can be\nassured not only by effecting greater financial\nresponsibility and sound management, but also, more\nurgently, by a serious commitment by all Members to\nhonour the financial obligations they are bound to comply\nwith within the terms of the Charter.\nWe agree that the Secretariat of our Organization\nneeds to be rationalized further. The Organization is now,\nI believe, sufficiently mature to effect cuts where cuts are\ndue. Programmes affecting developing countries need to\nbe lean, effective and sustainable, which is not the same\nas saying they should not be touched. Prudent, well-\nconceived economies could be, and have been, put into\neffect. We must reform, not deform, the Organization.\nAbove all, the United Nations desperately needs a sound\nfinancial base. Without that, there will be no prospect of\nbuilding the streamlined, efficient and effective world\nOrganization that we all dream of. We will merely waste\nour time and energy building castles in the air.\n\n\nThe working groups on the question of equitable\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\nSecurity Council and on the strengthening of the United\nNations system have made some progress, although no\nfinality has been reached in regard to the main areas of\nfocus. We believe, however, that these efforts should\ncontinue. We should redouble our energies to reach\nconsensus.\nThe main organs of the United Nations, it must be\nemphasized, will be credible and effective only to the\nextent that they secure the confidence of the general\nmembership and ensure that their decisions enjoy general\nacceptance. With regard to the Security Council, it is our\nview that today\u2019s political and economic realities, rather\nthan yesterday\u2019s military power, need to be reflected in any\ndecisions to be taken on questions such as that of the\npermanent membership of the Council and the enlargement\nof its overall membership.\nThe United Nations must neither master nor servant\nbe.\nFirst, despite fashionable theories about the need to\nlimit national sovereignty, the members of the Organization\nremain sovereign, independent States. Each State, however\nsmall and weak it may be, jealously guards its sovereignty.\nHence, where the United Nations intervenes, it should do so\nexpressly within the terms of the Charter. The consent and\ncooperation of States are vital to ensure the success of any\nUnited Nations endeavour which impinges on the territory\nof a Member State. Only such an approach would guarantee\nthe safety and security of United Nations personnel and the\nwelfare and interests of the people in the receiving State.\nIn playing its role in conflict resolution and\npeacemaking, it is important that our Organization should\nnot stray into domestic issues and conflicts which are\nwithin the domestic jurisdiction of the States concerned.\nThe Organization should play its role only with the\nacceptance of the countries concerned. This position arises\nfrom the simple logic that the States concerned are best\nequipped, in the first instance, to deal with these issues,\nbeing familiar with the socio-economic milieu in which\nthey arise. Otherwise, United Nations action could be\ncounter-productive and could lead even to the exacerbation\nof conflicts. Nor should United Nations mandates be used\nto serve the interests of any one State or group of States.\nThe United Nations must not be used as a franchise to give\nlegitimacy to causes that may not reflect the general will of\nthe membership, on whose behalf the Security Council\nshould act at all times.\nNow more than ever before we must reaffirm our\ncollective respect for the fundamental principles of the\nCharter of the United Nations. The smaller nations of the\nworld must receive constant reassurance from the larger\nnations that their interests will be safeguarded and their\nsovereignty respected. The smaller nations have only the\nUnited Nations to look to for the protection of their\nnational interests.\nFirst, translated into practical terms, developing\ncountries, which are under-represented, need to have their\nnumbers increased in the Security Council. Secondly,\nthere are Member States in the Organization which\nadvance arguments to support permanent seats in the\nCouncil no less cogent than the arguments tendered 50\nyears ago to justify the special status of the current five\npermanent members.\nMy delegation also notes the useful discussions that\nhave taken place on the subject of \u201cAn Agenda for\nPeace\u201d. We feel that further work needs to be done in this\narea.\nThe subject matter of the Agenda for Development\nis of crucial importance. It underlies the central role of\nour Organization in the field of economic cooperation and\ndevelopment. While noting the progress that has been\nachieved in this endeavour, we should reiterate our\ncommitment to move speedily in this area which vitally\nconcerns the economic advancement and stability of\ndeveloping countries.\nI turn now to the problem of terrorism. The epithet\n\u201cterrorist\u201d has been too often hurled unjustifiably at\ngenuine national liberation movements, those, for\ninstance, which struggled against foreign occupation and\napartheid. The legitimacy of such organizations has been\nrecognized by the United Nations. They are organizations\nwhich have sat with us here to discuss the issues which\nhad compelled them to armed action. We are happy to see\nthose true movements of the people now occupying seats\nin this Organization as full Members. We should not\nspend time seeking to evolve a comprehensive definition\nof terrorism, lest we become helplessly mired in a\nsemantic minefield. An international consensus against\nterrorism, based on the recognition of stark reality, has\nmatured over the years. It is imperative now to implement\nthat consensus.\nThe world is aware that Sri Lanka has been racked\nwith the anguish of a violent ethnic conflict which has\nsapped our energies for almost two decades. We have\n2\n\n\nbeen dealing for many years with an armed group which\nseeks to dismember our country by violent means, resorting\nto terrorism as a means of achieving this illegitimate goal.\nThis group \u2014 the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam\n(LTTE) \u2014 has been perpetrating a series of terroristic acts,\ncausing death and destruction in many parts of my country.\nThis extremist group does not in any meaningful sense\nrepresent the people they claim to fight for. They have\nnever sought a mandate from the people at an election.\nThey have kept out of the democratic mainstream, when\nmany of the minority parties have entered the consultative\nprocess to seek redress for their grievances through\ndemocratic means.\nWe are working on a set of proposals introduced by\nmy Government to address minority grievances, which\nincludes far reaching constitutional changes.\nThe LTTE does not believe in the path of peaceful\nnegotiations, having put their faith in the power of the gun.\nThe peace process, they fear, would marginalize them;\nhence the recourse to increased violence. We are aware\nthat \u2014 in terms of finance, equipment and war mat\u00e9riel \u2014\nthis group draws support from persons outside our country,\nbut not from other States. There is not a single State that\nsupports them either in word or deed. They receive support\nfrom misguided members of the Tamil community who live\nand work in the affluent countries, or through extortion,\ndrug trafficking, gun-running, people-smuggling or other\nillegal activities in many developed countries, in abuse of\nthe hospitality of the host Governments and in violation of\ntheir laws.\nIn Sri Lanka, the terrorists have deliberately targeted\ncivilians. They have bombed a rush-hour commuter train\nand busy office buildings and have shot up rural villages,\ncausing the death of thousands of innocent civilians,\nincluding large numbers of women and children. Many\nthousands have been injured and maimed. As Sri Lanka\u2019s\nPresident emphasized last year at the fiftieth-anniversary\nsession, concerted international action is essential to combat\nterrorism and compel terrorists to renounce violence.\nOn that occasion President Clinton remarked that no\none was immune from terrorism.\nThe summit meeting of the Group of Seven and\nRussia in Lyon and the subsequent ministerial meeting on\nterrorism in Paris took bold initiatives which need to be\ndeveloped into practical action. The proposals for a\nconvention on terrorist bombings and the proposals to\nprevent the abuse of asylum and refugee laws are\nparticularly timely initiatives. Sri Lanka looks forward to\ntheir elaboration during this session.\nEfforts need also to be made to further strengthen\nand give legal effect to the 1994 Declaration on Measures\nto Eliminate International Terrorism. Now we need more\nthan a mere declaration; we need a convention on\nmeasures to combat terrorism. Concerted international\ncooperation is necessary to ensure that the terrorist does\nnot enjoy safe havens anywhere in the world. The\nterritory of no State should be permitted to be used in any\nmanner that would encourage or sustain terrorist activity\nin another. Fund-raising activity on foreign soil in\nparticular, either directly or indirectly through so-called\ncharitable funds, must be prohibited. Should terrorism be\npermitted through international apathy to fester, it would\npoison the international body politic, enervating\ndemocratic processes, processes the international\ncommunity is obliged to sustain.\nIt would be myopic for a nation to stand aloof or to\ndisown responsibility for combating acts of terrorism\nwhich may seem too distant to evoke anything more than\ncuriosity. With the English poet John Donne, I would say,\n\u201cnever send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for\nthee.\u201d Terrorists have the means to move freely across\nborders, have used chemical weapons, and could well\nhave access to nuclear weapons.\nGlobal interdependence is undoubtedly a modern\nreality. However, opinions vary on the real implications\nof that phenomenon on the economies of developing\ncountries. In the development debate, globalization and\nthe call for integration into a single global economic grid\nare held out as the primary or even the sole option for\ndeveloping countries seeking cooperation with developed\ncountries.\nBut cooperation must not be confused with\nconformity. The specific character of individual\ndeveloping countries, including the social and political\ncompulsions facing their Governments, needs to be taken\ninto account. Globalization involves the free flow of\ncapital, the liberalization of trade, the privatization of\nState enterprises, the freezing of price controls and the\nscaling down of welfare measures even for the most\nvulnerable sectors of the population. These have not\nalways proved to be a panacea for those developing\ncountries which have accepted them as economic\ninjunctions.\n3\n\n\nIt is important that such institutions as the World\nTrade Organization, the successor institution to GATT, be\nsensitive to the concerns of developing countries in such\nmatters as external investment flows, which should not be\nclogged with linkages to issues more relevant to other\norganizations and institutions. Similarly, while sound social\nand environmental policies are essential for all societies,\narbitrarily imposed standards should not be used as excuses\nfor trade discrimination or concealed protectionism. The\nGovernment of Sri Lanka has provided opportunities for its\nprivate sector to advance as the principal engine of growth.\nSri Lanka continues to welcome investment \u2014 economic\nand technological collaboration with foreign entrepreneurs\non the basis of mutual benefit. These efforts, however,\nwould be negated if such economic cooperation were\npursued only on terms overwhelmingly favourable to one\nside.\nDespite the pressures and tensions caused by a\nsituation of conflict, we have succeeded in keeping our old\ndemocratic institutions and traditions alive and strong. We\ngive our best attention to the protection and promotion of\nhuman rights. In furthering an elected Government\u2019s\naccountability to its own people, the Government of Sri\nLanka has taken several measures to strengthen the legal\nframework and ensure the effective implementation of\nhuman-rights standards. One of the significant measures we\ntook this year was the establishment by act of Parliament of\na Human Rights Commission. We have ensured that the act\nguarantees independence of action for the Commission. The\nareas of competence of the Commission include monitoring,\ninvestigative and advisory functions. The act also addresses\nthe question of liability of non-State actors for human-rights\nviolations.\nMy Government has decided to accede to the Optional\nProtocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights as a logical next step in a series of national\nmeasures. Sri Lanka will thus be among the few countries\nthat have taken the progressive decision to ratify the\nOptional Protocol. The Government has given the highest\npriority to Sri Lanka\u2019s obligations under international\ncovenants and we are committed to continuing our\ncooperation with United Nations human-rights mechanisms.\nLooking at the world, we see that, in Bosnia,\nfollowing the Dayton Agreement, the guns have been\nfinally silenced, and we are happy to note that the peace\nAgreement is holding up. Sri Lanka has condemned the\natrocities committed in Bosnia, particularly the inhuman\nand cruel treatment of the Muslims. We believe that a\nsettlement will not be complete unless those responsible\nfor the atrocities are brought to justice.\nIn the Middle East, we hope the peace process will\nmove on, without losing the momentum it had gained,\ndespite the changes in the political scene in that area. Sri\nLanka reiterates its support for the peace process, the\nrealization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian\npeople and the establishment of conditions of peace and\nstability for all States in the region to live within secure\nboundaries. We commend the efforts taken by the United\nStates of America, other concerned States and the States\nof the region to achieve the objective of bringing peace to\nthe Middle East.\nWe share the concerns of the world community in\nregard to the crises that have overtaken Liberia and\nBurundi and express our fervent hope that peace will be\nrestored to these troubled regions.\nIn our own region, South Asia, we have recorded\nprogress in our efforts at regional cooperation. We\ncelebrated the tenth anniversary of the South Asian\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) last\nDecember, heralded by the coming into force of the South\nAsian Preferential Trade Arrangement. SAARC has set\nitself the goal of achieving a South Asian free-trade area\nby the early years of the new century. The private sectors\nof our region are engaged in close cooperation. We\nremain deeply committed to our abiding concern of\nalleviating, if not eradicating, poverty in our countries\nwithin a realistic time-frame.\nSri Lanka has turned increasingly towards promoting\neconomic cooperation with countries in the Asia-Pacific\nregion with which we identify closely. We see regional\ncooperation as a source of political stability as well as\nmutual economic benefit. We have recently become a\npartner in the Indian Ocean rim initiative. We have\napplied for membership of the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation Council. We also expect that, when the\nrequired ratifications are completed, the Indian Ocean\nMarine Affairs Cooperation will provide a further impetus\nto technical and other cooperation among Indian Ocean\ncountries. At the political level, Sri Lanka, with other\nmembers of the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on\nthe Indian Ocean, is reviewing the concept of the Indian\nOcean as a zone of peace in the light of current realities\nin the region.\nI wish to refer at this point to the Non-Aligned\nMovement, of which Sri Lanka is a founding member.\n4\n\n\nToday \u2014 26 September \u2014 is a particularly significant date\nfor Sri Lanka, which commemorates a great patriot, the late\nS.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, who was assassinated on this date.\nHe was Prime Minister from 1956 to 1959. He ushered in\na uniquely peaceful, non-violent transformation of Sri\nLankan society. His electoral victory in 1956 led to the\nempowerment of the rural, the underprivileged, the mass of\nthe people of the country, and set the country\u2019s foreign\npolicy firmly towards non-alignment.\nTwo days ago, we celebrated the thirty-fifth\nanniversary of the founding, in a formal sense, of the Non-\nAligned Movement. Mr. Bandaranaike did not live to see\nthe Non-Aligned Movement firmly established in 1961.\nHowever, in 1956, 40 years ago, he addressed this General\nAssembly and said:\n\u201cWe are supposed to be the uncommitted' nations. I\nstrongly object to that word. We are committed up to\nthe hilt. We are committed to preserve decency in\ndealings between nations, we are committed to the\ncause of justice and freedom....\n\u201cNo doubt the prevention of war is a necessary factor\nfor peace, but peace, believe me, is something much\nmore positive than that, for peace in its true sense\nmeans human understanding, human friendship and\ncooperation out of which, indeed, peace in its true\nform alone can arise. I look upon the United Nations\nas the one machine available to mankind today\nthrough which it can express this unconquerable spirit\nof man in its efforts to achieve that peace, friendship\nand collaboration.\u201d (Official Records of the General\nAssembly, Eleventh Session, Plenary Meetings, 590th\nmeeting, p. 234-35)\nThe policies he initiated in respect of Sri Lanka \u2014\nand I confine my remarks to foreign policy \u2014 were carried\nforward by his successor, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike,\nwho, as Prime Minister, attended the first Non-Aligned\nsummit in Belgrade in 1961 and subsequently presided over\nthe fifth summit of the Movement in Colombo.\nThe Movement, which has a membership of 113\ncountries, is today the largest grouping of independent\nsovereign States in the world, apart from the United\nNations itself, which have come together with the common\nobjective of achieving peace, prosperity and the welfare of\ntheir people, a majority of whom belong to the third world.\nWith the end of the cold war, there were sceptics who\nthought that the Movement would die in the absence of a\nclear role for the future. We have been able to dispel this\nmisapprehension and chart a new course for the\nMovement. It has emerged today as the voice of the third\nworld, of the smaller countries which are crying out for\na place in the sun and demanding opportunities for\neconomic development and self-expression.\nAlthough the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons has been extended indefinitely, it is to\nbe remembered that the total elimination of nuclear\nweapons is the ultimate end of the non-proliferation\nprocess. As a member of the Conference on\nDisarmament, our delegation has worked hard to ensure\nthat all nuclear testing be banned as an interim measure,\nleading eventually to the total elimination of all nuclear\nweapons. The text of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty adopted by the General Assembly a few days\nago was the result of several years' patient negotiations,\nyet its terms do not contain a firm and clear commitment\nto nuclear disarmament and the total elimination of all\nnuclear weapons. We would have expected the scope of\nprohibition to be truly comprehensive and the provisions\nfor entry into force not to be self-debilitating. We look\nforward to the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons\nConvention as well as the Convention relating to\nbacteriological and toxin weapons.\nSri Lanka remains a loyal and dedicated Member of\nthe United Nations committed to upholding the noble\nprinciples of the Charter. Our faith and trust in this great\ninstitution, fashioned half a century ago, despite all its\nweaknesses and failures discerned in the intervening\nyears, remains steadfast. These blemishes are after all but\na mirror-image of the infirmities and inadequacies of all\nhuman kind. So we have no need to be either discouraged\nor despondent. We stand firm in the belief that the United\nNations is still the best hope for this world. Indeed, we\nhave no alternative or option in this matter, for to give up\nhope is only to slide into the depths of despair.\nBut our hopes for the United Nations must be\ngrounded in action, in a firm resolve to act decisively in\nthe best interests of this great institution, indeed of all\nhumanity, untainted by the narrow national interests\nwhich have dogged our path in the course of these past\nfive decades. This is no easy task, but unless we remain\nunyielding in our determination to ensure that the United\nNations remains faithful to the tasks envisioned by its\nfounders, we will have failed the generations that follow\nus in the twenty-first century.\n5\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I begin by\ncongratulating Ambassador Razali of Malaysia on his\nassumption of office as our General Assembly\u2019s new\nPresident and offer our thanks to his predecessor,\nAmbassador Freitas do Amaral, for all his valuable work\nduring the fiftieth session.\nThe late twentieth century is an exciting time. For the\nfortunate among us, the world has never offered more:\ntravel with unheard-of ease, a tantalizing cornucopia of\nconsumer goods, 100 or more television stations in our\nhomes, the Internet. But these fruits are denied the vast\nmajority of the planet\u2019s population. The number of people\nwho live in absolute poverty is still growing. Their misery\nis a challenge to all our consciences, and I want today to\ntalk about what we all, the developed countries as well as\nthe developing, can do for those trapped in poverty \u2014 what\nwe can do together to open the door to development.\nBut first of all I would like to say a few brief words\nabout four other issues of particular importance at this\nmoment in time.\nFirst of all, Hong Kong. The year 1997 will be a\nspecial one for Hong Kong. Less than 300 days from now\nthe world will witness history. The peaceful transfer of\nsovereignty over a territory of 6 million free and prosperous\npeople is an event unparalleled in modern times. A transfer\non the basis of an international Treaty, registered here at\nthe United Nations \u2014 a Treaty between two members of\nthe Security Council, which guarantees that for 50 years\nafter 1997 there will be \u201cone country, two systems\u201d and\nthat \u201cHong Kong people will rule Hong Kong\u201d. Let there\nbe no doubt of Britain\u2019s continuing commitment to the\nfuture of Hong Kong and its people, well into the next\ncentury.\nThanks to the efforts of the Hong Kong people\nthemselves, the development of Hong Kong is one of the\nworld\u2019s great success stories. The Chinese Government\nhas made clear its determination to preserve Hong Kong\u2019s\nprosperity, its stability and its way of life as a free and\nopen society based on the rule of law. For Britain, a\nsuccessful transfer will be the closing of a chapter, but\nalso a new beginning to our relations with both Hong\nKong and with China.\nI suggest that all Members of the United Nations\nhave a stake in this historic exercise. As long as the\npromises of the joint Declaration are turned into reality,\nHong Kong has a bright future, as part of China and as\none of the world\u2019s leading cities, contributing enormously\nto growth and prosperity throughout the Asia-Pacific\nregion. And I am sure that all here will join me in\nwelcoming that prospect.\nI want also to take this opportunity to commend the\nInternational Court of Justice in its fiftieth anniversary\nyear. The International Court has performed\ngroundbreaking work in settling disputes between States,\nand I am proud that the United Kingdom has always been\namong the States that accept its compulsory jurisdiction.\nI hope that others will join us in pledging both moral and\nmaterial support to the International Court. The more who\naccept that international law must be the foundation of\ninternational relations, the safer we shall all be.\nThe world is safer today too with the historic\nsignature of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nEarlier this morning I had the privilege of signing the\nTreaty for the United Kingdom. It shows that we can, by\nacting with determination and by making sacrifices, reap\nthe benefits of the end of the cold war, and I firmly\nbelieve that the Treaty can make an important\ncontribution to preventing the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons and in promoting international security. The\nTreaty was the product of a multilateral negotiation and\nwas adopted here in the General Assembly. But that alone\nis not enough. If it is to be fully effective, it must\ncommand universal support, and the United Kingdom will\nnow put in hand the steps to allow us to ratify the Treaty.\n17\n\n\nIt is the sovereign right of every State to decide whether or\nnot to be bound by international agreements. But it is our\nfirm conviction that this Treaty is in the interests of all, and\nI urge all States to give it their full support.\nMeanwhile, other threats still loom large. The\ninsidious spectre of terrorism is a concern to all of us here,\nand it is right that the United Nations should be the forum\nfor debate on this worldwide menace. The United Kingdom\nis proposing for adoption at this session a United Nations\ndeclaration which will spell out unequivocally that acts of\nterrorism, and the financing, planning and incitement of\nthese acts, are contrary to the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations. People who do these evil things and who\nseek asylum under the United Nations refugee Convention\ndo not deserve to benefit from it.\nThe United Nations faces a critical year. It remains the\nhope of people across the world in search of peace and\ndevelopment. But the changes required to adapt and\nstrengthen the United Nations to meet the challenges of the\nfuture have not yet been completed. This year must see a\nsolution to the financial crisis. Reform must be part of the\nsolution, including a thorough updating of the system of\nassessing contributions to the United Nations, so that\ncontributions match real ability to pay. But all Members\nmust pay what they owe, both their assessments and their\narrears, and promptly; and the European Union\u2019s proposals\nare a good basis for negotiation. It will also be important to\nachieve over the coming year a resolution to the long-\nstanding discussions of Security Council enlargement. In\nshort, the United Nations must be made fit for the new\nmillennium.\nI turn now to my main theme. Three months ago, at\nLyons, the Group of Seven countries committed themselves\nto a partnership for the economic development of the world.\nThis is not just a catchy slogan; it is a fresh approach to the\nchallenge of development, and what it means is that the\ndeveloping countries and the developed together would\nshare responsibility for creating the conditions that will\nallow economies to grow, a shared agenda of measures that\nwe need to take to promote development.\nFor the countries of the developing world, this means\npursuing policies to enable economies to grow: taxes need\nto be kept low, subsidies cannot be allowed to distort\nmarkets, exports should not be impeded by heavy tariffs.\nDomestic markets must be allowed to operate with as little\ninterference as possible. The goal must be to establish an\nenvironment where the private sector can flourish, for the\nprivate sector is the engine of growth.\nIn 1755, Adam Smith famously remarked that for\nprosperity\n\u201cLittle else is requisite ... but peace, easy taxes, and\ntolerable administration of justice\u201d.\nThis is still a valid recipe today \u2014 not easy to achieve,\nbut with the sound foundations of good government and\nsensible macroeconomic policies, enterprise can flourish\nanywhere. This is the challenge to the Governments of\nthe developing world.\nWhat of the developed world\u2019s side of the\nbargain? \u2014 countries such as my own. Our responsibility\nis to remove the shackles which hinder developing\neconomies as they try to enter the global market. Many of\nthe poorest countries are still caught in a mire of debt\nthey are unlikely ever to be able to pay off. This benefits\nno one. The United Kingdom has long argued that, when\ncombined with macroeconomic reform of the kind I have\ndescribed, deep debt relief can kick-start the development\nof the poorest economies. Some time ago, Britain helped\nto identify steps that could be taken to lift the debt burden\nfrom the poorest, most indebted countries: more debt\nrelief from bilateral creditors and getting the multilateral\nagencies themselves to share more of the burden. Since\nthen the Paris Club of creditors has made an important\ncontribution by increasing debt forgiveness as agreed\nfollowing British proposals at the Naples Summit in 1994.\nThe multilateral agencies too have come up with some\nuseful proposals, such as the World Bank\u2019s Trust Fund to\nprovide debt relief. I also welcome the International\nMonetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) commitment to continue\nproviding concessional finance through the enhanced\nstructural adjustment facility.\nThese measures to relieve debt need to be\nimplemented both flexibly and soon. The countries in\ngreatest need should be granted maximum relief as swiftly\nas possible. I look forward to final agreement at the\nannual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank next\nweek.\nThe private sector is the motor of development.\nPrivate investment flows to the developing world are now\nat record levels. The United Kingdom is the third largest\nsource of private investment. But these flows are still not\nreaching the poorest countries. There is therefore a\ncontinuing need for concessional aid to prime the pump\nof homegrown development. We need to focus our efforts\non those countries where help is needed most and which\ncan make the best use of it. Help must primarily be\n18\n\n\ntargeted at creating growth with equity, at developing\nhuman resources to their full potential, at giving priority to\nthe needs of the poor: to health and education, to clean\nwater and small enterprises.\nIncreasingly this partnership in development amongst\nus all has to deal with the growing problems of planet\nsurvival: climate change, the environment, the future of the\nworld\u2019s oceans and forests, and pandemic diseases.\nDevelopment which ignores these will not be sustainable.\nThe United Nations is a central forum for focusing the\nattention and action of Governments and civil society on\nthese challenges as we enter the next century. Next year\u2019s\nGeneral Assembly special session to review the Rio summit\non environment and development is one example.\nBut the best help that we in the developed world can\ngive to the developing is to buy what they produce, and to\ndo that we in the developed world must demolish the\nbarriers that we still maintain against imports from the\npoorer countries of the developing world. When I look\naround the world, I see many developing countries bursting\nwith exports that they have to sell: textiles, food,\nmanufactured goods. But tragically, the markets of the\nricher countries of the developed world are often closed to\nthese exports. Last week\u2019s report from the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\npredicted that poor countries could triple their exports to the\nNorth over the next 10 years if import quotas were phased\nout \u2014 an extra $175 billion a year in income.\nProtectionism is starving the developing economies of their\noxygen, the oxygen of growth.\nThe European Union\u2019s record is better than most. We\nalready have a wide-ranging scheme to allow duty-free\nimports from developing countries. But even so, the\nEuropean Union obstructs, for example, imports of\nPalestinian cut flowers; it obstructs fruit juices from South\nAfrica, strawberry jam from Bulgaria. Other developed\ncountries are even less generous. The United States targets\nimports of Mexican tomatoes; Japan restricts imports of rice\nfrom South-East Asia. The list could go on.\nWe all know the difficulty of resisting powerful\ndomestic lobbies. They exist in Britain as elsewhere. But\nthis sort of protectionism is not simply selfish; it is also\nshort-sighted. Growth and prosperity in the developing\nworld will over time increase, not diminish, the wealth of\nthe industrialized world. Trade is not a zero-sum game. It\nis a process which is mutually beneficial, mutually\nenriching; and with prosperity comes stability and greater\nsecurity for us all.\nThis is not some fashionable nostrum dreamt up in\nan ivory tower. It is a prescription which has already been\nseen to work. Since 1945, under the auspices of the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the\nworld economy has moved steadily towards more open\nmarkets. And the result is clear: five decades of\nunprecedented economic growth and prosperity. It is\nincumbent upon us to spread this benefit more widely.\nThat is why I so warmly welcome the proposal put\nforward by the Director-General of the World Trade\nOrganization. Mr. Ruggiero has proposed that the least-\ndeveloped countries be granted tariff-free access to the\nmarkets of the developed world. I wholeheartedly\nwelcome this initiative. I hope that others will see its\ncompelling logic: the best hope the poor have for\nsustained economic development is to be given the\nfreedom to export, the freedom to sell.\nThat freedom enables countries to grow. But free\ntrade is not just helpful to developing countries, it is a\nglobal good, its benefits are spread wide, to the producers\nand consumers in the developed and the developing world\nalike, who can profit from the greater efficiency that free\ntrade engenders, and who can buy the best and cheapest\nproducts available on the world markets. In short, free\ntrade benefits us all. That is why Britain is so firmly\ncommitted to bringing the vision of global free trade to\nreality by the year 2020.\nFree trade begins at home. Cutting tariffs and other\nimport restrictions helps developing countries by cutting\nthe costs of production, boosting efficiency and thus\nhelping exports and growth. Combine these benefits with\nthe freedom to export granted by open markets in the\ndeveloped world, and developing countries and their\neconomies can enjoy a virtuous circle of development.\nFree trade is therefore the catalyst for growth. This is not\njust good economic theory. Greater efficiency and higher\ngrowth mean more resources available for new hospitals\nand new schools, better housing and cleaner water. Free\ntrade means real benefits for poor people.\nI have described today a challenge for every one of\nus here. Poverty is something we can all do something\nabout. In May, the Organisation for Economic\nCooperation and Development proposed that the\ndeveloped and developing worlds together should try to\ncut the number of people living in absolute poverty by\nhalf by 2015. Britain commits itself to that goal. It is\nachievable.\n19\n\n\nAt home, we must liberalize our economies, minimize\nthe burden of government and lift all restrictions on the free\noperation of the market. In the global economy, we must\nremove barriers to trade to allow the developing countries\nto sell. We must help lift the millstone of debt from those\nwho can least bear it. We cannot allow the poorest\nmembers of the world community to become marginalized.\nWe must do our utmost to enable all Members of the\nUnited Nations to enjoy the fruits of integration into the\nglobal economy. A revitalized United Nations has an\nessential part to play.\nI do not underestimate the difficulty of the tasks that\nI have described. We can only confront them in partnership,\nrich and poor together. If we all play our part, prosperity\ncan be placed within the grasp of even the poorest\ncountries.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffA year ago this month, the\nGeneral Assembly adopted by acclamation the Declaration\non the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United\nNations. Thus, the special commemorative session of the\nAssembly, attended by 128 Heads of State and\nGovernment, solemnly reaffirmed our commitment to the\npurposes and principles of the Charter. As Ambassador\nButler of Australia, the Chairman of the Preparatory\nCommittee, stated, that Declaration must serve as a set of\nguidelines for cooperation amongst all nations in the years\nahead.\nThe fiftieth session, so ably presided over by\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, took the initial\nstep towards translating these new guidelines into practical\naction aimed at the twenty-first century. In congratulating\nMr. Razali Ismail upon his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session, I wish him every\nsuccess in his highly responsible mission to carry further\nthe new tasks and endeavours of the Organization in the\ncourse of this session.\nLast year\u2019s Declaration spelt out four main areas for\naction in fulfilment of the mission of the United Nations in\nthe coming decades: peace, development, equality and\njustice. The world of the twenty-first century will confront\ntwo great opposing forces: globalization and fragmentation.\nBulgaria, as an active member of the international\ncommunity, has felt both the new opportunities and the new\nrisks. In developing its policies and responses, Bulgaria has\nproceeded on the basis of its European identity, particularly\nits association with and prospective membership of the\nEuropean Union. I would therefore like to state that we\nshare in and attach importance to the European Union\nmemorandum to this session and to the statement delivered\nby Mr. Dick Spring on behalf of the Union.\nWith the transition from the post-war bipolar system\nto a world of multi-centrism, the regional format will\nacquire ever-growing importance. This has been our\nexperience in the Balkans, at least, a region which has\nsustained the full blast of the forces of both globalization\nand disastrous fragmentation.\nIn line with its consistently maintained positions,\nBulgaria welcomed from the outset the Dayton and Paris\nagreements. We provided observers as well as police\npersonnel to the international missions in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. The recent elections in that country,\nnotwithstanding their deficiencies and problems, represent\na vitally important step forward. They opened the way for\nyesterday\u2019s welcome and important Security Council\nresolution to lift the sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia.\nAt the same time, even during the active phase of\nthe conflict, we have worked for the promotion of the\npositive trends of good-neighbourliness throughout the\nregion. At last year\u2019s fiftieth session, the Prime Minister\nof Bulgaria highlighted this priority feature of Bulgaria\u2019s\nforeign policy, favouring comprehensive regional\ncooperation. In particular he stated our intention to\nconvene a meeting of Central and South-East European\nStates in order to examine a broad range of issues\nconcerning long-term stability, security and cooperation\nthroughout the region.\nToday, it is my pleasure to inform the Assembly that\nsuch a meeting took place in Sofia on 6 and 7 July 1996\nat foreign ministerial level. At that meeting, seven\ncountries \u2014 Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,\nGreece, Romania, Turkey and Yugoslavia \u2014 adopted a\ncomprehensive document, the Sofia Declaration on Good-\nNeighbourly Relations, Stability, Security and\nCooperation in the Balkans.\nThe text of the Declaration was duly circulated as an\nofficial document of the General Assembly and the\nSecurity Council. The Declaration was fully supported by\nall participants in the broader format of the Sofia\nministerial meeting, including representatives from\nCroatia, Slovenia, Italy, Hungary, and the five Contact\nGroup countries \u2014 Germany, France, the Russian\nFederation, the United Kingdom and the United States of\nAmerica; Ireland, which holds the presidency of the\nEuropean Union; representatives of countries chairing the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE), the Central European Initiative, Black Sea\n11\n\n\nEconomic Cooperation; and high-level representatives from\nthe United Nations, the European Commission, the Council\nof Europe, the United Nations Economic Commission for\nEurope, the World Bank and the European Bank for\nReconstruction and Development. The High Representative,\nMr. Carl Bildt, was also present, took part in the meeting\nand made a valuable contribution to its success.\nI should like to outline very briefly the main spheres\nof activity launched at the meeting in Sofia in July. In the\nfirst area \u2014 enhancing regional peace and stability, and\nbuilding confidence and good-neighbourliness \u2014 the point\nof departure was for the countries in the region to reaffirm\ntheir allegiance to the fundamental principles of inter-State\nrelations as spelt out by the Charter, as well as in Helsinki\nand Paris.\nIn line with these principles, Bulgaria has been\nactively promoting confidence-building with all its\nneighbours and has already concluded agreements to this\neffect with Turkey, Greece and Romania. We stand ready\nto enter into such agreements with our other neighbours, as\nwell as on a multilateral regional basis.\nAnother important step in this direction will be the\nconvening in Sofia of a meeting of Ministers of Defence as\nprovided for in the Declaration of the Balkan countries.\nThis meeting should contribute significantly towards\nstrengthening security, enhancing confidence and\nconsidering future arms-control measures in the region.\nRecent regional multilateral cooperation in South-East\nEurope has focused on infrastructure development and\nupgrading as important factors for economic growth and\nregional stability. There is an emerging consensus that it\nshould be oriented towards upgrading and linking local\ninfrastructures with trans-European ones, as well as with\nthose in other adjacent areas \u2014 the eastern Mediterranean,\nnorthern Africa and across the Black Sea and into Asia.\nTransport infrastructure development is the subject of local\ncooperation between Albania, the Republic of Macedonia\nand Bulgaria, with direct financial and technical assistance\nbeing provided by the United States of America; a\nquadrilateral agreement has recently been signed with\nregard to this matter. It is also the subject of trilateral\ncooperation between Greece, Bulgaria and Romania. An\nimportant contribution to the cause of good-neighbourliness\nand infrastructure development are the Bulgarian-Greek\ncross-border cooperation and water-sharing agreements,\nwhich recently entered into force and will be submitted to\nthe OSCE under the Pact on Stability in Europe.\nFurthermore, in accordance with the agreement\nbetween the Balkan countries, the Bulgarian Government\nbegan preliminary consultations towards setting up a\ntransregional information and contacts centre for\ninfrastructure development. We expect further\ncontributions to be made to the positive developments in\nthis field from the forthcoming meeting of Ministers of\nTransportation of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation\nand Central European Initiative partner countries in Sofia\nin November 1996.\nTogether with its neighbours in South-East Europe,\nBulgaria is building regional cooperation on the basis of\nthe rule of law and full respect for human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, including those of persons\nbelonging to different national, ethnic, religious and\ncultural minorities. The countries from the region once\nagain reaffirmed their commitment to these principles and\nvalues. They also adopted specific guidelines in the\nvarious areas of cultural contacts and cooperation through\nexchanges and joint programmes. These should add to\nexisting bilateral or multilateral programmes that promote\nbetter mutual understanding and the overcoming of\nnegative stereotypes inherited from the past.\nJoint action in the field of crime prevention and the\nelimination of international terrorism envisages closer\ncooperation between central, regional and border\nauthorities through efficient communications and\nexchange of information; a commitment to accede to all\nrelevant international conventions that prevent and punish\ninternational crime and terrorism; joining and participation\nin specialized regional forums for discussing the problems\nof illicit drug-trafficking, organized crime and regional\nanti-terrorist cooperation; and the elaboration of a regional\nprogramme to combat organized crime. This already\nrepresents a tangible contribution to the implementation\nat the regional level of a zero-tolerance approach to\nterrorism.\nThe Sofia Declaration thus set out both the\nframework and the terms of reference for comprehensive\nregional cooperation. To this end, follow-up activities are\nbeing elaborated in all areas and we hope that all States\nfrom the region will take part at the next ministerial\nmeeting in Greece in 1997.\nProposals on cooperation in South-East Europe have\nalso come from outside the region. The Florence\nconference of the Peace Implementation Council last June\nidentified the three initiatives fostering such cooperation:\nthe Balkan conference initiated by the Bulgarian\n1\n\n\nGovernment, the stability process under the terms of the\nRoyaumont declaration of 12 December 1995 and the\nSouth-East Europe cooperation initiative of the United\nStates Government. There is important potential for\ninteraction between the three initiatives, with the process\nlaunched in Sofia serving as a comprehensive basis which\ncould link up with the other two initiatives in specific areas\nof common interest.\nThis regional endeavour represents an integral building\nblock in the development of an all-European system of\nsecurity and cooperation. We expect the Lisbon OSCE\nsummit in December 1996 to address in a comprehensive\nmanner this set of issues and provide guidelines for future\naction at both the European and regional levels. Various\nbodies and agencies of the United Nations system, such as\nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the United\nNations Environment Programme, the Commission on\nNarcotic Drugs, the United Nations Crime Prevention and\nCriminal Justice Branch and other bodies could also be\nhighly effective in encouraging and promoting at the\nregional level the ideas and initiatives that I have outlined.\nI would like to state Bulgaria\u2019s position on some\nUnited Nations-led and other major endeavours at the\nglobal level. We fully share the view that the recent\nconclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nis an achievement of truly historic proportions. In pursuit of\nBulgaria\u2019s long-standing policies in favour of nuclear arms\ncontrol and disarmament, I had the honour to sign this\nTreaty on the very first day it was opened for signature. For\nBulgaria, a convention on the ban on the production of\nfissionable material for military purposes would be the next\nlogical stage in the work of the Conference on\nDisarmament, in which Bulgaria is an active participant.\nFrom the point of view of global as well as regional\nsecurity, another priority task is the early entry into force\nand implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\nAs for the Biological Weapons Convention, Bulgaria is\nfully in favour of upgrading its control and verification\nmechanism and is ready to contribute to this end at the\nforthcoming Review Conference and thereafter.\nBulgaria took an active part in the Review Conference\nof the States Parties to the Convention on Prohibitions or\nRestrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons\nWhich May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to\nHave Indiscriminate Effects, and its Protocol II. During the\nnegotiations, we made special efforts to take into\nconsideration the new technical requirements on mines as\nan absolute prerequisite for the purposes of mine-\nclearance and the normal conduct of United Nations\npeacekeeping and humanitarian operations. Furthermore,\nby a decision taken on 2 May 1996, the Bulgarian\nGovernment imposed a three-year ban on exports of anti-\npersonnel mines. Bulgaria, which currently hold the\nchairmanship of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment, attaches particular importance, together\nwith the other United Nations Member States, to the\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the review of\nthe follow-up process to the United Nations Conference\non Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro.\nIn October 1995, Sofia hosted the third Ministerial\nConference on Environment for Europe. The Conference\nprovided further impetus to the Environmental Action\nProgramme for Central and Eastern Europe. The\nministerial declaration adopted is an important document\nin the field of environmental protection in Europe and a\nfurther step towards implementing the global concept of\nsustainability.\nIn recent years, we have witnessed rapid changes in\nthe world economy, changes that can be described by the\ngeneral trends of liberalization and globalization, both of\nwhich are important factors for development. I am happy\nto inform this Assembly that, after long years of\nstrenuous negotiations, today, 2 October 1996, Bulgaria\nis becoming a member of the World Trade Organization\n(WTO). By joining WTO, Bulgaria shall become fully\nintegrated into the world trading system which is essential\nfor us to be able to achieve stable economic growth.\nBearing in mind the new challenges in the social and\neconomic areas in today\u2019s multipolar and interdependent\nworld, my country supports the efforts of the international\ncommunity to enhance and streamline United Nations\nactivities in this field.\nBulgaria is a party to all major international human-\nrights instruments. We believe that international\ncooperation in the field of human rights is essential for\ntheir implementation. It should be conducted in\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the\nprinciples of international law, such as the sovereign\nequality, political independence and the territorial integrity\nof States. We are in favour of constructive and open\ndialogue on even sensitive issues related to human rights\nin individual States. This approach is not directed against\nany country. The situations in different parts of the world\nshould be examined in a way that takes into account the\nspecific characteristics of individual countries in a\n13\n\n\ncomprehensive context and be aimed above all at\nencouraging positive developments and tendencies.\nTransnational crime and international terrorism are\nincreasingly emerging, as stated by many speakers in this\nforum, as one of the major security challenges facing the\ninternational community today. They directly affect\ndevelopment and quality of life and erode the very\nfoundations of democratic society. It has become more than\nobvious that these challenges cannot be addressed\neffectively by national institutions alone. Today, there is a\npressing need to develop new cooperation in the field of\ncrime prevention and criminal justice. Such cooperation\ncould also include more information sharing, including\ninputs from intelligence sources.\nAt this session, the General Assembly must carefully\nexamine all valuable ideas and proposals in this field put\nforward by preceding speakers. My country will readily\nsupport the efforts of the international community aimed at\nthe elaboration, on a global level, of efficient measures to\ncombat crime and to eliminate international terrorism.\nAllow me to digress for a moment from the prepared\ntext of my speech in order to share with the Assembly a\nmost regrettable and tragic piece of news concerning a\npolitical assassination which took place just over 24 hours\nago in Sofia. The target was a former Prime Minister of\nBulgaria, Mr. Andrei Lukanov. I would like to inform the\nAssembly that Mr. Lukanov was one of the principal and\npersonal driving forces behind the democratic changes that\ntook place in Bulgaria after 1989. He staked his personal\nefforts and future on the successful introduction into\nBulgarian society of the values of democracy, the\npromotion of human rights and economic reform. He was\nalso well-known within the United Nations family, in\nparticular in Geneva, having been an active promoter of the\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\nsince its early years and having promoted Bulgaria\u2019s\nparticipation in the world trading system and the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade. In an ironic twist of fate,\ntoday marks, as I said, Bulgaria\u2019s accession to WTO.\nThe Bulgarian Parliament adopted a declaration on this\noccasion several hours ago. It firmly declares the will of all\npolitical forces in Bulgaria \u2014 Mr. Lukanov having been an\nactive member of Parliament for the last seven years \u2014 not\nto permit this act in any way to divert Bulgaria from the\npath towards economic and political reform or to infringe\non the peaceful and lawful process of political and public\nlife, including the forthcoming presidential elections at the\nend of this month.\nI have instructed my Mission to transmit the text of\nthis declaration, with a short covering note, to you,\nMr. President, the Secretary-General and Member States.\nI invite all of you to share our feelings of support and\nsympathy for the family of Mr. Lukanov and to send\nmessages of support to the Bulgarian Parliament. I invite\nthe Assembly, at this point in time, without rising, to\nshare a minute of silence in remembrance of\nMr. Lukanov.\nImprovements in the effectiveness and functioning of\nthe principal organs, a better balance in their authority\nand the streamlining of the subsidiary machinery are\nimportant conditions for the reform of the United Nations.\nThe issue of equitable representation on and increase\nin the membership of the Security Council is a key\ncomponent of this process. We share the view that some\nMember States \u2014 developed, for instance Germany and\nJapan, and developing alike \u2014 are able to assume the\nresponsibility of permanent membership. A number of\nproposals for the reform of the Security Council have\nalready been put on the table and should be examined\nwith due attention. In this respect, I would like to mention\nthe valuable ideas presented by Minister Lamberto Dini\nof Italy just a few days ago. One of the major\ndevelopments over the past several years has been the fact\nthat the number of States in the Eastern European Group\nhas almost doubled. We reiterate our conviction that such\na rise in membership requires one additional non-\npermanent seat to be allocated to this Group. Some\nBalkan countries have already indicated their willingness\nto apply for non-permanent membership in the Security\nCouncil. With its consistent regional policies of good-\nneighbourliness and cooperation in South-East Europe, as\nwell as in the broader United Nations framework,\nBulgaria is equally justified in seeking membership on the\nCouncil in the years to come.\nIt would be remiss of me, however, not to mention\nsome serious flaws in the United Nations peacemaking\nmachinery. The question of finding an adequate solution\nto the complicated problems arising for third countries as\na result of United Nations Security Council-imposed\nsanctions is one of them. At its fiftieth session the\nGeneral Assembly once again expressed concern at the\npersisting special economic problems confronting States\naffected by sanctions implementation. It also renewed its\ninvitation to the international financial institutions to\ncontinue to pay special attention to these problems and\ntheir adverse social impact, and to consider ways and\n14\n\n\nmeans for mobilizing and providing resources on\nappropriate terms for mitigating the negative impact of the\nsanctions on those States. The Assembly also renewed its\nrequest to the competent organs, programmes and\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations to take into\nconsideration the special needs of the affected States and to\nconsider providing assistance to them from their special\nprogramme resources.\nRegrettably, few are the practical steps in\nimplementing these recommendations. These problems,\nsince they are long-lasting, will continue to exert their\nnegative impact long after the lifting of sanctions. It would\nbe highly counterproductive if the peacemaking essence of\nsanctions were to be distorted by major economic\ndislocation in affected third States. Being among the\ncountries suffering most from the implementation of\nsanctions, at this session Bulgaria will again submit a draft\nresolution on the subject and I invite all Member States to\ngive it their unanimous and firm support.\nThe proceedings of the fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly provide new, important opportunities to\ncontinue on the path of reform and increased efficiency.\nThey open up new opportunities to render support to those\ntrends in the modern world, our global village and each of\nits neighbourhoods, making for societies with greater\nsecurity and promise in which our children can look\nforward to a more fulfilling life. Bulgaria is firmly\ncommitted to contributing actively and in a constructive\nspirit to the accomplishment of this new mission of the\nworld Organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to congratulate the President warmly on\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly and\nto reiterate our trust in his qualities and skills, which will\nhelp in conducting the work of this session. I assure him\nthat the delegation of Guinea- Bissau is ready and willing\nto help him.\nWe would also like to congratulate his predecessor,\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for the devotion and\nconstructive spirit with which he carried out his duties.\nWe take this opportunity to underscore our\nappreciation to and reiterate our confidence in the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose\ninitiative and personal involvement in the reform of the\nUnited Nations system have made satisfactory results\npossible.\nLast year, over 185 States met in New York City to\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\nThis historic event was an excellent opportunity for the\nUnited Nations to evaluate and assess the state of our\nOrganization in a changing world and to cast a glance\nforward into the future.\nToday, as yesterday, a large part of the world\u2019s\npopulation \u2014 which, to date, has experienced neither peace\nnor security, not to mention social well-being \u2014 place their\ntrust in the United Nations, the only institution with a\nuniversal mission, capable of promoting international peace\nand security and developing socio-economic cooperation on\na global scale.\nThe numerous challenges and hopes which the United\nNations must respond to today are unprecedented. It is\ntherefore important that we make every effort to restructure\nand revitalize the Organization, because the United Nations\nis facing an increasingly complex international situation.\nIn that connection, we commend the Open-Ended\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\nSecurity Council for its contribution to overall efforts\nmade on this important and timely question. Guinea-\nBissau is of the view that all related proposals of the\nAfrican Group, and other proposals such as that of Italy,\nshould be given due consideration.\nIn a world beset by numerous grave conflicts, the\nUnited Nations is incontrovertibly, the best forum for\nachieving the ideals which underpin its irreplaceable role\nin promoting international peace and security.\nHowever, despite the ongoing efforts of our\nOrganization, peace and stability are still a dream in\nmany parts of the world. Conflicts and fratricidal warfare,\nand the persistence of various kinds of serious tension\namong States, have made innocent victims of entire\npopulations, causing loss of human life and provoking\nmassive movements of peoples and refugees.\nUnfortunately, Africa is the continent most affected by\nthis tragedy. Angola, Burundi, Liberia, Rwanda and\nSomalia are dramatic examples of Africa\u2019s recent history.\nMy recent visit to Angola \u2014 which coincided with\nmy country\u2019s presidency of the Security Council \u2014 as\nSpecial Envoy of the President of the Republic of Guinea-\nBissau, Mr. Joa\u00afo Bernardo Vieira, demonstrated our\npeople\u2019s long-standing solidarity with the people of\nAngola and illustrates our unequivocal will to promote\nconfidence among the parties, which is essential to the\nsuccess of the peace process.\nIn that connection, we should like to stress the\nimportant role of the United Nations, the Troika and the\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General,\nMr. Blondin Beye, in the establishment of the peace\nprocess in Angola. We are convinced that the road we\nhave travelled and the successes achieved to date fully\nwarrant the confidence of the international community\nand its continued support for the peace process in Angola.\nGuinea-Bissau hopes that the reasons for the delay of the\nfull implementation of the Lusaka Protocol will be\novercome.\nWe deplore the tragedy that is dividing Liberia, a\ncountry of our subregion, just as we deplore the ongoing\nviolations of the agreements concluded, which increase\nthe loss of human life and provoke new outbreaks of\nviolence. We are also gravely concerned to note the\nnegative impact of the war in Liberia on the neighbouring\ncountries.\n\n\n\nWe urge all warring factions to respect the new\nimplementation plan of the Abuja Agreement and of the\nLiberian National Transitional Government. We also invite\nthem to cooperate fully with the Economic Community of\nWest African States Monitoring Group, the United Nations\nObserver Mission in Liberia and the rest of the international\ncommunity in the search for a definitive solution to the\nproblem in Liberia.\nThe situation in the Great Lakes region, particularly\nthe situation prevailing in Burundi, is also of great concern\nto us. We support the efforts of the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity to avoid a repetition of the\nRwandan tragedy in these countries.\nAs for Western Sahara, we reiterate our support for\nthe efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations\nto organize the referendum.\nGuinea-Bissau continues to focus special attention on\nthe situation in East Timor which needs a negotiated,\npeaceful, political approach if a solution is to be found. In\nthis context, we would like to welcome the talks between\nPortugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the United\nNations to find a just solution to this conflict.\nOn behalf of our Government, I reiterate our firm\nconviction that the Republic of China on Taiwan should be\npart of the United Nations on the basis of respect for the\nprinciple of universality and for the legal equality of States.\nThe fundamental rights of 21 million inhabitants of a\nterritory under the jurisdiction of a legal Government whose\nPresident has been democratically elected provide the\npolitical and legal basis for the recognition of their right to\ninternational status as a sovereign State under the legal and\njudicial terms enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations.\nThe reunification of China is a question that must be\nresolved by the people of China itself. However, the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan is legally entitled to enjoy\ninternational status before reunification \u2014 in other words,\nits recognition as a State and application of the principle of\nparallel representation of divided States.\nIt is essential that the Middle East peace process be\nsupported. We consider that any lasting solution to the\nMiddle East conflict must respect the inalienable rights of\nthe Palestinian people to self-determination and to the\nestablishment of an independent State, and must respect the\nindependence and territorial integrity of all States of the\nregion, including the State of Israel, and their right to live\nin security within internationally recognized boundaries.\nThe tragic events of recent days have weakened the peace\nprocess while seriously affecting world public opinion.\nWe urge the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority\nto persevere on the path of dialogue towards the\nrestoration of a climate of trust, which is vital for the\nestablishment of lasting peace. We welcome the meeting\nbetween President Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu,\nwhich is an important step on that path. We commend all\nparties that are contributing to the restoration of the\nIsrael-Palestinian dialogue, especially the Government of\nthe United States of America.\nThe holding of elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nis a positive element in the resolution of this crisis in\nEurope. We hope that all the parties concerned will\nhenceforth devote all their energies to the reconstruction\nof that devastated country, to ensure a future of peace,\ntolerance and development.\nThe embargo against Cuba, whose repercussions\ngravely affect the people of that country, must be\nresolved through dialogue and negotiation by the parties\nconcerned, with a view to achieving a complete and\nsatisfactory solution.\nPoverty, malnutrition, hunger and major endemic\ndiseases are a painful reality that affects a large part of\nthe population of developing countries. We welcome the\nconvening at Rome next November of the World Food\nSummit, organized by the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO).\nGuinea-Bissau is convinced that international\nsecurity and stability depend on the collective struggle\nagainst all the internal and external factors that force a\nlarge part of the world\u2019s population to live in abject\npoverty. Indeed, the persistence of poverty throughout the\nworld requires an ongoing sustained effort on the part of\nthe community of nations and calls for a global approach\nto resolve the major socio-economic problems affecting\nthe world.\nThe debt burden and debt-servicing gravely\njeopardize development in Africa. During recent years, as\nwas clearly demonstrated by the mid-term review of the\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\nAfrica in the 1990s, our countries have become net\nexporters of capital because of the financial agreements\nthey must honour. Indeed, the amounts allocated to debt-\nservicing greatly exceed external resource flows. Guinea-\n12\n\n\nBissau is no exception. Overall, third world economies have\nseen little improvement.\nThe gap between developed and developing countries\ncontinues to grow because of the slow rate of economic\ngrowth in the developing countries in general and the least-\ndeveloped countries in particular.We welcome the action\nundertaken by the United Nations, especially the System-\nwide Special Initiative for Africa. My Government\ncontinues to devote considerable efforts to the economic\nrecovery of our country, strictly applying the structural\nadjustment programme agreed with the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund. However, efforts to restore\nour country\u2019s macroeconomic balance and the well-being of\nour people should be supplemented by additional support\nfrom the international community, which we hope will\ncontinue to be forthcoming in support of our efforts in that\ndirection.\nGuinea-Bissau, an African country and a member of\nthe Portuguese-speaking community, welcomes Portugal\u2019s\ninitiative to propose to its European Union partners the\nconvening of a European-African summit, whose objective\nwould be to promote a political dialogue aimed at laying a\nnew foundation for a new global partnership.\nEnvironmental protection and the rational utilization of\nour planet\u2019s natural resources are the responsibility of all\nhumanity. Aware of this reality, Guinea-Bissau has\ndesigned with its cooperation partners a strategy for\nsustainable development that respects environmental balance\nand which can be considered socially viable and just. In\nthat context, our Government is making considerable efforts\nto implement the recommendations of the Copenhagen\nWorld Summit for Social Development, the Platform of\nAction of the Fourth World Conference on Women, held at\nBeijing, and the recommendations of the second United\nNations Conference on Human Settlements, held at\nIstanbul.\nRespect for and the full exercise of basic human rights\nare elements of freedom, peace and international stability.\nGuinea-Bissau, a democratic country, is resolved to\npreserve intrinsic human values, for harmonious and\nintegrated development. The United Nations is intended to\nbe the appropriate forum for finding concerted\ncomprehensive solutions to the major challenges facing the\nworld today. That is why it is vital to increase its ability to\nprevent conflicts and preserve peace and to promote socio-\neconomic development. Today Guinea-Bissau, more than\never before, is determined to contribute to the achievement\nof the ideals enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I am convinced that with his outstanding ability\nand rich experience he will fulfil this lofty mission with\ndistinction. I would also like to express my thanks to\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for the important contribution\nhe made during his presidency of the last session.\nThe 1990s are a period of momentous transition,\nduring which international relations are undergoing the most\nfar-reaching changes since the Second World War. The\ncollapse and disappearance of the bipolar structure has\nrekindled hope that the world will become a community of\ncountries with equal rights for all, rather than one\ndominated by a single big Power. Multipolarity is gaining\nmomentum in a global as well as a regional context. Major\nPowers are readjusting their relationships. On the other\nhand, the multitude of developing countries have become\nincreasingly aware of the need to bolster their strength\nthrough concerted efforts. The Non-Aligned Movement\ncontinues to uphold the ideals and principles of\nindependence, independent decision-making and\nnon-affiliation with blocs, and is vigorously pushing for\na new just and democratic international order of peace\nand equality. Regional economic organizations, which are\ndisplaying great vitality, are expanding their role in\npromoting regional cooperation and development in their\nrespective areas.\nAsia\u2019s upsurge is having a significant impact on the\nworld\u2019s political and economic configurations. The world\nis deeply impressed with the vigorous economic\ndevelopment of Asia, East Asia in particular. The\nconvening of the first Asia-Europe meeting highlighted\nthe changes now being seen and marked an important\nnew beginning for an equal, cooperative relationship\nbetween Asia and Europe. As the world moves towards\nmultipolarity, the forces for peace are bolstered. The call\nfor dialogue and cooperation, as against confrontation and\nconflict, has become louder.\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, efforts to maintain peace\nand stability and promote common development through\ndialogue, consultation and cooperation have yielded\npositive results. An agreement on confidence-building in\nthe military field along border areas has been concluded\nbetween China on the one hand, and the Russian\nFederation, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan on the\nother; this agreement governs a boundary over 3,000\nkilometres in length. The Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN) Regional Forum has succeeded in\nbringing Asia-Pacific countries together to consider\nsecurity issues facing the region. The Asia-Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation Council (APEC) has become a\nuseful mechanism for promoting trade and investment\nliberalization as well as economic and technological\ncooperation in the region.\nThe past year has seen peace returning to a number\nof war-torn countries and regions. We are pleased to note\nthat the peace accord reached between the belligerents in\nBosnia and Herzegovina is being implemented, and that\nYugoslavia and Croatia have normalized their relations.\nIt is hoped that peace will soon be fully restored to the\nregion of the former Yugoslavia in order to put an end to\nthe prolonged conflict in that part of Europe.\nThe impact on Africa of the drastic changes in the\npost-cold war international situation is waning. Africa is\nentering a new historical era in which it is striving for\npeace, stability and development. Many burning issues in\nAfrica have already been or are in the process of being\nsettled gradually. At the same time, however, some\n14\n\n\ncountries and regions are still plagued by the scourge of\nwar. We hope that the international community will\ncontinue to give attention and attach importance to African\nissues so as to help bring lasting peace and development to\nthe whole African continent at an early date.\nBut the path towards peace is tortuous. After some\nmajor gains in preceding years, the Middle East peace\nprocess has hit snags again. China is concerned at this\ndevelopment. We hope that all the parties concerned will\nstrive for an early comprehensive and just settlement of this\nissue by strictly observing the agreements already reached\nand resuming negotiations and dialogue on the basis of the\nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\nPeace should have prevailed in the post-cold-war\nworld, in which equal members of the international\ncommunity should respect each other\u2019s sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity, refrain from invading each other or\ninterfering in each other\u2019s internal affairs, and live in\nharmony with each other, in a spirit of seeking common\nground and putting aside differences. However, the reality\nis that the world today is far from tranquil because the\ncold-war mentality dies hard and hegemonism has\nrepeatedly raised its ugly head. Interference in other\ncountries\u2019 internal affairs under various pretexts, and\nindulgence in sanctions-wielding or even the use of force\nare trampling on the purposes and principles of the Charter\nof the United Nations and all accepted norms of\ninternational relations, thereby threatening and undermining\nworld peace and stability. Recent controversies in\ninternational forums, generated by the issue of sanctions,\nsignify that in the context of a growing trend towards\nmultipolarity, hegemonism and power politics will become\nincreasingly untenable.\nThe vigorous expansion of international trade and\ninvestment and the rapid advance of science and technology\nhave led to closer economic ties between countries and\nregions, thus accelerating the process of economic\nglobalization. This presents a rare opportunity to both\ndeveloped and developing countries. By riding the tide of\nglobalization and relying on their own unremitting efforts,\nsome developing countries have achieved sustained and\nrapid economic growth, thereby giving a great impetus to\nworld economic growth. These and other changes on the\nworld scene have widened the prospects of international\ncooperation.\nRegrettably, however, a counter-current of trade\nprotectionism has recently arisen in the ranks of developed\ncountries, designed to curtail the development of developing\ncountries and exclude them from the decision-making\nprocess on major world economic issues. Any act\nprejudicial to developing countries will in the final\nanalysis undermine the interests of developed countries.\nInternational economic exchanges and cooperation should\nbe built on the basis of mutual complementarity. Facing\nthe tide of economic globalization, neither developed nor\ndeveloping countries should resort to trade protectionism.\nRather, both should make the necessary readjustments and\nreforms in the light of their own national conditions in\norder to promote their welfare and keep out of harm\u2019s\nway. Only by enhancing international exchanges and\ncooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit\ncan we jointly cope with new problems arising in the\ncourse of world economic advances and achieve sustained\ncommon development and prosperity.\nNo one should overlook the unevenness of world\ndevelopment and the ever widening gap between\ndeveloped and developing countries. Caught in the web of\nrelentless international competition, the least-developed\ncountries are in distress, and the risk of marginalization\nis looming large. To make matters worse, the amount of\nofficial development assistance from richer countries is\nshrinking every year, with more stringent conditions\nattached. The coffers of the United Nations Capital\nDevelopment Fund are drying up, and future prospects are\ngrim indeed. The international community, and especially\nthe developed countries, are duty-bound to take effective\nmeasures to reverse this dire situation. The promotion of\neconomic development and the prosperity of all countries,\nand the elimination of poverty should always be at the top\nof the United Nations agenda.\nStrengthening international cooperation in the field\nof the environment and development is a vital link in\nglobal efforts to achieve sustainable development.\nFour years after the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development, the public has become\nincreasingly aware of the importance of environmental\nprotection. Sustainable development has become a major\nobjective in the socio-economic development strategies of\nall countries. However, international cooperation in this\ndomain is disappointingly lagging. Developed countries\nhave failed to live up to their pledges under Agenda 21 in\nterms of funding and technology transfer, yet they\ndemand that developing countries accept obligations\nexceeding their capability at their present level of\ndevelopment. It is hoped that next year\u2019s special session\non environment and development will be able to resolve\nthese issues.\n15\n\n\nPoverty, unemployment, the problem of refugees,\ncrime, over-population, environmental deterioration, drug\nabuse and terrorism \u2014 these scourges remain formidable\nand impede global stability and development. In the face of\nthese challenges, all countries should not only carry out\nsocial development policies commensurate with their own\nnational conditions, but should also actively cooperate with\none another in line with the principles of mutual respect,\nequality and mutual benefit. The United Nations needs to\nenhance its social programmes focusing on developing\ncountries.\nThe international community at large should press for\nthe implementation of the follow-up actions of the Cairo\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\nthe Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development and\nthe Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women in favour\nof universal social development.\nOur Organization has gone through vicissitudes in the\ncourse of half a century. Enormous changes have taken\nplace on the world scene. It is imperative for the United\nNations to carry out appropriate rational reforms so that it\ncan better perform the noble mission of the times and usher\na better world into the twenty-first century.\nAll reforms must be conducive to realizing the\npurposes and principles of the Charter and to improving the\nefficiency of the United Nations. They must also contribute\nto a more positive and effective United Nations role in\npromoting world peace and common development. They\nmust conform to the principle of the sovereign equality of\nall States, and reflect the aspirations of the developing\ncountries, which comprise more than two-thirds of the\nmembership. Democratic consultations should be practiced\nthroughout this process. We are confident that we will be\nable to achieve a broad consensus as long as all of us\nengage in patient deliberations in the spirit of openness and\nfair play, and with a readiness to consider all legitimate\nconcerns.\nThe United Nations continues to be plagued by a\nserious financial crisis. The Organization cannot function\nnormally without firm and reliable fiscal resources. We call\non the major countries whose financial contributions to the\nOrganization are in arrears to fulfil the financial obligations\nset forth in the Charter by unconditionally paying up in full\nwithout further delay.\nMajor progress has been made in the field of arms\ncontrol and disarmament since the last session of the\nGeneral Assembly. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty resulting from two and a half years of negotiations\nhas finally been adopted by the General Assembly.China\nactively participated in the Treaty negotiations and\ndisplayed maximum flexibility, thereby contributing\nsignificantly to the final conclusion of the Treaty. We\nhave always stood for the complete prohibition and\nthorough destruction of nuclear weapons. In our view, the\ncomprehensive test-ban Treaty is only a first step in the\nentire process of comprehensive nuclear disarmament.\nThere are still large stockpiles of nuclear arms in the\nworld. Some nuclear Powers still refuse to undertake not\nto be the first to use such weapons. We still have a long\nway to go, and must continue to work strenuously in\norder to achieve the ultimate goal of the total elimination\nof nuclear weapons.\nIn order to expedite nuclear disarmament and free\nourselves from the danger of nuclear war forever, I wish\nto reiterate the following calls on behalf of the Chinese\nGovernment: first, the major nuclear Powers should\nrenounce their policy of nuclear deterrence; those\npossessing huge nuclear arsenals should continue to cut\nback their stockpiles drastically.\nSecondly, all nuclear States should assume the\nobligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons at\nany time or under any circumstances; they should\nunconditionally renounce the use or threat of use of such\nweapons against non-nuclear States or nuclear-free zones;\nand they should conclude international instruments to that\neffect without delay.\nThirdly, those States which have deployed nuclear\nweapons overseas should withdraw them completely; all\nnuclear States should pledge support for moves to set up\nnuclear-free zones; they should respect the status of such\nzones and assume corresponding obligations.\nFourthly, all States should refrain from developing\nor deploying weapons systems in outer space and missile\ndefence systems that undermine strategic security and\nstability.\nFifthly, all States should negotiate with a view to\nconcluding an international convention on the complete\nprohibition and total destruction of nuclear weapons.\nSince mankind was able to produce nuclear weapons\nin the twentieth century, it is fully capable of abolishing\nthem in the twenty-first century. The Chinese Government\nand people are ready to join hands with all Governments\n16\n\n\nand peoples of the world to strive for the realization of this\nlofty goal.\nMy country continues to press forward along the road\nof reform, opening up and modernization. Our economy\nmaintains a healthy momentum. The macroeconomic\nenvironment continues to improve. We anticipate a growth\nrate of around 10 per cent this year. Inflation will be kept\nbelow 10 per cent. Despite severe natural disasters in some\nparts of the country, we have still managed to gather a\nbumper harvest of summer crops this year. Grain output for\nthe entire year is expected to top the previous year\u2019s\nfigures. The Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic\nand Social Development and the Outline of the Long-Range\nObjectives to the Year 2010 were inaugurated this year.\nThey depict a promising future for China\u2019s modernization\ndrive at the turn of the century. By the year 2000, when our\npopulation will have had a net increase of 300 million, we\nexpect to quadruple our 1980 per capita gross national\nproduct. And by the year 2010 our gross national product\nis anticipated to be twice that of the year 2000. Then we\nwill have put in place a viable socialist market economy.\nSeventeen years of reform and opening up have\nbrought about a fourfold increase in our gross national\nproduct. Our overall national strength will grow further in\nanother 15 years. Yet China will still be a developing\ncountry with relatively low ranking in terms of indicators\nsuch as per capita gross national product. China\u2019s\ndevelopment will only help to bolster the elements making\nfor peace. We pose no threat to anyone anywhere, but will\nonly help to strengthen the cause of world peace, stability\nand development. On the other hand, if China fails to\nachieve economic development and its population of 1.2\nbillion is mired in poverty, that would indeed be ominous\nfor world peace and stability.\nChina will resume the exercise of sovereignty over\nHong Kong as from 1 July 1997. This will be a milestone\nin the great cause of our national reunification. It is also a\ngood example of how countries can peacefully resolve\nissues left over by history. Preparations are under way to\nput into effect our resumption of the exercise of sovereignty\nover Hong Kong. We are fully capable of ensuring a\nsmooth transfer of government and transition in Hong\nKong. After Hong Kong\u2019s return to the embrace of the\nmotherland, we will put into effect the policy of \u201cone\ncountry, two systems\u201d. As a Special Administrative Region\nof the People\u2019s Republic of China, and in conformity with\nthe Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative\nRegion, Hong Kong will be administered by the Hong\nKong people. It will enjoy a high degree of autonomy. The\nexisting social and economic system and way of life will\nremain unchanged, and the laws currently in force in\nHong Kong will be basically maintained. Hong Kong will\nretain its status as an international trade, financial and\nshipping centre, free port and separate customs territory.\nIts long-term stability and prosperity will be guaranteed.\nForeign economic interests in Hong Kong will be\naccommodated.\nTwenty-five years ago, at its twenty-sixth session,\nthe General Assembly adopted the historic resolution\n2758 (XXVI), solemnly declaring the restoration to the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China all its lawful rights in the\nUnited Nations. That resolution thoroughly settled the\nquestion of China\u2019s representation in the United Nation in\nall aspects \u2014 political, legal and procedural.\nThere is but one China in the world and Taiwan is\nan inalienable part of its sacred territory. \u201cPeaceful\nreunification and one country with two systems\u201d \u2014 this\nis our unswerving guideline for the settlement of the\nTaiwan question. This question involves a cardinal\nprinciple of China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity\nand the great task of reunification. It is a purely internal\naffair of China which will brook no outside interference.\nThe Chinese Government and people are determined to\ncarry through the struggle against all attempts to split\ntheir territory or create an independent Taiwan. No force\non Earth can hold back China\u2019s great cause of\nreunification.\nThe world is on the march at top speed. New\ncontradictions and problems are constantly arising. The\nprofound changes in the international scene have brought\nforth rare opportunities as well as serious challenges. Let\nus seize the opportunities, meet the challenges and push\nforward the cause of peace and development. Such is the\nglorious mission which our times have bestowed on us.\nThe Chinese Government and people are ready to join\nwith all other Governments and peoples in this endeavour.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to extend to President Razali Ismail\nEcuador\u2019s warm congratulations on his election, which is a\ntribute to his valuable contributions to the work of our\nworld Organization in his capacity as Permanent\nRepresentative of Malaysia. I wish also to convey our\nthanks to Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session, for the fruitful\nwork he accomplished.\nI wish to express to the delegation of Bulgaria the\nheartfelt condolences of the Government of Ecuador for\nthe irreparable loss it has suffered with the killing of\nformer Prime Minister Lukanov. Our condolences go also\nto the family and friends of that eminent man.\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, we\nremain immersed in a process of profound change on the\ninternational scene, resulting from the end of the\nideological confrontation between East and West. We are\nseeing the emergence of new opportunities for peace-\nbuilding, for the strengthening of development, for the\ndiffusion of democracy and for stepped-up international\ncooperation, especially politically. Ecuador believes that\nwe should take maximum advantage of these positive\nfactors and use them as a basis on which to devise the\nmost ambitious programme possible for the coming years,\nwith the goal of a world of equity and justice, a world in\nwhich future generations can live well, in secure\nconditions, at peace with themselves and with the\nenvironment on which their very survival depends.\nIn these circumstances, the essential objective of our\nOrganization, as established in the Charter, remains the\nsame: the maintenance of international peace and security.\nTo attain this objective, it is imperative that all Member\nStates reaffirm their faith in the purposes and principles\nenshrined in the Charter. Most fundamentally, this means\nbanning the threat or use of force against the territorial\nintegrity or the political independence of any State, as\nwell as the obligation to settle international disputes\nexclusively by peaceful means. The larger goal of\ninternational security should be seen as embracing the\npolitical, economic and social conditions in which all\nnations develop.\nWhile the danger of worldwide nuclear destruction\nhas receded, Ecuador continues to maintain that\npreventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons is not an\nend in itself, but an intermediate step towards the ultimate\nobjective of totally banning and completely destroying all\nnuclear weapons. Ecuador regrets that the Conference on\nDisarmament was unable to adopt by consensus the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). It takes\nthe view, however, that the text supported by most States,\nwhich has been endorsed by the General Assembly and\nopened for signature by States, is an important step\ntowards that objective. Ecuador has signed that\ninstrument. Although it is not the ideal instrument for\nwhich the Conference on Disarmament was striving, it\nwould be a mistake to start this long and arduous process\nall over again. Ecuador will also continue to work for\n21\n\n\ngeneral and complete disarmament, which will eliminate\nonce and for all the grave danger inherent in weapons of\nmass destruction and end the squandering of scarce national\nresources on weapons.\nEcuador voted in favour of resolution 49/75 K, by\nwhich the General Assembly requested the International\nCourt of Justice to issue an Advisory Opinion as to whether\ninternational law authorizes the threat or use of nuclear\nweapons in any circumstances. We welcome the Court\u2019s\nunanimous finding that\n\u201cThere is in neither customary nor conventional\ninternational law any specific authorization of the\nthreat or use of nuclear weapons.\u201d\nThe finding also states that\n\u201cA threat or use of force by means of nuclear\nweapons that is contrary to Article 2, paragraph 4, of\nthe United Nations Charter and that fails to meet all\nthe requirements of Article 51, is unlawful.\u201d\nIn its finding, the Court also expresses the view that\n\u201cThere exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and\nbring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear\ndisarmament in all its aspects under strict and\neffective international control.\u201d\nThe Government of Ecuador believes that the General\nAssembly should endorse these views, which form a basis\nfor the continued work of the international community to\nbring about the definitive banning of nuclear weapons.\nTerrorism in all its forms and manifestations;\norganized international crime; and the production,\nconsumption and trafficking of all illicit drugs continue to\npose grave threats that undermine international stability and\nthe security and well-being of society in general. To\neradicate these evils, we need a coordinated and persistent\ninternational effort in which all States should be involved,\nin accordance with their capacity and with their degree of\nresponsibility. In this regard, Ecuador is complying\nappropriately with its obligations.\nWe are currently experiencing the rapid globalization\nand interdependence of the world economy, which requires\nthe adoption of rational domestic policies and a favourable\ninternational economic environment. At present, the\npromotion of economic development is reflected in the\nliberalization of trade agreements and the establishment of\nan open multilateral commercial system. This new state\nof affairs has favourable effects; however, in certain\ncircumstances, it produces adverse consequences. For that\nreason it is imperative that policies and the international\nenvironment be structured so as to derive maximum\nbenefit from these trends and minimize the negative\neffects. Ecuador is mindful of this situation, but would\nalso like to stress the need, as expressed by the Heads of\nState and Government in the Declaration on the Occasion\nof the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations, to\n\u201cInvigorate the dialogue and partnership between all\ncountries in order to secure the existence of a\nfavourable political and economic environment for\nthe promotion of international cooperation for\ndevelopment based on the imperatives of mutual\nbenefit and interest and genuine interdependence,\nwhile recognizing that each country is ultimately\nresponsible for its own development\u201d. (resolution\n50/6, para. 8)\nIn this regard, direct foreign investment in developing\ncountries is particular important because it accelerates the\neconomic process to the benefit of both the investors and\nof the recipient economies.\nThe United Nations should continue to be an\nimportant catalyst in support of the economic and social\ndevelopment of the developing countries and of the\ndisadvantaged and marginalized sectors. The world\nOrganization has sponsored global conferences to address\nvital problems related to the environment, population,\nsocial development, crime, the advancement of women,\nthe protection of the family, human settlements, trade and\ndevelopment, and public administration. The\nrecommendations and initiatives adopted at those\nconferences have set genuine priorities for the\ninternational community in the promotion of development.\nNevertheless, what has been achieved to date in many of\nthese fields is still uneven and insufficient. Therefore,\nEcuador reaffirms that, in order to effectively implement\nthese decisions, there needs to be a rapid mobilization of\nthe resources for development, as well as a more efficient\nuse of those resources. Without such an international\ncommitment, all the conferences\u2019 recommendations and\nother similar pronouncements will only enlarge the\noverloaded archives of our foreign ministries. Given the\npersistence of such environmental problems as the lack of\ndrinking water, threats to biological diversity, the\ndepletion of the ozone layer, the warming of the\natmosphere, the diminishing soil productivity,\ndesertification and diminishing food security,\n22\n\n\nGovernments of both industrialized and developing\ncountries must take joint, concerted action.\nEcuador, faithful to its democratic traditions, has\nrecently provided an example of a transparent electoral\nprocess and of respect for the popular will. As a result,\nPresident Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram was elected to lead the country,\nand for the first time in Ecuadorian history, a woman, Mrs.\nRosal'a Arteaga, has been elected Vice-President of the\nRepublic. The new Administration\u2019s first and principal\nactions are focused on social policies, especially on\ncombating poverty and on a wide-ranging national\nprogramme of low-cost housing.\nGiven its faith in the will of the people, Ecuador\nwelcomes the growing trend towards democratization: more\nand more countries have adopted multi-party systems,\norganized free and fair elections and begun to transform\nthemselves into more open and participative societies.\nHowever, Ecuador also believes that this process does not\nhappen spontaneously but requires the understanding and\nsupport of the international community so as to create and\nsustain conditions conducive to such changes. In other\nwords, democracy and hunger are antithetical elements that\ncannot exist together.\nThe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action \u2014\nwhich is steadily gaining practical force and\neffectiveness \u2014 reaffirm the solemn commitment of all\nStates to promote and protect all human rights and\nfundamental freedoms. The interrelationship between human\nrights, democracy and development articulated in that\nDeclaration and Programme, calls for a comprehensive and\nglobal approach to ensure the promotion and protection of\nhuman rights.\nIn the Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth\nAnniversary of the United Nations, the Heads of State and\nGovernment reaffirmed that all human rights are universal,\nindivisible, interdependent and interrelated. They made a\ncommitment, among other things, to protect all human\nrights and fundamental freedoms; to strengthen laws,\npolicies and programmes to secure the full and equal\nparticipation of women in all spheres of political, civil,\neconomic, social and cultural life; to promote and protect\nthe rights of the child; to ensure protection of the rights of\npeople who are particularly vulnerable, including young\npeople, the disabled, the elderly and migrant workers; and\nto promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations.\nEcuador considers that human rights has become one of the\nmost important spheres of United Nations action. It\nsupports the work of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights in his efforts to carry\nout this broad and important programme of activities.\nIt should be recalled that economic and social\nproblems are not restricted to the most disadvantaged\ncountries. A number of societies are seriously threatened\nby increasing external debt, the instability of the\ninternational financial system, persistent unemployment,\nintractable poverty and increasingly destructive waves of\ncrime and corruption. The inequality gap between\ndeveloped and developing countries remains unacceptably\nlarge and continues to widen. More than 1 billion people\nlack drinking water, and 1.7 billion do not have access to\nproper health facilities. This means that poverty continues\nto affect more than one fifth of the world\u2019s population.\nHunger, malnutrition, health problems, a total lack of\nhousing, limited access to education and other public\nservices and resources, social exclusion, alienation and\nviolence are only a few of the many factors associated\nwith poverty. The fight against this scourge is one of the\ngreatest challenges that the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies must face in close cooperation with\nnon-governmental organizations and the international\ncommunity as a whole. Since 1990, commitments have\nbeen made and goals established, with a view to\nachieving the overall objective of eradicating poverty in\npartnership with all the actors associated with\ndevelopment. In this context, and from this lofty rostrum,\nEcuador would like to issue an urgent appeal to all\nMember States to intensify international cooperation, in\nits many aspects, in order to fight vigorously together to\nensure that these commitments and goals have practical\nand effective application. We must remember that poverty\nis not only a malady which destroys the societies directly\naffected, it is also a corrosive contagion that prevents\ninternational relations from developing on a basis of\njustice and equity.\nEcuador is a multi-ethnic country with sizeable and\nimportant indigenous groups and significant black\nminorities. For this reason, it considers that the\nInternational Decade of the World\u2019s Indigenous People,\ndeclared by this General Assembly, establishes a\nprogramme of action that will restore the rights of those\npeoples, which have systematically been victims of a long\nhistorical process of exclusion and discrimination. We\nbelieve it is incumbent on the entire international\ncommunity to build universal understanding of the fact\nthat protecting those populations also means preserving\nthe cultural heritage of humankind. Ecuador trusts that it\ncan rely on international cooperation in order to\n23\n\n\nappropriately fulfil its obligation in this respect, in\ncoordination with its national programmes.\nThe founders of the United Nations must have realized\nthat they could not foresee exactly what the world would be\nlike 50 years hence. On the other hand, they established\nbasic objectives and principles and incorporated them in a\nCharter that is sufficiently flexible to enable the\nOrganization to serve its peaceful objectives and to evolve\nin response to new challenges. This is why the Charter, and\nits purposes and principles, has endured. However, today\u2019s\nchanged circumstances, which determine the functioning of\nthe United Nations, demand a modification in the structure\nand the operational practices of our Organization. It is\nnecessary, among other things, to increase the United\nNations capacity to prevent conflicts through preventive\ndiplomacy, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. We need better\nways and means to respond to the challenges of emergency\nsituations. And, along with all of this, it is essential to fully\ncarry out the work of economic and social development.\nThe General Assembly must be revitalized as the pre-\neminent organ in which all Member States exercise on an\nequal footing their rights and duties as set forth in the\nCharter. Equitable representation in the Security Council\nmust be assured, and its size must be in proportion with the\nnumber of Member States. It must cease being an elitist\norgan with antidemocratic privileges, and the efficiency and\ntransparency of its work must be enhanced. The Economic\nand Social Council must regain its essential original\nfunctions as set out in the Charter: primarily, to promote\nwell-being and to improve living standards for all the\ninhabitants of the Earth. The current financial crisis is\nseriously affecting the United Nations ability to fulfil the\nlofty objectives set forth in the Charter. The greatest\ndebtors should set an example of their readiness to fulfil\ntheir obligations. Only if there is a general willingness to\nprovide the United Nations with the resources it needs, as\nwell as the necessary political support, will it be possible\nfor the global Organization to live up to the trust and hopes\nthat humankind has vested in it.\nI wish to inform the General Assembly that since the\nlast session, as regards the peacemaking process being\ncarried out pursuant to the Itamaraty Declaration between\nEcuador and Peru, and with the participation of the\nguarantor countries \u2014 Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the\nUnited States \u2014 several meetings have taken place at both\nthe diplomatic and military levels. At these there has been\nsignificant progress, progress that my delegation regards as\nconducive to finalizing the procedures for discussions on\nthe substance of the border dispute between the two\ncountries. The Government of Ecuador will continue to\nwork towards the achievement of the ultimate goal, which\nis no less than a fair, definitive and honourable solution\nto the problem.\n\n\n\n"

In congratulating\nhim on his election, I am pleased by the fact that he\nrepresents a country, Malaysia, with which Portugal has\nexcellent relations in addition to deep historical and cultural\nties.\nI believe that it is understandable that I should also\ntake this opportunity to pay tribute to the outgoing\nPresident, my fellow countryman Mr. Freitas do Amaral,\nfor the dedicated, competent and innovative manner in\nwhich he directed the work of the fiftieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nI wish also to express to the Secretary-General my\nadmiration for the manner in which he has carried out his\nfunctions during a period in which the United Nations has\nbeen called upon to take an ever more active role in a\nvariety of aspects of international life.\nMy colleague from Ireland has already addressed the\nAssembly on behalf of the 15 member States of the\nEuropean Union, expressing positions to which Portugal\nfully subscribes. Nevertheless, I would like to reflect on\nsome questions that are of particular importance to my\ncountry.\nAllow me to point out that while speaking in my\ncapacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal, I am\nalso speaking as a representative of a country that is\nextremely proud to belong to the Lusophone Community.\nThis is probably the newest international organization, and\nas President of its Council of Ministers, I foresee an\nimportant role for it in the concert of nations, in useful\nand effective cooperation with the United Nations and its\nagencies. It represents a strengthening of the solidarity\nand fraternity that unite these countries and will empower\nthe economic and social development of its peoples, while\naffirming and disseminating the Portuguese language,\nwhich is the common heritage of over 200 million people\nscattered over every continent.\nThe Lusophone Community, made up of Angola,\nBrazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Sao\nTome and Principe and Portugal, is a political project\nbased on the Portuguese language, which is the historic\nbond and a common heritage of the seven countries,\ndespite geographical separation. It will always be an open\nforum, based on mutual support and close relationships\nwith all Portuguese-speaking communities of the world\nand cooperation with other, similar organizations.\nOne year after the commemoration of the fiftieth\nanniversary, we are still far from meeting the expectations\ncreated and the real needs of the Organization. It is clear\nthat a process on this scale can be realized only in the\nmedium term.\nA core issue of the reform process that we must\naddress is the resolution of the serious financial crisis of\nthe United Nations. We believe that the resolution of the\ncrisis can be found through three essential approaches: the\nfulfilment of commitments, in full and on time; review of\nthe scale of assessments in order to reflect the capacity of\nMember States to pay; and financial rigour and\nrationalization of existing resources. In the spirit of\ncontributing to the resolution of this crisis, Portugal\nvoluntarily increased its 1995 contributions to the\npeacekeeping budget, moving from Group C to Group B\n19\n\n\nin the scale of assessments. That decision will result in a\nfive-fold increase of our initial contribution.\nEqually important is the reform of the Security\nCouncil. We are convinced that only with an adequate and\nbalanced representation of all the world\u2019s regions will the\nSecurity Council be more democratic and, consequently,\nmore effective in the formulation and implementation of its\ndecisions.\nWhen considering the process of reform, I must also\nrefer to issues related to the Agenda for Development and\nthe Agenda for Peace. With regard to the former, we must\nrecognize the need to review the entire system of\ninternational aid for development and consider the role the\nUnited Nations should play in this domain.\nThe integrated and sustainable development we\npropose should be pursued in all its facets, not only in the\neconomic field, but also in the consolidation of democratic\ninstitutions. To meet these objectives, it will also be\nnecessary to implement the decisions taken at the major\nUnited Nations global conferences, as it has been at those\nconferences that the Agenda for Development has gradually\ntaken shape. This question is all the more important to us\nin Portugal, since we focus special attention on the\nNorth-South dialogue, which is attested to by the fact that\nthe North-South Centre is located in Lisbon.\nAware of the fact that today the important task in this\narea is to help the developing countries, especially the more\nvulnerable ones, Portugal has gradually increased the funds\nit sets aside for development aid, both at the bilateral level\nand through the framework of international organizations of\nwhich it is a member. In this context, our official\ndevelopment assistance exceeds the goal established for\ndonors at the Paris conference in 1990.\nAt the multilateral level, allow me to single out the\nimportance we attribute to the Lom\u00e9 Convention as a vital\ninstrument of aid and cooperation between the members of\nthe European Union and the countries of Africa, the\nCaribbean and the Pacific. Thus, we have strongly\nadvocated a review of the Convention based on maintaining\nthe principles of partnership and cooperation.\nMaintaining international peace and security\nundoubtedly continues to be the priority challenge faced by\nthe United Nations. The results achieved in most of the\nrelevant missions lead us to conclude that we should not\nlessen our commitment or the dynamism of our activity.\nIt is true that the United Nations cannot abdicate its\nmission of helping to restore peace. We also believe,\nhowever, that efforts should be focused on conflict\nprevention. But in both areas, the question of cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and regional\nintergovernmental organizations has been discerningly\nraised. This can be seen in some recent successful\nexamples, such as the joint action of the United Nations,\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the\nWestern European Union (WEU), the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the\nEuropean Union (EU) in the territory of the former\nYugoslavia, organizations of which Portugal is a member\nand in which it participates actively.\nAnother component of the efforts towards peace is\ndisarmament. Portugal welcomes the adoption of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\nPortugal, which will contribute significantly to the CTBT\nverification system, has signed and will shortly ratify the\nTreaty, and appeals to all Member States of the United\nNations to do the same.\nIt is urgent that the process of enlarging the\nConference on Disarmament be completed, as well as that\nof deliberating on its agenda and the rules for decision-\nmaking and for admission of new members, which should\nbe improved. It is increasingly essential to seriously\ndebate nuclear disarmament, with a view to achieving the\nultimate goal of the permanent eradication of nuclear\nweapons. We advocate that the Conference on\nDisarmament should, early at its next session, begin\nnegotiations on a treaty for the banning of the production\nof fissile material for nuclear weapons.\nWith regard to the serious problem of anti-personnel\nlandmines, Portugal hopes that concrete measures will be\ntaken this year towards a complete prohibition of the\nmanufacture and export of those devices of death and\ndestruction. For our part, we have already decreed a\nmoratorium on the manufacture and export of such\nweapons. Furthermore, I would like to mention that on 23\nAugust last my country ratified the Convention on the\nbanning of chemical weapons.\nAmong the many activities of the United Nations, I\nwould like to single out two areas which I consider\nessential: the environment and human rights.\nThe protection of the environment is becoming an\nincreasingly prominent issue. In this field, we recognize\nthe great importance of the problems of climate change,\n20\n\n\ndesertification and the protection of the marine\nenvironment. For this reason, Portugal has been closely\nfollowing the implementation of the principles and\ndecisions adopted in this regard at major United Nations\nconferences.\nI would also like to underline the particular sensitivity\nof Portugal, whose territory includes two archipelagos \u2014\nthe Azores and Madeira \u2014 to questions relating to the sea\nfrom a perspective of the development of balanced\nmanagement of fishing and marine resources. To this end,\nmy country is currently concluding the necessary\nprocedures that will soon permit it to ratify the United\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nFurthermore, on Portugal\u2019s initiative, the General\nAssembly, at its forty-ninth session, declared 1998\nInternational Year of the Ocean. Focusing on this subject,\nExpo 98 will be held in Lisbon that same year, with the\ntheme, \u201cThe oceans: a heritage for the future\u201d. Its central\nfocus will be the relationship between the current state of\nknowledge on marine resources and the urgency of\nensuring, through a rational and scientific management\nprocess, a greater ecological equilibrium on our planet.\nThe defence and promotion of human rights is one of\nthe principal concerns of Portuguese foreign policy. We\nbelieve that it is the responsibility of every Government to\nguarantee in their respective countries the full enjoyment of\nall human rights, but that it is also legitimate for the\ninternational community to concern itself with ensuring the\npromotion and protection of those rights around the globe.\nWe consider that the United Nations has a key role to\nplay, and thus it is indispensable that the High\nCommissioner and the Centre for Human Rights be\nprovided with adequate human and financial resources for\nthe fulfilment of his important task.\nA constant pursuit of Portuguese foreign policy has\nbeen to stress the need to find a political and diplomatic\nsolution to the question of East Timor, without which it\nwill not be possible to put an to end the systematic abuses\nof human rights that continue to prevail in that territory.\nPortugal has repeatedly stated \u2014 and I do so here\nonce again \u2014 that its sole objective, apart from the\nimmediate concern of defending the human rights and\nidentity of the people of East Timor in their different\naspects, is to find a just, comprehensive and internationally\nacceptable solution to the question of East Timor, in\naccordance with international law and the full respect for\nthe rights of its people, namely its right to\nself-determination.\nDespite the difficulties that have been encountered,\nthe difference between the substantive positions of\nPortugal and Indonesia and the slowness of the process,\nwe continue to be committed to finding such a solution\nthrough dialogue and under the auspices of the Secretary-\nGeneral, whose patient efforts I wish to pay tribute to\nhere. In the pursuit of that objective, we consider it\nextremely important to continue the active association of\nTimorese representatives to that process, which deserves\nthe unequivocal support of the international community.\nIn this regard, I must note here the increasing\nsupport that this question has received from the\ninternational community, namely through the adoption of\npositions that range from the resolutions of the European\nParliament to the declarations of the 21 Heads of State\nand Government of the member countries of the Ibero-\nAmerican summit, and include the common position\nadopted this year by the 15 member States of the\nEuropean Union, to which a further 14 European\ncountries associated themselves.\nPortugal, exercising its responsibilities as\nadministering Power of the non-self-governing territory of\nEast Timor, will continue to cooperate constructively with\nthe United Nations, with full regard for the Charter of the\nUnited Nations and the relevant resolutions, towards the\nindispensable conclusion of the process of decolonization\nin East Timor.\nIn this era, at the close of the millennium, marked\nby such profound changes and close interdependencies,\nwe believe that the African continent deserves special\nattention from the international community. To that end,\nall efforts should be pooled towards the creation of\nconditions that will permit it to benefit from a\ndevelopment process similar to that enjoyed by other\nregions of the world.\nWe are therefore acting in the context of the\ninternational organizations of which we are members,\nwith the aim of preventing the marginalization of the\nAfrican continent and ensuring that it receives priority\ntreatment on the agenda of the international community.\nBecause we actively uphold this view, Portugal has\nproposed to its European Union partners that a\nEuro-African summit take place, open to the participation\nof all African States without exception, so as to allow for\n21\n\n\na political dialogue at the very highest level on issues of\nmutual concern. The goal is to achieve a new dimension to\nour relations and provide a further impulse to traditional\nareas of mutual cooperation in order to create the\nfoundations of a new global partnership. The 15 Member\nStates of the European Union have already recognized the\ninterest and importance of this initiative.\nIn this manner, we are seeking to include Africa in all\nits aspects on the international agenda, stressing, on the one\nhand, the scale and economic potential of the African\ncontinent, which is deserving of a new approach and a new\nmodel for dialogue, and, on the other hand, encouraging\nAfrican countries to embark on their own process of\ndevelopment based on the promotion of peace, democracy,\nstability and economic and social progress.\nWe supported from the very beginning the creation\nand establishment of the Mechanism for Conflict\nPrevention, Management and Resolution by the\nOrganization of African Unity at the Cairo summit in 1993.\nPortugal attaches great importance to strengthening the\ndialogue between the European Union and the Southern\nAfrican Development Community. The second ministerial\nsummit, planned for this October in Windhoek, will\ncertainly allow for a global review of the adequacy of the\nactivities undertaken as a result of the Berlin conference.\nPortugal, a member of the troika of observers to the\npeace process in Angola, continues to be particularly\nengaged in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol,\nwhich seeks, in general terms, the re-establishment in\nAngola of constitutional democratic life and the formation\nof a single national army.\nI take this opportunity to salute the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General of the United\nNations, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, whose negotiating\nskills constitute an important factor in placing peace and\nhope in a better future once more on the horizon for all\nAngolans.\nWe note with satisfaction the positive developments\nthat have taken place over the last few months in the\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol, which have\npermitted the cessation of hostilities throughout the entire\nterritory of Angola. However, we cannot ignore the fact\nthat important tasks remain to be completed, without which\nthe irreversibility of the peace process cannot be\nguaranteed. The postponement of the resolution of military\nand political questions is difficult to understand and may\njeopardize the process of consolidating peace.\nAllow me therefore to recall the concerns expressed\nin the declaration of the troika of observers \u2014 Portugal,\nthe Russian Federation and the United States \u2014 issued on\n22 August 1996. I appeal to the Government of Angola\nand to UNITA to continue to follow the path of peace\nthey have set out on in order to contribute decisively to\nthe full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, namely\nthrough one armed force and the creation of conditions\nfor the free movement of people and goods, which would\nmake possible the normal functioning of society, the\neconomy and the institutions in that great African country.\nI should also like to appeal to the international\ncommunity to support the reconstruction and rehabilitation\nof Angola. In particular, it is urgent that the necessary\nfunds be made available for the implementation of the\nprogrammes for the demobilization of former combatants.\nSocial stability is indispensable to the success of the\npeace process.\nI would not like to end this reference to Africa\nwithout expressing concern for the situation currently\nprevailing in the Great Lakes region, which has tragic\nrepercussions on the security and well-being of innocent\npeoples. Portugal is participating in the efforts of the\ninternational community to bring to an end this tragedy of\nthe African continent and to ensure the return of stability\nto that region.\nPortugal did not remain indifferent to the suffering\nof the peoples of the Balkans or to a situation with\nserious consequences for peace and stability in the region.\nPortugal therefore participates in the Implementation\nForce with a significant military, police and civilian\ncontingent, very often demonstrating a greater effort and\nengagement than that of other countries with larger\neconomic capacities.\nThe recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nrepresented an important step towards the consolidation of\npeace, and we are confident that they will have a lasting\neffect on the consolidation of the Bosnian State \u2014 based\non its two entities \u2014 allowing for a self-sustained\nstability of the country and the reconfiguration of the\nInternational Force so as not to affect the fundamental\ngoal of guaranteeing peace and the coexistence of the\nthree communities.\n22\n\n\nPortugal will be the host country for the next summit\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE), which will take place in Lisbon on 2-3 December\nnext. We hope that the 53 Heads of State and Government\nwill take substantial decisions with regard to the\ncornerstone principles of a security model for the twenty-\nfirst century. I am certain that the Lisbon charter, to be\nadopted at that meeting, will represent a significant step\ntowards the stability of the European continent and the\ninstitutional strengthening of the OSCE.\nPortugal has promoted closer and deeper ties with the\ncountries of the Mediterranean, especially those of the\nMaghreb, a region of fundamental importance for the\nsecurity, stability and development of the entire region. In\nthe short term, it is necessary to adopt confidence-building\nmeasures that would contribute to launching the foundations\nof a new type of relationship between the peoples of both\nsides of the Mediterranean. Portugal is committed to the\ncreation of a Euro-Mediterranean charter, a matrix for a\nnew partnership that will contribute decisively to the\npolitical, economic, social and cultural development of our\nMediterranean partners.\nPortugal is following with great concern the latest\ndevelopments in the Middle East peace process.\nWe believe that the future of the region depends\nessentially on the will of the parties urgently to restart the\nnegotiations in accordance with the principles of Madrid\nand the Oslo terms of reference. I appeal to all interested\nparties to exhibit restraint and to honour previously\nassumed commitments, which is the only way to achieve a\njust, comprehensive and lasting peace for the region. The\ndramatic incidents that have just occurred are the clearest\ndemonstration that there is no alternative to the peace\nprocess.\nPortugal has very strong human, historical and cultural\nties with Latin America. The next Ibero-American Summit,\nwhich will take place in Chile, will represent another\noccasion to debate the important advances that the\nprocesses of democratization and development have\nachieved on that continent. Furthermore Portugal welcomes\nthe holding in 1998 of the seventh Ibero-American Summit\nof Heads of State and Government.\nPortugal welcomes the projects for inter-American\nregional integration, as well as the mechanisms for\ncooperation, that have been gradually established between\nthe countries of that continent and the European Union.\nThe development of a relationship with Asia also\nconstitutes one of the Government of Portugal\u2019s foreign-\npolicy priorities. We share a common historical heritage\nwith many countries in that region. At the bilateral level,\nin addition to opening new embassies in South-East Asia,\nwe will be seeking to strengthen even further our\nrelationship with the Pacific island States, which will\ncertainly be reflected in the framework of the Lom\u00e9\nConvention.\nIn terms of our multilateral participation, we hope\nthat the new dialogue created in the framework of the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) will\nrepresent a significant step in the relationship between\nEurope and Asia, leading to a more open and broader\ncontact on all matters of mutual interest to the European\nUnion and Asia.\nThe transitional process in Macao, to be completed\nat the end of 1999, based on a constructive dialogue and\nclose cooperation with China, is of the greatest\nimportance to the Government of Portugal, whose\nfundamental concern is to guarantee the prosperity and\nstability of the territory, as well as to preserve its identity.\nThe multilateral dynamic is undeniably gaining an\never-greater importance in the international realities of the\npresent. Portugal has been developing unequivocal efforts\ntowards strengthening its participation in the organizations\nto which it already belongs and becoming involved in\nnew multilateral frameworks. Clear evidence of Portugal\u2019s\nattitude in this respect is our increasing participation in\npeacekeeping operations. Portugal has considerable forces\nin Bosnia and Angola, and currently has the sensitive\nresponsibility of ensuring command of the United Nations\nforce in the Western Sahara. I am pleased to note that in\nthe domain of peacekeeping and international security, we\nare the European Union\u2019s sixth-largest troop contributor\nto United Nations peacekeeping operations, and the ninth\nlargest among those countries that make up the Western\nEuropean and other States group. We are clearly in the\ntop half of the list of countries that contribute forces to\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. We also lead\nother Member States with greater resources and per capita\noutput.\nPortugal\u2019s candidature for membership of the\nSecurity Council should be considered as an important\nexpression of the will of my country to continue to\nparticipate, as fully as possible, in the multilateral\ndimension of today\u2019s world. Portugal is a country with a\nuniversalist commitment, which is used to establishing\n23\n\n\ncontact with many and diverse regions of the world, and to\nunderstanding and accepting different cultures and\ncivilizations.\nWe therefore believe that as a member of the Security\nCouncil we would be able to contribute to finding solutions\nin accordance with the principles and purposes enshrined in\nthe Charter. We also believe that participation in the\nSecurity Council by States of a size and with characteristics\nsimilar to those of Portugal would contribute to greater\nequilibrium and representativity in the decisions taken by\nthat body.\nThis will be possible only when full respect is given\nto the principle of sovereign equality of all Member States,\nwhich, in truth, represents the principal guarantee of\ndemocracy in the Security Council. Yet this principle has\nnot been observed in practice. Indeed, out of the 185\nMember States, 79 have never served on the Security\nCouncil and 44 have served only once, as is the case with\nPortugal.\nWe can and should improve this situation. Indeed, to\nguarantee adequate representation by Member States on the\nSecurity Council, obstacles or precedents must not be used\nthat would prevent a healthy rotation in that organ. For\nthese reasons, the Portuguese candidature for membership\nof the Security Council is based on its own merits. We\nrefuse to resort to any alliances, coalitions or other artificial\nmeans that would limit and condition the right of choice of\nMember States.\nPortugal\u2019s candidature was not launched to defend\ninterests or to respond to the demands of domestic politics,\nnor was it launched to pursue or consolidate external\nambitions. Portuguese foreign policy is an undivided whole.\nIt is part of, and evolves within, a well-defined\ngeo-strategic space. It is not based on arrogance or\neconomic power, nor has it been altered to accommodate\nPortugal\u2019s candidature. The foreign policy of my country is\nbased consistently on its universalist commitment to\ndialogue with all the peoples of the world.\nBefore concluding, I should like to cast my vote of\nconfidence in the future of the United Nations and to\nreiterate Portugal\u2019s full commitment to the reform of the\nOrganization.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLike some others present here, I too have had the\nopportunity to visit Malaysia. Malaysia is a great country,\nboth in size and because of its outstanding successes in\nmany areas. But it is a great country above all because of\nthe quality of the women and men who govern it and who\nrepresent it on the international scene. Ambassador Razali\nIsmail is without doubt one of its most eminent\nrepresentatives. I am therefore convinced that he will\npreside over the work of our 51-year-old Organization with\ngreat cheer and efficiency. I convey to him and to all the\nelected members of the Bureau my congratulations and\nbest wishes for success.\nI would also like to congratulate his predecessor,\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, whose personal qualities\nand wealth of experience guided the work of the historic\nfiftieth session in an exemplary manner. We wish to\nconvey our great gratitude to him.\nFinally, I pay well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his outstanding\nefforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations and\nfor the talent and tenacity with which he has guided the\nOrganization in these difficult times.\nIn July 1996, the Assembly of Heads of State and\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity adopted\nin Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, a declaration expressing its\nappreciation for and stressing the work done by\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the helm of the United\nNations. According to tradition and the rules of fairness,\nAfrica is entitled to a second mandate, which we hope\nwill come about.\nThe current trends on the international scene are\ndisquieting. The sovereign equality of States and the\nprinciple of free trade are being damaged by unilateral\nmeasures, despite the fact that the General Assembly of\nthe United Nations has reaffirmed these principles and the\nstrict respect that should be accorded to them. Moreover,\nwe are facing a financial crisis that is essentially caused\nby the default on payments of assessed contributions due\nto the Organization. The overwhelming majority of\nspeakers who have preceded me have said that this\npractice is unacceptable, particularly on the part of those\nwho have the capacity to pay.\nThe procedures and decision-making process of the\nSecurity Council are still fairly opaque, despite some\nminor openings. The geographical origins of the\npermanent members run counter to the principle of\nequitable geographical distribution. The cause of this is\nhistorical, but this perception is now more widespread and\nstark, 51 years after the creation of the Organization. Yet\ntoday, through the deliberations and decisions of the\nSecurity Council, a veritable body of substantive\ninternational law, armed with sanctions and strewn with\nad hoc tribunals, is emerging. After 51 years, the General\nAssembly, the pedestal and guarantor of this structure,\nfinds itself stripped of its powers and even of its\nfunctions.\n\n\n\nWe cannot compare the General Assembly to the\nSecurity Council but recent developments in these two\nbodies have accentuated their differences instead of\nemphasizing their complementarity, which is not a healthy\nsituation. Ironically, this situation coincides with the\nvehement, ongoing clamour for transparency and democracy\neverywhere. The reform of the United Nations system is\nunderstood in various ways and we have yet to find the\nformula that can be supported by everyone. Difficulties\narise from the demands of some and the reluctance of\nothers. Clearly, reform must be a joint effort or it will not\ncome about. We are concerned because all of these\ncombined factors might encourage the disturbing trends to\nwhich I referred earlier.\nIndeed, the financial situation of the United Nations is\ncentral to the significance and future of our Organization.\nAn institution, a community of men and women, can be\ncreated by force \u2014 can, for a time, be maintained by\nforce \u2014 but it is not force that makes them last. The idea\nof leadership is based on the ability to take decisions as\nwell as on moral authority. Moral authority is based on the\nability to convince the majority in a lasting and complete\nway. To be followed without conviction is to run the risk\nof abandonment as soon as short cuts can be safely taken.\nThe joint aspiration of the States Members of the\nUnited Nations was, is and must remain that of following\na common path beneficial to all. It is no coincidence that in\nthe Charter, drafted at the end of a conflict in which\nPowers imposed themselves on other Powers, spirit and\nletter came together so that States large and small could\nfeel involved as much in the responsibilities and decision-\nmaking as in the outcome. Hence the principle of the\nsovereign equality of States, who assumed that, regardless\nof their size or importance, each should participate to the\nbest of its ability in the functioning of the Organization\nbecause, in this way, each worked equally to attain the\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter. Nor is it a\ncoincidence that those which bore a greater burden in this\nrespect were given a privilege in the Security Council,\nthough it was to be exercised on behalf of all and for the\nbenefit of all.\nWhat is happening nowadays? The United Nations is\nunique. It is political. Its role and its objectives are very\nspecial. How can we, therefore, try to see it as a company\nwhose shareholders want to move it in a particular direction\non the basis of the number of shares they hold? How could\nwe continue to call ourselves United Nations? The United\nNations has charge over destinies and people. It is also an\ninstitution that must be managed, but one in which\neveryone has a place.\nI have dwelt at length on this point because Burkina\nFaso is a community of men that understands, appreciates\nand supports the fact that the United Nations is\nirreplaceable. It is an instrument which has no equal and\nwe desire a world of fraternity and progress.\nAfrica is fighting for its development, although beset\nby crises and conflicts, such as those in Liberia and\nBurundi. In Liberia, after the events of April 1996, the\nsummit meeting of the Committee of Nine and a certain\nopen-mindedness on the part of faction leaders calmed the\nsituation, permitted the nomination of a new Head of\nState in the person of Ms. Ruth Perry, opened up\nprospects for the holding of elections. We encourage this\ntrend.\nIn Burundi, a military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat swept away\ncivilian rule, but the fraternal States of the subregion\nrejected fait accompli by ordering sanctions. We are\ntherefore concerned by the situation in that country, which\nhas already been traumatized by numerous ethnic\nconflicts. The international community should pay heed\nto that and provide resources.\nTurning to the subject of Taiwan, Burkina Faso\nwould refer to the principle of universality in the matter\nof representation of 22 million people. We hope that an\nad hoc committee will be established.\nPoverty is on the rise. It is the result of the policies\nof the countries that control the markets. Poverty is also\nthe consequence of unequal distribution among the\ndeveloping countries. In all cases, statements on both\nsides very often sound like incantations crashing against\nthe wall of cold implacable reality. The idea of\nglobalization, paradoxically, goes hand in hand with that\nof fragmentation, both political and economic. The world\nconferences held over the past six years have promoted\nthe concept of partnership. We still need to give that\nconcept real content and weight. Unfortunately, we still\npossess neither of these despite real efforts by some\npartners of the North. Invective, tirades of complaint and\nexhortations have not advanced the debate nor brought us\ncloser to the right solutions.\nFrom 16 to 20 September 1996, we held the mid-\nterm review of the United Nations New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. We thank\nAmbassador Owada and his country, Japan, for their\n3\n\n\ninterest in the development of Africa. However, we must\nacknowledge that the results of our negotiations with our\nother partners continue to fall short of our expectations,\nneeds and priorities, although Africa has largely met its\ncommitments. The same goes for the mid-term review\nundertaken by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund on the\noutcome of the World Summit for Children. Increased\nresources are necessary and expected.\nSelf-control is the beginning of wisdom, but it is not\nenough without an enabling environment. From the\ndiscussions in the Uruguay Round to the creation of the\nWorld Trade Organization, this point is constantly being\nborne out. Solidarity, the key word, must prevail and guide\nour actions if we want a global village, not just a series\nof enclaves that are more or less fortunate and in the long\nrun condemned to mutual destruction.\nMultilaterlism could prevent that fate, especially\nsince we are now seeing that the State is surrendering\ncontrol over certain elements of its sovereignty.\nEverywhere, structures and organizations with varying\ndegrees of legality are transcending States and\nestablishing transnational networks and relations. It is\ntherefore imperative that we keep pace with these trends\nand adapt now and in the future our special instrument,\nour common instrument: the United Nations at the service\nof peoples. Political will is what will make the difference."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe delegation of Costa Rica is pleased to\nextend its warmest congratulations to the President of the\nGeneral Assembly on his election. In addition to his\ndistinguished personal and professional qualities, we are\ninspired by the respect and friendship that we share with\nMalaysia, a living example of many peoples joining their\nefforts without losing their identity, as is appropriately\nstated in the motto of Malaysia: Unity is strength.\nI am also pleased to convey Costa Rica\u2019s respects to\nthe former President of the General Assembly, His\nExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for his excellent\nwork presiding over the deliberations of the Assembly.\nMr. Secretary-General, your work in favour of world\npeace and security and your efforts to renew the United\nNations have granted you a place of honour in the pages of\nthe history of this Organization and of the international\ncommunity. My delegation wishes to convey the gratitude\nand respect Costa Rica feels for your commendable work.\nA session of the General Assembly is necessarily a\ntime for meditation for all Member States. Each and every\ndelegation asks itself the same questions: what progress has\nbeen made towards fulfilling the purposes and principles of\nthe United Nations during the last 12 months? What has our\ncountry or region done to contribute to that task? Is the\nUnited Nations playing the role we would like it to? What\ncan we do to ensure that this Organization lives up to the\nhopes placed in it? What progress have we achieved in the\nreform of the United Nations?\nWe are keenly aware that in this post-cold-war era the\nUnited Nations agenda has grown considerably.\nNevertheless, the present situation does not seem very\nencouraging. The establishment of this Organization, as we\nwere reminded during the celebration of its fiftieth\nanniversary, was one of the most extraordinary\nconsequences of the end of the Second World War.\nHowever, the so-called balance of terror between the super-\nPowers that prevailed in the cold-war years has been\nfollowed by a long series of conflicts that, despite their\nlimited geographical scope, are nonetheless damaging and\nbloody. We have watched in anguish as, in several parts of\nthe world, national, religious, tribal and racial hatreds\nhave re-emerged. Even within pluralistic democracies,\nsituations of extreme poverty and social injustice in some\ninstances, or of crime and drug trafficking in others, have\nunleashed varying degrees of violence. To all this we\nmust add the recent events of recent weeks in the Middle\nEast, which have given rise to deep concern and may\nhave grave consequences for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security.\nNonetheless, there are grounds for optimism. We\nhope that the elections in Bosnia, which took place in a\nharmonious environment, will allow for the establishment\nof a durable multi-ethnic State, in the spirit of the peace\nagreements.\nIn the same vein, my delegation welcomes the\nresumption of negotiations between the State of Israel and\nthe Palestinian Authority aimed at achieving harmonious\nrelations among the peoples inhabiting the Holy Land. I\nam pleased to inform the General Assembly that a\nplenipotentiary envoy from Costa Rica met recently with\nChairman Arafat to convey to him Costa Rica\u2019s solidarity\nwith the Palestinian people and its steadfast determination\nto support and contribute to compliance with the Oslo\nagreements in order to achieve a stable and lasting peace\nin the Middle East.\nCosta Rica, which will soon celebrate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the abolition of its armed forces, also\nwelcomed the Advisory Opinion of the International\nCourt of Justice regarding the legality of the use and\nthreat of use of nuclear weapons, and it is deeply satisfied\nby the opening for signature of the Comprehensive\nNuclear Test-Ban Treaty. Since 1958, in the framework\nof the Organization of American States, my country has\nbeen proposing the limitation of conventional weapons\nand the prohibition of nuclear weapons within the inter-\nAmerican system. In keeping with this civil and pacifist\ninclination, Costa Rica signed the Treaty at the General\nAssembly. My delegation further calls fraternally upon all\nMember States of the United Nations to do likewise as\nsoon as possible. Similarly, my nation considers most\nfavourably the draft resolution proposed by Malaysia\nregarding the follow-up to the Advisory Opinion and its\ncall for the start of negotiations to conclude a treaty\nproviding for global nuclear disarmament.\nWe are also of the view that greater consideration\nneeds to be given to the problems raised by international\narms transfers and trade. The delegation of Costa Rica\nwould like to take this opportunity to recall the draft\n23\n\n\ninternational code of conduct on this issue, proposed by the\nformer President of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias, and other\nNobel Prize laureates, in accordance with the principles of\nthe United Nations and with the aspiration of maintaining\nworld peace.\nCosta Rica is also pleased to say that Central America\nhas continued its progress in consolidating peace and\ndemocracy. Although we still suffer serious problems and\nstill face harsh social and economic realities, the bloody\ncrisis of the 1980s belongs to the past. The Central\nAmerican countries are firmly committed to consolidating\npeace and maintaining democracy. Honest and pluralistic\nelectoral processes have become the norm where before\nthey were the exception. National reconciliation is\nbecoming a reality. The recent, definitive progress in the\nGuatemalan peace process augurs well for the definitive\nattainment of peace in the entire Central American area. In\nthis regard, I am pleased to extend special congratulations\nto the Government of President Alvaro Arz\u00fa Irigoyen, to\nthe Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG),\nto the Group of Friends, particularly the Government of\nMexico and President Ernesto Zedillo, and to the Secretariat\nof the United Nations, for the progress recently achieved.\nThe existence of peace and democracy in Central\nAmerica, a region usually considered turbulent, proves that\nwill and perseverance can overcome any of the negative\nlegacies of history. We, the Central American peoples, hope\nthat other peoples will join in this experience, without\nhaving to pay so high a price. Nonetheless, precisely\nbecause all the countries in the region were affected, in one\nway or another, by this political and security crisis, all of\nus are now working determinedly to ensure that that chapter\nwill not be reopened.\nWe know, furthermore, that without development there\nwill be no lasting peace. With this conviction, the Central\nAmerican region has found a common goal in the\nendeavour to attain sustainable political, economic, social\ncultural and environmental development.\nTwo years ago, the Central American nations decided\nto unite in an Alliance for Sustainable Development. In\naddition to reconciling humankind with nature, this Alliance\naspires to establish in our countries a society that will allow\npresent generations to fully develop their capabilities in all\nareas and that will ensure future generations a prosperous\nfuture.\nOur Alliance is based on a common political project\nthat combines economic growth, environmental balance and\nindividual freedom. For the first time in its long history,\nCentral America has a common developmental goal, and\nthis in turn strengthens its dedication to regionalism.\nIn the same line of action, Central America has set\nout on a quest for innovative approaches to the rest of the\nworld that will help it realize its political, social,\neconomic, cultural and environmental goals. This joint\nfraternal action aimed at reincorporating Central America\ninto the international community has sought to\ninstitutionalize new links with other countries and regions\nthat have supported our efforts to attain peace and\ndemocracy in the isthmus, and that are now cooperating\nin our struggle for sustainable development. Central\nAmerica has thus established special mechanisms of\ndialogue and cooperation with Mexico, Chile, Canada, the\nUnited States of America, Japan, the Republic of Korea\nand the Republic of China on Taiwan. We have also\nredefined our relations with the European Union,\ninstitutionalized since the start of the last decade in what\nis known as the San Jos\u00e9 dialogue. We hope that in the\nnear future these activities will be extended to other\ncountries and regions.\nThe conviction that it is possible to consolidate\npeace only through development is not exclusive to\nCentral America. This year my country has had the\nhonour and the privilege to preside over the Group of 77\nand China in New York. This has allowed us to represent\nand defend on numerous occasions the points of view of\nthe countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the\nCaribbean.\nOne fifth of humanity continues to live in conditions\nof extreme poverty; discrimination on the basis of gender\ncontinues to be the order of the day; millions of children\ncontinue to lack access to education, health services and\nnutrition. My delegation views these facts with deep\nregret and attaches the utmost importance to the Agenda\nfor Development.\nIn this connection, I wish to reiterate the conviction\nexpressed recently on the occasion of the adoption of the\nreport of the Working Group on this matter \u2014 that that\nforum must remain open. A true United Nations system\nis inconceivable without an integrated and comprehensive\nplan of action for development. If the issues of\ndevelopment and international cooperation were to be\nreduced or diminished in this Organization, the very\nessence of the United Nations would be seriously\naffected.\n24\n\n\nIn that same spirit of solidarity that holds sway in our\nOrganization, we believe that the preservation and\nstrengthening of the United Nations Conference on Trade\nand Development (UNCTAD) and the United Nations\nInternational Development Organization (UNIDO) are\nessential. For small countries in particular, the linkage\nbetween commerce, technology transfer and development\nare, in and of themselves, outside the framework of the\nWorld Trade Organization. In order to emphasize this firm\nconviction, the President of Costa Rica travelled to South\nAfrica on the occasion of UNCTAD\u2019s 9th meeting. At that\nforum he expressed our country\u2019s support for the just and\nlegitimate aspirations to development of the countries of the\nthird world.\nInternational cooperation cannot be viewed solely in\nterms of the richest giving aid to the poorest. We strongly\nbelieve in the necessity and appropriateness of intensifying\nthe efforts aimed at increasing horizontal cooperation\nbetween developing countries. In January 1997, at the\nconclusion of its term as Chairman of the Group of 77 and\nChina, Costa Rica will convene \u2014 with the participation of\nthe private sector and non-governmental organizations \u2014 a\nSouth-South conference on trade, finance and investment.\nWe hope that new and constructive approaches to speed up\nthe rate of economic and financial cooperation among\ndeveloping countries will result from that conference.\nDirectly related to the subject of the Agenda for\nDevelopment is the need for an integrated follow-up to the\nagreements and programmes of action adopted at the\nsummits and conferences held by the United Nations in the\nlast decade. In them lies the real agenda of work for the\nUnited Nations in such essential fields as the environment,\npopulation, human rights, the rights of women and children,\nhabitat and social development. Accordingly, Costa Rica, in\nits capacity as Chairman of the Group of 77 and China,\npromoted and received unanimous support in the Economic\nand Social Council for a resolution designed to give\ncoherence and provide follow-up to the agreements and\nprogrammes of action of the international conferences and\nsummits of the United Nations.\nCosta Rica, as an agricultural country, attaches great\nimportance to the food summit planned to be held at Rome\nat the end of this year. As early as 1954, through the\ninitiative of then-President Jos\u00e9 Figueres Ferrer, Costa Rica\nproposed to this Organization the creation of a world food\nreserve that would enable us to confront the effects of\nnatural disasters and famines. Today we still believe that\ninternational solidarity is decisive in facing food challenges\nand that it constitutes a fundamental goal of contemporary\ninternational relations that should not be disregarded in\nthe search for economic liberalization.\nOf greatest importance, and closely related to these\nissues, is the need to pay attention to the problems of\ndesertification and water resources, which during the early\nyears of the next millennium will gravely affect food\nproduction and the very existence of the human species.\nAt the World Summit for Social Development, it\nwas reaffirmed that human rights are universal,\nindivisible, interdependent and interrelated. Among those\nrights is the global right to development, which, in Costa\nRica\u2019s opinion, right cannot be reduced to its mere\neconomic dimension. Development must also have a\nmoral and ethical dimension. We must accept the\nresponsibility of ensuring that the world that we are going\nto leave to future generations is going to be more\npeaceful, healthier, more humane and more democratic\nthan the one in which we have lived. This responsibility\nmust be shared individually and collectively, nationally\nand internationally by all elements of society.\nReflection on what we have done and what we have\nfailed to do over the last 12 months leads us to the\nquestion of what must be done in the immediate future.\nIn this connection, the revitalization and reform of the\nUnited Nations system is pivotal. In its analysis of this\nissue, the Government of Costa Rica has considered with\ndeep interest some of the proposals contained in the\nreport of the Commission on Global Governance. The\nreform of the United Nations must reflect the realities of\nchange, including the capacity of civil society to\ncontribute to global governance.\nMy delegation attaches fundamental importance to\nthe restructuring of the Security Council. We cannot\narrive at the year 2000 still using the calendar of 1945.\nThe Council cannot continue to be held in a framework\nthat has been fully overtaken by the reality of\ninternational politics. Costa Rica considers it a priority to\ntake up this task, both in order to grant permanent\nmembership to Germany and Japan and to a\nrepresentative of each of the three developing regions \u2014\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. In\naddition, we must reorganize the powers of the Council\nand of its members. If the political conditions for a\nreform of this kind do not exist, we must then consider\nother possibilities, such as the proposal made by the\nGovernment of Italy.\n25\n\n\nWe consider that there is a need to infuse the General\nAssembly with new vitality, as regards both the need to\nensure the principle of universality and the modernization\nof its agenda and procedures. We believe that no people on\nEarth should be denied the right to be represented in our\nOrganization.\nMy delegation is also of the view that greater\nimportance should be given to the work of the Council and\nthe Secretariat in the area of preventive diplomacy. The\nactions of these bodies at the outset of a conflict can be\ndecisive in achieving a solution, but they would be even\nmore so if their powers were increased so that they could\nanticipate such situations. Similarly, we believe that there\nis a need to restructure the Secretariat to give it greater\nflexibility and effectiveness in the execution of its tasks.\nAs a country that entrusts its security to international\nlaw, Costa Rica gives a place of honour to the International\nCourt of Justice. In our opinion, the acceptance of the\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court could become a duty\ninherent in membership of this Organization.\nFinally, the restructuring of the United Nations is also\ndirectly linked to its financial capabilities. The new United\nNations cannot be the property of the major Powers, nor\ncan it become the sole responsibility of a small group of\nStates. The United Nations of the future should belong to\nall, and this conception logically involves the duty of all its\nMembers to meet their commitments in accordance with the\nscale of assessments. In this respect, my delegation believes\nthat the full reform of the United Nations system, if it\nensures a more rational administration and more equitable\ndistribution of the resources and programmes of the\nOrganization, will put the Organization in a better position\nto insist that its Members States pay their assessments on\ntime.\nOur world is approaching the third millennium. In the\nmidst of so much darkness, so many challenges and so\nmany overwhelming difficulties, the human race retains a\nspirit that, together with the use of language, distinguishes\nit from any other species: hope. This spirit, now more than\never before, is embodied in this Organization. The United\nNations must remain united in its effort to make the present\nbetter and united in its goal to design a promising future.\nI should like to conclude by recalling a teaching of the\nProphet Mohammed which continues to resonate today as\na norm of conduct for all human beings and all nations on\nEarth:\n\u201cDo not break the ties of friendship, do not feel\nbitterness towards your fellow men, do not feel\nloathing for them, do not envy them. Live as\nbrothers, as God has ordered us to do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I first extend to Mr. Razali Ismail my\nwarmest and most sincere congratulations on his\n12\n\n\nunanimous election as President of this important session of\nthe General Assembly.\nI recently accompanied President Carlos Saul Menem\non a visit to his country, and I have the most pleasant\nmemories of his countrymen\u2019s hospitality, of the vitality of\nhis culture and of the extraordinary strength of his\ncountry\u2019s economy.\nTo Ambassador Freitas do Amaral, who presided over\nthe Assembly at the last session, we express our most\nsincere admiration. His term was a year full of difficulties\nand challenges, and he left us a positive vision of the\nquestions of the future.\nI have had the privilege of participating in the general\ndebate for the last six years. During that period, significant\nchanges have come about and profound contrasts have\narisen in the world. The scepticism of some\nnotwithstanding, allow me to recall some of the progress\nmade on the international scene: we have improved\nmechanisms for international peace and security; we have\nadvanced in the universal consolidation of democracy and\ntolerance; we have created institutions to prevent very\nserious crimes that offend the world\u2019s conscience from\ngoing unpunished, which clearly reflects the concept that\njustice and the law are inseparable components of a stable\npeace; we have successfully stepped up intense collective\nwork towards non-proliferation of nuclear and conventional\nweapons, including anti-personnel mines. The adoption of\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban-Treaty will\nundoubtedly contribute to greater progress, as will the entry\ninto force of the Convention on the Prohibition of the\nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical\nWeapons and on Their Destruction. We have also begun to\narticulate the concept of sustainable development to ensure\nprogress for current generations without compromising the\nviability of such progress for those of the future. We have\nopened new paths to free trade, eliminating barriers which,\nuntil yesterday, were regarded as normal instruments of\nnational policy.\nAll this has happened in recent years, and it is only\nfitting to recognize that the Secretary-General has\nanticipated, promoted and reflected all this in his annual\nreports, in his Agenda for Peace and in his Agenda for\nDevelopment, documents that are essential for the\ninterpretation of the process begun at the end of the cold\nwar.\nAllow me to take this opportunity to state how my\ncountry has dealt with all these transformations. Argentina\nhas actively promoted the new agenda. It has adapted\nitself domestically and internationally to fulfil the\nobjectives and principles of the Charter, both in its letter\nand its new spirit.\nArgentina has consolidated democracy and has taken\na very active role in the defence of fundamental rights\nand freedoms. It has given constitutional status to the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and to the main\nhuman rights treaties to which it is a party.\nArgentina has got its economy in order and opened\nup new possibilities and potential for its people by\npromoting good governance, fiscal discipline,\naccountability in the management of public funds,\nequality before the law for domestic and foreign investors\nand the fight against corruption.\nIn particular, Argentina has presented and promoted\nin the Organization of American States (OAS), as well as\nin this Assembly and other international organizations,\ninitiatives to combat the curse of corruption, which is an\nenemy to development, investment and charity in society.\nIn Argentina, sustainable development goes beyond\nacademic discussions. The growing deterioration of the\nozone layer in the southern hemisphere has affected the\ndaily life and health of the population of southern\nPatagonia. Argentina, in cooperation with other countries\nin the region and the United Nations system, has assumed\na leading role in reducing the risk level for the affected\npopulations by establishing five ozone-layer monitoring\nstations in our national territory, incorporating them into\nthe world multilateral environmental monitoring system.\nWe strongly hope that the international community will\njoin us in this effort by taking the necessary actions to\ncooperate in protecting the atmosphere.\nIn our subregion, the southern cone of the Americas,\nArgentina, together with its neighbours, has played a\nsignificant role in eradicating distrust, in resolving border\nproblems, in promoting physical and economic integration\nand in fostering political cooperation, all of which have\ngenerated an exemplary framework for cooperation and\nconvergence.\nOn the basis of political and economic stability, we\nhave designed ambitious mechanisms for integration, and\nwe have made the Southern Cone Common Market\n13\n\n\n(MERCOSUR) and the Rio Group important channels for\nour foreign policy.\nIn the agreements signed at the last MERCOSUR\npresidential summit, the States parties \u2014 Brazil, Paraguay,\nUruguay and Argentina \u2014 ratified their commitment to\ndemocratic institutions. As our country sees it, this should\nbe a prerequisite for full membership in MERCOSUR. The\nStates parties established a mechanism for consultation and\npolitical cooperation aimed at reviewing international\nactivities of special interest to them.\nAt that time, agreements were also signed between\nMERCOSUR and Chile and Bolivia, which will\nsignificantly broaden MERCOSUR and launch our\neconomies into an ever more globalized system. Clear\nevidence of this is the adoption of the interregional\nframework agreement between MERCOSUR and the\nEuropean Union, which has given rise to positive\nexpectations and created opportunities for strengthening\nlinks between the two regions in the economic, political and\ncultural fields.\nArgentina has promoted common activities on issues\nof growing importance, such as protection of the\nenvironment, preservation of natural resources and social\nand human development, within the framework of regional\nmechanisms for dialogue and political cooperation, as well\nas bilaterally, in regional forums and at the United Nations.\nArgentina participated in the adoption of concrete decisions\nto fight terrorism, drug trafficking and corruption, which\nare the new threats to international peace and security.\nArgentina\u2019s natural interest in the South Atlantic is\nreflected in our participation in the zone of peace and\ncooperation in the South Atlantic, which embraces countries\nfrom both sides of the ocean in constituting an area to\nwhich we attach special significance.\nMember States of the zone are committed to\nrespecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, promoting\ndemocracy, human rights and civil liberties, joining efforts\nfor nuclear non-proliferation and de-nuclearization, and to\ncooperating in the struggle against drug trafficking. We are\nvery pleased with our contribution to maintaining, together\nwith other coastal States, the political balance and economic\npotential of the South Atlantic.\nHowever, there is still an important unresolved issue:\nthe persistent sovereignty dispute over the Malvinas, South\nGeorgia and South Sandwich Islands and their surrounding\nmaritime spaces.\nDuring these last six years, I have come to this\nforum to voice the claims of the Government and people\nof Argentina in the sovereignty dispute over the Malvinas\nIslands.\nIt is incomprehensible that while Argentina and the\nUnited Kingdom have overcome the sorrow and have left\nbehind their mutual disagreements and distrust and built\nup a harmonious and constructive relationship \u2014 and we\nsee the positive results of this day by day \u2014 they have\nnot so far been able to comply with the resolutions of the\nGeneral Assembly and of the Decolonization Committee\nand to progress in the dialogue towards a definitive\nsolution to this dispute. We have not even been able to sit\ndown together around a table to talk, even if only to\nexpress our disagreement.\nIn the same spirit that encouraged our two countries\nto cooperate in the South Atlantic for the protection of its\nrenewable and non-renewable resources, we should\nadvance in our search for a peaceful solution to this\ndispute.\nIn spite of our efforts, the lack of direct links with\nthe Malvinas impedes human contacts, trade and tourism,\namong other possible exchanges, and has slowed down\nthe economic and cultural development of the South\nAtlantic. The lack of relations between the two areas is\ninconceivable in today\u2019s world.\nArgentina is proud of its great cultural diversity.\nSince the birth of our nation, our laws have preserved and\nguaranteed such cultural heritage. Our national\nConstitution establishes the objective of recovering the\nMalvinas Islands and the full exercise of sovereignty, and\nensures respect for its inhabitants\u2019 way of life. The only\nthing lacking is the will to start a new phase together.\nArgentina is firmly convinced that a new era should\nbegin in the South Atlantic, as an area free from\ntensions \u2014 a place where different cultures committed to\nhumanistic ideals and with a common wish for progress\nand well-being may come together.\nWhat in the past has been a negative factor in our\nrelations should become a positive factor and a starting\npoint for a new relationship.\nMy country has shown its vocation for constructive\nparticipation in the areas created by the international\nsystem, fostering tolerance and preserving peace. In that\nrespect, we avidly support all efforts to resolve situations\n14\n\n\nof serious instability and conflict still existing in various\nparts of the world.\nIn the Middle East, we welcome the progress made in\nthe peace process, especially regarding the question of\nPalestine. We add our voice to those calling for the parties\ninvolved to maximize their efforts to achieve a just, lasting\nand comprehensive peace. We renew our offer of full\ncooperation to contribute to the attainment of that objective.\nThe peace process, fostered by this General Assembly, has\nborne fruits that should not go to waste.\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations are one of the\nmost effective tools for preventing violence around the\nworld. This explains our full support for peace missions.\nWe have responded promptly and unconditionally to\nrequests of the Security Council, agreeing to participate in\noperations in our hemisphere and in various other parts of\nthe world by providing large amounts of financial\nresources.\nWe deem it vital to ensure an orderly transition\nbetween peace-keeping operations and the work of\nreconstruction aimed at reversing the economic, political\nand social damage caused by conflicts and to offer effective\nhumanitarian assistance so as to reduce the suffering of the\npopulations affected.\nWith the objective of complementing United Nations\nemergency humanitarian assistance, Argentina, inspired by\nPresident Carlos Saul Menem, proposed the \u201cWhite\nHelmets\u201d initiative. The effective deployment of the \u201cWhite\nHelmets\u201d in many humanitarian assistance operations is\nalready proving their political and technical viability.\nThe United Nations is called upon to play a significant\nrole in the international system of the twenty-first century.\nEverything indicates that this system will be marked by\ngrowing globalization and that problems such as poverty,\nunemployment, corruption and the lack of education can be\nmore effectively dealt with at a global level. For the United\nNations to respond effectively to this increasingly broad and\ncomplex mandate, it will be imperative for Member States\nto renew their political commitment to the organization\u2019s\npolitical future. At the same time, it will be necessary to\nstrengthen the United Nations through the in-depth\nstreamlining and reform process that has already begun.\nWith respect to the Security Council, we continue to\nfavour a mechanism that, without affecting its efficiency,\nreflects new realities, of which Argentina is an active part,\nand ensures the participation of those who have clearly\ndemonstrated their commitment to and respect for the\npurposes and principles of the Charter. It is equally\nimportant to ensure that the working methods of the\nCouncil guarantee transparency in the debates and in\ndecision-making processes. Only in this way will the\nOrganization become a special forum for nations to\nchannel their resources effectively and successfully face\nthe challenges of a globalized world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure to\ncongratulate Ambassador Razali on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\nsession. He is not present here, but I would like to say\nthat he is no stranger to India. We are fully cognizant of\nhis sagacity and skills and repose our confidence in his\nability to successfully guide the General Assembly during\nits fifty-first session. May I also express my delegation\u2019s\nwarm appreciation for the presidency of his predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for a most\nproductive tenure as President of the Assembly in its\nhistoric, landmark fiftieth year.\nSix years ago I had the privilege of addressing the\nhistoric forty-fifth session of this Assembly. We rejoiced\n12\n\n\nat the end of the cold war and believed that the animosities,\nrivalries, suspicions and intrigues that had bedeviled the\npast would now be overcome and the problems of the\nworld and their solutions could be addressed with greater,\nperhaps pristine, clarity. We have welcomed the reduction\nof global tensions and the opening up of new economic\npossibilities between nations.\nHowever, we cannot say that the new dawn has led to\na new and genuinely cooperative web of kinship and\ncollaboration. Regional conflicts and tensions continue to\noccupy us. Development problems remain acute, and there\nis less sensitivity to the genuine needs of struggling nations.\nThe voice of the rich and powerful nations rings louder\nthan ever, while the developing world feels itself more\nmarginalized and ignored than ever.\nIn these circumstances, it is even more necessary to\nstrive for a genuine spirit of joint international endeavour\nin addressing the world\u2019s problems. The United Nations is\nthe foremost embodiment of multilateralism. No single\nnation or even group of nations today can expect to find\nsolutions to the world\u2019s problems, nor are many problems\namenable to solutions in isolation. Global problems require\nglobal institutions and global solutions. This role and duty\ncan fall only to the United Nations.\nWe are concerned at unilateral actions and at the\nevident decline in the commitment to obligations under the\nCharter of the United Nations. International cooperation is\nnecessary to meet the vast development needs of the\ndeveloping countries, to eliminate weapons of mass\ndestruction and to fight terrorism and crime. The United\nNations system, under which sovereign nations have joined\ntogether to achieve their common objectives, is the\nuniversal framework for international cooperation. The\nCharter of the United Nations is the real basis for renewing\nmultilateralism. India recently joined 15 other Heads of\nState or Government in stating that\n\u201ceither nations move forward to strengthen\n(multilateralism), or we risk having to face more\nunilateralism and perhaps conflict and overt disregard\nof international law and common values\u201d.\nThe United Nations is at a crossroads. Its financial\ncrisis is the result of an unwarranted unwillingness on the\npart of certain countries to pay their dues in full and on\ntime. Such deliberate targeting of the United Nations\nrepresents the most acute threat to multilateral cooperation\nand can do incalculable long-term damage.\nBeyond the financial crisis of the United Nations\nitself is the critical issue of financing global cooperation.\nWhile the world remains confronted with enormous\nproblems of poverty, malnutrition, disease, ecological\ndegradation and waste, the will to contribute is on the\ndecline. Development assistance is at its lowest level in\ndecades. Negotiated replenishments of multilateral\ndevelopment funds are not being honoured.\nIt is unfortunate that voices continue to be raised\nquestioning the role of the United Nations in the\neconomic growth and social development of developing\ncountries. It is necessary to restore to the United Nations,\nin the coming century, the important role of eradicating\npoverty and all the ills associated with it, of promoting\ndevelopment and achieving social progress and better\nliving standards, with more freedom for all.\nFor this purpose, the multilateral economic system\nneeds to be reformed and the partnership of the United\nNations with other relevant institutions must to be\nstrengthened in order to achieve greater economic growth,\nintegration and sustainable development. The United\nNations and the Bretton Woods institutions need to\ndevelop an effective partnership. While India welcomes\nthe initial, tentative steps towards such a partnership,\neffective economic leadership requires that we work to\nensure a much closer relationship between global\neconomic institutions than has been the case so far.\nIndeed, there is no alternative if the financing of long-\nterm global cooperation in economic and social fields is\nto be assured. We need larger volumes of financial\nassistance, greater predictability of resources and\nunfettered access to the markets of developed countries.\nIt is also time that we energize our efforts to complete the\nAgenda for Development and launch an effective follow-\nup process, including in the context of the recent major\nUnited Nations conferences.\nIndia is unreservedly committed to the protection\nand promotion of human rights. The profoundly\nhumanistic traditions of Indian civilization, with its\nemphasis on tolerance, harmony, non-violence and the\ninviolability of the individual, have been consolidated in\nthe Constitution of India, which is indeed a veritable bill\nof human rights. All human rights are sacrosanct in India,\nguaranteed by its Constitution, an independent judiciary,\na free press, public opinion vigorously expressed and an\nindependent National Human Rights Commission. To us\nin India, the human rights of all segments of society are\nsacrosanct and an article of faith rather than a policy.\n13\n\n\nWe believe that international cooperation in the\nprotection and promotion of human rights should proceed\nwithin the framework of respect for the sovereignty and\nintegrity of States. We deplore the selective use of human\nrights issues as a form of political pressure, as an obstacle\nto trade or as a condition for development assistance. Such\nactions detract from the moral imperatives of human rights\npromotion and impede the full realization of the human\nrights of all people.\nHuman rights violations take many forms. Among the\nmost pernicious of them is terrorism. Terrorism seeks to\nexploit the openness and freedom offered by democratic\nsocieties to pursue narrow ends through the use of violence.\nIt must be combated by firm action at the national and\ninternational level. We are dismayed when we hear certain\nparties voice concern for the so-called rights of terrorists\nwhile ignoring their persistent violation of the human rights\nof their victims, including the right to life, freedom of\nexpression and the freedom to follow religious beliefs of\none\u2019s own choice.\nIndia took the lead in raising the issue of terrorism as\na threat to human rights almost five years ago. We are\npleased that despite initial and sometimes vocal opposition\nby some western countries, terrorism is now accepted to be\nthe major threat to the enjoyment of human rights today. A\nnumber of international declarations have been issued on\nterrorism such as the Sharm el-Sheikh Declaration, and the\nG-7 Lyons Declaration of 27 June 1996. We are\nencouraged that the international community now\nrecognizes terrorism as a major challenge to democracy,\nhuman rights and peace. In this context, India will pursue\nits call to adopt a binding international convention to\ncombat terrorism.\nFifty years after the United Nations was established,\nthe threat to humanity posed by nuclear weapons continues\nunabated. We believe that India\u2019s security, as indeed that of\nall countries, lies in a nuclear-weapon-free world.\nThe only way to achieve this ultimate security is to\nban the production, possession and use of nuclear weapons\nwithin an agreed time-frame. Partial and half-hearted arms\ncontrol measures, such as the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) or the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), defeat\nthis objective by legitimizing the possession of nuclear\nweapons and permitting the non-explosive testing of nuclear\nweapons by nuclear-weapon countries. India, therefore,\ncannot be a party to such flawed arrangements.\nLet me also emphasize that any effective\ndisarmament regime needs to be universal in its approach\nand scope. The total elimination of all existing nuclear\nweapons, as an indispensable step towards general and\ncomplete disarmament under strict and efficient\ninternational control, is the demand of the entire Non-\nAligned Movement, to which we fully subscribe. Partial\nor regional approaches, as are sometimes put forward, do\nnot serve any useful purpose and can distract us from the\naccepted goal.\nAt the same time, India remains committed to\nparticipating fully and actively in any negotiations on a\ntreaty banning nuclear weapons and all types of tests, just\nas it did in regard to the Chemical Weapons Convention.\nIndia signed and deposited its instrument of\nratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the\nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction two weeks\nago. India regrets that major chemical weapon producers\nhave been slow to ratify the Convention. We urge all\nthose countries which have still not done so to ratify the\nChemical Weapons Convention and to demonstrate their\nreadiness to move towards banning all weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nIndia will work with all like-minded countries in\nsponsoring draft resolutions on the establishment of an ad\nhoc committee under the Conference on Disarmament for\nbeginning negotiations on a treaty banning nuclear\nweapons in a time-bound framework. India expects all\ncountries, including those represented in the Canberra\nCommission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons,\nwhich support time-bound elimination of nuclear\nweapons, to join in supporting such draft resolutions.\nIndia will once again present the draft convention on\nthe prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons at this\nsession of the General Assembly. India believes that the\nurgency of negotiating that convention has been greatly\nenhanced by the advisory opinion of the International\nCourt of Justice regarding the illegality of the use of\nnuclear weapons.\nAt the recent session of the Conference on\nDisarmament, India joined 27 non-aligned and neutral\ncountries to present a phased programme for the\nelimination of nuclear weapons by the year 2020. India\nasks that all countries join us in propagating and\npromoting this joint proposal, both at the fifty-first\nsession of the General Assembly and in other forums.\n14\n\n\nIndia is in favour of a non-discriminatory and\nuniversal ban on anti-personnel mines, which cripple or kill\na large number of civilians.\nThe continued credibility of the United Nations\nrequires reform of the Organization to reflect present-day\nrealities. While the membership of the United Nations has\nincreased greatly, the voices of the newly sovereign\ncountries in decision-making in the United Nations remain\nunheard. There is an imbalance in the authority and weight\nof structures and organs, just as there is an imbalance in the\nweight of different countries or groups. The General\nAssembly, the sole universal organ of the United Nations,\nneeds to find greater resonance in other bodies of the\nsystem.\nThe Security Council must be made more\nrepresentative in order to enhance its legitimacy and\neffectiveness. The vast increase in the membership of the\nUnited Nations since its founding, especially of the\ndeveloping countries, must find adequate representation in\nthe categories of permanent and non-permanent\nmembership. A comprehensive proposal by the Non-\nAligned Movement for the reform and restructuring of the\nSecurity Council is already on the table. India supports the\nexpansion of both the permanent and the non-permanent\ncategories. We are against piecemeal or temporary solutions\nwhich discriminate against developing countries. We\nbelieve that the same yardstick must be applied to all\ncountries, developed or developing, from all regions or\ngroups, for induction as permanent members. We believe\nthat under any objectively derived criteria for the expansion\nof permanent members, India would be an obvious\ncandidate.\nReform and expansion must be an integral part of a\ncommon package. The restructuring of the Security Council\nmust give expression to the impulse for reform. The\nreforms must address not only the failings of the past, but\nalso the needs of the future.\nPeacekeeping is a significant area of United Nations\nactivities, very often the most visible symbol of the\nOrganization\u2019s presence on the ground. India has\nparticipated in over 25 peacekeeping operations on four\ncontinents, including some of the most sensitive and\nprolonged, starting with Korea in 1953 and 1954, and\nincluding the operations in Viet Nam, Congo, the Middle\nEast, Cambodia, Haiti, Somalia, El Salvador, Mozambique\nand Rwanda. Indian peacekeepers are currently in the field\nin Angola, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Liberia and Kuwait.\nOur participation has not been without cost. We have lost\n100 peacekeepers for the United Nations cause. We have\nalso offered a fully-equipped brigade to the United\nNations standby arrangement. The performance of the\nIndian troops has won universal recognition. India is one\nof the few countries which can sustain large-scale troop\ncommitment over prolonged periods.\nOur participation in United Nations peacekeeping\ndoes not stem from considerations of narrow gain. We\nhave participated because we have been wanted and\nbecause we have been asked, but most of all because of\nour solidarity and empathy with the affected countries and\nwith the international community, as well as because of\nour commitment to the United Nations and to the cause\nof international peace and security.\nIndia has offered its candidature for the non-\npermanent seat on the Security Council from Asia for\n1997 and 1998. Our candidature is rooted in the criteria\nstipulated in the Charter: the principle of equity, our\nunwavering commitment to the United Nations, and to the\ncause of multilateralism, and our 50-year-long\ncontribution to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity and to the other purposes and principles of the\nOrganization. India has a unique record of supporting\nUnited Nations activities against apartheid and\ncolonialism. We have richly contributed to the debates on\ndevelopment, disarmament and human rights. We seek the\nonerous responsibility of Council membership convinced\nof the support of this Assembly.\nI would like to take this opportunity to pay a warm\ntribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, for his successful stewardship during a most\ndifficult period. His services are a distinct asset to this\nworld body.\nLet me briefly refer to India\u2019s interaction with the\nworld. We have witnessed some remarkable changes in\nthe last few years. New vistas for greater cooperation are\nnow visible. The challenge lies in effectively seizing the\nopportunities. We attach the highest importance to\ndeveloping cordial and friendly relations with our\nneighbours with a view to promoting peace, stability and\nmutual confidence in the region. We also seek to develop\nstronger economic and commercial relations within the\nregion, for all-around prosperity. As current Chairman of\nthe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation\n(SAARC), it will be our endeavour to promote\nmultifaceted cooperation in all spheres.\n15\n\n\nThe economic reforms embarked upon since 1991\nhave provided India with a new outward orientation that\nseeks greater integration of India into the global\nmarketplace. Today, India is branching out and adding to\nthe substantive content of its relations with individual\ncountries of the region and beyond, developing and building\nupon regional cooperation arrangements involving SAARC,\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the\nASEAN Regional Forum, the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation Council (APEC) and the Indian Ocean Rim, to\nname a few.\nConvinced of the need and utility of enhanced South-\nSouth cooperation, we accord the highest priority to our\nrelations with Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. We\nare proud to have been associated with Africa and its\ncauses in the United Nations since the inception of the\nworld body. We appreciate the role played by the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), which has striven to\nfind regional solutions to African problems. Its efforts must\nbe supplemented by the United Nations. The scramble for\nAfrica in the nineteenth century was for African land and\nresources. We hope that the closing years of the present\ncentury will see a scramble to redress African problems, the\ngenesis of which largely lies outside the region. The United\nNations must lead international efforts to meet Africa\u2019s\nneeds and aspirations.\nWe are deeply concerned at the recent serious\nincidents of violence in the West Bank and Gaza and by\nIsraeli authorities\u2019 opening of a tunnel beneath Haram\nAl-Sharif \u2014 the Temple Mount \u2014 in East Jerusalem,\nwhich resulted in the tragic loss of several innocent lives\nand large-scale injuries following violent clashes. The\ncurrent situation underlines the need for immediate and\neffective measures to end the violence and to create a\nclimate that would enable purposeful negotiations based on\na recognition of the underlying causes of the conflict. These\ndevelopments also serve to emphasize the need to build\nfurther on the agreements and understandings already\nreached.\nIn the wave of the recent political changes in the\nMiddle East, India is encouraged by the reiteration by all\nparties of their continued commitment to the Middle East\npeace process based on the framework established by the\nMadrid Conference. However, we are concerned that these\nreaffirmations do not appear to have manifested themselves\nin commensurate progress in the peace process. India urges\nall parties to intensify their efforts towards realizing the\nmutually agreed objectives of the Middle East peace\nprocess, keeping in view that achieving durable peace and\nstability in the Middle East requires solving the\nPalestinian issue.\nIndia has ties dating back to early history with\nAfghanistan, a country with which we also share bonds of\nkinship, culture and religion. We are deeply saddened by\nthe continued violence and loss of life in that country.\nIndia stands for the unity, independence and territorial\nintegrity of Afghanistan. We urge all Afghan parties to\nresolve their differences through early peaceful dialogue\nand negotiations. We support the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral and his special representative to bring about a\nsolution in Afghanistan.\nThe Non-Aligned Movement figures firmly in\nIndia\u2019s world view and constitutes an important plank in\nour foreign policy. We remain firmly committed to the\nphilosophy and values of the Non-Aligned Movement. For\nus, non-alignment means independence of thought and\nautonomy of choice. It also means working in cooperation\nwith the largest number of countries. Last year\u2019s non-\naligned summit in Colombia reinforced our faith in the\nability and resilience of the Movement, its responsiveness\nto change and its effectiveness in today\u2019s global situation.\nIndia will be privileged to host the next ministerial\nconference of the non-aligned countries in New Delhi in\n1997.\nIndia is a progressive country charting a balanced\ncourse between economic growth and social justice, and\nscience and tradition. It is committed to the values of\npeace, non-violence, coexistence, pluralism, tolerance and\nconstructive cooperation. Culturally, India is a bridge\nbetween traditional cultures and emergent trends.\nPolitically, India will remain anchored in a pluralistic,\nliberal democracy that can provide space for all its\nconstituents and internal interlocutors.\nBefore I conclude, I am reminded of an ancient Rig\nVedic hymn which reads:\n\u201cO citizens of the world!\nLive in harmony and concord\nBe organized and cooperative\nSpeak with one voice\nAnd make your resolutions with one Mind.\u201d\nMay this invocation to harmony, cooperation,\nconsensus and solidarity continue to guide our\ndeliberations and actions.\n16\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe world of today is faced\nwith a paradox. While our global interdependence is\ngrowing and threats to our societies require globally\ncoordinated efforts, countries look inwards to their own\nregions. But regional cooperation should never be made\na pretext for ignoring the outside world. It should open\nitself to the world. It should be a building block for truly\nglobal solidarity.\nWe need a vision of a global neighbourhood, a\nglobal ethic and a global citizenship based on equality,\n11\n\n\ntolerance and solidarity. The globalization of our societies\nis irreversible. We need to cooperate to deal with its\nconsequences.\nWe have the instrument: the United Nations. At 50,\nthe United Nations is the subject of criticism and lack of\nconfidence. The experience of political setbacks in Somalia,\nRwanda and the former Yugoslavia is not quickly forgotten.\nAs in Bosnia, alternatives to the United Nations are sought\nto deal with pressing international issues.\nBut the tasks of the United Nations have not been\nmade easier by Member States\u2019 refusing to give it adequate\nresources. Many Members, including some major Powers,\nstill do not pay their contributions to the United Nations\nfully or on time. It is a shame that the Secretary-General\nhas to devote much of his time to pleading with Member\nStates to fulfil their financial obligations.\nOf course, the United Nations has its shortcomings. It\nsuffers from bureaucracy and resistance to change. There\nare inefficiencies, but there are also success stories. We\nmust not forget how United Nations operations helped build\npeaceful societies in Cambodia, El Salvador and\nMozambique, nor how United Nations humanitarian actions\nhave saved lives and alleviated suffering in Somalia,\nRwanda, Burundi, the former Yugoslavia and other crisis\nareas.\nFor security in a broad sense, we need a global\nOrganization. We need the United Nations as a meeting\nplace. We need the United Nations as a guardian of\ninternational norms and principles. We need the United\nNations to prevent conflicts and to find peaceful solutions\nwhen violence erupts. We need the United Nations to cope\nwith global threats to human security. We need the United\nNations as a safeguard against environmental threats and in\nfavour of sustainable development. We need the United\nNations to promote democracy and human rights. We need\nthe United Nations as a focal point for global solidarity.\nTo realize this vision, we need a strong United\nNations. Present inefficiencies have to be dealt with\nvigorously. Reform does not automatically equal down-\nsizing. In some fields, we may even have to expand the\nOrganization. But resources should not be wasted.\nConfidence in the Organization demands financial\ndiscipline. A revitalized United Nations means a more\nfocused and more determined United Nations.\nWe need a United Nations that does not abandon its\nposition as the principal instrument for maintaining\ninternational peace and security, a United Nations which\nis capable of acting rapidly with adequate means and\nresources. Today, I join with 15 other Heads of State and\nGovernment in a statement in support of renewing\nmultilateralism. Without political leadership, the necessary\nchanges cannot be made.\nMy Government, the Swedish Government, sees the\nfollowing steps as immediately required. First, United\nNations Members must make a commitment to global\nmultilateral cooperation. Secondly, payment must be made\nof assessed contributions to the United Nations in full,\nunconditionally and on time. Thirdly, there must be a\ncommitment to strengthen and renew the United Nations,\nincluding a time-frame for comprehensive reform.\nFourthly, a commitment to the United Nations as an\ninstrument for sustainable economic and social\ndevelopment is necessary. Fifthly, we must adopt an\nintegrated approach to security in view of long-term\nthreats to our societies. Sixthly, there must be a\ncommitment to early action to prevent conflict and man-\nmade disasters. Finally, there is need for an agreement to\ndevelop the capacity of regional organizations to act in\ncooperation with the United Nations.\nThe Swedish Government is committed to a strong\nand effective United Nations and we are ready to\ncontribute to this objective. Therefore, Sweden seeks a\nseat on the Security Council for the 1997-1998 period.\nOur candidature has been launched with the full support\nof the other Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland\nand Norway.\nMembers of the Security Council have a particular\nresponsibility for international peace and security. It is\nessential that small and medium-size countries serve on\nthe Council as well. The principle of rotation of non-\npermanent seats is important to us, for we have not\nserved on the Council for the past 20 years.\nIf elected to the Council, Sweden would continue to\npursue openness and transparency. The links between the\nCouncil and the United Nations membership at large must\nbe strengthened.\nSweden would take independent positions, upholding\nthe principles of international law. The primacy of\ninternational and humanitarian law is a pillar of our\nforeign policy. Sweden would contribute to a more\nefficient United Nations role in the new generation of\npeace-keeping, including better coordination between the\ncivilian and military aspects of such operations. We\n12\n\n\nwould also work for clearer mandates for United Nations\noperations.\nThe capacity of the United Nations to command and\ncontrol large-scale peace-keeping and humanitarian\noperations should be secured. We need an Organization\ncapable of coordinating the various aspects of peace\noperations, including political peacemaking, military peace-\nkeeping, long-term peace-building and humanitarian efforts.\nIn our national planning for participation in future\npeace operations, my Government is taking steps to\nintegrate the training of military and civilian personnel in\norder to facilitate coordination in the field. We invite other\ncountries to such training in Sweden.\nSweden believes that the sanctions instrument has to\nbe refined. It is an important instrument for helping to\npreclude the use of armed force. But ways must be found\nto avoid the suffering of innocent civilians and to alleviate\nthe consequences of sanctions for third parties. This is\nessential for the credibility and efficiency of the sanctions\ninstrument.\nThe United Nations represents the moral authority of\nthe world community. It has a vital role in seeing to it that\nwar crimes do not go unpunished. The Tribunals for the\nformer Yugoslavia and Rwanda should be given the\nnecessary support. The message must be clear. Civilians\nmust be protected in all armed conflicts, whether internal or\ninternational. It should never be possible to live out\ncriminal perversions, to murder, torture or rape with\nimpunity. A permanent international criminal court should\nbe established in the year to come.\nThe financial crisis and the non-payment of assessed\ncontributions to the United Nations must not be used as an\ninstrument to precipitate reforms, nor should they be an\nexcuse not to start urgent reforms. The possibility of using\nalternative sources of financing needs to be explored\nfurther. They could be used on a voluntary basis and serve\nto finance special needs outside the regular United Nations\nbudget.\nThe financing of global development cooperation is a\ncritical issue that goes beyond the present financial crisis of\nthe United Nations. The willingness to pay is decreasing.\nDevelopment assistance is at its lowest level in decades.\nOnly four countries \u2014 Sweden among them \u2014 fulfil the\nUnited Nations 0.7 per cent aid target. In our own case, we\nmaintain this commitment despite a very difficult financial\nsituation.\nNegotiated replenishment of multilateral\ndevelopment funds is not being honoured. The financing\nof global cooperation is a long-term issue that requires a\nlong-term solution.\nThe globalization of our economies, our politics and\nour daily lives calls for cooperation. This has been clearly\nillustrated in the report of the Commission on Global\nGovernance. Industrialized and developing countries will\nrealize that we have common interests, not least in\nmeeting the threats to our common future, the\nenvironment. Further efforts must also be made to resolve\nthe debt crisis for the poorest and most heavily indebted\ncountries.\nWe have a joint interest in open borders and free\ntrade, which create growth and wealth. A difficult\nobstacle to such a development is the worldwide increase\nin organized crime. In my own region around the Baltic\nSea, the Heads of Government have decided to elaborate\na common plan of action to combat cross-border crime.\nI believe that this session of the General Assembly\nshould send a strong political signal that intensified global\nefforts are also needed in this area. What is needed is\nincreased exchange of information, judicial cooperation\nand closer cooperation in training, inter alia, through\nInterpol.\nAnother global threat is the proliferation of arms,\nboth conventional arms and those designed for mass\ndestruction. For decades, Sweden has been in the\nforefront in the struggle against nuclear arms. The entry\ninto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nis essential. It would be a historic step towards the\nelimination of nuclear arms. I welcome the report of the\nCanberra Commission. It is a timely and valuable\ncontribution to this endeavour.\nAnti-personnel landmines are a threat to\ndevelopment, to reconstruction and to human dignity in\nmany parts of the world. Mines do not discriminate\nbetween an invading soldier and a child at play. They\ntotally ignore cease-fires and political settlements.\nIt is imperative that we move towards a global ban\non these killers. Stockpiles should be destroyed. Sweden,\nfor its part, will take such a unilateral step. All countries\nmust adhere to the stricter legal regime that has been\nagreed for landmines, and much larger resources should\nbe directed to humanitarian mine clearance. My\n13\n\n\nGovernment is prepared to make its substantial contribution\nto this end.\nMultilateral cooperation is indispensable for dealing\nwith the crucial issues of survival facing us on the\nthreshold of the next millennium. We have a common\nresponsibility to give to the next generation the tools for\nsuch cooperation. True security is global.\nSweden contributes actively to cooperation and\nsecurity in our Baltic neighbourhood and in Europe. Our\nfirm support for peace and development in the Middle East,\nin southern Africa, in Asia and in Central America is well\nknown. True to our traditions and our vision, we continue\nto stand up for cooperation and security in our global\nneighbourhood.\n\n\n\n"

I take this\nopportunity to extend my best wishes to him and to the\nother members of the Bureau for success in directing the\nmeetings of this session and in all endeavours to strengthen\nour Organization and promote peace in our world. I also\ncongratulate Mr. Razali\u2019s friendly country, Malaysia.\nI also take this opportunity to express my thanks and\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Freitas do Amaral, and\nthe former members of the Bureau for their effective\nstewardship of the fiftieth session.\nI also wish to express our gratitude to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the dedicated\nefforts he has sincerely and honestly made to advance the\nOrganization and to promote its humanitarian mission of\nsettling disputes between States by peaceful means. In\nconformity with the decision of the League of Arab States,\nJordan supports the extension of the Secretary-General\u2019s\nmandate for another term, in order to enable him to\npursue his mission and efforts in the service of\ninternational peace and security and the reforms he has\ninitiated in the organs and Secretariat of the Organization.\nThe role of the United Nations and its specialized\nagencies in the protection of international peace and\nsecurity and in enhancing and directing the world\neconomy towards liberalization and integration are among\nthe main reasons for my country\u2019s devotion to the\nOrganization and adherence to its Charter. In view of this,\nand out of our sense of responsibility and concern for the\nefficiency and relevance of the Organization, we appeal\nto all Member States to continue to support it, to fulfil\ntheir obligations to it consistently and to work to resolve\nits financial crisis.\nI assert my country\u2019s firm position on the need to\nimplement the necessary administrative reforms and\nrestructure the Security Council. The structure of the\nCouncil no longer reflects the current balance of power.\nAny expansion of the permanent membership of the\nCouncil should take into account the increase in the\nnumber of developing countries and the growing\neconomic power of certain industrial nations, such as\nGermany and Japan. We have seen many plans and\nproposals on this matter which the Security Council\nshould carefully consider, such as the Italian plan. A\nreview of the veto power enjoyed by the permanent\nmembers should reflect the democracy and transparency\nwe seek.\nIn this context, I must emphasize the need to review\nthe question of economic sanctions, which neither\ndistinguish between a political entity and its innocent\nunarmed civilian population, nor provide compensation to\nthird States adversely affected by such sanctions. We\nmust work together to create a durable formula. We also\ncall for opening the membership of the United Nations to\nall peace-loving States, as stipulated in Article 4.1 of the\nCharter.\nThis international Organization has made worthy\npeacekeeping efforts in many countries. It has made\nhuman sacrifices that would be unfair and unwise to\nignore. Jordan is very proud to have been among the first\ncountries participating in the peacekeeping forces in the\nformer Yugoslavia and elsewhere. In this regard, my\ncountry\u2019s effective participation in the Implementation\nForce\u2019s peacekeeping and peacemaking operation in\nBosnia is noteworthy.\n8\n\n\nIn this regard, the fraternal people of Bosnia must be\ncongratulated on the Dayton Agreement and on the\nelections it has held. A special tribute should be paid to\nPresident Alija Izetbegovic\u00b4 for winning the presidential\nelection. We are ready, along with other peace-loving\ncountries, to help the people of Bosnia make the new\ndemocratic experiment a success, consolidate and rebuild\nthe federal State and promote its reconstruction,\ndevelopment, sovereignty and stability.\nBefore I move on to another international issue, I\nwould like to congratulate the United Nations on opening\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty for signature.\nMy country is proud to have been among the first countries\nto sponsor the draft resolution under which this Treaty was\nadopted and to have signed it. We hope that steps towards\nnuclear disarmament will continue and will encompass the\nMiddle East region. We hope that negotiations will begin\nfor the conclusion of a treaty in the very near future\nbanning the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\nnuclear and otherwise, so that a nuclear-weapon-free zone\nmay be established in the Middle East.\nThe peoples of our region have suffered the agonies of\ndevastating wars over the past five decades, wars which\nhave caused the deaths of tens of thousands, destroyed\nbasic infrastructures and brought the people of our countries\nbloodshed, pain, deprivation, poverty and instability. Due to\nthe allocation of resources to the war machine and the\nterrible arms race, their economies have gone into\nrecession.\nSigns of hope, however, emerged for these people five\nyears ago with the Madrid Peace Conference in October\n1991 and the subsequent bilateral and multilateral\nnegotiations between Arabs and Israelis. Palestinian hopes\nwere revived with the 1993 Oslo agreement. The\nDeclaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government\nArrangements that followed restored happiness and hope to\nmillions of Palestinians, who saw in that agreement the\nbeginning of the end of their pain, bloodshed and destroyed\neconomy. They were newly optimistic about securing their\nright to self-determination within their own State, rebuilding\ntheir national economy, industry and infrastructure, which\nhad been destroyed by wars, and the onset of peaceful trade\nrelations with their neighbours in Jordan, Israel and other\ncountries of the region. Hope was also rekindled by the\npeace treaty concluded between Jordan and Israel in\nOctober 1994 and the resulting bilateral agreements on the\nestablishment of diplomatic and economic relations,\nbilateral and regional cooperation, the reconstruction of the\nregion and the establishment of strong trade and economic\nrelations between the two countries, to the benefit of their\npeoples and other peoples in the region, opening the way\nto comprehensive regional cooperation.\nConcrete progress was also made on the Syrian-\nIsraeli and Lebanese-Israeli peace tracks. There were\nprospects for a Syrian-Israeli agreement based on the\n\u201cland-for-peace\u201d principle, providing for full Israeli\nwithdrawal from the Golan in return for a peace\nagreement ending the state of war and paving the way for\npeaceful relations based on strong foundations of\nunderstanding and normal, peaceful coexistence.\nCurrent events and negative factors and measures in\nthe occupied Arab territories \u2014 a return to the settlement-\nbuilding policy; the violation of the sanctity of the holy\nplaces; the closure of the territories; the denial of work\nopportunities; the refusal to implement the agreements\nsigned on the Palestinian-Israeli track; the postponement\nand impediment of self-government negotiations; the\nunilateral determination of the status of Jerusalem and of\nthe self-government negotiations; the refusal to resume\nnegotiations, suspended seven months ago, with Syria and\nLebanon; and the refusal to return to the terms of\nreference and framework of the Madrid Peace\nConference \u2014 have given rise to frustration among the\npeoples of the region, who are beginning to lose the\nrekindled hope to which I have referred.\nDespite the excessively negative slogans against\npeace used by the new Israeli Government during the\nelectoral campaign, we in Jordan \u2014 the King, the\nleadership and the people \u2014 welcomed the new\nAdministration and the newly-elected Prime Minister out\nof respect for the free will of the Israeli people and non-\ninterference in their internal affairs. We called for the\ncontinuation of the comprehensive peace process in the\nregion and pledged to utilize the peace treaty with Israel\nto establish such a comprehensive peace. We urged our\nneighbours, Syria and Lebanon, to deal with the new\nrealities and the new Israeli Government positively and\nrealistically. Our motto and position at the Arab Summit\nConference held at Cairo last June was a call to extend\nmore time and opportunity to the new Israeli Government\nto return to the peace process on the bases agreed upon at\nthe Madrid Peace Conference: the \u201cland-for-peace\u201d\nformula and the implementation of Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\nAll the participants in the Madrid Peace Conference\nhad believed that the success achieved on the Palestinian-\nIsraeli track and the Jordanian-Israeli track had opened to\n9\n\n\nthe peoples of the region, including the Israeli people, the\ndoor to a new life and a better future based on the\nprinciples of justice, peace for all, peaceful relations and\ntrade. They had also believed that this success proved once\nagain how misguided and wrong are obsolete principles\nsuch as that of achieving security through force and thus\nthrough the imposition of forced solutions. It also debunked\nthe principle of occupying other people\u2019s land by force to\nensure one\u2019s own security. Indeed, it has become clear that\nsecurity can be ensured only through dialogue, peaceful\ncoexistence, negotiations, mutual respect among peoples\nand free economic and trade relations, rather than through\npower politics and the imposition of forced solutions. Yet\nonce again we are hearing certain nervous calls to revive\nthe obsolete theory of security and the imposition of\nsolutions by force.\nAmid the gloom that has begun to enshroud the peace\nprocess, there is still a ray of hope. It is up to us, both\nArabs and Israelis, to keep it shining with a view to\nsecuring a better future for our children and our\ngrandchildren. For if, God forbid, we allowed this hope to\nbecome lost, a renewed cycle of violence, instability,\ntension, terrorism and extremism would prevail in the\nregion, as shown by the recent bloody violence.\nAt the Cairo summit, all Arab Governments expressed\nfor the first time their collective support and blessings for\nthe peace process and proclaimed that peace is an\nirreversible strategic option. We have heard similar pledges\nfrom the new Israeli Government. It is our sincere hope that\nthe United States and Russian co-sponsors of the peace\nprocess will intervene, and that international efforts will be\nmade to put the peace process back on track, restore its\nprevious vigour and impetus and put an end to all the\nobstacles that might impede or disrupt it.\nThe war and destruction in the region and the peace\nprocess that followed it have been described as a series of\nmissed opportunities; for in the past all of us have missed\ninvaluable opportunities for peace. Now here we are again,\nabout to return to that insane policy. By challenging the\nopponents of peace, President Arafat and the Palestinian\nleadership have demonstrated a serious and unambiguous\ndesire to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting peace.\nIt is not wise to reward him by embarrassing him before\nthe Palestinian people and placing him in an unenviable\nsituation vis-\u00e0-vis the opponents of peace, who are betting\non the failure of his policies and the failure of the peace\nprocess.\nNor is it prudent to stipulate that Syria and Lebanon\nmust return to the negotiating table without preconditions,\nas though the Madrid Conference and the painstaking and\ntough negotiations that followed had never taken place.\nDoes this condition itself not constitute a precondition for\nthe peace process? We all declared our intention to\nnurture the magnificent baby born at the Madrid\nConference, whom we named \u201cthe peace process\u201d. But\nthen, we disagreed on the method to be followed in the\nbaby\u2019s upbringing. Let us return to working together, so\nas not to kill the baby in its cradle and along with it our\npeoples\u2019 chances for the better life which shone on the\nhorizon after decades of death and destruction.\nOne of the most important factors for the credibility\nof the Middle East peace process is the improvement in\nthe living conditions of the population through increased\ninvestment which has resulted in lowering the high\nunemployment rate. We in Jordan have taken numerous\nmeasures, enacted legislation and concluded agreements\nwith a view to protecting and promoting investment. I\nregret that despite these reassuring measures and\nguarantees and the convening of two international\neconomic summit conferences \u2014 in Casablanca in 1994\nand in Amman in 1995 \u2014 the real outcome in terms of\ninvestment in the region has been disappointing. Apart\nfrom the increase in tourism that we noticed following the\nsigning of the peace treaty, foreign industrial investment\nremains very low notwithstanding the many profitable\nprojects put forward at the recent Amman economic\nconference.\nWhile private foreign companies may have an\nexcuse for reluctance to invest, because of fears related to\nthe regime\u2019s history and political situation, the\nGovernments of developed industrial countries have no\nexcuse for their failure to provide their insurance\ncompanies with sufficient guarantees against investment\nrisks to encourage companies to increase their\ninvestments. This is particularly true since the increased\nprofitability of these companies\u2019 investment projects and\nthe resulting higher incomes in the recipient developing\ncountries would benefit the economies of the developed\nindustrial countries as well. In this regard, we have high\nhopes for the successful conclusion of the fourth\neconomic summit, to be held in Cairo next November.\nThis will provide another opportunity for foreign investors\nto contribute to the region\u2019s development and to the\nconsolidation of peace \u2014 quite apart from the benefits\nthey and the economies of countries are bound to reap.\n10\n\n\nOne of the region\u2019s biggest and most complex\nproblems is that of Palestinian refugees; its settlement has\nbeen deferred to the final status negotiations. It is\nregrettable that the international community has not yet\ngiven this important political and humanitarian problem the\nattention, understanding and assistance it deserves. Every\nyear we receive the report of the Commissioner-General of\nthe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine\nRefugees in the Near East, in which he describes the\nAgency\u2019s budget deficit and the consequent need to reduce\nthe level of services provided to the refugees.\nWe urge the wealthy industrial States to give this\nmatter their fullest attention and to increase their\ncontribution in order to ensure the survival of this\ntemporary solution to the major humanitarian problems that\naffect over 3.5 million Palestinian refugees, including some\n1.5 million who live in Jordan. The Government of Jordan,\ndespite its limited resources, is compelled to provide\nassistance and relief worth approximately $300 million\nannually. It is necessary to provide support for the\nAgency\u2019s budget to enable it to continue its work\neffectively, pending a final solution of the refugee problem\non the basis of United Nations resolutions providing for\ntheir repatriation or compensation. As long as it remains\nwithout a substantive and effective solution, this problem\nwill continue to constitute a time bomb \u2014 forgive me for\nusing this term to indicate the magnitude of this problem \u2014\nfor the peace process, in view of its significant\nhumanitarian and political dimensions.\nThe subject of peace in the Middle East leads us to\ndemand speedy implementation of the recent agreement\nbetween Iraq and the United Nations for a partial lifting of\nthe embargo on the sale of Iraqi oil in order to provide\nfood and medicine to the brotherly people of Iraq, who\nhave suffered, and continue to suffer, from the economic\nsanctions imposed on Iraq. These sanctions have punished\nthem but have not affected their leaders. We call upon the\nGovernment of Iraq to implement United Nations\nresolutions; respect the sovereignty, independence and\nfreedom of neighbouring States; cooperate with the United\nNations Special Commission; cooperate in the release of\nKuwaiti prisoners of war held in Iraq; respect human rights;\nand establish a democratic system in which the rights of all\nits communities are respected. At the same time, we call for\nthe lifting of the economic sanctions that are punishing the\npeople of Iraq. We also call for respect for Iraq\u2019s\nsovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in\nits internal affairs. We reject any attempts aimed at dividing\nIraq, such as the recently proposed \u201csafe areas\u201d scheme.\nIt is also our hope that the United Arab Emirates\nwill be able to arrive at a peaceful solution enabling it to\nregain its three Gulf islands occupied by Iran. We call for\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of Bahrain and\nextend our support to that sister country, at a time when\nit is the target of terrorism. We call upon Eritrea to find\na peaceful solution to the question of its withdrawal from\nthe Yemeni Huneish islands in response to Yemen\u2019s\npeaceful efforts, in order to maintain good-neighbourly\nrelations and in gratitude for Yemen\u2019s assistance to\nEritrea in attaining its independence and sovereignty.\nWe call for a just and speedy solution to the\nLockerbie problem, and for a positive response to the\ninitiatives and efforts of the League of Arab States, the\nOrganization of African Unity, the Non-Aligned\nMovement and the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, which would ensure the trial and punishment\nof the perpetrators of that heinous terrorist act without\npunishing all the people of Libya.\nMy country supports international efforts to combat\ninternational terrorism. Hence our active participation at\nthe Sharm el-Sheikh summit, held earlier this year at the\ninvitation of our sister country, the Arab Republic of\nEgypt, to explore the most effective means of\ninternational cooperation in this regard. We also support\nthe decisions of the latest summit meeting of the Group\nof Seven industrial Powers aimed at fighting terrorism\nand punishing its perpetrators, as terrorism has become a\ndangerous international phenomenon that has taken the\nlives of many innocent people, destroyed the\ninfrastructure of many countries, disrupted tourism and\nthe free movement of innocent people and defamed\nnational liberation and independence movements. We\ntherefore support bilateral, regional and international\ncooperation to combat this ugly and destructive\nphenomenon.\nToday the world stands on the threshold of a new\ncentury, only three years away. That historic occasion\nmust not pass without our pondering and studying the\nevents of the twentieth century in preparation for the\ncoming twenty-first century. We should benefit from the\nlessons we have learned and the events we have\nwitnessed in order to make the next century a safer, more\nsecure, stable and developed one for future generations.\nAn idea worthy of exploration and careful examination in\nthis regard is that of holding, at the outset of the new\ncentury, a special session of the General Assembly at the\nHeads of State level, to prepare for a new world order in\nwhose shaping all States, large and small, developed and\n\n\n\ndeveloping, would participate. This is only an idea which\ncould be further elaborated and considered.\nAs the representative of a developing country, it\nconcerns me that despite the great progress achieved in the\nareas of disarmament and the resolution of global security\nproblems, there has been no resolution of the problem of\nthe economic security of the developing States. The gap\nbetween the developed and developing countries in the\nareas of income and technology is growing. Small\ndeveloping countries will not be able to find solutions in\nthe foreseeable future to their heavy burden of persistent\nindebtedness. It is both disastrous and painful that many\ndeveloping countries, such as my country, Jordan, give their\nfull efforts to consolidate and develop their democratic\nsystems, orient their economies towards privatization,\nreform their economic systems, redress their budgetary and\nbalance-of-payment deficits, fully cooperate with the World\nBank and the International Monetary Fund and make\nconcrete strides in this respect, and yet find themselves,\nafter their people have devoted all their resources,\ncapabilities and productivity to servicing and repaying their\nburdensome debts, still striving breathlessly to catch up\nwith the developed countries, without hope of soon ridding\nthemselves of this burden. Therefore, the shaping of and\npreparation for any new world order to be developed must\nconsider the important question of the economic security of\nthe developing countries.\nWe now live in a world where distances between its\nvarious places and economic markets have been reduced\ndue to tremendous technological strides in the areas of\ntransport and communications. This means that the\ndevelopment and well-being of the developing countries is\nan important part of the solution to the recession in the\ndeveloped countries. The idea of holding a special session\nof the General Assembly to prepare for a new world\neconomic order could be the subject of a draft resolution\nwhich I hope will be brought before this Assembly for\nconsideration.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure to\ncongratulate Ambassador Razali on his election as\nPresident of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly. The Barbados delegation shares fully the\nconfidence expressed in his leadership and assures him of\nits cooperation in the work of this Assembly.\nLet me also warmly commend his predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for his\noutstanding stewardship of the fiftieth session, including\nthe Special Commemorative Meeting on the occasion of\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. That\ncelebration, which brought together 128 Heads of State or\nGovernment, stands as a fitting memorial to the historic\nevent.\nMy country\u2019s knowledge of and appreciation for the\nUnited Nations system has deepened since we had the\nhonour to host the United Nations Global Conference on\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates in 1994. The Barbados Declaration and Programme\n14\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\nof Action outlined the way forward for the relationship\nbetween small island developing States and the international\ncommunity. The Barbados Conference was the first and to\ndate the only follow-up Global Conference to the United\nNations Conference on Environment and Development,\nbecause it was recognized that small island developing\nStates have a critical role to play in sustainable\ndevelopment.\nBarbados and other members of the Alliance of Small\nIsland States will unremittingly pursue the follow-up to the\nProgramme of Action because our survival depends on it.\nWe have, however, been disappointed to note that so much\nof the promise of the Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing States\nhas as yet gone unfulfilled, and we will engage the\ninternational community further to ensure that our concerns\nare addressed.\nBarbados welcomes the coming into force of the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the\nestablishment of the International Seabed Authority and the\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. This new\nregime for the world\u2019s oceans is of particular interest to us\nand to small island developing States in general, because of\nthe critical link between the maritime environment and our\nland mass. Small island developing States are in some ways\njust coastal zones, and as such have a particularly intimate\nrelationship with the oceans, upon which we depend for\nfood and which are pivotal to our tourism industry.\nIt is in this context that we view with apprehension the\nuse of the Caribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of nuclear\nand other hazardous materials. While we understand the\nneeds of countries to dispose of and reprocess waste\nmaterials, and we recognize their right to do so under Law\nof the Sea, International Maritime Organization and\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency regulations, we fear\nthe consequences of accidents for an environment which is\nso highly fragile. The Caribbean presents a unique\ncombination of factors which demand that it be treated with\nspecial care: large numbers of small island developing\nStates, a semi-enclosed sea subject to violent seasonal\nstorms, and the presence of one of the most intensively\nused shipping passages, the Panama Canal. The Heads of\nGovernment of the Caribbean Community have repeatedly\ndeclared their opposition to the use of the Caribbean Sea\nfor trans-shipment of nuclear materials. We look forward to\ndeepened dialogue with flag States and other concerned\nStates and organizations to ensure that we are all aware of\nwhat is being shipped, when and where, and how best to\nmanage it.\nThe vulnerability of Caribbean micro-States is\nfurther increased by narco-trafficking. This illicit trade\nthreatens the very existence of our democracies, a point\nthat was reinforced earlier this year when the United\nNations International Drug Control Programme held a\nconference in Barbados on drug enforcement and\nrehabilitation cooperation in the Caribbean.\nRegional cooperation is the responsible and effective\nmeans for implementing international agreements dealing\nwith this matter. The response of the international\ncommunity to our peculiar set of problems has been\nencouraging, but it must continue to be upgraded. We\nsuffer not so much because we are major end-users, but\nbecause of our strategic location in this traffic. We will\ncontinue in our efforts, with the limited resources we\nhave at our disposal, to ensure that the drug traffic does\nnot undermine the foundations of our democracies. We\nwill not stand accused of not cooperating with our\npartners, but neither will we allow our hard-fought\nsovereignty to be sacrificed in the tug-of-war between the\nmoral and societal imperative to curtail demand and the\nneed to reduce supply.\nAs we herald the International Decade for the\nEradication of Poverty, this delegation is appalled that in\n1996, despite the advances in technology and the new\nwealth being generated by the forces of globalization,\nmillions of children still do not have access to the most\nbasic necessities.\nJust as we argued at the Second United Nations\nConference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) that\nhumankind has a right to housing, Barbados fully supports\nthe notion that individuals have a right to adequate\nnourishment. We look forward to the World Food Summit\nlater this year in Rome as being the catalyst for major\nchange towards alleviating hunger.\nWomen are among the most impoverished groups in\nour societies, and gender equality is a major vehicle for\nachieving sustainable human development. Although\nBarbados ranks high on the human development index,\nparticularly as it relates to gender equality, the Beijing\nPlatform for Action remains for us a critical policy and\naction framework.\nThe landmark fiftieth session was an occasion for\nsolemn reflection on the mission and performance of the\nUnited Nations and for a constructive assessment of the\nchallenges which confront the Organization in the post-\ncold-war world. Member States have left no doubt about\n15\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\nthe critical role that the United Nations must continue to\nplay in fostering global peace and security and promoting\nsustainable development. They have recognized that,\nnotwithstanding its shortcomings, this Organization remains\nthe only universal mechanism which offers the hope of\nachieving the goals for humanity enshrined in its Charter.\nThe task with which we have been charged is to revitalize\nthe United Nations and to strengthen its capacity to meet\nthe new demands of rapid global change. My delegation\ntherefore attaches the greatest importance to the Working\nGroups established by the General Assembly to advance the\nreform process, in order to make the world a more peaceful\nplace and to improve the Organization\u2019s effectiveness in\npromoting economic and social development.\nReform is now the order of the day. No country or\ninstitution can neglect the reality of globalization or the\ntechnological revolution that drives this process. It poses\nmajor challenges for countries and societies, particularly\nsmall developing countries. We recognize only too well our\nown vulnerability to marginalization, stemming from\nintense global competition and reform of major global\ninstitutions, including the United Nations. Barbados\ntherefore follows with special interest the consultations\ntaking place in the Open-ended Working Group on the\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\nMembership of the Security Council and other Matters\nRelated to the Security Council. The question of equitable\nrepresentation of small States is of particular concern, and\nwe are studying closely those proposals which take this\nconcept into account. At the same time, we note with\nsatisfaction the broad convergence of views on enlargement\nof the Council, and the importance being given to measures\nto improve its working methods and procedures, to enhance\nits democratic and representative character, and to foster\ngreater transparency.\nWe also recognize the important consultations which\nare proceeding in the other Working Groups. When this\ntask is successfully completed, we envisage a United\nNations restructured and re-energized, to accelerate\neconomic and social development in a world where absolute\npoverty still afflicts over one billion people who exist on\nless than one dollar a day.\nCommitment to reform notwithstanding, the capacity\nof the Organization to support this global agenda is being\nhampered by recurring financial crises. The United Nations\nnow finds itself at the crossroads. In April 1996, the\nSecretary-General cautioned that the United Nations was on\nthe brink of financial disaster. Regrettably, this outlook has\nnot markedly improved to date. Given this prospect, it is\nclear that resolute action to address this crisis can no\nlonger be postponed if the integrity of the Organization\nand the viability of its mandates are to be preserved. In\nour view, we have debated far too long obligations which\nare so clearly spelt out in the United Nations Charter.\nBarbados holds firmly to the position advanced by\nthe Group of 77 and China that the crisis derives\nessentially from the Organization\u2019s cash flow problem,\ncreated by the failure of major Member States to pay their\ncontributions in full and on time. More generally, we\nsupport the principle of periodic review of the scale of\nassessments, designed to ensure the long-term financial\nviability of the United Nations, based on the principle of\ncapacity to pay; but we do not believe that this should be\nlinked conditionally to the issue of arrears as we search\nfor a solution to the present crisis.\nThis Assembly will once again review the many\nunresolved problems which dominate the global political\nscene. The world still awaits the dawn of the new era of\npeace envisaged at the end of the cold war. As a small\ndeveloping country, Barbados is ever conscious of the\npeaceful domestic climate it has enjoyed since\nindependence in 1966, which has fostered its economic\nand social development. We therefore share the anguish\nof the international community for those countries where\ninternal strife and regional conflict, and their attendant\nhuman suffering, continue to deny economic and social\nprogress to millions of their people.\nMy delegation therefore welcomes the peace process\nwhich is being implemented in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nunder the Dayton accords. Though still fragile, this\nAgreement, we think, offers the best prospects for peace\nso far, and we hope for an end to a conflict which has\nthreatened the very credibility of the United Nations. We\nhope that the recent elections will be a further major step\nin the building of the confidence and trust so crucial to\nlong-term reconciliation.\nRecent outbreaks of violence in the Middle East\nhave renewed our anxieties about peace in that region.\nThe international community yearns for the day when a\nfull and lasting peace is consolidated in this entire region,\nbringing to an end the long cycle of violence. We urge all\nthe parties to re-embark on this journey and redouble their\nefforts to recapture the momentum of the peace process,\nwhich has so far brokered agreements between Israel and\nEgypt, Jordan and Palestine.\n16\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\nIn Africa, a number of countries remain locked in\nprolonged conflict, which has smothered the democratic\nprocess and stalled the development effort. We urge the\ninternational community to do all it can to stem the\nexplosive situation in the Great Lakes region. Without\npeace there can be no development, and without\ndevelopment there can be no lasting peace. We therefore\nhope for an early breakthrough for peace in affected\ncountries, not only in Africa but also in other regions of the\nworld, so that the urgent task of development can be\nresumed.\nIn our own hemisphere, the situation in Haiti continues\nto be of special concern to countries of the Latin American\nand Caribbean region. Thanks to the resolve of the Haitian\npeople and the support of the international community, a\nviable political and development infrastructure has begun to\ntake root. It holds the promise of nurturing the still-fragile\ndemocracy and accelerating economic and social progress\nwhich has eluded the majority of the Haitian people for too\nlong. Speaking on behalf of member States of the\nCaribbean Community during consideration of this question\nat the fiftieth session, Barbados cautioned that the road\nahead for Haiti would be long and difficult, that progress\nwould be uneven, and that sustained support from the\ninternational community would continue to be crucial.\nWe believe that this view is still valid. My delegation\ntherefore welcomes the adoption of Security Council\nresolution 1063 (1996) of 28 June 1996, which established\nthe United Nations Support Mission in Haiti until 30\nNovember 1996. It will provide continuing support to\nsecure and maintain a stable environment that will buttress\nthe democratic and development process. However, come\nnext month, the international community cannot wash its\nhands of Haiti, declare victory and leave. As recent events\nhave shown, stability, to say nothing of democracy, remains\na fragile sapling that will continue to require care and\nprotection. We urge that Haitians, who were among the first\nin this hemisphere to attempt to define their own post-\ncolonial political system, not be forgotten in the post-cold-\nwar world.\nDeveloping countries look to a reformed United\nNations to play a major role in shaping the global society\nof the twenty-first century. It must build on the\nconsiderable policy consensus that already exists on the\nbroad priorities of its agenda, including the link between\npeace and development, poverty eradication, sustainable\ndevelopment, social justice and democracy, issues of\ngovernance, and women. It must continue to nurture the\nparticipatory impulse of civil society, which has emerged as\na major influence on the work of the Organization and on\nnational public policy. It must propel this heightened\nconcern with the human condition in all its dimensions to\nthe top of the global agenda.\nBarbados shares these priorities for full human\ndevelopment by fostering the empowerment of all its\npeople as it expands its economic and social development.\nAt the same time, it has taken steps to review and deepen\nits democratic and human rights traditions through the\nestablishment of Commissions on Social Justice and\nReform of the Constitution, respectively. These inquiries\nwill assess the extent to which the promise of a good and\njust society has been fulfilled after 30 years of\nindependence. They reflect the fact that we assign the\nhighest priority to social policy and to the cause of human\nrights and democracy.\nThe United Nations faces many challenges, but these\nare not insurmountable if we renew our faith in its\nmission. Barbados believes that this Organization is still\nour best hope for fostering peace and social justice and\nfor coordinating the management of global problems.\nGiven the agenda before us, we believe this is a time for\nmore, not less, intensive global cooperation \u2014\ncooperation that only the United Nations can foster. We\nremain committed to its principles and will do our part to\nhelp fulfil the promise of the Charter."

        "file_text": "\ufeffTomorrow, I am going\nto sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty on\nbehalf of Norway. We join with almost all countries in\ncelebrating our new freedom \u2014 freedom from fear of\nnuclear contamination and proliferation. By our joint\nresolve, the terror of competitive madness fell victim to\nthe sheer force of reason.\nThanks to the United Nations, the norm of\nnon-testing has been galvanized. It is today part and\nparcel of international law. In the future, no country,\nwhether it has signed that treaty or not, will be able to\nbreak that norm. That can no longer be done with\nimpunity. It will go down in the annals of history that\nnuclear testing was carried out over a period of 40 years\nin the twentieth century, and then never again.\nThe decades of negotiations seemed endless, and\nwithout the perseverance of this Organization, it would\nnot have worked. Where else could we carve out a global\ntest ban? Where else can we cast norms of global\napplicability? Where else can we extend an international\nsociety based on law and contract?\nThat is what the United Nations does best. It is easy\nto ridicule years of meticulous negotiations. It is easy to\nderide the process as bloated bureaucracy and\ninefficiency. It is easy because that also happens every\nday, here by the East River. And we must never become\nused to that.\nBut some processes take time because they are\ndifficult and because they have profound effects on the\nwhole world. Every country, every man, woman and child\ndepend on what we can achieve right here, and every\ncountry represented here has a stake in our success or our\nfailure.\n8\n\n\nFor more than 50 years, the United Nations has \u2014 for\nbetter, but also for worse \u2014 reflected its Members, global\npolitical trends, contrasts, conflicts and confrontations. It\nhas been judged, unjustly, more by its failures than by its\nsuccesses.\nThe integration of scores of new Member States,\npeace-keeping operations, the promotion and protection of\nhuman rights, and field activities in developing countries\nbringing relief and consolation to millions of destitute\npeople all bear witness to how the United Nations has\nharnessed the best of humanity and civilization. Today, the\nthreats to peace come not so much from contention between\ngreat States. Today\u2019s killing fields are within States. Out of\naround 40 cases of armed conflict in the world today,\nhardly any occur between States. These conflicts are deeply\nembedded in the history of regions and peoples, where\ndisruption within societies date far back, some being\ncenturies old.\nThe price of intra-State conflict is being paid by\ncivilians. Ninety per cent of casualties in armed conflict are\ncivilians. They literally walk the minefields where millions\nof anti-personnel mines are strewn. Not only is the\ndeath-toll numbing; let us also count the many missed years\nof economic production, the livestock lost, the schools\nravaged, the clinics destroyed.\nMillions pay the terrible human price. But we all pay\na price if the gap deepens between the fundamental norms\nof civilization and the daily suffering in too many countries\nin too many parts of the world. Reversing that trend is our\nmoral obligation; preventing deadly conflict is our common\nchallenge.\nTrue, the United Nations is increasingly involved in\ninternal crises. We still do not possess the necessary means,\nmandates and mission capacity to suppress devastating\nconflict. All too often, intervention comes when the conflict\nhas erupted, when the battles have been fought and the\ndividing lines have been cemented. When the peacemakers\nare ready to go, it may be late \u2014 often too late.\nWe lack efficient procedures for dealing with\nemerging conflicts. To individual countries, emerging\nintra-State conflict may not be deemed vital. But to the\nUnited Nations, any armed conflict or threat of conflict\nmust be vital. We need more preventive action and more\npreventive diplomacy. Here at the United Nations, we need\nto develop the institutional, legal and managerial capacity\nto act, which would provide a model for regional action.\nPreventing conflict and human suffering must not be\nhampered by the traditional norm of what is essentially\nwithin the domestic jurisdiction of States. Killing people\ncannot be protected by the Charter.\nA situation which is not visibly dangerous and which\ndoes not offer spectacular pictures for the evening news,\nis all too often silenced and out of the news picture. And\nsince those who suffer have no vote in any of the\ncountries which command the resources to help, it may be\nall too convenient to look the other way.\nBut reacting in time need not be costly. On the\ncontrary, there is so much to gain, there is so much to\nsave. Much could be achieved if the United Nations were\nbetter able to send experienced diplomats and support\nmissions to conflict-ridden areas in timely endeavours to\ndeescalate conflict and reconstruct civil society. We know\nthat the hands of the Secretary-General are often tied in\nsuch cases, when it comes to redirecting resources. That\nis another challenge. United Nations expertise \u2014 our\nexpertise \u2014 may not show up in a situation because there\nare insufficient funds to pay for air tickets.\nNorway is ready to make an extra contribution. We\noffer to establish a fund for preventive action here at the\nUnited Nations. We pledge to fill it with approximately 1\nmillion dollars on an annual basis, and we invite other\nGovernments to join us. The fund would facilitate\nimmediate deployment of first-class expertise for\nproactive diplomacy.\nAny organization that fails to change is bound to\nlose its effectiveness. So we must press on with reform.\nBut we cannot accept intimidation. Withholding legally\nassessed contributions amounts to just that. Today, some\ncountries in fact pay more than their fair share. Other\ncountries voluntarily pay more than their fair share. Many\ncountries pay too little, or hardly anything at all. We now\nneed to settle on a long-term solution based on a more\nequitable scale of contributions and scrupulous respect by\nMember States for their financial obligations and the\npayment of arrears.\nWe must press on with reform of the Security\nCouncil. We are not served by protracted denials of the\nworld as it is. The Security Council must reflect this\nworld, and the issue of a regionally-balanced enlargement\nmust now be addressed. Asia, Africa and Latin America\nshould be represented on a permanent basis. Japan and\nGermany should each have a permanent seat. And as we\nenlarge the Council we must see to it that the efficiency\n9\n\n\nof decision-making is retained and that the Council\u2019s\nimplementing ability is greatly enhanced.\nIf we had sat down at the drawing board to create the\nUnited Nations today, we would have grouped the most\nclosely interlinked challenges together and designated a\nlimited number of agencies to deal with them. Today, in the\nsocial and economic field, responsibility for sustainable\ndevelopment, poverty, population and education is divided.\nThere is too much fragmentation and too many turf battles.\nWe need a leaner \u2014 and thereby, I believe, stronger\n\u2014 structure to deal with what we decided in Rio,\nCairo,Copenhagen and Beijing. Now we must do what we\nsaid there.\nThe Nordic countries, in their ongoing project for\nUnited Nations reform, have focused on the other end of\nthe spectrum \u2014 the country level. Today, there are several\nUnited Nations representatives in one country, often\noverlapping each other and often contributing to more\nfragmentation. But political issues, humanitarian issues and\nlong-term development are interlinked. Our organizational\nset-up should be the same. Let us coordinate our\nhumanitarian assistance activities better, thus allowing us to\nreact more quickly and more effectively. And let us speak\nout more openly about human rights.\nHuman rights are violated all over the world. But only\nin a few countries is the human rights situation\ndeteriorating. We may be impatient; we may find that\nprogress is too slow in important countries; and there may\nbe temporary set-backs.\nBut in a world of global communication, facts can no\nlonger be hidden. We cannot build fences around ideas in\nthe age of the Internet. It will become increasingly\nimpossible to derive the benefits of the global economy\nwithout exposing political power structures to the scrutiny\nof democracy.\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nestablished a global norm. This is what the United Nations\ndoes best and what it must continue to do. The first Chapter\nof the Charter calls for effective collective measures for the\nremoval of threats to the peace. Our challenge is to grasp\nthe complexity of today\u2019s threats. No single country is\npowerful enough to deal alone with the threats that\ntranscend our frontiers \u2014 terrorism, nuclear proliferation,\ndrugs, crime, disease and damage to the environment. They\nall require common action. They all belong on our common\nagenda.\nFive years ago in Rio we reached consensus on\nAgenda 21. That was a call for action. Together we\nsowed the first seeds of a global norm for sustainable\ndevelopment. Now we must struggle on towards its\nimplementation.\nLater this year we will start the final work on a\nclimate protocol. No challenge is more global than\nclimate change. We owe it to present and future\ngenerations to come up with a binding agreement that is\ncost-effective, equitable and verifiable. That process will\nrequire a combined political and scientific craftsmanship\nwhich will need to draw upon every experience we have\nhad in multilateral diplomacy so far.\nThere can be no civilized world unless we unite to\nstrengthen multilateralism by establishing global\nnorms, by building and raising the minimum standards of\ninter- and intra-State behaviour, and by building new\nnorms of international accountability.\nThe war crimes tribunal in The Hague is a\nbuilding-block in that edifice. The preventive aspect\nwould be served if the Karadzic\u00b4s and Mladic\u00b4s of this\nworld were brought to justice to answer for their crimes.\nBut again, conflicts should not be allowed to go that\nfar. We must be able to address the root causes of\nconflict in time. That is what prevention is all about. That\nis the win-win game we should all be playing. We cannot\nafford not to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first of all to convey to Mr. Razali Ismail my\nsincere and heartfelt congratulations on the occasion of his\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I am convinced that thanks to his wise\nand able leadership and his extensive experience in the field\nof international relations, the proceedings of our session\nwill be successful.\nMalaysia\u2019s presidency of the General Assembly is\nclear testimony to the respect that Mr. Razali\u2019s country\nenjoys within the international community, which\nappreciates the great and efficient role played by Malaysia\nat the regional and international levels in order to\nstrengthen and consolidate relations among nations on the\nbasis of peace, justice and cooperation. I take this\nopportunity to pay tribute to the excellent relations of\nfriendship and fruitful cooperation that exist between our\ntwo countries.\nI should like also to convey my sincere thanks to\nMr. Razali\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Freitas do Amaral, for his\nvaluable efforts during his presidency of the fiftieth session\nof the General Assembly. I wish to mention in particular\nhis contribution to helping advance the process of reform of\nthe United Nations, in order to make it more efficient in the\nlight of the changes the world is witnessing.\nI should like also to pay tribute to Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali and to convey to him our appreciation and\nsupport for his continued selfless dedication as head of the\nSecretariat of the United Nations. My delegation also\nappreciates his courageous initiatives, especially his Special\nInitiative for Africa, as well as his constructive proposals\nwithin the Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for\nDevelopment. Tunisia, which supports the renewal of\nMr. Boutros-Ghali\u2019s mandate, stresses the importance of\ncontinuing the reform process undertaken in recent years.\nWith the end of the cold war, the international\ncommunity has entered a new era of international\nrelations that aims to reject the use of force and violence\nas a means of settling conflicts, and to put an end to the\narms race. This trend favours the logic of wisdom and\nmoderation by resorting to peaceful means and preventive\ndiplomacy, which offer possibilities for dialogue,\nconcertation and negotiation to resolve conflicts, disputes\nand crises, however complex they may be.\nWe welcome this emerging trend in international\nrelations, which is a consecration of the principles and\npurposes of the United Nations as enunciated in its\nCharter. This trend must be strengthened and consolidated\nin order to eliminate sources of tension and defuse\nconflicts before they break out.\nThe international community welcomed with\nenthusiasm the start of the peace process in the Middle\nEast. This raised hopes of seeing the parties arrive at a\ntrue, comprehensive, just and honourable peace, thus\nputting an end to a cruel conflict that has lasted for\nalmost half a century, during which time the peoples of\nthe region have experienced the horrors of war,\ndestruction, exodus and occupation. This peace settlement\nshould be based on international law and United Nations\nresolutions, in particular Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978), and on the principle\nof the exchange of land for peace.\nThe Madrid Conference and the ensuing intensive\nnegotiations, which resulted in the Oslo, Washington and\nCairo agreements, led us to believe that the new peace\nprocess was finally on the right track. However, the\nagenda of the new Israeli Government has dashed the\nhopes of the peoples of the region. This agenda has\nindeed blocked the peace process on all tracks. An\nincrease in Israeli pressures and provocations, which aim\nultimately at imposing the policy of the fait accompli, has\nhindered the Palestinian people\u2019s progress towards\nachieving their legitimate right to self-determination and\nto create their own independent State.\nThe bloody events triggered by the opening of a\ntunnel under the Holy Mosque of Al-Aqsa emphasize the\nneed for decisive international action to bring the Israeli\nGovernment to abide by the agreements concluded with\nthe Palestinian Authority and to comply with international\nlaw regarding the settlement of the question of Palestine.\n14\n\n\nTunisia is concerned by the stagnation of the peace\nprocess and its negative effects on building the future of the\nregion on the basis of peace, security, stability and\ncooperation among its peoples. Tunisia considers that Israel\nmust re-evaluate its present policy and commit itself to\nrespecting the principles of the peace process and to\nimplementing the agreements already signed.\nWe also call upon the international community,\nparticularly the sponsors of the peace process, to spare no\neffort in facilitating the resumption of the peace\nnegotiations as soon as possible in order to avoid any risk\nof failure, which could affect the credibility of this process\nand lead to the return of confrontation and the escalation of\nviolence, extremism and terrorism. We believe that\nconfidence-building, good faith and a sincere commitment\nto a peaceful solution are necessary to advance this process.\nThe commitment of all parties to achieving a just,\ncomprehensive and lasting peace is essential to ensuring the\nsecurity and stability of the States of the region as well as\nthe coexistence of their peoples.\nAs stated by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on\nmany occasions, Tunisia is committed to following the\nsame approach it has taken since the beginning of the peace\nprocess, by establishing a close link between each step\ntowards normalization and the progress achieved by the\nnegotiations on all tracks.\nThe establishment of peace in the Middle East depends\non the maintenance of security and stability in the Gulf\nregion. Tunisia, which is deeply concerned by recent\ndevelopments in that region, calls upon all parties to show\nrestraint, avoid any escalation and remain committed to\ninternational legality and to the implementation of all\nUnited Nations resolutions. Tunisia also reiterates its\ncommitment to respect the sovereignty of all States in the\nregion as well as their territorial integrity and inviolability.\nWe also call for an end to the suffering that the Iraqi\npeople have been experiencing for several years, and we\nhope that recent developments in the region will not\naggravate this situation.\nTunisia believes that the time has come to lift the\nembargo imposed on the Libyan people in view of the\nnumerous positive initiatives taken by Libya, the League of\nArab States and the Organization of African Unity, all of\nwhich aim at reaching a peaceful and just solution and at\nputting an end to the suffering of the brotherly Libyan\npeople within the framework of international legality.\nDevoted to peace and a staunch supporter of just\ncauses, Tunisia reiterates its solidarity with the United\nArab Emirates and its full support for that country\u2019s\nendeavour to recover through peaceful means, which\ninclude appealing to the International Court of Justice, the\nislands of Great Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa.\nTurning to the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nTunisia expresses its satisfaction at the return of peace to\nthis country, and hopes that the recent elections will mark\nthe beginning of a new era in which concord,\nunderstanding and common action will prevail, thus\nallowing the establishment of the foundations of the\nBosnian State.\nWe note that today the international community is\ngiving priority to disarmament as the best means of\nensuring and consolidating international security.\nConsiderable progress has been made in this regard,\nespecially in the area of controlling the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction, in particular chemical and\nnuclear weapons.\nTunisia welcomes the adoption by the General\nAssembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nand its opening for signature. We hope that all Member\nStates will adhere to this Treaty, in order to ensure its\nuniversal application. The Treaty\u2019s conclusion, as well as\nthe anticipated strengthening of the Biological Weapons\nConvention, due to be reviewed soon in order to provide\nit with a verification mechanism, will no doubt\nconsolidate the progress made thus far in the field of\ndisarmament.\nWhile expressing our appreciation for the declaration\nof Africa as a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, we hope that\nour continent will be relieved of all weapons of mass\ndestruction. We also reiterate our call to free the Middle\nEast from all nuclear weapons and weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nWhile emphasizing the necessity of introducing\nefficient measures for ensuring a total ban of weapons of\nmass destruction, we believe that it is also essential to\ntackle the issue of conventional weapons, particularly the\nquestion of the accumulation and illegal trade in light\nweapons. This problem is not only serious but is growing\nmore so every day, since these are the most commonly\nused weapons in current conflicts and recent terrorist\noperations.\n15\n\n\nIn addition to its contribution to disarmament efforts,\nTunisia has always supported United Nations peacekeeping\nefforts around the world. From the early 1960s on, it has\ntaken part in United Nations operations in many African\ncountries, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and\nelsewhere.\nConvinced of the importance of these operations in\nmaintaining international peace and security, Tunisia called\non member States of the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) to create special units within their armed forces for\nparticipation when necessary in peacekeeping operations on\nthe African continent.\nWhile welcoming the decision of the United Nations\non establishing a system of standby forces to act to\nintervene rapidly and efficiently in peacekeeping operations,\nTunisia solemnly declares its readiness today to participate\nin that system, thus confirming our commitment to the\nOrganization and to its role in the maintenance of world\npeace and security.\nIntolerance, racism, organized crime, the illegal arms\nand drug trades, the illegal traffic in human beings,\nterrorism and extremism in all its forms are all phenomena\nthat have taken on a transnational dimension. The\ninternational community should ensure that appropriate\nsolutions are found by means of a global approach based on\nthe definition and implementation of international\ncooperation strategies in order to contain and eradicate\nthese scourges.\nOn many occasions and before various international\nand regional forums, my country has called the international\ncommunity\u2019s attention to the dangers of re-emergent\nterrorism and extremism, which threaten the stability and\nsecurity of States as well as the safety of individuals. In\nthis vein, Tunisia called for the conduct of a comprehensive\nand thorough re-evaluation of the attitudes of all parties to\nthese scourges through the establishment of international\nrules of conduct with the aim of fighting all illegal\nactivities, particularly those related to terrorism, in order to\nfind efficient and lasting remedies to these problems and to\neliminate their deep-rooted causes.\nTunisia notes with satisfaction the increasing\nawareness of the need for the international community to\njoin efforts in order to fight terrorism. We hope that the\nUnited Nations will adopt mandatory measures that would\naddress this phenomenon by criminalizing all terrorist acts.\nWe also hope that all member States will revise and adapt\ntheir relevant legislation to these measures.\nTunisia\u2019s steadfast efforts to consolidate the\nfoundations of the country\u2019s political institutions and the\nrule of law and to promote and protect human rights in\ntheir global dimension flow from a civilized, irreversible\nchoice made in accordance with universal values.\nEager to ensure respect for human dignity and to\nencourage ongoing development efforts to secure the\nwell-being of all citizens, Tunisia has been able to\nreconcile, in a balanced manner, economic growth with\nthe preservation of political, economic and social rights,\nthe requisite foundations of democracy.\nTunisia will continue to advance the causes of\nhuman rights in the world and to support the United\nNations Voluntary Fund for technical assistance in the\nfield of human rights, as well as the Programme of\nAction for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights\nEducation.\nWe are persuaded that the dissemination of the\nculture of human rights will come to fruition only with\nthe promotion of tolerance, which is an essential civilized\nvalue upon which are based all religions and human-rights\nideals.\nTunisia placed particular emphasis on tolerance in\nthe reform of its education system, since it is convinced\nthat global change, the progress of civilization and\nculture, as well as economic and social growth, will be\nfirmly established only when coming generations are\nwell-prepared and when the values of peace, democracy\nand goodness are complemented by a culture of tolerance.\nEconomic globalization has opened new perspectives\nfor international cooperation for development. But it has\nalso had a negative impact on the economies of numerous\ndeveloping countries that have been swept up in it\nwithout adequately preparing their economic and social\nstructures.\nIn the new era, Tunisia has focused on setting up a\ncomprehensive and multidimensional development\nstrategy designed to assist the disadvantaged in society\nand based on a broadened concept of human rights.\nTunisia\u2019s policy in this regard was based on a\ndevelopment approach aimed at providing equal\nopportunities to all levels of society and ensuring the\nwell-being of all its citizens.\nThe human dimension for which Tunisia has opted\nin defining its development policies has led to a deeper\n16\n\n\nspirit of solidarity within the population towards the\nunderprivileged and vulnerable sectors and to granting them\nthe highest priority. In order to achieve these objectives,\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali took the initiative of\nestablishing an anti-poverty programme \u2014 the National\nSolidarity Fund \u2014 aimed at eradicating pockets of poverty\nand ensuring harmonious development for all social sectors.\nThe debt burden in the third world is a very serious\nproblem that cannot be overlooked, since it constitutes the\nmain obstacle to their efforts to achieve a regular\ndevelopment pattern, free from any shortcomings or failure.\nWhile we welcome the Group of Seven\u2019s economic\ncommuniqu\u00e9 on the issue of debt, we also stress the need\nto take appropriate measures to alleviate the debt burden of\nmiddle-income countries.\nThe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund\nand the World Trade Organization should implement the\ncommitments undertaken by the international community in\nthe framework of the major conferences held during the\npast five years. To this end, they need to mobilize the\nresources required to fund the programmes adopted by\nthese conferences in the quest for sustainable development.\nWe welcome the process of reform initiated by the\nUnited Nations with the aim of adjusting to the emerging\ninternational environment, improving its functions and\nassuming its responsibilities as the institution best able to\nmaintain peace and security, on the one hand, and to pursue\nand support efforts on behalf of the economic and social\ndevelopment of the developing countries, on the other.\nTo this end, it is equally important to continue the\nprocess of reform of the Organization with the aim of\nrationalizing and strengthening its role as the central pillar\nof international cooperation for achieving objectives and\nimplementing programmes agreed upon by the international\ncommunity, on the basis of priorities set by Governments\nseeking to eradicate poverty and to support employment and\nhousing programmes, as well as those that provide basic\nservices in the education and health sectors and offer\nprotection to women, children and the socially\nunderprivileged.\nThese objectives can be attained only through the use\nof jointly agreed criteria based on transparency and\ndemocracy in international relations, and by rejecting any\npolicy that involves a double standard.\nIn order to preserve the prestige and credibility of the\nUnited Nations, it is necessary to implement the resolutions\nthe Organization adopts and to follow up on the\ncommitments entered into by States.\nWe would also like to underline the extreme\nimportance we attach to the restructuring of the Security\nCouncil, so as to enable this eminent body to play its key\nrole in the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, while taking into consideration the need for an\nequitable geographical representation based on new geo-\npolitical realities. I should like to recall in this respect that\nTunisia supports granting Japan and Germany the status\nof permanent members of the Security Council, owing to\nthe political and economic standing of both countries.\nIn accordance with the consensus reached at the\nthirtieth Organization of African Unity summit meeting,\nheld in Tunis, we reaffirm Africa\u2019s right to at least two\npermanent seats on the Security Council that would rotate\namong all African States.\nTunisia supports any initiative that takes into account\nthese principles, and it expresses its appreciation for the\ninitiatives and ideas presented by some States, in\nparticular friendly neighbouring Italy, in order to achieve\na comprehensive vision regarding reform of the Security\nCouncil.\nFinally, we believe that the success of our\nOrganization depends on the determination of all Member\nStates to act in conformity with the purposes and\nprinciples set out in the Charter, as well as on sincere\npolitical will, in order to allow our Organization to fulfil\nthe aspirations and hopes of our peoples, who provide it\nthe indispensable support it needs to guarantee its\ncontinued vitality, its renewed capacity and its durability.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have the honour to convey\nto the President and all the members the warm greetings\nand good wishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck,\nKing of Bhutan, for the success of the fifty-first session of\nthe United Nations General Assembly.\nWe congratulate Ambassador Razali on his unanimous\nelection as President of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly. We are happy that a close friend of Bhutan is\npresiding over our deliberations. We are fully aware of his\nwide experience and deep interest in the United Nations. He\nis not only an outspoken critic of the shortcomings of the\nUnited Nations but is also one of its greatest supporters,\nand we look to this session with high expectations.\nI would like to express our deepest appreciation to His\nExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for the exemplary\nmanner in which he conducted the Special Commemorative\nMeeting of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\nand the fiftieth session of the General Assembly. I am also\ngrateful for the privilege of having had the opportunity to\nserve in his Bureau.\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to pay a\nspecial tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for his leadership in steering the United\nNations through a period of many challenges and changes.\nTwenty-five years ago, on 21 September 1971, Bhutan\nbecame a Member of the United Nations. That day saw the\nfulfilment of a long-cherished dream and was a historic\noccasion on which the people of Bhutan joined hands with\nthe international community. We have since taken great\npride in our membership of the world body and have made\ngreat strides. Bhutan has stepped forward to take an\nactive role by seeking membership in all major United\nNations and other international bodies including the\nBretton Woods institutions. Our membership of the\nUnited Nations has provided us with the opportunity to\nparticipate in all international discussions of importance.\nOur participation, which we consider both a privilege and\nan obligation, has always been guided by a positive\nattitude, seeking to contribute constructively and fairly.\nOn the part of the international community, Bhutan\nhas received an outpouring of goodwill and friendship.\nThe United Nations and its agencies have come to our\nassistance with enthusiasm and dedication. Every sector\nin Bhutan has received the benefit of United Nations\nassistance, and the lives of the people of Bhutan have\ngreatly improved. Today, the development of Bhutan rests\nin the hands of young Bhutanese, many of whom were\ntrained through United Nations assistance. I take this\nopportunity to put on record the heartfelt gratitude of the\npeople of Bhutan to the United Nations and international\ninstitutions, in particular the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the\nUnited Nations Population Fund, the United Nations\nCapital Development Fund, the International Fund for\nAgricultural Development, the World Food Programme,\nthe United Nations Volunteers programme, the Food and\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World\nHealth Organization, the United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization, the World Bank and\nthe African Development Bank, many of which have been\nworking constructively in Bhutan for the last 25 years.\nBhutan takes the opportunity of the twenty-fifth\nanniversary of our membership to rededicate ourselves to\nthe principles of the United Nations and its Charter. As\nwe rededicate ourselves to the United Nations and express\nour support and gratitude, we are conscious of the fact\nthat the United Nations is at a crossroads, and that there\nis a struggle for the heart and soul of the Organization.\nThe world has changed, and the United Nations too must\nchange to meet the new realities.\nToday we would like to confine our remarks to a\nfew areas which we feel need to be addressed in the\nprocess of reform and in preparing the United Nations for\nthe next century.\nThe increase in membership from the original 51\nMembers to the current 185 is the clearest indication that\nthe United Nations is truly a global body. The\nrepresentation and participation of all United Nations\n15\n\n\nMembers in the General Assembly give true meaning and\nlegitimacy to the United Nations, yet increasingly the\nGeneral Assembly has little influence in the work of the\nUnited Nations. The role of the Assembly must be\nenhanced. It must become the centre of the United Nations\nand the source of both its moral and real authority. In order\nto do this, the General Assembly must change its own\nworking methods, and its debates and agenda must be made\nmore meaningful. It must become the point from which all\nUnited Nations policies emanate. The General Assembly\u2019s\nrelations with other principal organs and bodies of the\nUnited Nations must be streamlined and strengthened.\nThe structure of other principal organs such as the\nEconomic and Social Council must also be reviewed. In\nmany of the principal organs, subsidiary bodies and\ncommissions have taken a more prominent role than the\norgans themselves. While we agree that the more detailed\nwork of implementing the technical aspects must be\ndevolved to commissions and subsidiary bodies, policies\nmust be made by the principal organs themselves. Many\nhere will agree that the subsidiary bodies, committees,\ngroups, and so forth, are too numerous to keep track of, let\nalone participate in. All United Nations bodies must finally\nbe made accountable to the General Assembly. Unless this\nlinkage is strengthened, many Members will be excluded\nfrom the activities of the United Nations. For many smaller\nMembers, the possibility of being elected to and\nparticipating in many United Nations bodies is limited.\nTherefore, the General Assembly is of paramount\nimportance for enhancing the participation and role of\nMember countries.\nIn the area of peace and security, there is increasing\nconcern that the United Nations is unable to maintain peace\nand provide security, particularly for its smaller and more\nvulnerable Members. This view seems to persist despite a\nnumber of successful interventions by the United Nations.\nThere is growing frustration that the Security Council, the\nonly body of the United Nations with any real authority, is\nunable to respond to the challenges posed by the present\nconflicts, and that the Security Council is primarily driven\nby the views of its major members. The need for reform\nand expansion is more and more keenly felt. In our view,\nthere must be an increase in the number of both permanent\nand non-permanent members. Developing countries and\ndeserving countries from all regions must be included in the\nranks of permanent members. Using the objective criteria\nof equitable distribution, the ability to contribute to the\nwork of the United Nations and the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, Bhutan believes that India\nand Japan qualify for permanent membership of the\nSecurity Council.\nExpansion alone is not sufficient. The decision-\nmaking process of the Security Council, its relations with\nthe General Assembly, and other powers such as the veto\nand the Council\u2019s virtual hold over the appointment of\njudges of the International Court of Justice and other\nimportant positions in the United Nations, must be\nreviewed.\nProgress towards a world free of tension can only be\nmade with disarmament that includes all types of\nweapons. While various steps have been taken towards\neasing the nuclear threat, no significant progress towards\nthe goal of the complete elimination of all nuclear\nweapons has been made. We must not lose sight of the\nprimary objective of the complete elimination of nuclear\nweapons. The disarmament dialogue must include all\nparties and address the genuine concerns of every\nMember State.\nA brisk international business in conventional arms\ncontinues to pose a threat to peace and security. As long\nas there is an unlimited supply of arms, their use in the\nsettlement of disputes will continue. We must expand our\ninitiatives at the United Nations to control the global arms\ntrade. Bhutan supports the steps taken towards the\nelimination of chemical and biological weapons. The\nUnited Nations Register of Conventional Arms is a useful\nstep. Efforts must also be redoubled to bring about a\nmoratorium on the manufacture, sale and deployment of\nanti-personnel landmines, with the objective of\neliminating this weapon which kills indiscriminately.\nWith the major agreements and common ground\narrived at during the United Nations global conferences of\nthe 1990s, it was hoped that the stage had been set for\nfresh impetus and a new direction in international\ndevelopment. In reality the new era of development has\ncontinued to elude us.\nThere is an emerging consensus that the new\napproach to development must be to concentrate on the\nwell-being of the individual person and to release the\nproductive capacity of the human spirit and of nations\nthrough social development, free markets, international\ntrade and investment. While this strategy has brought\nprogress to many countries, many poorer developing\ncountries have not been able to compete and benefit, due\nto structural inadequacies in their economies or because\nof the small size of their markets.\n16\n\n\nTo adapt to the new approaches to development, all\nUnited Nations agencies have to undergo major changes in\ntheir organization and operations. However, the resources\navailable to United Nations agencies have declined both in\nactual and real terms. Many of them are unable to carry out\nprogrammes at the level of previous cycles. In these\ncircumstances, many of the targets set in the major global\nconferences, whether in health, environment, population,\neducation, or other social fields, may not be met.\nIt is often said that the overall contribution of United\nNations agencies to a country\u2019s development is small.\nWhile this may be the case in larger countries, it should be\npointed out that in many smaller countries the input of\nUnited Nations agencies plays a substantial role. It is\nunfortunate that the most far-reaching responsibility of the\nUnited Nations, which can make a lasting impact in\nimproving the lives of millions of people, is being\nconstrained and reduced at a time when more efforts are\nnecessary.\nThe efforts of the United Nations development bodies\nare of particular importance to the 48 least developed\ncountries. It has become increasingly difficult for the\nconcerns and needs of these countries to find a place in the\ninternational development dialogue. The United Nations,\nthrough the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment and all other agencies, must ensure that the\nsituation and the needs of the least developed countries are\nkept in focus and as part of any agenda for development.\nOtherwise we risk the further marginalization of a\nsignificant number of countries.\nThe United Nations development agencies must ensure\nthat the resources they spend in finding and developing new\nideas and approaches are balanced and matched by\nprogrammes and resources in the field. The agencies and\ndeveloping countries must work closely together in order to\nregain the confidence of the donor community. Bhutan\nstrongly believes that the special role that many\ndevelopment agencies fulfil must not be allowed to\ndiminish due to a lack of funds.\nBhutan recognizes that developing countries must\nwork closely with other major participants in the\ninternational development effort, such as financial\ninstitutions, bilateral donors and the world business\ncommunity. Bhutan has greatly benefitted from the\ncontributions and efforts of our bilateral donors. Their\nassistance has been utilized effectively and has contributed\nmeaningfully to our development. We take this opportunity\nto express our gratitude to our bilateral donors, in particular\nIndia, Switzerland, Japan, Denmark, the Netherlands,\nAustria, Norway, Kuwait, Germany, Australia and\nThailand, for their cooperation and generous assistance.\nAllow me to express a few thoughts concerning the\nimpact of reform on the United Nations. We are aware\nthat the issue of reforming the United Nations system and\nits organizational structure is not new, and that it was\nraised just a few years after the establishment of the\nUnited Nations itself. However, the issue of\norganizational reform has taken on special significance in\nthe last few years, given the financial situation of the\nUnited Nations and some of its major agencies. While the\ndialogue on reform of the United Nations continues, the\nOrganization has had to implement major cuts in staff and\nactivities. The morale of the international civil servants\nhas been greatly affected. This situation should not be\nallowed to continue for long. All Member countries must\ntake cognizance of these facts, work towards completing\nthe reform process, and place the Organization on a firm\nfinancial footing at an early date.\nWe must not be afraid of reform and change. Major\nchanges have already been carried out, and there are still\nmany areas which need to be addressed. However, it is\nour view that the process of reform of the Organization\nshould be time-bound. A long, drawn out process with no\nend in sight will hinder the Organization in effectively\ncarrying out the vast responsibilities we have assigned to\nit.\nThe calls for change and reform of the United\nNations, in their own way, are the best indicator of the\nstrong support of its Members. The United Nations today\nhas become an indispensable institution in international\nrelations and development. It is up to us, the Member\nStates, to ensure that it will be able to meet the\naspirations and expectations of all its Members, large and\nsmall. It must become the source of inspiration for all and\na guiding beacon that will take the world to the next\nmillennium of peace and prosperity for all the peoples\nand nations of the world.\n\n\n\n"

This year alone, the\nOrganization ran out of money in its regular budget three\ntimes and was therefore forced to borrow funds from its\npeacekeeping operations budget. The tasks of today and\nthe challenges of tomorrow require a general reform of\nthe entire United Nations system.

Albania is in favour of increasing the\nsize of the Council by two permanent seats: Germany and\nJapan. We also believe that options should be considered\nthat relate to a broader representation of Member States,\nin order to make the Council more efficient and better\nable to fulfil its mandate.\nRevitalization of the Economic and Social Council\nmust be part of the reform process. We all firmly believe\nthat as long as wide economic gaps exist between North\nand South, and East and West, several peoples and\ncountries will face key problems related to their survival,\nand risks of tension, conflicts and regional hostility will\nprevail. For this reason, reform of the Security Council\nwill not aid the cause of global peace and stability if it is\nnot accompanied by an equally effective reform of the\nEconomic and Social Council.\n\n\nAfter a long 50 years of communist rule, Albania has\nnow been a democracy for five years. During this period of\ndemocratic reform, it has had to face innumerable major\nproblems, including its communist heritage, with its\nassociated spirit of class struggle; and its extreme poverty\nand strict isolation. The country\u2019s transition was rendered\nyet more difficult by the situation in the region, which was\nweighted down by the crisis in the former Yugoslavia and\nthe related application of the sanctions regime for several\nyears. Nonetheless, Albania has been able to evolve from\na one-party to a multiple-party system; from repression to\nthe establishment of a State based on the rule of law and on\nrespect for human rights and minorities; from a highly\ncentralized and depressed economy to a growing, free-\nmarket economy; and from isolationism to openness to\nEuro-Atlantic integration.\nAlbania\u2019s gross domestic product has increased\nannually, from 11 per cent in 1992 to 15 per cent in 1996.\nInflation fell 400 per cent in 1992 and now stands at 7.5\nper cent in 1996. Our national currency\u2019s exchange rate has\ngained some stability, and our foreign debt has been paid.\nAlthough five years ago the economy was totally\ncentralized, privatization is now proceeding rapidly in all\nthe major economic sectors; at present 75 per cent of\noverall production comes from the private sector. The\nunemployment rate has dropped from 39 per cent in 1992\nto 12 per cent in 1996. Within four years, Albania was able\nto completely liberalize prices.\nClearly, transforming a centralized economy into a\nmarket economy is difficult and sometimes painful,\nespecially for certain economic sectors and for certain\nsegments of the population. I should like to take this\nopportunity to again sincerely thank the European Union,\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\nWorld Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and\nDevelopment, the International Monetary Fund and a\nnumber of United Nations specialized agencies for the\nvaluable assistance they have provided to my country\nduring this period of transition. We are confident that these\ninstitutions will continue to help Albania.\nOver the past four years, Albania\u2019s prestige in the\ninternational arena has increased considerably, giving proof\nof its priority Euro-Atlantic orientation. Albania is already\na member of the Council of Europe and an active\nparticipant in the Partnership for Peace, and is working for\nits full integration into the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization and the European Union. In this regard\nAlbania highly appreciates the support of the member\nStates of the European Union and is convinced that the time\nhas come to accelerate the process of Albania\u2019s\nintegration. We also welcome the current progress being\nmade in solidifying our relations with the United States,\nwhich the Albanians consider to be the champion of\ndemocracy and freedom. We are confident that these\nrelations, which are of great importance to Albania, will\ncontinue to develop.\nAlbania\u2019s regional policy is based on a desire to\npromote peace and stability in the Balkans. Given the\ngeo-strategic position of Albania, the deteriorating\nsituation of those Albanians living in exile in other\nBalkan countries, and the prolonged crisis in the former\nYugoslavia, the Albanian Government\u2019s significant\ncontribution to regional peace and stability demonstrates\nits willingness to establish regional cooperation in line\nwith Euro-Atlantic trends. Determined to continue this\npolicy and to increase its contribution, Albania hosted the\nfirst Conference of South-Balkans Defence Ministers,\nwhich served as a first step leading to the Conference of\nthe Ministers for Foreign Affairs, held in Sofia some\nmonths later. As part of this contribution, my country has\njust established a peacekeeping unit, now serving in\nZadar, Croatia within the framework of the\nImplementation Force (IFOR).\nThe Albanian Government continues to believe that\nthe question of the Balkans requires greater attention by\nthe international community and by the United Nations in\nparticular. The bitter history of the region and the\nprolonged conflict of recent years have proved clearly that\nthe threat of war always looms large in countries where\nultra-nationalism and chauvinism hold sway. We all are\naware of the importance of the Dayton Agreement in\nresolving the conflict in the Balkans. We have always\nstressed the importance of identifying the major cause of\nthat conflict: Serb ultra-nationalism.\nWhile making a serious effort to assist in the\nimplementation of the Dayton Agreement, the\nGovernment of the Republic of Albania wishes once\nagain to draw the attention of the United Nations to the\nserious problem of Kosovo. In the 1980s, Kosovo \u2014\nmore than 90 per cent of whose population consists of\nAlbanians who have lived on their own territory for\nthousands of years \u2014 was the first to speak of the danger\nthat Serb ultra-nationalism posed to the territories of the\nformer Yugoslavia. National chauvinism; ethnic\nintolerance; racial, economic and religious discrimination;\n\u201cethnic cleansing\u201d; and acts of violence and repression\nagainst an entire population \u2014 characteristic features of\nSerb policy \u2014 were demonstrated for the first time in\n2\n\n\nKosovo. In fact, the crisis in the former Yugoslavia began\nin Kosovo, though at that time the international community\npaid scant attention to what the Albanians were saying. It\nwas not until the crisis became a bloody conflict in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina that proper attention was paid.\nThe Kosovo issue must be duly examined and treated\nin the spirit of the Dayton Agreement. It is now considered\none of the serious international issues that must be resolved,\nand it has been the subject of several documents and\ndecisions of the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe and of the United Nations. However, the situation\nin Kosovo is still tense and volatile. The fact that up to\nnow an armed conflict between the Albanians living in\nKosovo and the Serbs has been avoided \u2014 or rather,\nresisted \u2014 is primarily the result of the peaceful policy\npursued by the legitimate political representatives of the\npeople of Kosovo, and of the foreign policy of the Albanian\nGovernment.\nWe believe that Kosovo deserves a status that reflects\nthe political will of its people as well as the international\ninstruments relating to the right of peoples to self-\ndetermination. The agreement on education in Kosovo,\nrecently reached by representatives of Kosovo and\nBelgrade, is a promising step towards further efforts fully\nto guarantee the Kosovo Albanians basic freedoms and\nhuman and national rights. The Government of the Republic\nof Albania believes that through constructive dialogue, in\nthe presence of a credible international third party, a\nsolution to this acute problem can be found.\nWe thank the General Assembly for its consideration\nof the situation in Kosovo, particularly through its\nresolutions 49/204 of 23 December 1994 and 50/190 of 22\nDecember 1995. We would like to take this opportunity to\nappeal once again to the international community to\ncontinue its efforts until this issue is definitively resolved.\nAlbania\u2019s foreign policy is characterized by efforts to\nestablish good relations with its neighbours. Albania has\nalways been in favour of peace, stability, and economic and\ncultural cooperation with its neighbouring countries.\nAlbania and Greece have been able to establish good\nrelations, which are expanding and strengthening. The\nGovernment of the Republic of Albania and the Albanian\npeople are grateful to the Government and the people of\nGreece for having supported us during our difficult period\nof transition. The current positive developments in\nAlbanian-Greek relations show, to our great pleasure, that\nin bilateral relations all problems can be solved\nsatisfactorily and within a reasonable time-frame if there is\npolitical good will and a serious commitment by both\nsides. The friendly relations between our two countries\nare concrete testimony of the achievements of both the\nGreek and the Albanian Governments. Good relations\nbetween two neighbouring countries such as Albania and\nGreece show that the existence of national minorities in\nneighbouring countries can serve as a bridge of friendship\nand become a connective link between countries. The\nrecognition and equal treatment of national minorities,\ncoupled with respect for the independence, sovereignty\nand territorial integrity of each State, are essential\nelements in such relations.\nThe Albanian Government has taken steps to show\nits interest in establishing mutually beneficial relations\nwith the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\nAlbania was among the first countries to officially\nrecognize that State, while at the same time assuring it of\nour readiness to work with it to establish stronger\nrelations in all fields, independently of the problems\nrelating to the situation and the position of those\nAlbanians living in that State. My country believes that\nthe normalization and improvement of relations with\nSerbia and Montenegro depends on Belgrade taking\ncertain steps, such as respecting the Dayton Agreement,\ntaking concrete measures to put an end to the violence\nagainst and the suppression of the rights of the Albanians\nin Kosovo, and making a serious commitment to a\npeaceful solution to the Kosovo question.\nAlbania attaches particular importance to its relations\nwith its western neighbour, Italy. This ancient relationship\nhas lasted as long as our peoples have lived in the\nMediterranean. In the framework of the European Union,\nItaly has been one of the main donors to Albania. We are\nvery grateful to the Italian Government and people for the\ntremendous assistance they have given our country during\nthis difficult period of transition, and for the spirit of\ngood will that has always prevailed in our relations. We\nbelieve these things provide a solid basis for further\npositive developments in the future.\nBefore concluding my address before the Assembly,\nallow me to assure members, on behalf of the Albanian\nGovernment, of our continued support for the activities of\nthe United Nations. We will continue to contribute to the\nstrengthening of the Organization and of its irreplaceable\nrole in the service of peace, security, progress and\ndemocracy throughout the world. My small country,\nAlbania, will always be committed to contribute actively\nto all the work of the Organization.\n3\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI bring with me from the\nKingdom of Swaziland the greetings and good wishes of\nHis Majesty King Mswati III, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi\nand Queen Mother, the Government and the whole Swazi\nnation to our friends and fellow Members here at the\nUnited Nations.\nOn behalf of the Kingdom of Swaziland, may I\ncongratulate you most sincerely, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of this fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly. We are confident that the wisdom, experience\nand diplomatic skills you bring to this office will ensure\nsuccess in the important business before us.\nSwaziland would also like to congratulate your\npredecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, who presided\nwith such skill over the historic fiftieth session.\nI should also like to record the deep gratitude of the\nSwazi nation to our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, and to the staff of the Secretariat for their\nuntiring efforts in meeting the many challenges that face\nour Organization as we prepare to enter a new millennium.\nOne year ago, His Majesty King Mswati III joined\nother leaders from around the world to celebrate the first 50\nyears of achievement of the United Nations, to set out a\nvision for the future and to reaffirm the commitment of the\nKingdom of Swaziland to the principles set out in our\nOrganization\u2019s founding Charter.\nSwaziland recognizes the vital role the Organization\nhas played throughout its history, and we remain convinced\nthat the United Nations represents humankind\u2019s best hope\nof providing global leadership and guidance towards\nachieving the conditions of universal peace and security that\nwill allow equitable and sustainable development for all our\npeoples.\nLast year\u2019s occasion was seen by many as an\nopportunity to review the internal mechanisms of our\nOrganization and to call for greater efficiency,\naccountability and representation in all areas of its work.\nSwaziland is therefore encouraged by the progress\nbeing made by the various working groups established by\nthe General Assembly, in particular progress towards the\nreform of the Secretariat and Security Council. We will\ncontinue to support all initiatives that bring about a more\nefficient and cost-effective Organization.\nAs the Organization\u2019s membership has increased\nover the years, so has the scope of its operations and\nresponsibilities. It is an unfortunate fact that our will to\nface these new challenges has not been met by a\ncorresponding desire to pay for the means to overcome\nthem. We are faced with a stark choice between whether\nto accept new responsibilities and the bill they attract, or\nadmit that we lack the financial commitment to meet\nthem.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has always believed in\nthe principle of meeting our financial responsibilities in\nfull and on time. We fully endorse the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s call to our fellow Members to do likewise, so\nthat the United Nations can have the resources at its\ndisposal to perform the tasks that we expect of it.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has been most\nencouraged by recent developments towards the eventual\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction. The\nnegotiations leading up to and the signing of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by an\noverwhelming majority brings great credit to our\nOrganization and to those whose hard work made it\npossible.\nWhile we recognize and are deeply grateful for the\nhumanitarian assistance provided to Africa by the United\nNations, we believe that the Organization needs to do\nmore to strike at the causes of the hardship suffered by so\nmany Africans who find themselves caught up in the\nhorror of war.\nOne important issue concerns the flow of weapons\ninto Africa from many other parts of the world. It is a\nsimple fact in today\u2019s world that arms, ammunition and\narmaments are too easily accessible to those with the\nmeans to procure them. The duration of conflict situations\ncan be limited by the non-availability of the weapons of\nwar.\nIt has been suggested that the first action of a truly\ncaring world in response to a conflict situation should be\nto cut off the supply of arms to all involved, and that the\nfinal responsibility of a caring world towards a country\nthat has endured conflict is the clearance of the last\nlandmine.\nThis is a lesson we learned very late in recent\ndisasters such as the Bosnian crisis and in Rwanda. We\nhave clearly not learned from it in other situations around\nthe world. Let us hope that the global community\n8\n\n\nrepresented here can move faster in future to impose\nlimitations on man\u2019s ability to harm his fellow man.\nWe in Africa recognize the need to be prepared for\nimmediate reaction to our continent\u2019s problems and are\ntaking the necessary steps to abide by the principle of\n\u201cAfrican solutions to Africa\u2019s problems\u201d.\nThe example of Burundi shows our continent\u2019s desire\nto heed the warning signs and to ward off potential\ndisasters before they happen.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland commends the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and those individual\ncountries whose diplomacy and actions have prevented the\nsituation from spiralling out of control. The Organization of\nAfrican Unity has also been at the forefront in attempting\nto resolve crisis situations in Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan and\nLiberia.\nWe join the rest of the world in applauding these\nefforts, and we continue to offer our encouragement and\nsupport in bringing about an end to the suffering of those\ninvolved. The OAU represents the hope of all Africans for\nunity, peace and development, and deserves to be supported\nstrongly by the rest of the world.\nOn a subregional basis, and in the field of economic\nand trade cooperation, the Kingdom of Swaziland is a\nmember of the Southern African Development Community\n(SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern\nAfrica.\nSADC has recently expanded its mandate to include a\nnew Organ on Politics, Defence and Security. This is an\nattempt to provide a mechanism by which member States\ncan call for advice and support from other members in the\nevent of national and international issues that might threaten\nthe stability of the whole subregion.\nThe new organ is founded on the principle of the\nrecognition of the sovereignty of independent States and is\nintended precisely to identify potential problems, in\nwhatever context, and to look for solutions to persistent\nconcerns in our area. The organ provides an example of our\nsubregion\u2019s commitment to peace and stability within and\namong our member States as essential conditions for the\ndevelopment of our separate nations. It deserves the support\nand encouragement of the rest of the world.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has been heartened by\nthe various initiatives of the United Nations towards an\nimprovement in global socio-economic conditions.\nThe establishment of an international criminal court\nis welcomed by Swaziland as a necessary extension of\njustice in cases where national jurisdiction does not apply.\nThis step relies for its success on the political will of all\nStates and requires the widest possible representation of\nMembers in its operation. Similarly, the Kingdom of\nSwaziland welcomes the move by the United Nations to\naddress the increasing threat posed to civil society by\norganized crime and money-laundering.\nOf particular danger to Swaziland in this regard is\nthe increase in traffic across our borders and abuse among\nour people of illegal drugs and related substances. This is\na relatively new and alarming phenomenon for our\nKingdom and undermines our efforts to promote national\ndevelopment. We therefore welcome the report of the\nSecretary-General on promoting international cooperation\nin the fight against the illegal drug trade, and we are\nappreciative of the high priority this subject attracts in the\nrelevant agencies of the Organization.\nThis effort has been matched by a similar initiative\nwithin our own SADC organization to encourage cross-\nborder cooperation among our security personnel and to\nagree on measures among the Member States to contain\nthis potentially devastating problem.\nIt has been acknowledged that the continent of\nAfrica presents particular challenges in the quest for\nsustainable development and a decent standard of living\nfor all its peoples.\nWith this in mind, the Kingdom of Swaziland gave\nan enthusiastic welcome to the Secretary-General\u2019s\ninitiative on the United Nations New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. It was hoped that\nthe Agenda would provide fresh impetus for change and\nfor the good of the people of Africa, but for many\nreasons this remains an elusive dream. While social and\neconomic conditions in many areas of the continent\ncontinue to decline, we are comforted by the fact that\nefforts are being made to identify the reasons why so\nmany commitments continue to remain on paper and why\nsome are implemented, but slowly.\nSwaziland echoes the call from all African brothers\nand sisters for real commitment to the New Agenda for\nthe Development of Africa so that future generations of\n9\n\n\nAfricans will not be locked into the same spiral of despair\nthat many people on our continent find themselves in.\nIt is to avoid being caught in this very situation that\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland has always worked hard to\nensure that our people are at the centre of all our national\ndevelopment efforts. To this end the Kingdom frequently\nconsults with all its people on all the most important\ndevelopment issues. Each and every Swazi has a voice and\nis given the opportunity to express his or her views on the\nmatters that affect them.\nIn recent times we have consulted in this way with the\nnation on our political direction and our economic\npriorities. Currently we are addressing ourselves to a review\nof our Constitution.\nA constitutional review committee has been\nestablished, representing the widest range of views, which\nwill now consult with the nation and gather the people\u2019s\nwishes on the way they would like to see their country\nmanaged. All will be free to contribute, and we will abide\nby the views of the majority. The end result will be the\nKingdom\u2019s defining document, and it will, in a very real\nsense, be the people\u2019s Constitution. This current\nconsultation exercise is the latest example of our nation\u2019s\nadherence to the principle of rule through consensus, and it\nis one that has served us well throughout our history.\nIn a world where the definition of such concepts as\nhuman rights and democracy can vary so greatly and is so\ndependent on timing and circumstances, the Kingdom of\nSwaziland has had a consistent vision of what is really\nrequired of its rulers by its people: to provide the freedom\nand opportunity for all Swazis to offer an opinion on the\ngreat matters of the day and for our leaders to be bound by\nthe wishes of the majority. We owe our survival as a nation\nto this principle, and we will continue to abide by it for as\nlong as it suits us.\nFor the past three years the Kingdom of Swaziland has\ngiven its support to efforts by the Republic of China on\nTaiwan to have its case presented to the General Assembly.\nAs the world concentrates its attention on the great social\nchallenges facing us all today, we must surely acknowledge\nthe need to engage all peoples of the world in a truly global\neffort to overcome them. Indeed, the Charter speaks of the\nrequirement for universality in our Organization so that all\nmay feel represented here.\nThe 23 million people of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan believe they can contribute significantly to this\neffort and have already shown that they are willing to do\nso in many areas of expertise, including poverty\nalleviation, private enterprise development and\nhumanitarian assistance. Many countries have\nacknowledged this will on the part of the Government and\nthe people of the Republic of China on Taiwan, and the\nrecent political developments in Taiwan have encouraged\nmany others to support our call.\nWe are positive that a lasting solution can be found\nto resolve this question. Hence, we support the idea of the\nGeneral Assembly establishing an ad hoc committee to\naddress the question of the readmittance of the Republic\nof China on Taiwan into the United Nations.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland continues to place its\nconfidence in the United Nations and in the principles on\nwhich it was founded. We remain deeply grateful for the\nassistance we have received over the years from its\nagencies, and we look forward to many more years of\ncooperation and support.\nFor 51 years, and despite the many obstacles in its\npath, the United Nations has presented to successive\ngenerations the only chance for a united, global approach\nto the world\u2019s problems. We are reassured by the\ninitiatives for reform in the Organization and look\nforward to a new dynamism and efficiency in its\noperations.\nI am charged by His Majesty King Mswati III, by\nHer Majesty the Indlovukazi, the Queen Mother, and by\nthe Government and the people of the Kingdom of\nSwaziland, with proclaiming the renewal of our\ncommitment to the founding Charter of the Organization.\nWe ask for Almighty God\u2019s blessing on its leaders and\nthose who work here, to give them the wisdom and\ndirection they need to carry out their vital tasks on behalf\nof all humankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn common with the speakers preceding me, I\nshould like to congratulate you upon your election to the\npresidency of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly. We see it not only as a recognition of your\npersonal qualities, but also, and above all, the consecration\nof the distinguished part played by your country in the\ninternational arena. Through your person, the honour that\nderives from your election is shared with the member\ncountries of the Non-Aligned Movement, which gives us\nparticular pride. I would like to assure you of the complete\ncooperation and full support of the delegation of\nMadagascar, which it is my privilege to lead.\nMy congratulations also go to the other members of\nthe General Committee, to whom we wish every success in\ntheir work.\nLastly, I would like to take this opportunity to express\nto your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do\nAmaral, our warm gratitude for all the efforts that he made\nduring his term as President of the Assembly at its fiftieth\nsession. I would like to assure him that we followed\nclosely and with interest the activities and contacts which\nhe undertook on behalf of our Organization and in order\nto further its objectives.\nThe disappearance of the political and ideological\ndivisions arising from the cold war gave birth to hopes\nfor greater international security, stability, peace and\nprosperity, so that the international community could\nhenceforth focus its efforts on the establishment of a just,\nequitable and truly multilateral and non-discriminatory\ninternational order, and on the strengthening of\ncooperation for international development. These hopes,\nhowever, not been fulfilled. A feeling of anxiety prevails\nin the face of the imbalances, insecurity, tensions and\ncontradictions clouding the prospects for peace and\neconomic development. The forces of conflict have grown\nto dangerous proportions as they have spilled over\nfrontiers, and have assumed various forms such as\nterrorism, separatism, fundamentalism, intolerance and\nxenophobia.\nSimilarly, the interdependent world economy\ncontinues to be dominated by uncertainty, imbalances and\nrecession. Negative economic growth rates, persistent\nimbalances in the commercial and financial fields,\nincreased transitional or structural unemployment, and an\nabsence of coordination in exchange rates and trade\npolicies \u2014 these are some of the problems connected\nwith the system of the developed world which have an\nadverse impact on the developing countries. For in fact\nthe resources allocated to cooperation for development\n\n\nhave fallen, on the pretext that up to now this has achieved\nnothing for the beneficiary countries, including our\ncountries in Africa, whose priorities, at both national and\ncontinental level, have been to relieve absolute, endemic\npoverty, to eradicate hunger and malnutrition, to overcome\ndisease and illiteracy, and to meet the needs for housing\nand sanitation.\nIn this connection, just as we welcomed Habitat II last\nJune in Istanbul, we commend the initiative of the Director-\nGeneral of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\nUnited Nations (FAO) to convene the World Food Summit\nnext November in Rome, to sensitize international opinion\nto the problem of hunger in the world, thereby reviving\ninterest in the subject that has apparently waned.\nThus it is clear that the world today is confronted with\nurgent social and economic problems which, at the national,\nregional and international levels, require efforts and the\nimplementation of policies and measures that can provide\nurgent solutions. The future of world trade, financial and\nmonetary regimes, economic growth and social\ndevelopment, as well as human rights, the environment and\npopulation in relation to development, are vital issues that\ninextricably link the fate and destiny of all countries.\nIt is therefore comforting to recall the solemn\ncommitment made by the international community on the\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\non the night of 24 October 1995, to mobilize in the quest\nfor peace, security, development and stability. In order to\nattain these objectives and successfully discharge the\nfunctions assigned to it in the Charter, the United Nations\nneeds to be reformed in order to adjust to a world in\nconstant change.\nWith respect to the increase in the membership of the\nSecurity Council, the principle is accepted in general, if for\nno other reason than to respond to the increase in the\nnumber of United Nations Member States. The proposals\nput forward in this context are as interesting as they are\nvaried, each invoking praiseworthy objectives, depending on\none\u2019s viewpoint. Thus the Italian proposal, drawing on the\nprinciple established in Article 23 of the Charter, highlights\nthe need to favour the geographical regions that are\ncurrently under-represented. This comes close to the\nconcern of countries such as Madagascar, which wholly\nsubscribes to the decision taken by the African summit in\nJuly 1996, namely that the Security Council must become\nmore representative in nature and reflect the composition of\nthe Organization in a new international system, so as to\ncorrect the geographical imbalance that now characterizes\nit and make it a genuine organ for the execution of the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s resolutions.\nThe African position gives priority for the time\nbeing to an increase in the number of members. both\npermanent and non-permanent. This restructuring of the\nSecurity Council should allocate two new permanent seats\nto Africa, three to Asia, two to Latin America and the\nCaribbean, and one to the European and other States.\nWith respect to the post of Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, Madagascar associates itself with the\nchorus of all African countries, through the Declaration of\nYaound\u00e9, which reaffirmed Africa\u2019s right to a second\nterm in the Secretary-General\u2019s post, as has been the\npractice since the creation of the Organization.\nAccordingly, Madagascar supports the re-election of\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, one of whose main objectives\nhas been to identify and elaborate concrete proposals for\nthe recovery and development of Africa so as to make the\nUnited Nations system\u2019s support to the continent as\neffective as possible. In that context, the support of the\ninternational community as a whole is a must.\nWe take note of the progress achieved in resolving\nthe debt problem and in the implementation of the Naples\nterms, as well as the recommendations made by the\nGroup of Seven summit convened in Lyon in June 1996.\nThe developing countries, particularly in Africa, certainly\nneed substantial international support, but it is above all\nthe responsibility of our leaders and peoples to make the\nnecessary changes to create a suitable sociopolitical\nclimate for development on a large scale. Thus we have\nno choice but to continue to work, by ourselves to begin\nwith, to achieve collective self-reliance at the national,\nregional and continental levels. For its part, Madagascar,\nwhich has just completed its economic policy framework\ndocument, hopes in the near future to benefit from\nadditional measures from its creditors going beyond the\nNaples terms to give a fresh impetus to its development.\nIndeed, in today\u2019s world of multidimensional\ninterdependence, any failure in development can only\nharm us all, rich and poor alike, since poverty is defined\nin terms of collective responsibility and the rights of\nevery individual.\nIn the field of human rights, efforts must be stepped\nup to translate into real action the 1992 Declaration on\nthe Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic,\nReligious and Linguistic Minorities, adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly.\n2\n\n\nWith respect to the challenges arising in the Middle\nEast, Bosnia and Northern Ireland, we note that we are\nadvancing in the right direction. Madagascar is attentively\nfollowing the recent phases, particularly as regards the\npeace process between Israel and the Palestinians.\nMoreover, like all peoples of the world, we reaffirm our\nwish to see the peaceful reunification of Korea.\nIn the face of the situation obtaining in the Western\nSahara after the Security Council\u2019s decision of May 1996,\nMadagascar remains concerned.\nThe frequent setbacks experienced by the conventional\napproach to peacekeeping should persuade us to persevere\nin our efforts to prevent conflict and give subregional\nstructures responsibility for the maintenance of peace, as\nadvocated in the United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s\nAgenda for Peace, and as applied by the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\nManagement and Resolution.\nAgainst this background, the General Assembly should\nbe given appropriate powers to have access to mechanisms\nfor the peaceful settlement of conflicts. The mechanisms for\nthe peaceful settlement of conflicts should be strengthened\nin the light of the provisions advocated in the Agenda for\nPeace. When peace is restored, the role of United Nations\nforces as a buffer in international, civil or ethnic conflicts\nshould also be strengthened. Madagascar intends to\nparticipate concretely in peacekeeping operations. Regional\nstructures for conflict resolution, such as those that exist\nwithin the United Nations, the Organization of African\nUnity and the Non-Aligned Movement, should again be\nstrengthened.\nFor us, the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\nManagement and Resolution has proved its usefulness in\nAfrica in a number of cases, inter alia, through the\nintervention of regional units of the Economic Community\nof West African States (ECOWAS) and the Inter-\nGovernmental Authority on Drought and Development\n(IGADD), which have operated respectively in sub-Saharan\nAfrica and in the Sahel. Madagascar fully subscribes to this\napproach, as is borne out by its direct involvement in the\nmediation process for the settlement of the Comorian\nconflict in 1995.\nThe signing of the Pelindaba Text of the African\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty this year attests to the\nwillingness of the African countries to banish all nuclear\nweapons from their soil. Madagascar, faithful to its\nprinciples, is now initiating the procedure for accession to\nthis Treaty. It is in this connection that Madagascar has\njust signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nSimilarly, my country also considers that the extension of\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) is an initial response to the major challenges of our\ntime in the area of nuclear proliferation and arms\nlimitation.\nIn the environmental sphere, after the legitimate\nconcerns expressed by Heads of State and Government at\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, energetic\nmeasures must be taken through a common commitment\nby all countries. There is no need to demonstrate that\nenvironmental problems know neither political nor natural\nboundaries. Nevertheless, at the domestic level, it must be\nemphasized that people are not always sensitive to the\nalmost irreconcilable concepts of conservation and\nprotection and meeting basic needs (heating, fuel,\nfisheries resources, etc.).\nIt is in the light of these considerations that\nMadagascar has opted for a gradual approach regarding\nits accession to international environmental conventions.\nThus the country has set up a basic framework for\nenvironmental policy, termed the Environmental Charter.\nIt has drawn up an environmental programme in three\nstages phased over a 15-year period; negotiations for\nmulti-donor financing of this programme have just been\ncompleted in September in Paris.\nWith respect to international conventions,\nMadagascar has ratified the main Conventions, including\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity, the United\nNations International Convention to Combat\nDesertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious\nDrought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa, the\nVienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer,\nand the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the\nOzone Layer. As it implements these various\nConventions, Madagascar wishes to enlist the\nparticipatory involvement of its people, and thus apply the\nprinciple of \u201cThink globally \u2014 act locally\u201d.\nLastly, one year after the Beijing Conference and\none year after the Copenhagen summit, I would not wish\nto conclude without recalling Madagascar\u2019s efforts in the\nsocial sphere, as demonstrated by the permanent\nstructures within successive Governments for the benefit\nof women, children and social problems in general.\n3\n\n\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, Madagascar,\nlike all nations on earth, aspires to a world of peace and\nprogress in which the scourges of war, poverty and\ndestruction will be banished forever. The United Nations is\nthe ideal place to build such a world, provided that all\npeoples and all leaders have the necessary political will and\ntransform into reality all the promises made. That is the\nMalagasy delegation\u2019s ardent hope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by congratulating\nMr. Razali Ismail on his assumption of the office of\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session.\nI am confident that his valuable guidance will lead to the\nsuccessful outcome of this session. He has the assurance of\nour full support.\nAs an introduction, let me recall that this September\nmarks the fifth anniversary of Estonia\u2019s return to the\ninternational scene. It was five years ago that the Estonian\nblue, black and white tricolour was hoisted in front of this\nforum. That moment was equal in historic and emotional\nsignificance to the one 70 years earlier, in September 1921\nin Geneva, when Estonia was welcomed as a new member\nof the League of Nations \u2014 an international organization\nwhose history has taught the world many lessons.\nThe cold war is over. Nevertheless, the international\ncommunity continues to seek further guarantees of a more\nsecure future for our children and grandchildren. In this\nrespect, Estonia would like to express satisfaction at the\nrecent overwhelming support for the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty adopted by the General Assembly.\nThe signing ceremony at the United Nations on 24\nSeptember was an important milestone, a result of\ncontinued negotiations and at the same time a sign of hope\nfor the future. We firmly believe that the Treaty can make\nan important contribution to preventing the proliferation of\nnuclear weapons and promoting international security. The\nUnited Nations must now give a clear response to people\nwho want to live in a world free of any threats of nuclear\nweapons and other means of mass destruction.\nOur world is facing new challenges. These new\nchallenges require a renewed United Nations. At the last\nsession, considerable efforts were made to reform the\nOrganization. This work will continue during the current\nsession. In fact, one of the principal goals of the session\nahead of us will be to increase the effectiveness of the\nUnited Nations. Estonia welcomes the progress made in this\narea. There are still a number of ways by which the United\nNations can further improve its performance. We attach\nparticular importance to the review of the working methods\nof the functional commissions and expert groups and bodies\nof the Economic and Social Council, as well as to better\ncoordination between the work of the Second and Third\nCommittees.\nEstonia is looking forward to active participation in\nUnited Nations-reform working groups. We attach\nspecific importance to the financial reform of the\nOrganization. Estonia is supportive of the view that the\nUnited Nations should be put on a sounder financial\nfooting. Member States should make every effort to fulfil\ntheir obligation to pay their arrears without any\nconditions. At the same time, we share the understanding\nthat the United Nations scale of assessments should be\nrevised. The new scale of assessments must be fair and\nmore transparent. It should also better reflect the\nfundamental principle of capacity to pay. We hope that\nthe High-level Open-ended Working Group on the\nFinancial Situation of the United Nations will achieve a\ncomprehensive and consensus solution to the current\nfinancial difficulties of the Organization.\nThe reform of the Organization will also include\nchanges in the composition and working methods of the\nSecurity Council. We welcome the decision by the\nGeneral Assembly mandating the relevant Open-ended\nWorking Group to submit a report to the General\nAssembly at its fifty-first session. At the same time, we\nhope that, along the lines of the mandate of the Working\nGroup, Member States can bring about a resolution to the\nlong-standing discussions on Security Council\nenlargement.\nPeacekeeping continues to be one of the important\nactivities of the Organization. Recent years have seen a\nchanging role for United Nations peacekeeping missions.\nToday they have grown into manifold and diversified\ntypes of action. A new challenge for United Nations\npeacekeepers is dealing with internal conflicts throughout\nthe world. In this respect, I would like to reiterate that\nregional peacekeeping efforts that are conducted under the\nauspices of the United Nations must remain under\nstringent United Nations control.\nEstonia is continuing to take part in United Nations\npeacekeeping. This autumn we will increase our\ncontribution to the United Nations peacekeeping forces by\noffering a company to the United Nations Interim Force\nin Lebanon (UNIFIL). The company will be deployed in\nthe Norwegian battalion. The deployment is part of a joint\nproject to develop a Baltic peacekeeping battalion. That\nbattalion will be the contribution of the Baltic States to\nthe strengthening of United Nations peacekeeping\ncapacities. I would like to take this opportunity to thank\nall of the Governments that have contributed to this\ncommon Baltic project.\n23\n\n\nDuring the past year Estonia has taken further steps\ntowards the implementation and follow-up of the major\nUnited Nations Conferences \u2014 Rio, Vienna, Cairo,\nCopenhagen, Beijing and Istanbul. To this end, a special\ninter-ministerial commission has been established in\nEstonia. Since the critical areas of concern of many of the\nconferences overlap, we are also looking forward to a better\ncoordination of their outcomes.\nLast year important work was done by the Preparatory\nCommittee on the Establishment of an International\nCriminal Court in elaborating the text of a statute for such\na court. We welcome that work and look forward to further\nprogress during the fifty-first session.\nFailure to respect human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms is a major cause of conflict. Many intra-State\nconflicts arise from the denial of basic human rights. The\nVienna World Conference on Human Rights made it clear\nthat the promotion and protection of all human rights is a\nduty for all States. Estonia reaffirms its continued\ncommitment to human rights. In spite of the hardships of\ninstitutional and economic transition, we have been able to\nmake democracy a way of life. Human rights for all\nresidents of Estonia is an inextricable part of Estonian\ndemocracy.\nWe continue to place particular importance upon the\nwork of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr.\nJos\u00e9 Ayala Lasso, the Centre for Human Rights and United\nNations human rights machinery in general. A transparent\nfunctioning of this machinery should rely on impartial\nreporting and disregard politically motivated allegations.\nFailure to do so would seriously damage the credibility of\nthe Organization. Owing to very recent memories, this\nissue is of special importance to Estonia. This is also one\nof the reasons why Estonia lists among its priorities issues\nregarding indigenous peoples and human rights.\nEstonia believes that it is essential to secure\nadequate financing for the office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for\nHuman Rights. At the same time, we would like to point\nout that various regional organizations that focus on\nhuman rights issue periodic reports regarding such\nmatters. In order to avoid duplication and to make\neffective use of resources, the United Nations human\nrights machinery should rely on the extensive expertise of\nregional organizations, including the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the\nCouncil of Europe. Those two organizations foster the\nbasic foundations of security and stability in Europe. The\nUnited Nations should further enhance its ties with them,\nespecially with the Council of Europe, the established\nstronghold of human rights on the European continent and\na symbol of cooperation between nations striving for an\nopen and mutually beneficial dialogue. Estonia, the\ncurrent Chairman of the Council of Europe, is pursuing\npolicies of positive engagement in relations with all\ncountries, including our eastern neighbour. In this respect,\nit is our sincere hope that the Russian Federation will\nreciprocate our efforts.\nIn conclusion, let me underline our commitment to\ncontribute, together with all Member States, to the\nestablishment of a world community in which individuals\nand States may live in peace and understanding. Let me\nexpress our sincere hope for a better world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe agenda of the General Assembly at\nthe current session reflects all the complexity of the stage\nmankind is now going through, the essence of which is\nthe transition from bloc confrontation to multipolarity,\neconomic interdependence and the democratization of\ninternational relations.\nI would like to emphasize that during the past year\nRussia made its contribution to the consolidation of this\nvery trend. At the domestic level, this means an\nuncompromising continuation of the process of reforming\nsociety. The results of the recent presidential elections in\nour country have convincingly proved that Russia has\ndecisively embarked on the road to the future. The\nmajority of Russians voted for the continuation of\neconomic reform, for a State of law and for a policy of\nopenness and cooperation.\nIn our relations with the other Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS) countries, we resolutely oppose\nboth the idea of restoring the Soviet Union, an idea based\non the denial of the sovereignty of the Commonwealth\nStates, and narrow-minded national isolationism. We\nstand for the voluntary integration and unification of the\n13\n\n\nmembers of the Commonwealth and hold that it should not\nbe isolated from the rest of the world. We wish to ensure,\nand we shall ensure, that the CIS will become an important\ncentre of world economic development and international\nstability.\nOn a wider international plane, Russia is pursuing a\npolicy aimed at establishing a new world order firmly based\non the equality of all States, justice and universal security.\nHowever, the establishment of such a world order is a slow\nprocess, influenced by both objective and subjective factors.\nIt is only natural that the end of the cold war provided a\nstarting point for the transition to achieving a stable and\npredictable peace at the global level.\nBut zones of regional conflict have expanded\ndrastically. The upsurge of terrorism has caused universal\nshock, and the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction is emerging. The rejection of ideological,\nmilitary-force confrontation, brought about by the end of\nthe cold war, clearly proved insufficient to neutralize all\nthese dangers and risks.\nLet us confess, at least to ourselves, that we will not\nsucceed here unless, first and foremost, we overcome the\ninertia of the political mentality. Unfortunately, the\nstereotypes that took root in the minds of several\ngenerations of statesmen during the 40 years of the cold\nwar have not yet disappeared along with the dismantling of\nstrategic missiles and the destruction of thousands of tanks.\nIn this connection, I would like to single out three\nconditions for the transformation of international relations\nduring the post-cold-war period.\nFirst, we should see to it that the old fronts of bloc\nconfrontation are not replaced with new lines of division.\nThat is precisely why we accept neither the idea of the\nexpansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO) military infrastructure to the area of the now\ndefunct Warsaw Treaty nor the efforts to make that alliance\nthe axis of a new European system. The enormous\npossibilities for economic cooperation and the spiritual\nenrichment of all the peoples of the continent can be\nrealized only through the creation of a genuinely\nall-European system of international relations. The\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) Lisbon summit must be an important stage in the\nconstruction of such a Europe.\nIt is important to stress in general that the logic of a\nmultipolar world in the twenty-first century should differ\nqualitatively from the schemes outlined by Metternich and\nBismarck. The way towards the establishment of a system\nof comprehensive security is through learning the skills of\nequal partnership between the various \u201cpoles\u201d, rather than\nthrough the revival of reflexes of rivalry and of balance\nof power.\nThe threat of new lines of division is appearing not\nonly in Europe, but elsewhere. The understandable\nintolerance of the extremism of certain Islamic groups and\nfactions must not develop into a categorization of the\nMuslim world at large as an enemy of modern\ncivilization. This is probably one of the pressing\nrequirements of our day.\nRussia advocates resolute opposition to extremist and\nterrorist forces. They are especially dangerous when they\nenjoy State support, and no effort should be spared to\nprevent any State from rendering such support. This\ncannot be justified. I believe it is time a universal\nconvention, covering all States without exception, were\nelaborated within the United Nations, denying political\nasylum anywhere to persons engaged in terrorist\nactivities. However, no sanctions should be used as a\nmeans to punish peoples or as an instrument to overthrow\nGovernments. It is far more effective to offer prospects\nfor a better future to those who renounce extremism and\naccept the norms of conduct by the world community.\nThe second condition for achieving a durable peace\nis the emancipation from a mentality based on concepts\nof leaders and followers. Such a mentality is fuelled by\nillusions that some countries emerged from the cold war\nas victors, and others as the vanquished. But this is not\nthe case. Peoples on both sides of the Iron Curtain jointly\nstrove to rid themselves of the policy of confrontation.\nMeanwhile, the mentality based on leaders and followers\npaves the way directly towards the establishment of a\nunipolar world. Such a world-order model is unacceptable\ntoday to the overwhelming majority of the international\ncommunity.\nFinally, the third condition for the successful\nmovement towards stable peace lies in the coordinated\nactivities of the international community. Today, one of\nthe most important tasks is the settlement of regional and\nlocal conflicts. In this regard, significant progress has\nbeen achieved recently. Peace agreements are being\nimplemented in Bosnia. Initial important agreements have\nbeen achieved for a durable peace in the Middle East. We\nhave managed to secure ceasefires in Transdniester,\nAbkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorny Karabakh. The\nsituation has improved somewhat in the conflict zones on\n14\n\n\nthe African continent and in Latin America. But as yet no\nbreakthrough to a durable peace has been achieved in any\nof these hotbeds of tension.\nThe future of the Middle East is a cause for grave\nconcern. Russia \u2014 one of the sponsors of the peace\nprocess \u2014 cannot accept the sacrifice to tactical\nconsiderations and internal political manoeuvres of the first\nfruits of the peace negotiations, which were won at such a\ngreat cost. The implementation of the Agreements reached\nis the only realistic basis for maintaining the peace process.\nThe only possible way forward is to advance through\nnegotiation on the basis of the principle of \u201cland for peace\u201d,\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as\nwell as resolution 425 (1978), which deals with Lebanon.\nIt should be clear that the danger of reverting to\nconfrontation becomes greater as the artificial pause in the\npeace process continues. When negotiators are silent, lethal\nweapons begin to awake.\nWe appreciate the peacemaking efforts of the United\nStates of America, the European Union, France, Egypt and\nother members of the international community and we\nsupport an even closer partnership in peacemaking. That is\nthe most effective way to promote peace-building in the\nMiddle East.\nThe Bosnian settlement has entered a new and crucial\nstage since the elections of 14 September. The prospects for\na lasting peace have become greater, but the risk of slipping\ninto a new spiral of hostility and confrontation remains. I\ncall upon all the Bosnian parties to take full advantage of\nthe chance for peace created by the international\ncommunity. At the same time, the United Nations, the\nOSCE, members of the Contact Group and the High\nRepresentative should immediately take a just and balanced\napproach to resolving outstanding problems. Assistance for\nthe social and economic reconstruction of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina should be intensified considerably and\nconditions created for the return of refugees.\nThe time has also come to look beyond the horizon of\nthe Paris agreements. There would seem to be a need for a\nlarge-scale and prolonged civilian peacemaking operation in\nwhich the United Nations and its specialized agencies will\nplay an important role. The international military and police\npresence, to which Russia contributes, should remain a\nfactor in the peace process for a given period after\nDecember 1996.\nThe lifting of sanctions against the Federal Republic\nof Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the Bosnian\nSerbs is an indispensable condition for a successful peace\nin the former Yugoslavia. I hope that, in the near future,\na Yugoslav delegation will take its place in this Hall, as\nit has at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope.\nThe programme of disarmament, security and\nstability for the twenty-first century should become one of\nthe major axes of transition period strategy. The adoption\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is one\nhuge step in this direction. Russia has just signed the\nTreaty and we believe that it is of fundamental\nimportance for all countries with nuclear capability to\naccede to it. However, it should clearly be understood that\ntesting by any country of a nuclear explosive device\nbefore the Treaty enters into force will radically change\nthe international situation and greatly prejudice the Treaty\nitself, and may compel many countries to revise their\nattitude to it.\nI should like to draw the attention of the Treaty\u2019s\nopponents to the fact that it will not only contribute to the\npromotion of nuclear non-proliferation, but will\nobjectively stimulate a gradual transition to nuclear\ndisarmament on a multilateral basis. That is the purpose\nof President Yeltsin\u2019s proposal to conclude a treaty on\nnuclear security and stability with the participation of all\nthe nuclear Powers. We invite interested States to begin\nexchanging views on the issue. Our suggestion that\nnuclear arsenals be located only on the territories of the\nnuclear Powers in question remains current.\nThe strengthening of the non-proliferation regime for\nweapons of mass destruction depends directly upon\nreliable prevention of the illicit traffic in fissile materials.\nThe Moscow Summit of the Eight on Nuclear Safety and\nSecurity, convened as a result of a Russian initiative,\ncontributed significantly to a solution of this problem. I\ncall on all United Nations Member States to become\ninvolved in the implementation of the Moscow\nagreements.\nThe rights of an individual should occupy a central\nplace in any new concept of international security.\nStrengthening the international human-rights protection\nmechanism could ensure the observance of these rights.\nIts oversight and preventive functions should be\nconsolidated and made more practical. However,\nlegitimate efforts to ensure respect for human rights\ncannot serve political purposes. It is too delicate an area\nto be invaded by political speculation and objectives.\n15\n\n\nMy comments apply fully to the protection of the\nrights of national minorities. The relevance of this problem\nis evident in today\u2019s world. The complexity of the\nsituation \u2014 let us be frank \u2014 requires a link between the\nprotection of the rights of national minorities and\nobservance of the principle of the territorial integrity of\nStates. Russia is directing its policy at precisely such a link.\nMy comments also apply to the Baltic States. While\nrecognizing the sovereignty of those countries and their\nterritorial integrity, Russia cannot remain indifferent to the\ndiscriminatory practices pursued against the\nRussian-speaking populations in Estonia and Latvia. While\nacknowledging measures that have already been taken to\nimprove the situation, we believe that the United Nations\nand other international organizations should intensify and\nsystematize their work for the protection of the rights of\nnational minorities.\nHow do we implement this strategy for creating a new\nworld order? Despite the importance of bilateral relations\nand successful regional organizations, the United Nations\nremains the principal mechanism capable of ensuring the\ntransition from a bipolar and confrontational world to a\nmultipolar and democratic one. In such circumstances, the\nsignificance of the United Nations as a centre for\ncoordinating the actions of States is increasing. During the\nformation of a multipolar system, the United Nations is\ncalled upon to serve as a kind of safety net, minimizing the\ndestructive effects of the changes and directing them\ntowards democratic evolution.\nThe major task of the United Nations remains the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nFurthermore, the principal tools available to the\nOrganization must be political and diplomatic. I remind the\nAssembly of this fact because, during the past few years\nwithin the United Nations, a \u201csanctions syndrome\u201d has\nbegun to emerge: a desire to apply sanctions and other\ncoercive measures more broadly and actively, sometimes\nignoring existing political and diplomatic avenues. We are\nconvinced that the United Nations should take such\nmeasures only in exceptional cases, after all other means\nhave been genuinely exhausted.\nOn the whole, there is a need to modernize the United\nNations sanctions mechanisms. Today, for example, no\nspecific procedure is provided for lifting sanctions, and, as\nexperience has demonstrated, this is extremely important.\nThe humanitarian damage caused by sanctions and the\ndamage to third countries should be minimized.\nIt is extremely important to emphasize that the\nUnited Nations must be maintained as the sole\nOrganization that can authorize the use of force. Any\nactions of that nature taken in circumvention of the\nSecurity Council must be totally precluded.\nThe United Nations can and must work purposefully\ntowards establishing a new global legal framework. To\ngive impetus to such work Russia has proposed the\nholding in 1999 of a third peace conference. This idea\nalready has the support of a significant number of States.\nI believe that the time has come to discuss this initiative\nin a constructive and substantive manner.\nPast experience shows the need for new approaches\nby the United Nations to peacekeeping operations. We\ncan already discern a pyramid regulating the relations of\nthe United Nations with regional organizations. Without\nthe development of such relations the United Nations may\nnot be able to withstand the burden of peacemaking\nactions. I refer specifically to a pyramid, because it is of\nfundamental importance to do no harm to the Security\nCouncil, which bears the primary responsibility for the\nmaintenance of international peace.\nWe are counting on significantly more attention\nbeing paid by the United Nations to conflicts in the area\nof the Commonwealth of Independent States. So far, the\nmajor role in this respect has been played by Russia and\nits Commonwealth partners.\nIn view of present circumstances, Russia calls on the\nUnited Nations to address the Afghan conflict. In that\nmultinational and long-suffering country, a truly critical\nsituation has arisen, and we have to do everything\npossible to prevent the country from disintegrating. The\nAfghan tragedy, like the endless series of internal\nconflicts in Rwanda and Liberia, is the most convincing\nargument for the development of a United Nations policy\nof national reconciliation diplomacy.\nTo cope with all these tasks, the United Nations\nitself must be updated and adapted to these new\nconditions. Reform is long overdue, and it is not a single\nmeasure that is required but a process that encompasses\nthe entire United Nations system. Reform of the United\nNations requires clearly defined goals: first, that it carry\nout its activities in a timely manner; and secondly, that its\nstructure be optimized in order to enhance the\neffectiveness of the Organization.\n16\n\n\nA great deal has already been done to implement\nreform. The Secretary-General has made a considerable\ncontribution to these efforts, and Russia supports the\ncontinuation of this difficult and protracted effort.\nIt is a well-established tradition to conclude statements\nbefore this Assembly by saying that the current session\nmust play a special role in strengthening peace and that\npeoples are expecting us to make decisions. I am confident\nthat this session of the General Assembly will live up to the\nexpectations of Governments and the hopes of peoples: that\nall of us will take a new step in humankind\u2019s difficult\ntransition towards a world united in its diversity, a world\nthat is open to universal economic and spiritual\ndevelopment, a world that promises security and stability \u2014\na world in which States cooperate on an equal footing. Let\nus work together for the sake of this goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation offers its\nwarmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at what will certainly\nbe a crucial session. We have come to know you over the\nyears, and have never failed to admire and appreciate your\nrelentless activism, plain-speaking and valuable\ncontributions. We have no doubt that your unique\nexperience, coupled with your keen awareness of the issues\non which we will have to deliberate, augur well for a most\nproductive session.\nWe also wish to record our gratitude to Mr. Freitas do\nAmaral, the outgoing President, for his direction and\nfocused leadership during the historic fiftieth anniversary\nsession. Much of the pace and progress in United Nations\nreform efforts and activities this year are largely due to his\ncommitment to achieving a meaningful and balanced\noutcome on this difficult issue.\nWe would also like to commend the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the perseverance\nand dedication with which he has undertaken his duties.\nSaddled as it is with diminishing resources and increasing\nuncertainty regarding its role and mandate, the United\nNations is going through trying times. The Secretary-\nGeneral, however, has, against all odds, maintained the\ncontinuity and functioning of the Secretariat, tackling the\ndaily challenges facing mankind.\nMy delegation, in conformity with the decision and\nrecommendation of the League of Arab States and the\nOrganization of African Unity, supports the re-election\nbid of the Secretary-General for another term in order to\nenable him to accomplish the objectives of his mission.\nFifty years ago, with great energy, grand vision and\na considerable measure of optimism, the world embarked\nupon a high-minded journey to end the scourge of war,\neliminate poverty and create a world of freedom and\njustice for all. Much has been accomplished, and it cannot\nbe denied that humankind now has the power and\nresources to achieve the goals we set ourselves.\nYet too many dreams remain shattered, too much\npotential remains unfulfilled, and too many conflicts\nremain in too many parts of the globe. The United\nNations is bracing itself for more turbulent times ahead,\nwith bankruptcy on the horizon as it confronts the threat\nto either \u201creform or perish\u201d. Remarkably, there is a placid\nair of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d pervading this session of the\nGeneral Assembly \u2014 a dream state in which all is well\nand normal. Given the dire predicament threatening the\nexistence of this Organization, does this reveal a measure\nof resignation? Is this the beginning of the end of the\n\n\nenthusiastic hope for a new world order with which this\ndecade began? Does this explain why so many opportunities\nto address the pressing problems of our day have not been\nrealized? While politically the world might be in a state of\nflux and transition, economically, however, it has enjoyed\nan unprecedented level of output \u2014 enough for every man,\nwoman and child on this planet to enjoy a happy and secure\nlife.\nThe vast majority of the people of the world, however,\nhave received minimal benefit. The facts are foreboding.\nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\ninforms us that over the last decade income levels in some\n70 developing countries were lower than in the 1960s or\n1970s. The Administrator of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme tellingly reminds us that the\nbelief that the developing world is doing very much better\nis one of the great myths of the present. In fact, three fifths\nof the world\u2019s population live in poverty, millions are\nforced to migrate every year, and 15 per cent suffer from\nchronic hunger and malnutrition. All this is taking place\nwhile world food production and reserves are declining in\nthe face of population growth. As most of us realize, much\nof this stagnation is taking place in Africa.\nFor all the oft-cited reasons \u2014 historical, colonial or\ncontemporary \u2014 Africa has been lagging behind on the\nmarch to self-sustaining growth. Consequently, 50 per cent\nof its peoples live in poverty, with a quality of life that is\nnot expected to improve during this decade. While the\nincreasing flow of negative statistics on Africa tends to\nmask the substantial efforts for reform, pluralization and\nstructural adjustment that are taking place in many countries\non the continent, for most people the situation is life-\nthreatening.\nThere are, however, a few hopeful signs that the\nextent of Africa\u2019s predicament has begun to draw the\ncritical attention it needs from the international community.\nIn particular, the 10-year United Nations System-wide\nSpecial Initiative on Africa, launched in March by the\nSecretary-General, deserves a special mention. Although it\ndoes not represent new funding so much as the more\nefficient use of available resources, it should prove useful.\nTogether with this initiative, the formal endorsement\nlast week by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and\nthe World Bank, during their annual meeting in\nWashington, of a plan to substantially reduce the debt\nburden of the world\u2019s poorest and most heavily indebted\nnations, most of which are in Africa, is very encouraging.\nIf current economic reform measures are to have the\ndesired impact, debt relief is crucial, particularly in\nreversing Africa\u2019s increasing marginalization.\nBut problems of degradation, poverty and\nunderdevelopment are hardly unique to Africa; they are\nfound in every corner of the world, and must be seriously\naddressed if we are to rectify the frightening pace of\nglobal polarization, both within and between countries.\nAccording to the Administrator of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, we are creating a planet that,\nincreasingly, is not one world but two.\nFor all these reasons, the World Food Summit in\nRome next month, and the designation of the decade\n1997-2006 as the first United Nations Decade for the\nEradication of Poverty will provide the international\ncommunity with an opportunity to renew its commitment\nrealistically to face those twin scourges of humankind.\nThe conventional wisdom of today argues that the basic\nremedy for underdevelopment lies in embracing free and\nopen market economies, stimulated by private capital. To\nthis end, the bulk of the world is engaged in restructuring\nto fit this mould. But with the dramatic shrinkage of the\nresources needed for transitional development \u2014\nparticularly those for official development assistance \u2014\nself-sufficiency has become an almost impossible task.\nCompounding this dilemma, total private investment has\nquadrupled since 1990, but only in ways that bypass most\ndeveloping countries and fail to address their problems.\nThe world remains laden with conflicts. It has been\nsaid that as many as 25 complex emergencies now\nthreaten tens of millions of people worldwide every year,\nthat the convulsions are becoming larger, with wider\nrepercussions, and that this new generation of crises will\ncontinue until their underlying causes are properly\naddressed. Cold-war identities have lost relevance, and\nold identities and animosities have resurfaced. Many\nnation States have lost considerable cohesion and are\nbeing buffeted by external pressures and strains within.\nThe consequent void of economic and political instability\nhas provided an opening for many unscrupulous, self-\nproclaimed \u201cleaders\u201d who, hungry for power, are\nreigniting the myths, latent prejudices, hatreds and fears\nlying in the dark recesses of so many minds. Employing\nviolence, propaganda and intimidation, such as we have\nseen in Bosnia, Somalia, Cambodia and elsewhere, they\nhave successfully pitted peoples against peoples. The\npredictable result has been an explosion in the number of\narmed conflicts, accompanied by widespread devastation,\nboth human and physical, gross violations of human\nrights, and \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d. This is a situation\n2\n\n\nincreasingly in need of concerted international action and a\nstrong, focused and impartial United Nations.\nThe United Nations has, indeed, responded positively\nin many instances. Cambodia and Mozambique are cases in\npoint. Some crises, however, have proved intractable,\ninvariably because of the nature of mandates or the political\nwill of Member States, whose changing views and policies\nhave affected the prospects for early resolution. Had the\ninternational community acted with dispatch in crisis\nsituations, countless lives could have been saved and scarce\nresources conserved by forcing the belligerents to disarm\nunconditionally and to respect the rule of law.\nThe widespread and indiscriminate use of anti-\npersonnel mines in many conflict situations has been\nconsistently devastating. We therefore welcome the Security\nCouncil statement of 30 August 1996 indicating the high\npriority being given to demining. The effectiveness of\npeacekeeping will be greatly enhanced by making demining\nan integral part of it. Sadly, however, these commendable\nmeasures will continue to fall short of what is required\nunless the international community imposes a moratorium,\nif not a total ban, on the manufacture and deployment of\nsuch devices. In the same vein, we hope that the adoption\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty will provide\nan impetus to increased international cooperation, in\naddition to marking a first viable step towards the total\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction.\nThe problems, conflicts and challenges of development\nand international cooperation are growing in complexity.\nNot surprisingly, therefore, as so many have noted, the\nUnited Nations system needs to be renewed and enabled to\nrespond to these simultaneous challenges.\nOver the past two years, and particularly in the first\nhalf of this year, a number of High-level Open-ended\nWorking Groups of the General Assembly have extensively\nexplored and deliberated on issues of reform as they\nimpinge upon the financial situation, the enlargement,\ncomposition and transparency of the Security Council, and\nthe Secretariat and General Assembly. Considerable time,\nenergy and resources have been expended in these efforts.\nHowever, differences persist among nations, reflecting\ndivergent national policies, views and interests.\nAs might be expected, a proliferation of ideas and\npositions is emerging from individual countries, including,\nto name just a few, the United States, Italy, Belize and\nMalaysia, which have produced proposals and statements of\nposition. Regional groups, including those in Africa, and\nalliances and coalitions, including the Non-Aligned\nMovement, have their own positions. All of them are\njockeying for position so as to advance and strengthen\ntheir individual or collective interests. The stalemate over\nSecurity Council reform is far from over and remains the\ntoughest problem. The real stumbling block is the number\nand composition of the new permanent membership,\nwhich must include developing countries from all parts of\nthe world, including Africa, Asia and Latin America. We\nmust also recognize that constructive participation in the\nCouncil by many smaller States has demonstrated that the\npossession of large economies and large populations\ncannot be the exclusive criteria for permanent\nmembership.\nThe tense circumstances persisting in a number of\nStates in the Great Lakes region of Africa is a cause of\nconcern to my country. This is true of Rwanda, where\nbloated prisons, camps swollen with refugees and the\nslow pace of the judicial process are just a few of the\nproblems that continue to plague that country. The\nInternational Tribunal for Rwanda has begun to function,\nbut with limited manpower and financial resources. The\nTribunal must be seen to function effectively, as the\nmessage it sends is crucial to resolving the Rwandan\nproblem.\nIn neighbouring Burundi, the international\ncommunity remains haunted by the fear of a re-enactment\nof the horrors that took place in Rwanda over two years\nago, where tens of thousands were massacred. There has\nalready been a frightful human toll in Burundi since the\narmy murdered the first democratically elected President\nin 1993, marking the advent of instability and violence.\nShould the army \u2014 the de facto head of State and\nsupreme authority since 1993 \u2014 remain unprepared to\naccept the authority of a democratically elected civilian\ngovernment, we may have a recipe for uncontrolled\nbloodshed. That is the real problem confronting the\ninternational community in resolving the Burundi debacle.\nDjibouti fully supports the efforts of the countries in the\nregion in imposing sanctions, whose objective is to\ncompel the new regime in Bujumbura to restore\nconstitutional order and legality and to hand over power\nto a legitimately elected government.\nWith the explosion of violence in the territories\noccupied by Israel, we have witnessed an alarming\ndeterioration in prospects for peace in the Middle East.\nThe Israeli act of opening a tunnel under one of Islam\u2019s\nholiest shrines, the Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem,\nwas yet another example of disrespect for, as well as\n3\n\n\ndefiance of, international opinion. But more importantly, it\nwas yet another example of intransigent rule over East\nJerusalem.\nIt is difficult to deny that the ultimate Israeli aim is to\nchange the ground rules \u2014 in effect, unilaterally to redefine\nthe peace process, thereby rolling back the clock and\nreversing years of hard work, concessions, sacrifice and\ngood faith on the part of the previous Israeli Government,\nthe Palestinians, the Arabs, and the international\ncommunity. It is also disturbing that, while the world is\nwatching, Israel should decide openly to pursue a policy of\ncreating \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d in total disregard of the\nprinciples established in Oslo, the Washington peace\nagreement and United Nations resolutions, all of which\nemphasize the return of occupied land in exchange for\npeace. It is little wonder that the current talks between\nMr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat, which began last week in\nWashington, have neither produced nor resolved anything.\nWhat we see instead are Israeli promises or commitments\nto keep talking to the Palestinians. But there has been\nneither an action nor a promise to implement what had\nalready been agreed upon, or even to contemplate the start\nof final status negotiations.\nThe depth of Arab disillusionment is obvious. The\nhard line policies pursued by the new Government are\nsimply fuelling fires of hatred and violence. Djibouti hopes\nthat reason will prevail, and calls on key countries and\nregions to continue providing the necessary direction,\nleadership and reassurances for a return to previous\ncommitments. Having come so far and sacrificed so much,\nand with so much at stake, we must not allow the peace\nprocess to drift or wither away. In this context, we also\nwish to underscore the urgent call of the Arab Summit in\nCairo in June for Israel to resume the peace process within\nthe framework of the Madrid Conference, in accordance\nwith Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973)\nand 425 (1978).\nWe share the anxiety in the Gulf region about the state\nof the three islands of the United Arab Emirates that have\nbeen occupied by Iran, and we hope that this long-standing\nproblem will be resolved peacefully.\nSomalia continues to exist in a cycle of misery and\npolitical impasse, lacking structures, an economy, a stable\ncivil society or legitimate authority. More disturbing, there\nis neither peace nor war, and clashes continue unabated.\nMogadishu and its infamous warlords remain the maelstrom\nof Somalia. Despite almost five years of incessant fighting,\nthere are no signs of compromise or reconciliation. The lust\nfor power of a few has resulted in disaster for the whole\ncountry, whose condition is now a virtual replica of what\nit was in the nineteenth century. There is simply nowhere\nto lay the blame for Somalia\u2019s wretched state except on\nthe warlords and their inability to reason and reach\nagreement. This myopic vision of leadership seems\nunlikely to change until one faction prevails, and that may\ntake years. Meanwhile, the people suffer, and the world\nis watching. Somalia, we must conclude, remains a\nfestering tragedy, a piece of unfinished business for the\ninternational community, an international embarrassment,\nand a permanent problem. It will not go away simply\nbecause we refuse to address it, and it will certainly\ncontinue to be an indelible blemish on the Charter of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe sooner we consider the far-reaching implications\nof the situation of this failed State, which is absent from\nthis Hall, the better it will be for the Somali people and\nthe international community. Somalia is simply consumed\nby an interminable turmoil from which it cannot free\nitself. It needs help \u2014 our help.\nWith the holding of elections, the saga of Bosnia has\nreached a decisive juncture. The problem facing the\ninternational community is the attempts to obstruct the\nnormalization process through the use of violence and\nintimidation, which increase the pressure for secession.\nHowever, one issue that is creating tremendous frustration\nand confusion is the reluctance of the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) to apprehend the prime\nBosnian Serb war crime suspects \u2014 Karad\u017eic\u00b4 and\nMladic\u00b4 \u2014 who are accused of instigating, planning and\nordering the genocide and \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d in Bosnia.\nTo date, 74 arrest warrants have been issued for suspected\nwar criminals, but only eight people are in custody. This\nfact, perhaps, reflects a political decision; but it is a\nparadoxical one whose effects may be with us in Bosnia\nand beyond for a long time.\nIn conclusion, I wish to refer to an issue relating to\nmy own part of the world. Our corner of the globe, the\nHorn of Africa, seems to be passing through a period of\nrenewed optimism and revival. This must be sustained.\nWith the regional economy slowly but steadily recovering\nfrom the effects of past turmoil, the need for enhanced\ncooperation cannot be overemphasized. Djibouti is\numbilically linked to the pulse of its neighbours and\ncannot, therefore, be indifferent to their economic and\ntrade realities.\n4\n\n\nThe conflicts and civil strife that have plagued the\nHorn of Africa in the past two decades have had a\ndevastating effect on our economic and social life. This can\nbe readily observed in the unacceptable number of\ndisplaced persons and refugees in my small country, for\nwhom our continued commitment to care is proving to be\neconomically and socially overwhelming, if not disastrous.\nDjibouti\u2019s approach to regional affairs is based on\nmutual respect, moderation and cooperation. We believe\nthat all the countries in the Horn of Africa must together\nseek to resolve the common problems of poverty, conflict\nand underdevelopment, bilaterally and within the framework\nof the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and\nDevelopment (IGADD), whose revitalization is crucial.\nDjibouti is in the midst of economic restructuring and\ninstitutional reforms. Given the demobilization process that\nis now under way, we require generous assistance from the\ninternational donor community. Towards this end, we are\nplanning to organize a round table early next year, under\nthe aegis of the UNDP and the Bretton Woods institutions,\nto address these problems and the accumulated effects of\nregional instability. We have made a valiant effort, and we\nremain convinced that the donor community will, for its\npart, work with us in order to surmount our multiple\nchallenges and create a better future for our citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is with great pleasure that\nI extend my delegation\u2019s heartfelt congratulations to you,\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-first session. We are deeply gratified\nto see an eminent representative of a brotherly neighbouring\ncountry and fellow member of the Association of South-\nEast Asian Nations (ASEAN) preside over our sessions.\nYour election to this high office is also a well-deserved\nrecognition of your personal qualities and professional\naccomplishments, as well as of the role and stature of\nMalaysia in regional and global affairs.\nMay I also extend our felicitations to your\npredecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, for\nso ably presiding over the historic fiftieth session.\nLet me avail myself of this opportunity to pay tribute\nto Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his many\naccomplishments, his untiring efforts in the cause of peace\nand development and the sagacity with which he is steering\nthe Organization during these challenging times.\nDuring the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations last year, we noted a resurgence of\nhope and optimism in the international community as we\nreviewed the achievements of the world Organization, made\nin spite of the many constraints with which it has been\nsaddled. We renewed our determination to strengthen the\nUnited Nations and rededicated ourselves to the vision of\nworld peace that inspired its founding, as well as to the\nideals and principles enshrined in its Charter. That act of\nrededication was timely and necessary. For, since the\ndemise of the cold war, the world has been in the grip of\nmassive changes that have given rise to new challenges\nand contradictory trends in international relations. At the\nsame time, new vistas have emerged and a deepening\nsense of interdependence has prompted nations to devise\nmore realistic and more mutually beneficial patterns of\ncooperation.\nYet, while these developments have revived\nexpectations of a more peaceful and secure world, the\nacute reality is that our planet is still far from being a\npeaceful place. Violent conflicts continue to embroil many\nregions of the globe. Nation States and international\ninstitutions are frantically struggling to adjust to\ndrastically changed and changing political and economic\ncircumstances. Weapons of mass destruction still pose a\npotent threat of worldwide catastrophe. In view of all\nthese, it is no wonder that, after a momentary resurgence\nof hope, we are again being overtaken by a sense of\nfrustration and common vulnerability.\nThe primordial challenge of our time, therefore, is to\ndevise a more effective system of global governance in\norder to manage the demands and the vicissitudes of\nglobalization and interdependence. As emphasized in a\nstatement recently issued by 16 Heads of State or\nGovernment, including the President of Indonesia, nations\nshould rise from their immediate concerns, focus on their\ncommon long-term interests and break new ground.\nConstructive initiatives are needed, and multilateralism\nhas to be reasserted and strengthened.\nNot even global cooperation, however, can meet the\nneeds and expectations of people without a stronger\nUnited Nations to give coherence to such cooperation.\nWorld governance, therefore, in order to be effective and\nacceptable to all, must be fashioned with the United\nNations as its principal mechanism and source of\nlegitimacy. The revitalization of this international\ninstitution through a comprehensive process of\nrestructuring and democratization of its major organs and\nfunctions has therefore become imperative.\nIt is of pivotal importance that the General\nAssembly, the highest deliberative and decision-making\norgan within the United Nations system, should function\neffectively. Indeed, strengthening the role of the General\nAssembly is a basic premise of the current process of\nUnited Nations reform and revitalization.\n9\n\n\nJust as crucial is the reform of the Security Council so\nas to allow it to reflect contemporary realities and to\naccommodate the interests and concerns of developing\ncountries, which comprise the overwhelming majority of the\nOrganization. It is an anachronism and a gross anomaly that\nEurope is overrepresented, Asia underrepresented and\nAfrica and Latin America not represented at all on the\nCouncil\u2019s roster of permanent members. In our view, new\npermanent members should be chosen on the basis not only\nof equitable geographic representation, but also of such\ncriteria as political, economic and demographic weight,\ntheir capability and proven track record of contributing to\nthe promotion of peace, security and development, both\nregionally and globally, and their commitment to assuming\nresponsibilities inherent to permanent membership.\nThe Economic and Social Council is now being\nrevitalized so that it will have a more dynamic relationship\nwith the General Assembly and other United Nations\nbodies. Yet, regrettably, it is still unable effectively to fulfil\nits crucial role, notably in helping United Nations Members\nadjust to the complex demands of globalization. The\nreforms and adjustments that the Economic and Social\nCouncil is undergoing should be further strengthened to\nenhance its cooperation not only with other United Nations\nbodies but also with such important international agencies\nas the Bretton Woods institutions.\nAll these efforts to revitalize, reform and democratize\nthe United Nations, however, will come to naught if in the\nend the United Nations is paralysed by financial insolvency.\nIf the current financial plight of the United Nations\ncontinues \u2014 and it will continue as long as certain major\nMember States refuse to remit their legally-obligated\ncontributions \u2014 there is a real danger that peacekeeping\noperations will collapse and many endeavours to maintain\npeace and security will be compromised. The very\nfunctioning of the United Nations itself could be severely\nundermined and the purposes of the reform process\nseriously jeopardized. No organization can be reformed by\nstarving it. Ironically, the countries that are pressing the\nhardest for cutbacks and reforms have themselves refused\nto finance the new austerity budget. For more than five\ndecades the United Nations and related institutions have\nbeen engaged in an immense array of activities that touch\nevery aspect of people\u2019s lives all over the world. If those\nvital statistics, too, must be terminated because of the\nOrganization\u2019s insolvency, that would constitute an\nenormous human tragedy.\nNuclear arsenals of enormously destructive power\ncontinue to pose a threat to all life on Earth. We believe\nthat the time has come for the Conference on\nDisarmament to establish a special committee for\nnegotiations on a programme of nuclear disarmament and\nthe ultimate elimination of all nuclear weapons within a\ndefinite time-frame. In this regard, it is my hope that the\nrecent Advisory Opinion of the International Court of\nJustice on the illegality of the threat or use of nuclear\nweapons will serve as a catalyst towards this end.\nThe 10 countries of South-East Asia recently made\na substantive contribution to the cause of nuclear\ndisarmament. During the historic Bangkok summit of the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the\nseven ASEAN leaders, together with the leaders of Laos,\nCambodia and Myanmar, signed the Treaty on the South-\nEast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. ASEAN is now\nworking for the Treaty\u2019s early entry into force. We hope\nthat the nuclear Powers will soon endorse the Treaty by\nacceding to its Protocol. Thus, with the conclusion of\nTreaties for nuclear-weapon-free zones in South-East Asia\nand Africa, in addition to the Antarctic, Rarotonga and\nTlatelolco Treaties, a large segment of the southern\nhemisphere should become free of the nuclear menace. As\nfor chemical weapons, I am pleased to inform the General\nAssembly that Indonesia is now at the final stage of the\nprocess of ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention.\nAnother positive development was the signing a few\ndays ago of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT) after two and a half years of arduous negotiations\nin the Conference on Disarmament. Indeed, for the past\nthree decades, the international community unceasingly\nstressed the need for such a treaty in an endeavour to\nstem the horizontal and vertical proliferation of nuclear\nweapons. The Treaty outlaws nuclear-test explosions by\nall States in all environments for all time, ensures that the\nban is effective and verifiable and provides new ground\nfor the realization of the objectives set by the 1995\nReview and Extension Conference of the Parties to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nHaving become a reality through broad\ncompromises, however, the Treaty is still a far cry from\nthe CTBT long-envisioned by the international\ncommunity. It still allows the most sophisticated form of\nnuclear-weapon testing: simulation. In a strict sense,\ntherefore, it is not truly comprehensive, nor does it\ndirectly address the issue of nuclear disarmament. But it\ndoes limit the nuclear-arms race by making it more\ndifficult for countries to develop or improve their\narsenals. Moreover, humankind cannot afford to dispense\nwith the CTBT, imperfect as it may be. Our collective\n10\n\n\nexperience in the disarmament endeavour has been that, if\nwe pass over an existing opportunity in favour of a better\none that is yet to be, we suffer a costly delay and possibly\nan irretrievable setback. Having signed the Treaty on that\nbasis, Indonesia fervently hopes that it will eventually be\nsupported by the entire membership and thereby become an\neffective instrument to enable us to move towards the total\nelimination of nuclear weapons.\nFocal points of conflict still persist in many parts of\nthe globe. In the Middle East, the peace process is on the\nverge of collapse as a highly volatile and explosive\nsituation in the Israeli-occupied Arab territories threatens\nonce more to engulf the region in all-too-familiar violence\nand bloodshed, which we had hoped had become part of the\npast. Israel\u2019s provocative action of opening a new entrance\nto the tunnel along the Western Wall of the Al-Aqsa\nMosque has triggered a violent confrontation, resulting in\ndeath and injuries to scores of civilians. Further aggravating\nthe situation is the unprecedented armed clash between the\nIsraeli army and the Palestinian police. These are but the\nlatest manifestations of a rapid deterioration of the situation\ndue to Israel\u2019s reneging on its previous commitments and\nits blatant backtracking on its obligations under the 1993\nDeclaration of Principles and subsequent agreements.\nIsrael must be prevailed upon to honour the\nDeclaration of Principles and its subsequent agreements and\nto resume negotiations in earnest on the remaining issues\nand the final status of the occupied territories, including\nJerusalem. Once again, we emphasize that progress on the\nIsraeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese tracks of the\nnegotiations, attended by unconditional withdrawal of Israel\nfrom the Syrian Golan Heights and southern Lebanon,\nconstitutes a conditio sine qua non for comprehensive and\nlasting peace in the region.\nThe recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina, made\npossible by the cessation of hostilities as a result of the\nDayton and Paris peace Agreements, have brought the\ncountry nearer to reconciliation and paved the way for the\ncreation of durable national institutions.\nHowever, we are concerned that, especially in the\nSerb-held areas, the results of the election may lead to the\nlegitimizing of ethnic separation. It is therefore incumbent\nupon the international community to ensure the unity and\nterritorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a\nmulticultural, multi-ethnic and multireligious society. For\nthe peace Agreement to be implementable, obstructions to\nfreedom of movement must be removed and refugees\nallowed freely to return to their homes. Bosnian Serb\nleaders must yield their illicit control over segments of\nthe population and territory of the country. The parties to\nthe peace Agreement must ensure that those indicted by\nthe International Tribunal are brought to justice.\nIn the Gulf region, we have recently witnessed\nunilateral military action by extraregional Powers\ninterfering with the internal affairs of a Member State of\nthe United Nations. My delegation wishes to reiterate its\nfirm commitment to the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of States, in this case Iraq. Actions that are\ninconsistent with these basic norms and principles of\ninter-State relations, which are enshrined in the United\nNations Charter, are clearly unacceptable. I should also\nlike to seize this occasion to urge Iraq to comply fully\nwith all relevant Security Council resolutions.\nEarlier this month, almost a quarter of a century of\nconflict in the southern Philippines came to a peaceful\nend with the signing of a peace agreement between the\nGovernment of the Republic of the Philippines and the\nMoro National Liberation Front, with Indonesia serving\nas facilitator on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference Ministerial Committee of the Six. This\npositive development, which will bring peace and\nprosperity to the southern Philippines, also constitutes\nanother important step towards the realization of a\npolitically stable, socially cohesive and economically\nprogressive South-East Asia that is increasingly able to\ndeal with its own problems in its own way.\nWe are now living in an era of globalization and\ninterdependence, an era replete with challenges but also\nfull of promise. How it came about is no mystery. It had\nbeen creeping up on us for quite some time, the\nconsequence of rapid advances in science and technology,\nparticularly in communications and transport. The end of\nthe cold war and the dismantling of the barriers of bloc\npolitics and ideological contention unleashed the full force\nof globalization. Since then, global trade and production\nhave been boosted to new heights while goods, people\nand capital are moving from one country to another more\nfreely than ever. Globalization has thus raised the hopes\nof humankind with visions of a new world of\nopportunities and more equitable prosperity.\nThese hopes are not without foundation. In a global\neconomy that is gradually recovering from recession, the\ndeveloped countries, according to the 1996 Economic and\nSocial Survey, have shown average gross-national-product\ngrowth rates of two per cent. The developing countries\nhave registered a significant 6 per cent growth while the\n\n\n\neconomic dynamos of East and South-East Asia have been\ncredited with a stunning 8 per cent growth. These are the\ntrade-driven economies that have benefited most from\nglobalization.\nYet, the apprehensions about globalization are equally\njustified. In an external environment over which developing\ncountries have very little control, globalization could widen\nthe prosperity gap between the developed and the\ndeveloping countries. The fact that globalization can also\nlead to disaster was demonstrated not too long ago when\nthe global operations of financial markets led to instability\nand volatility that sent shock waves through the monetary\nsystems of developing countries. In their efforts to integrate\nthemselves into the global economy, many developing\ncountries have found it necessary to make structural\nadjustments that too often entail exorbitant social and\nhuman costs. Moreover, globalization has not mitigated and\nmay have, on the contrary, exacerbated the inequities and\nimbalances in international economic relations. Bereft of a\nfavourable external environment for their national\ndevelopment efforts, many developing countries continue to\nlanguish in poverty, backwardness, stagnation and even\nnegative economic growth. Every year, 13 to 18 million\npeople, mostly children in developing countries, die from\nhunger and poverty-related causes. Meanwhile, the\ndeveloping countries remain marginalized from the\ninternational decision-making processes that would fashion\nglobal solutions to the global economic problems that afflict\nthem.\nThe poignant experience of the past three and a half\ndecades teaches us that these problems cannot be solved\nthrough palliatives and piecemeal reforms. Since the major\nproblems of development are global in nature, they can\nonly be effectively dealt with through a new global\npartnership for development involving all countries, of both\nthe developed North and the developing South, on the basis\nof mutual interest and equitable sharing of benefits and\nresponsibility.\nIt has been more than two years since the successful\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\nnegotiations, but the promise of an equitable, transparent\nand rule-based multilateral trading system, as embodied in\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO), has yet to be\nrealized. Moreover, we are alarmed at the tendency of some\ndeveloped countries to resort to a new form of\nprotectionism in the guise of linking labour standards and\nother social and environmental concerns to trade. Such\nefforts will not only harm the developing countries, but will\nalso ultimately debilitate the WTO itself. We therefore call\nupon all trading partners to refrain from overloading the\nagenda of the first Ministerial Meeting of the WTO in\nSingapore this coming December with issues extraneous\nto trade. Let us together nurture the WTO as the guardian\nof a predictable, non-discriminatory multilateral trading\nsystem and the guarantor of the rights of the weaker\ntrading partner against unilateral and arbitrary actions by\nthe strong.\nIn this context, we share the concern expressed by\nthe international community at the practice of some\ncountries of promulgating national laws with\nextraterritorial application that adversely impact on the\nlegitimate interests of other countries. We cannot accept\nthe imposition of the law of the strong in place of\ndialogue and negotiation. No one country, no matter how\npowerful, should be allowed unilaterally to regulate the\nlives of other sovereign countries.\nThe biggest single deterrent to development in many\nof the world\u2019s poorest countries is the crushing effect of\ntheir debt burdens. Indonesia has long advocated a set of\nprinciples for managing the debt problem, calling for a\n\u201conce-and-for-all\u201d settlement of the debt problems of\ndeveloping countries, including multilateral debts, as well\nas the cancellation of the debts of the most severely\naffected, low-income developing countries. In this context,\nwe welcome and support the joint proposal of the World\nBank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which\noffers effective alternatives for reducing the overall debt\nburdens of heavily indebted poor countries to sustainable\nlevels. While this initiative could be further refined, it is\nIndonesia\u2019s fervent hope that, at the forthcoming meetings\nof the World Bank and the IMF, this proposal will finally\nreceive the support that it needs and deserves from the\ndeveloped countries. In this context, I am encouraged by\nthe developments at the IMF meetings in Washington\ntoday.\nSocial development and social justice remain elusive\ndreams for millions of impoverished people throughout\nthe world. Indonesia shares that dream and abides by the\ncommitments it assumed at the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment in Copenhagen and the Fourth World\nConference on Women in Beijing, both of which were\nheld last year. We have indeed dedicated ...\nWe have, indeed, dedicated ourselves to the\nproposition that people should not only be the\n12\n\n\nbeneficiaries of development but should also be given every\nopportunity to become the authors of their own\ndevelopment. At the same time we should address, through\nconcrete and concerted international action, the problem of\nthe global trade in illicit drugs and other forms of\ntransnational crime. Above all, we must continue to address\nthe problems of poverty and underdevelopment, and we\nmust commit ourselves fully to genuine partnership.\nThis century that is about to end will perhaps be\nremembered for both the cruelty of its wars and the\ntremendous achievements that it has seen in science and\ntechnology \u2014 although it is not for these achievements that\nwe should be proud of it. To my mind, what makes this\ncentury special is the fact that during this time the human\nrace truly began to nurture the idea that poverty is not an\ninevitable part of the human condition, but that it can be\nconquered and wiped off the face of the Earth. We have the\nnatural resources and the mental and organizational capacity\nto succeed at that task. The question has always been\nwhether we have the political will to do it, and whether we\nare concerned and enlightened enough to form an equitable\nglobal partnership for development \u2014 for a concerted\nstruggle against poverty that will give a deeper and brighter\nmeaning to globalization and interdependence. The answer,\nI believe, is largely in the hands of the General Assembly.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is my pleasure to\ncongratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\nsession, and to congratulate his friendly country,\nMalaysia, on his election to that high international post.\nWe are confident that his political experience and\ndiplomatic skill will lead to the success of this session\u2019s\ndeliberations. May I also extend our thanks to his\npredecessor for conducting the work of the fiftieth session\nof the General Assembly.\nOn this occasion, we should like to express our\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his efforts to\nenhance the role of the United Nations, and our concern\nthat his international standing, and his mandate under the\nCharter be respected. We also believe that the common\ninterest of Member States requires the support of his\ncandidature for a second term.\nWe live in a region which, because of the injustice,\noccupation and aggression it has witnessed for decades,\nhas had more than its share of victims of wars and\nviolence. It was impossible to envisage a solution to end\nsuch tragedies and to respond to the aspirations of the\npeoples of the region as long as the Arab-Israeli conflict\ncontinued to prevail in the absence of a just and\ncomprehensive peace.\nMany people do not know how many international\nendeavours were made, how many meetings were\nconvened, how many parties contributed, how many\nletters were sent and assurances given before agreement\nwas reached between the parties on the foundations and\nrules that made up the terms of reference of the Madrid\n8\n\n\nPeace Conference. It is now five years since the Madrid\nConference was convened and, in turn, bilateral negotiations\nset up. Those negotiations survived various periods of\ntension, interruption, set-back \u2014 and progress. They\ngenerated thousands of pages of records. Both Syria and\nIsrael agreed on Israel\u2019s withdrawal from the Golan back to\nthe boundary of 4 June 1967. Negotiations then proceeded\nto the other elements of peace \u2014 all under the supervision\nof the United States of America, and with its participation.\nNow, after all those international efforts, which were\nunprecedented in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, a\nnew Government has taken office in Israel. It has set itself\nthe opposite course to that of its predecessor, and has\ndeclared \u201cno\u201d three times: no to withdrawal from the\nGolan; no to withdrawal from occupied Palestinian lands;\nand no to a Palestinian State.\nTo anyone who has followed the declarations and\npractices of the Israeli Government since it assumed power,\nit is clear that it has not wasted a single opportunity to\nunderline its insistence on changing the foundations and\nrules of the peace process, to attempt to demolish all the\nachievements of the past five years and to call for a return\nto negotiations from square one, without preconditions \u2014\nin other words, without the Madrid terms of reference, in\naccordance with the \u201cpeace for peace\u201d formula, with the\nobjective of imposing its fait accompli on the Arabs.\nPresident Hafez Al-Assad has said:\n\u201cIf this is what the Israeli Prime Minister has in\nmind, why should Syria want peace? If peace does not\nreturn the land to its rightful owners, why should we\ncall for it? Can any thinking person in this world\nexpect Syria to establish peace with the Israeli\nGovernment while Syrian land remains in Israeli\nhands? That is why I say that if Netanyahu stays that\ncourse, I do not believe there is any window for a just\nand comprehensive peace in the region.\u201d\nOne of the dilemmas facing the Middle East peace\nprocess is that certain Israeli leaders are encouraging, rather\nthan discouraging, extremism in Israeli society. They are\nthe ones who add fuel to the fire whenever a better climate\nfor the achievement of peace begins to develop. There are\nmany examples of such an attitude, which we do not have\ntime to provide today. It is sufficient to recall that in the\naftermath of the Hebron massacre voices were raised\neverywhere, even in Israel itself, calling for the Jewish\nsettlers, who number less than 400, to move from the heart\nof Hebron, which is home to more than 120,000\nPalestinians. However, the Israeli Government refused to\nwithdraw from Hebron, portraying such a move as the\nultimate painful concession.\nThe bloody confrontations that broke out following\nthe opening of the tunnel that Israel dug under the wall of\nthe Al-Aqsa Mosque, as well as previous deliberate Israeli\nprovocations and the unjustified escalation of tensions\nagainst Syria and Lebanon over the past few weeks, all\nconfirm that the Israeli Government did not take office in\norder to resume peace negotiations on the basis of\ninternational legitimacy, the Madrid terms of reference\nand the \u201cland-for-peace\u201d formula, but rather in order to\nlaunch new negotiations with no terms of reference,\nentrenching a fait accompli.\nDuring his European tour, Prime Minister Netanyahu\nannounced that his decision to open the tunnel was\ndesigned merely to ease the movement of tourists and\nspare them a walk of a few dozen extra metres. Imagine\nhow guilty those tourists would feel if they believed that,\nin order to secure their comfort, the Israeli authorities\nkilled about 80 Palestinians, caused the deaths of 15\nIsraelis, and wounded more than a thousand people. They\nwould not, of course, believe it; we do not believe it \u2014\nand neither does the head of the Israeli Government, who\nrevealed his true expansionist intentions when he later\nclaimed that the tunnel had been there for two thousand\nyears, and arrogantly declared that it would remain open\nfor ever.\nPerhaps the huge number of innocent victims who\nfell in Jerusalem and in the towns of the West Bank and\nGaza have hastened the unmasking of such deceit. In this\nway the Israeli Government appears to public opinion as\nit truly is: neither desirous of a just peace nor keen to\npursue it. This was reflected in the statements made by\nmany Foreign Ministers in the Security Council, where\nIsrael appeared totally isolated, besieged on all sides by\nstatements deploring and denouncing its action, with the\nvoices that usually volunteer to defend it dying away.\nThe Israeli Government\u2019s fuelling of extremism did\nnot stop there. General Sharon, the Israeli Minister for\nInfrastructure, issued a decision last week allocating three\nnew sites on the occupied Syrian Golan for building 600\nhousing units. Perhaps a large segment of international\npublic opinion and some politicians are not aware that\nwithout the financial aid and huge governmental subsidies\ngiven to Jewish settlers, they would not settle in the\nGolan, especially as they are well aware that the Golan is\n9\n\n\nSyrian territory, which they will have to leave sooner or\nlater.\nGiven my comments, it might be concluded that the\nIsraeli Government has no strategy for peace but has, it\nseems, chosen the path of confrontation. The path of\nconfrontation, however, is very costly for several reasons.\nFirst, Israel can start a war whenever it chooses, but cannot\nend it when it chooses. Israel might wreak considerable\ndestruction here and there, but it can never destroy the will\nof a nation that has deep roots of civilization which spread\nall over the world. Many Israelis may be unaware that all\nthe wars they have fought between October 1973 and April\n1996 have gained them nothing except human and political\nlosses and further international condemnation.\nSecondly, the path of confrontation is very costly\nbecause the international community rejects war and\naggression and calls for the achievement of a just and\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. Israel knows that\nthe Arabs have opted for peace as their strategic option,\nincluding at the summit level. In taking this stand they have\nbeen supported by the summit of the States of the Non-\nAligned Movement, the summit of the European Union and\nthe summit of the Group of Seven industrial countries, all\nof which have stressed the need to adhere to the\nfoundations of the peace process, relevant Security Council\nresolutions and the \u201cland-for-peace\u201d formula, as well as\nrespect by the parties for the agreements and commitments\nreached so far.\nGiven these facts, it would be unacceptable if peace\nwere not also a strategic option for Israel \u2014 indeed, it\nwould be a real catastrophe. The achievement of a just and\ncomprehensive peace, to which the peoples of the region\nand the world aspire, requires Israel\u2019s withdrawal from all\noccupied Arab land, pursuant to Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\nSyria reaffirms its attachment to the unity of both the\nterritory and the people of Iraq. Syria rejects any attempt to\nviolate the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq\u2019s territory\nor to interfere in its internal affairs, including the attempt\nto establish a so-called security zone in northern Iraq. Syria\nalso calls for an end to the suffering of the brotherly Iraqi\npeople, and for a continuation of the implementation of\nSecurity Council resolutions, including a solution to the\nissue of Kuwaiti detainees.\nWith regard to the Lockerbie crisis, Syria expresses its\nconcern for the human and material harm that has been\ndone to the brotherly people of Libya as a result of the\ncontinuing coercive measures imposed on them by the\nSecurity Council. Syria reaffirms the statement made in\nthe final declaration on the issue of the recent Arab\nsummit, and calls for a response to the initiative\nsubmitted by the Arab League for solving this crisis.\nSyria hopes that the United Arab Emirates and the\nIslamic Republic of Iran can find a peaceful solution to\nthe crisis over the three islands in a way that will\npreserve good-neighbourly relations and contribute to the\nstrengthening of security and stability in the region.\nSyria expresses its support for the principles agreed\nupon by the Governments of Yemen and Eritrea for a\nsolution to their conflict through international arbitration.\nOur position flows from our desire for good-neighbourly\nrelations between them and our belief in the importance\nof re-establishing security and stability in the Red Sea\nregion.\nSyria also expresses its concern at the continuing\ndeterioration of the situation in Somalia and reiterates the\ncall of the Arab summit to the leaders of the Somali\nfactions to achieve national reconciliation and to work\ntowards the establishment of a national authority\nrepresenting our brothers, the Somali people, as a whole.\nWith regard to Korea, Syria expresses its support for\nmeasures that would guarantee peace and stability in the\nKorean peninsula and for the aspirations of the Korean\npeople to reunification.\nThe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nfounding of the United Nations provided an important\nopportunity for us to forge a common vision of the future\nof international relations. On that occasion, we said that\nthe crisis facing the United Nations does not arise from\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter, but rather from\nthe United Nations decision-making mechanism and the\nselective way in which decisions are implemented. We\nalso observed that the Organization\u2019s serious financial\ncrisis is, in fact, merely the reflection of a political crisis\nthat essentially revolves around the identity of the United\nNations and its role in the post-cold-war era.\nIn the light of those comments, the obvious question\nis: Will it be possible to introduce meaningful reforms\ninto the structure of the United Nations that are\nacceptable and satisfactory to Member States? That is the\ntrue challenge, requiring that we all strive to strengthen\ndialogue and international cooperation. This will ensure\n10\n\n\nthat reforms take place which fulfil, in substance and in\nform, the aspirations of Member States.\nToday, as we stand on the threshold of the next\ncentury, we are all faced with serious challenges that\nrequire us to create an environment that will allow future\ngenerations to live in peace, security and cooperation within\na system of international relations free from violence and\nconfrontation. That is the hope of our peoples. This is what\nwe must endeavour to achieve as we look forward to a\nbetter future, one both more just and more humane that will\nbenefit all mankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, Sir, allow me\nto join with earlier speakers in congratulating Mr. Razali\nIsmail on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-first session. His election is\nunquestionably a recognition of the role that his country\nhas been playing in advancing the ideals of our\nOrganization. It is also a great honour, and a personal\ntribute to his well-known experience as a diplomat. We\nwish him every success in his work during this session.\nWe are aware of the substantial number of topics for\ndiscussion during this session, and their subject matter.\nFirst, however, I wish to discharge the duty given me by\nthe President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, His\nExcellency Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, and convey to the\nrepresentatives of the friendly countries meeting here\ntoday his greetings and wishes for success in their work\nduring this session.\nA rapid review of our agenda reveals that many of\nthe issues go to the heart and central purposes of the\nUnited Nations. However, it is also true that most of them\nhave been the subject of broad-ranging and thorough\ndebate at many other sessions of the Assembly. To avoid\nrepetition, therefore, I shall briefly sum up my country\u2019s\nposition on these main issues.\nDuring the past 50 years the United Nations has\nconstantly worked to heighten the awareness of the\n12\n\n\ninternational community and the conscience of the world\nwith respect to international peace and stability, justice,\nequality and development throughout the world. We do not\nwish to sound pessimistic, but this session of the Assembly\nis taking place in a context of great uncertainty. Some are\neven questioning whether the United Nations still has the\nability to contribute to solving the problems that have arisen\non a daily basis in recent years. For this reason, the first\nproblem that we must face is whether what we have been\nbuilding over the past 50 years is valid when tackling these\nissues. For Equatorial Guinea, the answer is \u201cyes\u201d in\nprinciple. However, we must also acknowledge that the\nsystem we invented 50 years ago must be adapted to\ncurrent realities.\nApart from considering the various options for\nreforming the United Nations system, we must ask\nourselves seriously whether we are prepared to provide the\nOrganization with the legal machinery to make its important\ndecision-making bodies \u2014 the General Assembly and\nSecurity Council \u2014 more democratic. My country believes\nthat the credibility of the United Nations is at stake. We\nhave within our grasp an opportunity to make the United\nNations the centre for the global harmonization of our\nendeavours to achieve the common purposes articulated in\nthe Charter. When making decisions that affect all the\ncountries in our Organization, therefore, the necessary\nconsensus must prevail for us to find appropriate solutions.\nGiven this belief, I wish to make a modest contribution on\ncertain issues that we consider vital to the Organization.\nReform of the Security Council is an extremely\nimportant and complex issue, which calls for very careful\nthought. Equatorial Guinea is in favour of establishing\nmachinery to allow for broad consensus in the decisions\ntaken by that body. We therefore support the arguments of\nthose who believe that there is a need for an increase in the\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members of the\nSecurity Council.\nWe believe that, as others have said, exercise of the\nveto should evolve towards mechanisms that will make its\nuse more objective. The United Nations should also keep in\nmind the fact that the cooperation that will make\nsustainable economic development possible in the\ndeveloping countries is not just an option; it is an\nimperative, if we wish to eradicate the poverty and\ndestitution that breed violence and socio-political instability\nin many countries and regions of the world.\nPresent-day Equatorial Guinea has learnt the hard\nlesson of what it means to live in democracy and pluralism\nin a difficult socio-economic climate. Therefore, we\nbelieve that the preservation of peace and stability and the\nfostering of democracy are closely linked to the right of\nall the world\u2019s peoples to development.\nFor that reason, Equatorial Guinea is concerned\nabout the fate that the resolutions adopted at four\nimportant world summit meetings of recent years \u2014 the\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment at Rio de Janeiro, the World Summit for\nSocial Development at Copenhagen, the Fourth World\nConference on Women at Beijing and the World Summit\nfor Children at New York \u2014 can expect at the hands of\nthe international community. Are we once more going to\nfail to fulfil the hopes of our peoples, who had rejoiced\nto see the Organization take such salutary initiatives? The\ndebt problem remains unresolved, although timid steps\nhave recently been taken by the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund.\nWhere my country\u2019s domestic affairs are concerned,\nwe are building a participatory democracy founded on the\npeople, by the people and for the people. Thus, our\ndevelopment policy is concentrated on the welfare of our\ncitizens. Indeed, within that approach the Government of\nEquatorial Guinea is pursuing a programme to promote\nhuman rights, with the technical and financial assistance\nof the United Nations Centre for Human Rights. In this\nconnection, a number of courses and seminars are being\noffered for public order and security personnel as well as\nfor administrative and judicial authorities responsible for\nlaw and order.\nWe are daily and progressively enhancing the degree\nof democratization of State political structures at the rural\ncommunity, municipal, parliamentary and governmental\nlevels to facilitate transition.\nIn the economic sphere our efforts are directed to\nreforms that will be an impetus to sustainable\ndevelopment that can improve the standard of living of\nour population. Nevertheless, we must note here my\ncountry\u2019s concern at a trend in the international\ncommunity to erect barriers that hinder the efforts being\nmade by many developing countries to harness the\nresources needed for development.\nIn recent years, in fact, we have witnessed a\ncontradictory phenomenon: on the pretext of calling for\nthe restoration of unquestioned principles of democracy\nand respect for human rights, many developing peoples\nare being deprived of the resources that will enable them\n13\n\n\nto meet their basic needs. The donor community must, once\nand for all, learn to distinguish between the demands of\ncertain selfish political interests and the aspirations of\npeoples to freedom, democracy and development.\nIn the case of Equatorial Guinea, our aspirations to\nconsolidate a State based on the rule of law, democracy and\ndevelopment are held hostage to certain intransigent and\nradical political groups that are deliberately flooding the\ninternational community with disinformation that runs\ncounter to my country\u2019s present-day socio-political realities.\nFor a number of years now, either out of ignorance or\nbecause of vested interests, the donor community has\nwielded the weapon of economic blockade, which has made\nit impossible to establish democracy on a sure footing in a\nnumber of countries.\nHowever, we are pleased to inform the Assembly that\nour ideals of peace, republican order and healthy social\ncoexistence have enabled Equatorial Guinea today to attract\nworld interest. Foreign investment is increasing at a rapid\nrate, cooperation with friendly countries and international\neconomic institutions is growing and economic growth will\nexceed 7 per cent by the end of this year. We believe that\nultimately Equatorial Guinea will be able to lay the\nfoundation for the country\u2019s overall development in all\nareas.\nWe would therefore like to take this opportunity to\nappeal to the international community gathered here to\njudge Equatorial Guinea by what is actually happening\nthere, and thus to confirm the objective reality of our\nmovement towards progress and prosperity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to convey the congratulations of the\nGovernment and the people of Bolivia, President Razali\nIsmail, on your unanimous election, which is a token of the\nadmiration and esteem in which the peoples of the world\nhold Malaysia and constitutes just recognition of your\nmerits.\nMy delegation is grateful to the President of the\nAssembly at its previous session, Ambassador Diogo Freitas\ndo Amaral, for the remarkable job he did. For the\ndelegation of Bolivia, it was a distinct honour to serve as\nVice-President of the Assembly under his able guidance.\nI wish also to congratulate Secretary-General Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali and extend to him our most sincere\nappreciation for his valuable contributions to international\npeace and cooperation, as well as for his insightful and\nuntiring dedication to the cause of the United Nations.\nAllow me first to refer to some aspects of the far-\nreaching structural reform in my country.\nDomestically, since 1993, the Administration of\nPresident Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada has been\nsimultaneously transforming the State and the system of\nsocial participation, while also adapting the productive\nbase of society to enable Bolivia to dynamically meet the\ndemands inherent to the changes in contemporary\ninternational life.\nThe Government of Bolivia\u2019s current efforts are\nessentially based on the consolidation of participatory\ndemocratic institutions and on the conviction that\neconomic development must be compatible with care for\nnature and the environment \u2014 in other words, that this\nmust take place within the framework of sustainable\ndevelopment and of respect for ethnic and cultural\ndiversity, in order to make unity in diversity possible.\nMy Government\u2019s national plan confers the highest\npriority on the struggle against poverty. It strives\nvigorously to increase work opportunities and seeks a\nbetter quality of life for all Bolivians, aiming to enter the\ntwenty-first century with a modern, decentralized,\nparticipatory State. This perspective guides our policies of\ngrass-roots participation, educational reform, and\ncapitalization of major public enterprises.\nPart and parcel of this landscape of change are our\ninitiatives in support of children, women and the elderly.\nWe are working hard to reduce infant and maternal\nmortality, to improve levels of nutrition and to provide\nassistance to those who most urgently need it. These tasks\nare an essential aspect of our effort to improve the lot of\npoor families.\n\n\nMy country is proud of its pluri-cultural and\nmulti-ethnic character, and it is therefore taking important\ninitiatives for the advancement of indigenous peoples. The\nVice-President of the Republic, Victor Hugo C\u00e1rdenas, is\na distinguished representative of Bolivia\u2019s Aymar\u00e1 people.\nIn the international arena, we are actively pursuing\npeaceful coexistence among States and trying to make\ninternational justice a reality.\nOur position is based on the principles of equal rights\nof States, non-intervention in internal affairs,\nnon-recognition of territorial acquisitions by force, respect\nfor human rights and the other fundamental principles of\ninternational law.\nThe support we give to intergovernmental\norganizations, particularly the United Nations and the\nOrganization of American States (OAS), reflects our\nconfidence in the potential of multilateral cooperation in a\nworld that is growing ever more complex and\ninterdependent.\nAt the regional level, we are seeking the economic\nintegration of Latin America and the Caribbean with the\naim of establishing optimal conditions for forging a\nhemispheric community and establishing a united presence\nas the world opens up and markets expand.\nWe are seeking the closest possible ties with countries\nthat share our subregional realities, and we are committed\nto merging the various integration processes. That policy\nhas prompted Bolivia to sign an agreement forming a free-\ntrade area with the members of the Southern Cone\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR) \u2014 Argentina, Brazil,\nParaguay, and Uruguay \u2014 to sign agreements aimed at\nupdating and reinvigorating the Andean Common Market,\nmade up of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and\nVenezuela, and to give effect to numerous bilateral treaties\nto enhance mutual complementarity on the basis of our\nexperiences and the need to foster material and spiritual\nexchanges between nations.\nThe physical integration of the countries of the region\nconstitutes another central issue deserving priority attention.\nWe are working actively on the definition of inter-oceanic\ncorridors, and we attach great importance to the future of\nthe Plata Basin and the Treaty for Amazonian Cooperation.\nWith regard to Bolivia\u2019s maritime question, I must\ninform the international community, as we have done every\nyear, that Bolivia has reiterated in various forums its\npolitical willingness to begin negotiations that take proper\naccount of the interests of all the parties involved and\nensure Bolivia\u2019s sovereign presence with regard to the\nPacific Ocean.\nNo clear willingness to engage in dialogue can yet\nbe seen. However, on the basis of contacts on this matter\nwe can say that, despite historical difficulties and\nultranationalist suspicions, minds are opening and\nobjective foundations are being laid with a view to\nencouraging a timely solution to old problems through the\nexchange of ideas, the nurturing of mutual trust, mutual\ninterest and hemispheric understanding, in the hope that,\nbefore long, brotherhood, equality, justice and the\nrequirements of international peace and cooperation will\ntruly prevail.\nThis year Bolivia had the honour to act as pro\ntempore secretariat of the Rio Group, a high-level forum\nof consultation and political coordination for an important\ngroup of Latin American and Caribbean States. In that\ncapacity, Bolivia was the venue of the sixth regular\nmeeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Rio Group\nand the European Union, held last April in the city of\nCochabamba. On that occasion we reaffirmed our\nreadiness for joint endeavours between Latin America, the\nCaribbean and Western Europe. The meeting strengthened\nties between the two regions, based on respect for human\nrights, the fundamental rights of citizens and the\nprinciples of democracy and political pluralism.\nThe Ministers highlighted, inter alia, the danger of\ndrugs and related problems, recognizing the importance of\nmaintaining political dialogue on this issue at the highest\nlevel and agreeing on the need to strengthen the United\nNations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP).\nThe meeting called upon the international community to\ndeal with the phenomenon of drugs through joint action\nbased on the principle of global, shared responsibility. To\nthat end, consideration and support were given to the\nproposal to hold a special session of the General\nAssembly in 1998 to address this crucial issue.\nWorldwide awareness of the need for joint action is\nreaching its peak, and Bolivia hopes that the proposed\nmeeting will lay down positive guidelines to put an end\nto the scourge of drugs.\nI am also pleased to inform representatives that on\n3 and 4 September 1996, again in the Bolivian city of\nCochabamba, the Meeting of Heads of State of the Rio\nGroup took place, on the occasion of the tenth\nanniversary of the creation of that standing body. It was\n2\n\n\na great honour for my country to welcome such illustrious\nguests.\nThe Presidents and Prime Minister gathered there\nnoted with satisfaction that our region had made significant\nheadway in fighting international crime. As evidence of\nthis, they pointed to the signing in Caracas of the Inter-\nAmerican Convention against Corruption, the results of the\nSpecialized Inter-American Conference on Terrorism, held\nin Lima, and advances in the development of a hemispheric\nstrategy against drugs and related crimes in the framework\nof the Inter-American Commission against Drug Abuse.\nThe Heads of State and Government expressed their\nsatisfaction at the fact that our region had become the first\nnuclear-weapon-free zone through the adoption of the\nTreaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean.\nThe Final Declaration of the tenth summit expressed\nthe joint position of the Governments of the region on the\nissues of representative democracy and the eradication of\npoverty. It placed on record their deep conviction with\nregard to sustainable development; it set forth precise\nguidelines on regional integration and trade; it expressed a\nfirm resolve to press ahead in the fight against drugs and\nrelated crimes; it emphasized, in particular, the importance\nof the Inter-American Convention against Corruption; and\nit reiterated emphatically the crucial importance\nGovernments, from their position of lofty responsibility,\nattached to cultural integration.\nMy delegation has requested that the Secretariat of the\nUnited Nations circulate the final document of the\nCochabamba meeting to all delegations in the General\nAssembly.\nWith regard to the matter of the extraterritoriality of\nnational laws, a most sensitive issue for peoples and\nGovernments the world over, the Rio Group summit\nmeeting expressed its rejection of any attempt to use a\ncountry\u2019s domestic legislation to impose unilateral sanctions\nof an extraterritorial character, as this contravenes the\nstandards governing coexistence between States, disregards\nthe fundamental principle of respect for sovereignty and is\na clear violation of international law.\nBolivia is confident that intelligence and fairness will\nprevail on this delicate matter and that a solution will soon\nbe found, in the interest of international coexistence and\neconomic and commercial freedom for all peoples of the\nworld.\nOne of the most outstanding international\ndevelopments of our time was undoubtedly the United\nNations Conference on Environment and Development, in\nRio de Janeiro in 1992.\nWith the aim of laying the groundwork for a\nhemispheric agenda for sustainable development, several\ninternational meetings, starting with the Summit held in\nMiami in 1994, have expressed support for the decision\nto hold a hemispheric meeting at the level of Heads of\nState and Government in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz\nde la Sierra, scheduled for 7 and 8 December of this year.\nThat meeting will be a new opportunity to set the course\nof national and international endeavours for sustainable\ndevelopment in the light of economic, social and\nenvironmental goals and in reaffirmation of the\nimportance of obtaining new and additional resources to\nfinance the plan of action to be adopted.\nBolivia has offered to work its hardest alongside its\nsister nations to ensure the success of this major\nhemispheric event and is certain that inter-American\nsolidarity will lead to positive results.\nThe agenda of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly contains more than 160 items of particular\ninterest to the international community. My Government\nis prepared to participate constructively in the\nconsideration and resolution of each of them.\nWe are concerned with problems of international\npeace and security and trust that the United Nations\nsystem will contribute effectively to finding solutions for\nthe many parts of the world beset by conflicts and war.\nAs I stated on a previous occasion, Bolivia is of the\nview that many conflict situations can be explained by the\npersistence of unresolved social and national problems, as\nwell as by the accumulation of age-old injustices and\nresentments; by geopolitical and economic interests that\nfor decades have been fuelling confrontation from without\nand from within; and, above all, by Governments\u2019\ninability to cooperate effectively so as to provide timely\nand peaceful solutions to the problems of greatest national\nconcern.\nWe have participated in the debates on reforms of\nthe United Nations Charter, and we believe that it is of\nthe utmost importance to reach consensus in order to\nstrengthen the multilateral system in the interests of the\nworld community. We support the positions set forth by\nthe Non-Aligned Movement in this regard.\n3\n\n\nDifficult international circumstances are making it\nincreasingly clear that the United Nations needs to be\nstrengthened, to adapt its structures and strengthen the\nOrganization as a legitimate forum for the study,\ncoordination, follow-up and implementation of universally\naccepted policies. Accordingly, Bolivia considers it essential\nto strengthen the General Assembly, the Security Council\nand the role of the International Court of Justice. With\nregard to the expansion of the Security Council, we\nconsider it necessary that Germany and Japan be present as\nnew permanent members and that three other permanent\nmembers from Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the\nCaribbean be selected. The expansion should be\ncomplemented by an appropriate number of non-permanent\nmembers from the developing world. Of course, if\nconsensus could be reached on other formulas, then other\nproposals, such as the one presented by Italy, would need\nto be considered.\nWith regard to the veto, Bolivia shares the view that,\nideally, the international community should move towards\neliminating this device \u2014 and, one would hope, in the not-\ntoo-distant future. In the meantime, use of this device\nshould be strictly limited to actions relating to cases of\nthreats to the peace, breach of the peace or acts of\naggression referred to in Chapter VII of the United Nations\nCharter.\nBolivia is greatly concerned about the political and\nsocial situation in many African countries. We express our\nsolidarity with these countries, as we did to fraternal South\nAfrica during its times of trial, and we urge the\ninternational community, especially the rich countries of the\nworld, to cooperate generously and resolutely in order to\ncope with the grave economic problems of this continent.\nWe also express our solidarity with our brothers in the\nMiddle East. We believe that the time has come to heal old\nwounds and frame the terms of a just and lasting peace,\ntaking into account the need for secure borders for all and\ndefinitively resolving the situation through the creation of\na Palestinian state. A solution must also be found to the\nquestions of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, and the\nterritorial integrity and full sovereignty of all States of the\nregion must be preserved.\nWe rejoice in the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina\nhas embarked upon a new road to understanding, unity and\nconstruction of new democratic institutions.\nThe brotherly nations of Asia offer us remarkable\nexamples of the possibilities and opportunities for\naccelerated economic development. Their successes fill us\nwith confidence, and we are certain that they will apply\nthe same wisdom to finding solutions to the social and\npolitical problems that some of them still face.\nWe are convinced that the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty, adopted by the General Assembly on 10\nSeptember of this year, represents a landmark along the\nroad to the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Bolivia\nhas signed the papers of accession to the new Treaty and\nhopes to complete the constitutional procedures for its\napproval and ratification in a relatively short time.\nWe stress just as emphatically the need to ban the\nuse and production of anti-personnel mines, which have\nbeen leaving a trail of blood among the peoples of the\nworld.\nThe economic and social items before the Assembly\nalso deserve our keenest interest, since they are among\nthe essential tasks of the United Nations and of\ninternational cooperation. From our view of the\ninternational scene, questions pertaining to respect for\nhuman rights and democratic development in all countries\nare also matters of very high priority.\nAs representatives are aware, Bolivia has put\nforward its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the\nSecurity Council for the period 1997-1998, the elections\nfor which will be held during the present session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nAs a founding member of the United Nations,\nBolivia carries the principles of the Charter deep within\nits national spirit and has maintained a policy of\nrecognition of and support for this universal Organization.\nIn recent years my country has contributed to the forces\nof United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ),\nas well as to the election-monitoring processes in\nEl Salvador and Mozambique. We are also prepared to\nparticipate in United Nations standby arrangements. With\nregard to Haiti, Bolivia had the privilege of presiding over\nthe ad hoc group of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of\nthe Organization of American States and contributed\npolice personnel during the first stage of the democratic\nnormalization of that sister nation. Bolivia intends to\ncontinue participating in United Nations activities to\nfoster international peace and cooperation.\nIn this regard, I am pleased to note that my country\nenjoys excellent, long-standing diplomatic relations with\nthe five permanent members of the Security Council and\n4\n\n\nthat it plays an active part in the Non-Aligned Movement,\nwhose thirty-fifth anniversary we have just celebrated in an\nexpression of steadfastness in our convictions and in\ncontinued political cooperation.\nWe share common problems with developing\ncountries, land-locked States and small States the world\nover. Our established friendship with all the countries of\nAmerica, Africa, Asia, Europe and Oceania has enabled us\nto learn from their important experiences and better to\nunderstand their many problems.If our brother nations\nrepresented here see fit to honour us with their trust,\nBolivia undertakes to place its particular dedication at the\nservice of the international community in the Security\nCouncil.\nAs we move towards the end of the twentieth century\nand make preparations to welcome a new century and a\nnew millennium, peoples and nations cannot ignore deep-\nrooted trends towards new and untrodden systems of human\ncoexistence.\nIn that connection, we must ensure that small States\nparticipate actively in the international arena in promoting\nmankind\u2019s dream of making one out of many. That can\noccur only if the rules of the game are clearly defined and\nimplemented and if effective worldwide instruments are\ncreated. It is here, in the existence of and respect for\ninternational law and justice and the institutions that\nembody them, that peoples, nations and States can find the\nonly possible lodestar to guide them. Otherwise, they will\nbe condemned to new and ominous forms of modern\nslavery. That is why Bolivia believes, today more than ever,\nin the validity of the United Nations and will work to the\nutmost to defending and strengthening it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffEncouraging trends can be\nseen in many parts of the world following the end of the\nEast-West confrontation. Democracy has taken firm root in\nmany countries. The improved economic performance of\nmany countries is making an important contribution to the\nwelfare of peoples.\nAt the same time, we still face difficult challenges.\nEthnic and internal conflicts are taking a far heavier toll\nthan earlier international conflicts; grave cases of violations\nof human rights occur; the poorest countries are lagging\nbehind in economic development; the gap between rich and\npoor is growing; and the environment is coming under\nincreasing strain. The international community is facing\nchallenges going far beyond traditional diplomacy,\nchallenges directly affecting the lives of each individual\nhuman being. We must create safer and better living\nconditions for the individual.\nThis year, I will highlight four priority areas: first,\npeacekeeping and international security; secondly, human\nrights; thirdly, economic and social development; and,\nfourthly, the environment. In these areas, common efforts\nin the United Nations are imperative.\nFirst, international peace: threats against international\nsecurity and the rights of peoples must be dealt with in the\nUnited Nations. New complex intra-State conflicts have\nincreased dramatically. We must learn from the conflicts in\nthe former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Somalia. Millions of\nindividuals have suffered in these conflicts. Through the\nelectronic media, the world closely follows the unfolding\ntragedies. The hopes of the victims for a peaceful future are\nshared by all of us. The United Nations and the\ninternational community are expected to provide answers.\nWe must focus on the capacity to react directly and\nquickly and to prevent crises from getting out of hand.\nRapid response can be that which separates failure from\nsuccess. The creation of the United Nations standby system\nwas an important step in the right direction. We must now\ntake it one step further.\nThe establishment of a rapidly deployable\nheadquarters in the Department of Peacekeeping\nOperations will reduce planning time and response time\nfor future operations. The planning of new operations\ncannot start from scratch every time. Denmark continues\nits efforts with like-minded countries to establish a\nmultilateral brigade at a state of high readiness within the\nstandby system. A well-balanced, pre-planned force\nstructure will greatly improve the ability to act quickly\nand effectively.\nThe need for new conflict strategies was also\nunderlined by the Rwanda evaluation initiated by\nDenmark.\nPreventive diplomacy is called for. Regional\norganizations must be strengthened to take on more\nresponsibility in preventing conflicts and in post-conflict\npeace-building. The United Nations cannot carry the\nentire burden itself. The regional organizations must assist\nthe United Nations, not replace it.\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (OSCE), which I shall have the honour and\nresponsibility of chairing in 1997, is one such important\nregional organization. One of the tenets of the OSCE is\n\u201cOSCE first\u201d. This implies that the OSCE will be a\nprimary instrument for conflict prevention in its region,\nthus relieving the United Nations.\nArms control and arms reduction add their\ncontribution to conflict prevention. Two and a half years\nof intensive negotiations have resulted in the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) now\nopen for signature. On behalf of the Kingdom of\nDenmark, I signed the Treaty this morning. The CTBT\nwill end the qualitative development of nuclear weapons.\nIt is a necessary supplementary component to the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It will\nstrengthen progress towards complete global nuclear\ndisarmament.\nWhen it comes to conventional weapons, anti-\npersonnel landmines continue to pose a daily, grave threat\nto people in many parts of the world. They are, at the\nsame time, an unacceptable obstacle to the resettlement of\ndisplaced populations. The new landmine Protocol to the\nConvention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of\nCertain Conventional Weapons, adopted in May, is an\nimprovement. Denmark will ratify it shortly, without\nreservations, but we are still far away from the only\nviable solution to the landmine problem, which is a total,\n5\n\n\nworldwide ban. The Danish Government has decided to\nrenounce unilaterally the use of anti-personnel landmines in\nthe Danish armed forces. We encourage similar decisions\nby other Governments.\nFurthermore, the present state of technology for\ndetecting unexploded mines is ineffective. Public and\nprivate initiative, ingenuity and funding must be combined\nto create new technological options for landmine detection.\nThe International Conference on Mine-clearance\nTechnology, held in Denmark in July this year, has\nstimulated this endeavour. We welcome the initiatives of\nCanada and Japan to carry the efforts further.\nNational initiatives must be assisted by international\nefforts to speed up mine clearance. To this effect, the\nGeneral Assembly will be presented with a draft resolution\non assistance in mine clearance.\nMy second priority is human rights. They have come\nto play a visible role in international relations and on the\nagenda of many United Nations forums. The Vienna World\nConference on Human Rights made it clear that the\npromotion and protection of all human rights is a legitimate\nconcern, indeed a duty, of all States and the international\ncommunity. Criticism of human rights abuses can no longer\nbe rejected as interference in internal affairs. Indeed,\ncriticism should be seen as a contribution to our cooperative\nefforts to strengthen respect for human rights. The adoption\nof international instruments is the result of our cooperation.\nThey are the true universally-accepted bases for continued\nprogress in the human rights field.\nThe overall goal is to promote and protect the rights\nof individual human beings \u2014 our citizens. This leaves\nroom for each society to find its own way to further\ndemocracy and respect for human rights. No one is trying\nto impose a single model. When we freely adhere to\ninternational human rights standards as our own, we give\nup no part of our culture, no part of our national\nsovereignty. On the contrary, individuals enjoying full\nhuman rights are the best guarantee of national culture and\nsovereignty.\nThe United Nations Commission on Human Rights\nplays a particularly important role in the promotion of\nhuman rights. During its membership term, Denmark\nintends to contribute actively to the Commission\u2019s work in\nfour prime areas: the fight against torture; the promotion of\nthe rights of indigenous peoples; strengthening the High\nCommissioner and his office; and the right to development.\nLet me in this context pay tribute to the important\ncontribution of non-governmental organizations.\nI cannot mention the area of human rights without\nreferring to the grave situation in Myanmar. It is, indeed,\na tragedy that, since the release in July last year of Nobel\nPeace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, developments in\nthat country have gone from bad to worse.\nTime and again, Denmark and its European Union\npartners have urged the State Law and Order Restoration\nCouncil (SLORC) to respect human rights and to restore\ndemocracy to the Burmese people. Our appeals have been\nignored. I repeat them here in the strongest possible\nterms. This tragedy must end.\nI express my deep dismay at the unwillingness of the\nSLORC to discuss the death in custody, on 22 June 1996\nof Mr. James Nichols. Mr. Nichols served as honorary\nconsul for several European States, including Denmark.\nThe Government of Denmark intends to keep the\nsituation in Burma high on the international agenda until\nfundamental improvements are seen.\nEconomic and social development is the third area\nI want to emphasize. Human conflicts have many causes.\nIf we want a lasting foundation for peace in our own\nsocieties and internationally, we need to address the\nproblems of poverty, deprivation and social exclusion.\nThe plight of the poorest countries is a matter of\nparticular concern. The United Nations should play a\ncrucial role in addressing this problem.\nThe need for development assistance is as great as\never. The poorest countries do not attract private\ninvestment. They do not have the potential to benefit from\nliberalization of international trade. The current trend in\nofficial development assistance is deplorable. Official\ndevelopment assistance fell to 0.27 per cent of gross\nnational product in 1995. This is the lowest level since\nthe United Nations target of 0.7 per cent was set in 1970.\nUnfortunately, a number of major donors are still\nreducing their development programmes. In 1995, only\nfour countries were above the target of 0.7 per cent.\nDenmark, for its part, continues to contribute one per cent\nof its gross national product.\nEconomic growth, desirable as it is, cannot be\nequated with development unless it is accompanied by\neconomic and social progress for all groups. Social\n6\n\n\nprogress for all is not an automatic result of economic\ngrowth. The Declaration and Programme of Action adopted\nby the Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development\nstated that\n\u201cthe eradication of poverty, the generation of ...\nproductive employment, and the enhancement of social\nintegration\u201d (A/CONF.166/9, p. 24)\nshould be an integral part of policies furthering economic\ngrowth.\nI would particularly emphasize the need to ensure an\neffective follow-up to the Platform for Action adopted at\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.\nThe United Nations plays a crucial role in\nhumanitarian assistance. Recent experience, including the\nRwanda evaluation, has stressed the need for coordination\nof all actors in the humanitarian field. The Department of\nHumanitarian Affairs of the United Nations has gradually\nestablished itself as a focal point for coordination of needs\nassessment and appeals. I urge all Members of the United\nNations family with humanitarian assistance programmes to\nengage actively in DHA-sponsored coordination efforts.\nThe fourth priority area is the environment. The\nBrundtland Report and the Rio Conference on Environment\nand Development clearly emphasized the global nature of\nenvironmental issues. The concept of sustainable\ndevelopment has now firmly taken its place on our political\nagenda.\nMuch has been achieved. Yet it is uncertain whether\nthe accomplishments match the growing problems. Armed\nconflicts, poverty, ignorance and in some cases even short-\nsightedness and greed are contributors to the continued\nwear and tear on the environment.\nThe special session of the General Assembly, to take\nplace in 1997, will be the next opportunity for Governments\nto review at a high level the implementation of Agenda 21.\nThe special session must look at the need for readjusting,\nrevitalizing and increasing our efforts to cope with the\nchallenges.\nThe Government of Denmark fully supports this\nprocess. We will continue our support of activities in areas\nin need, such as safeguarding biodiversity, promoting\nrenewable energy and reducing erosion, desertification and\ndeforestation.\nI have dealt briefly with four high-priority areas. In\nthe view of my Government, the United Nations has a\nkey role to play in addressing these problems. But is the\nOrganization fully capable of taking up this challenge?\nRegrettably, the answer is no.\nWe must insist that all Members honour their treaty\nobligations and pay their contributions to the United\nNations in full, on time and without preconditions. The\npresent state of affairs is unacceptable. Undermining the\nUnited Nations is in the interest of no one. Members that\nare intentionally running behind in paying their assessed\ncontributions must realize that they cannot expect their\ninfluence in the various United Nations organs to remain\nunaffected.\nFurthermore, the United Nations must reflect present\npolitical realities. This should be borne in mind in the\nefforts to agree on reforming the Security Council. No\ndoubt, the United Nations must continue its efforts to\nrevitalize itself in the economic and social field. The\nquality of its work must continuously be improved. The\nmain objective is to increase its impact at the country\nlevel to the benefit of the poor. Denmark supports a\ncomprehensive and coherent reform of the present system\nin areas such as institutions, governance structure, staff,\nadministration and future funding.\nLittle can be achieved without the political will of\nthe Member States. I agree with the recent findings of a\ntask force sponsored by a well-known American\ninstitution, the Council on Foreign Relations. It states that\n\u201cthe United Nations is in crisis ... principally\nbecause Members States ... have failed to pay their\nbills, have given the United Nations responsibilities\nwithout the power to carry them out, and have\nblamed the United Nations for failures in national\npolicies.\u201d\nIn conclusion, let me underline the fundamental\ninterest of my country in the establishment of a world\ncommunity in which States, as well as each individual,\nmay live in conditions of peace and welfare. Well-\nfunctioning international organizations, not least our world\nOrganization, are cornerstones in this endeavour.\nDenmark will bring its dedicated contribution.\n\n\n"

His skills as a\ndistinguished diplomat are well known and, coupled with\nthe cooperation of Member States, will create the requisite\nconditions for a successful Assembly. I wish to assure\nhim of the full support of my delegation as he presides\nover the deliberations of this body.\nI wish also to express my delegation\u2019s appreciation\nto his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do\nAmaral of Portugal, who effectively guided the work of\na most historic and memorable fiftieth session. We wish\nalso to thank the Secretary-General for his leadership of\nthe Organization over the past year.\nThe Bahamas is indeed honoured to have been\nelected to serve as a Vice-President of the General\nAssembly at the fifty-first session. I wish to thank all\nMember States for their support in our realization of this\nachievement.\nOur deliberations during the last session provided an\nopportune environment for stocktaking and evaluation, as\nwell as the opportunity to look ahead and consider how\nwe ought to proceed for the next 50 years. The solemn\nDeclaration which we adopted at the end of the Special\nCommemorative Meeting, highlighted the international\ncommunity\u2019s continued commitment to the United\nNations and to the purposes and principles of the Charter\nby which it is governed. The Bahamas is convinced that\nthe United Nations remains the primary world body with\nthe capacity and political will to bring together the\ndisparate elements of the international community, so as\nto face and deal with the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury.\nThe Bahamas, like other countries, would wish to\nsee a strong and effective United Nations. It is our view\nthat the three-tiered reform process currently under way\nin the political, economic and social and administrative\nareas represents an important step in that direction. We\nmust remain diligent and focused in our work so as to\ntransform the United Nations into a structure equipped for\nthe fulfilment and support of the myriad demands of\nMember States.\nIn the area of political reform, the Bahamas\ncontinues to support the enlargement of the Security\nCouncil to enable it to become more effective,\nrepresentative, democratic and transparent. We are\ndisappointed that after another year of discussion little or\nno progress has been made. We urge all Member States\nto exercise flexibility so as to expedite agreement on this\nimportant matter.\n1\n\n\nWe acknowledge the need to strengthen the United\nNations system in the economic and social fields. Action\nmust be taken to reduce duplication and to improve\ncoordination among the various agencies, including the\nBretton Woods institutions.\nThere is a clear need for reform and greater efficiency\nin the administrative and financial areas. The discussions in\nthe respective high-level Working Groups established to\nexamine these areas have been useful. However, few, if\nany, meaningful decisions have been taken to date. We urge\nMember States to increase the momentum, so as to put in\nplace the requisite measures to strengthen the efficacy of\nthe Organization. At the same time, the Bahamas urges and\nappeals to Member States to make a more determined effort\nto meet their financial obligations to the Organization. We\nare aware that the assessment system needs reform. Thus,\nwe should take the opportunity provided by this session to\nagree on an equitable scale of assessment for the next\ntriennium. The scale of assessment, when finalized, should\ntake into account all relevant circumstances, including the\nspecial circumstances of archipelagic island developing\ncountries and the need for the development of a\nvulnerability index. The Bahamas also wishes once again to\nurge the international community not to use high per capita\ngross national product (GNP) as the sole measurement of\ncapacity to pay when it considers the question of criteria\nfor the scale. The Bahamas, as well as a number of other\ncountries, has repeatedly argued that high per capita GNP\nis not an accurate measurement of a country\u2019s wealth.\nIndeed, it presents a skewed and distorted picture of the\neconomic reality in my own country when one takes into\nconsideration the duplication of infrastructure and social\nservices.\nIn our efforts to reform this Organization, we must\nguard against engaging in reform for reform\u2019s sake. The\nrestoration of the dignity of the individual must remain our\nprimary focus. The extent to which we neglect this highest\nof priorities is the extent to which human rights abuses and\ninequities will abound, giving rise to tensions and conflicts\non various levels, like those that have been witnessed by\nthe international community in recent years with the\nescalation of civil wars and ethnic strife in many parts of\nthe world. A total breakdown in society is the ultimate\nconsequence of such activities, which completely\noverwhelm national resources and consume inordinate\namounts of international energy which could be far more\nmeaningfully expended. To achieve meaningful reform we\nwill have to change our focus significantly. It will require\na shift in paradigms, where issues previously neglected will\nhave to be brought to the fore.\nWe need to be reminded that economic and social\nsecurity directly influence political security. They must\ntherefore be addressed in an integrated manner. We must\nguard against the additional threat of economic might\nbeing translated into military power, which not only\nsidelines and marginalizes the disadvantaged and\ndispossessed but also threatens our peace and security.\nOur efforts must be aimed at raising the standard of\nliving and quality of life of the world\u2019s most\nunderprivileged. Despite impressive economic growth in\nmany countries, human development continues to move\nat a snail\u2019s pace, particularly in developing countries. We\nmust find a way to balance economic growth and human\ndevelopment so as to ensure the sustainability and\nlivelihood of future generations.\nWe are merely proposing for the international\ncommunity what is already in place in the Bahamas. The\npromotion and protection of human rights, the\nadvancement of women, social justice, equality and\ndevelopment continue to receive priority attention from\nthe Government of the Bahamas. We are fully committed\nto securing a social environment in which our citizens can\nlive in harmony, prosperity and security, without fear or\nintimidation. Many of the recommendations contained in\nthe plans and programmes of action of the recent world\nconferences have already been implemented in the\nBahamas, and we will continue to put in place the\nnecessary infrastructure to facilitate the implementation of\nthose recommendations which have not yet been put into\npractice.\nOur past actions have brought us to a day of\nreckoning. The wealth of oceans once deemed\ninexhaustible has proven finite. Global warming is no\nlonger a prognostication, but a present condition. What is\nat stake here is the future of our planet and the lives of its\ninhabitants. The Bahamas urges that the special session\nfor the review of Agenda 21 in 1997 be viewed as an\nopportunity to re-examine our strategy and to correct past\nmistakes. The Bahamas hopes that the special session will\nfocus on practical proposals and not try to renegotiate\nAgenda 21. Definitive priorities and a recommitment to\nsustainable development should be set out, taking account\nof the recognized peculiar problems of small developing\nStates and the international community\u2019s commitment to\nprovide resources to such States.\nThe Bahamas is concerned that protection be\nprovided to the fragile and vulnerable economies of small\nStates in a global community which is moving towards\n13\n\n\nthe strengthening and development of trading blocs. The\nnew international trade regime has put small States at a\ndisadvantage with the expectation that they liberalize their\nmarkets and open their borders in conformity with the\nobligations and commitments of the World Trade\nOrganization. The playing field must be levelled so that due\nregard can be given to the fragile domestic economies of\nthese States and their macroeconomic position. If the\ndeveloped countries are demanding protection for their\nsensitive domestic industries, then similar demands by\ndeveloping countries with respect to their domestic industry\nshould not be viewed as a request that is unreasonable or\ninconsistent with current international trends.\nA review of current events reveals new threats to the\nfragile peace process in the Middle East. The Bahamas\nurges the parties concerned to make every possible effort to\nrestore order, to refrain from acts of violence and to\nreactivate the peace process, which enjoyed the widespread\nsupport of the international community. We commend\nPresident Clinton for his initiative in inviting Middle East\nleaders to Washington for discussion aimed at defusing this\nvolatile situation and thus, hopefully, restoring confidence\nin the peace process.\nOngoing conflicts in Africa are of grave concern. The\ninternational community should see it as its duty to support\nmeasures for the prevention and resolution of conflict in the\ncountries concerned and to address the economic and debt\nburdens that have crippled Africa. Although the African\ncountries themselves have made strenuous efforts towards\nreadjustment and recovery, they continue to require the\nassistance of the international community.\nThe Bahamas welcomes the approval by the Group of\nSeven of a debt-relief plan for the world\u2019s poorest nations.\nThe debt-relief measure, which will release as many as 20\nof the poorest countries from up to $7.7 billion in debt, will\ngo a long way towards providing the needed relief for those\ncountries in their economic growth and development.\nThe Bahamas is pleased to note that after four years\nof devastating warfare free elections have taken place in\nBosnia and Herzegovina. We note the appointment of a\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General on the\nquestion of Cyprus, and we urge the parties concerned to\ncontinue to seek a just and viable solution to that conflict.\nViolence perpetrated against the people of Cyprus cannot be\ncondoned.\nNotwithstanding the considerable and praiseworthy\nefforts of the United Nations and the Organization of\nAmerican States, Haiti still remains unstable to a degree\nthat threatens the stability of the entire region, with a\ncontinuing outflow of immigrants seeking a better way of\nlife in other countries. The majority of such immigrants\nretreat to the Bahamas.\nIt is regrettable that, notwithstanding the assistance\nof the international community, many areas of great\nconcern remain to be effectively tackled in Haiti.\nAttempts to restore democracy are constantly hindered by\nthe absence of the conditions necessary to support them.\nWe are therefore left with a population surrounded by\nmuch activity, but one whose daily existence remains\nmeagre at best. The consequences are predictable, namely,\nunrest and increased violence. It is therefore not sufficient\nto continue business as usual. The peculiar nature of the\nsituation in Haiti requires specific, focused and targeted\naction that addresses causes and not effects, one in which\ninitiatives provide direct benefits to the Haitian people.\nThe Bahamas views with much regret the continued\nescalation of the nefarious drug trade, particularly in the\nLatin American and Caribbean region. We must double\nour efforts to fight this terrible scourge, and it is our hope\nthat the special session in 1998 will result in a renewed\ncommitment to fight and eradicate this illicit activity.\nWe are also of the view that efforts must be renewed\nto address the problem of the traffic in small arms, which\nhas increased to alarming proportions in recent times. We\nare particularly concerned about the large number of\nsmall arms that are smuggled into the Caribbean\ncountries. We urge the countries that manufacture and sell\narms to impose stricter arms control measures and\nprovide assistance to vulnerable States to reduce this\nthreat and increase the latters\u2019 capability to combat such\nillegal activity.\nAt the same time, the international community must\nvoice unanimous disapproval and condemnation of the\nunrelenting increase in crime and the rise of terrorism that\nis currently confronting the international community. The\nBahamas regrets the failure to reach international\nconsensus on dealing swiftly with those grave areas of\nconcern. We urge that every effort be made to implement\nthe relevant agreements already in force and to put in\nplace any additional measures required to deal with these\nreprehensible activities.\nThe proliferation of arms, both conventional and\nthose designed for mass destruction, poses a serious threat\nto humanity. Thus, the Bahamas welcomed the recent\n14\n\n\nadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nand intends to add its name shortly to the growing list of\nsignatories. Anti-personnel land-mines present an insidious\nchallenge to development and human dignity, and we\nshould move towards a complete ban on such treacherous\ntools of murder.\nThe Bahamas denounces the continued trans-shipment\nof nuclear material and hazardous waste through the\necosensitive Caribbean Sea. In this respect, the entire\nCaribbean Community is in agreement. Indeed in 1992, the\nHeads of Government of the Caribbean Community\ndeclared that the Caribbean Sea should be a nuclear-free-\nzone for purposes of shipment, storing or dumping of any\nradioactive or hazardous substances or toxic waste.\nThe Bahamas is encouraged by the steps taken by the\nsecond regular session of the International Seabed Authority\nat its meeting at Kingston last August, which are geared\ntowards ensuring the effective functioning of the Authority.\nAmong the issues before the General Assembly this\nsession is the matter of the international criminal court. We\nexhort the General Assembly to continue its work on this\nitem so as to enable the convening of a conference of\nplenipotentiaries in 1998 to adopt the statute of the court,\nthus fulfilling a lacuna in the existing international legal\norder.\nAs members are aware, the Bahamas is an archipelagic\nnation which, by any measure, is a small State with a\npopulation of less than 300,000. However, we are a proud\npeople and strong in our belief in justice for all and in the\ninalienable rights of all people, as enshrined in the Charter\nof this noble Organization.\nIt is in this spirit of justice and fair play that over the\npast two years we have repeatedly recorded our support in\nthe General Assembly for the efforts of the 21 million\ninhabitants of the Republic of China on Taiwan as they\nentreat the Organization to examine the merits of\nestablishing a committee to analyse in depth the\nimplications, both now and for the future, of continuing to\npreclude those 21 million souls from formal representation\nin the General Assembly by way of membership in the\nUnited Nations.\nThe Bahamas again calls on the nations of the world,\nas Members of this august and united international body of\nnations, to hear the plea of those 21 million souls on the\nisland of Taiwan and to consider what is just and right for\nthem as they too seek to avail themselves of the benefits\nof membership in the United Nations.\nThe next 50 years will be painful and exacting as we\nattempt to ensure that the pitfalls of the past are avoided.\nMany changes will be required. In effecting change, we\nmust ensure that it is profitable, for while change is\ninevitable, progress is not. The tendency to hold onto the\nold way of doing business in the midst of necessary\nchange will remain our greatest challenge. As we seek to\nbalance our efforts, it must be remembered that\ntransformation in one area does not necessarily relegate\nall others to irrelevance.\nMany reasons have been proffered for the present\nstate of affairs. Not surprisingly, none of them seem to\ninvolve the proponents. While everyone talks about the\nfuture, few are willing to make the necessary sacrifices to\nsecure it. Rhetoric boils with urgency, but talks move\nslowly, and action is even more halting.\nThe uncharted waters ahead remain daunting, defined\nby bilious seas of unrelenting, sophisticated, transnational\ncriminal activity, which is tearing at the very fabric of\nsociety. Environmental degradation has exposed the Earth\nto permanent damage. Navigation of these seas requires\nus to rise above platitudes and empty promises. We must\nrepudiate the adversaries of peace.\nOur evaluations during the past session confirmed\nthe continuing validity of the United Nations as the\nprincipal mechanism for addressing world concerns.\nDespite its uneven accomplishments, the United Nations\nfacilitates collaboration for the resolution of societal ills,\nwhatever their origin. The structure and machinery of the\nUnited Nations must be such that we are encouraged to\ncontinue to use the relatively calm chambers of this forum\nfor our deliberations. This is the only safeguard we have\nagainst countries\u2019 being tempted to take their disputes out\nto sea.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is with real pleasure and great interest that I stand before\nthe Assembly to convey the warm greetings of the people\nof Guinea and of its President, General Lansana Conte. I\njoin with the many preceding speakers in warmly\ncongratulating Ambassador Razali on his election to the\npresidency of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly. His election is testimony to the international\ncommunity\u2019s high regard for Malaysia, his country, with\nwhich the Republic of Guinea is honoured to have special\nties of friendship and cooperation. I am convinced that\nunder his skilful guidance our work will enjoy every\nsuccess. I assure him of the support and cooperation of the\ndelegation of Guinea in this task.\nMy congratulations also go to his predecessor,\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal who, with skill\nand clearsightedness, enabled the Assembly to address the\nconcerns of the international community during the\nfiftieth session.\nMy country, the Republic of Guinea, takes this\nopportunity to greet and stress our tribute to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose\ncourage, intelligence and tireless efforts have contributed\nsignificantly to the attainment of the Organization\u2019s noble\npurposes of peace, justice and progress. This is why my\ndelegation reiterates its support for his candidacy for a\nsecond term of office, in accordance with the decision of\nthe most recent Summit Meeting of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, held at Yaounde from 8 to 10 July 1996.\nA host of challenges are now threatening to upset\nthe balance of the United Nations as we approach the end\nof the millennium. Despite encouraging results in terms\nof maintaining international peace and security, many\nconflicts incompatible with people\u2019s aspirations of\neconomic and social progress persist.\nIn addition to the tensions and conflicts which are\ntearing peoples apart, of equal concern are the poverty,\nunemployment, malnutrition and environmental\ndegradation that continue to threaten the existence and\nfuture of many populations of the world. Today more\nthan ever there is an urgent need radically to restructure\nour common institution, the United Nations, so that it can\nadapt better to current changes, respond appropriately to\nthe expectations of our populations on the major questions\nwhich challenge humankind and make the outlook for the\nfuture one filled with hope.\nThe need to prevent and settle conflicts, to support\nthe efforts of States to ensure sustainable development, to\nprovide easier access to suitable housing and to guarantee\nsufficient food for all are now becoming elements of the\npromotion of human rights. The same holds true for how\nwe deal with the implications of the globalization of the\ninternational economy through reliable mechanisms.\nThe Republic of Guinea welcomes and strongly\nencourages the initiative of Japan, our great friend, to\ndesign and implement, with our countries, a new\ndevelopment strategy. In this respect, it supports the\norganization in 1997 in Tokyo of the second International\nConference on African Development in which it\nundertakes to play an active role from the preparatory\nphase to the end of its work. We are convinced that there\n18\n\n\nis an urgent need and obligation to support firmly a new\nform of world partnership involving all nations, large and\nsmall.\nThe Republic of Guinea, aware of the fresh challenges\nfacing developing countries on the eve of the third\nmillennium, has decided that its diplomacy should be based\non development. This role of diplomatic linchpin in the area\nof economic advancement will not only strengthen our\ncommitment to subregional and regional integration, but\nwill also increase significantly our participation in\ninternational trade.\nQuestions of international peace and security must\nremain at the forefront of our concerns. In this respect, my\ndelegation considers that the main role of the United\nNations is to continue and intensify the search for ways and\nmeans to increase the effectiveness of its action in the areas\nof the maintenance of peace and of preventive diplomacy.\nMy delegation welcomes the adoption of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which I have just\nsigned on behalf of the Government of Guinea. We see this\nas an important step towards total disarmament. If the\nTreaty is to attain all of its objectives, the main one being\nto spare humanity from chaos, it must be signed and\nrespected by all States of the world. To do this, we must\ncalmly and jointly seek to give the assurances of the\ninternational community to countries that hesitate to take\nthe decisive step towards the salvation of humanity, so that\nin the near future the accession of all Member States of the\nUnited Nations will enshrine the universality of this\nimportant Treaty.\nAlong the same lines, my delegation calls on the\ninternational community to implement global measures to\nprohibit the illegal traffic of fissile materials, the\ntransborder trafficking in conventional small arms and the\nproduction, stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines.\nMore than 110 million mines are now scattered around the\nworld, ready to explode at any time, indiscriminately\nstriking down innocent civilian populations.\nThe Republic of Guinea welcomes the adoption of the\ntext of Protocol II to the Convention on Prohibitions or\nRestrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons\nWhich May be Deemed to Be excessively Injurious or to\nHave Indiscriminate Effects, on Mines, Booby-Traps and\nOther Such Devices during the Review Conference on the\nimplementation of that Convention.\nOther threats weigh heavily on international peace\nand security. Our Organization must react vigorously to\nthe threats of terrorism, organized crime and drug\ntrafficking.\nApart from their many disastrous consequences,\nthese threats, because they are transborder threats, must\nbe considered as real dangers to the health, security and\nstability both of our populations and of our States.\nMy delegation, while welcoming the decisions of the\nGroup of Seven and Russia on combatting terrorism and\ntransnational threats, believes that a more complete use of\nthe potential of the United Nations as an instrument for\ndeveloping joint international strategies and cooperation\namong all States in the area of fighting crime would\nallow for more effective coordination of the actions of the\ninternational community.\nWe greatly appreciate the United Nations efforts in\nother areas as dangerous as terrorism: money-laundering,\ntrafficking in children and all related crimes. Fighting\nthese scourges of our time is everyone\u2019s business.\nIn Africa, tangible progress has been made in the\narea of peace and democracy. The Republic of Guinea,\nhowever, remains concerned by the conflicts which\ncontinue to rage on the continent. In the West African\nsubregion, the situations in Liberia and Sierra Leone have\ntangibly improved, despite some obstacles, which we are\nstriving to overcome within the context of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and its\npeace force, the ECOWAS Monitoring Group\n(ECOMOG).\nThe conflict in Liberia has lasted for seven long\nyears. It has caused the death of tens of thousands of\npeople and has led to a mass exodus of hundreds of\nthousands of refugees to neighbouring States, including\nmy country, the Republic of Guinea, on whose territory\nare hundreds of thousands of refugees, to whom it offers\nassistance and protection while at the same time\nespousing total neutrality in relation to other States\nmembers of ECOWAS in the search for a political\nsolution to end this conflict.\nThe joint efforts of that subregional organization\nwith such major forums as the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) and the United Nations led to the signing of\nthe most recent peace agreements at Abuja, Nigeria. The\nRepublic of Guinea, true to its policy of good-\nneighbourliness and neutrality, firmly supports these\n19\n\n\nagreements, which provide for free and transparent elections\nin May 1997, and will ensure their strict implementation.\nAn end to this conflict is of interest to the Republic of\nGuinea, my country, mainly because of the presence on our\nterritory of more than 650,000 refugees compared with a\npopulation of 7 million Guineans: one refugee for every 10\ninhabitants. This is a situation with rare precedents.\nSimilarly, our participation in the peace effort places a\nheavy burden on our economy and compromises many of\nour development projects.\nI would like to make an urgent appeal to all the parties\nconcerned with this conflict to implement the Abuja\nAgreement in full, and in a timely manner, to the benefit of\nstability in the subregion. The promises of assistance from\nfriendly countries and by the international community\ncould, if kept within the timetable, effectively lead the final\nsettlement plan to success. The initiatives under way in this\nregard are very encouraging. We welcome the action of the\nUnited States of America to assist ECOWAS peace efforts\nand thank the United States warmly for its latest\ncontribution to the financing of the activities of ECOMOG.\nThe deterioration of the socio-political climate in\nBurundi stirs fears today of a repetition of the threats\nexperienced in neighbouring Rwanda, a country with which\nit shares many social, historical and cultural similarities.\nThe continuation of this crisis also poses a serious threat to\nstability in the region and to peace. This is why the United\nNations, together with neighbouring countries, must be\nfurther involved in the search for a final solution to this\ncrisis. We lend our full support to the recent decision taken\nby the OAU and by the conference of Heads of State of the\nGreat Lakes region, held at Arusha, against the Government\nstemming from the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. We urge all the sons of\nBurundi and all those of good-will worldwide to support\nOAU efforts towards the peaceful settlement of the crises\nin Burundi and in Rwanda through dialogue, tolerance and\nreconciliation among the various communities.\nAs regards Western Sahara, my Government supports\nthe international community\u2019s efforts for a peaceful solution\nto this question, in accordance with the United Nations\nsettlement plan.\nWith respect to Angola, my delegation strongly\nencourages the Angolan Government and Uni\u00e3o Nacional\npara a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola (UNITA) to\npersevere along the path to peace and national\nreconciliation on the basis of the implementation of and\nrespect for the Lusaka Protocol.\nRegarding the situation in Somalia, we must say that\nleaving Somalians to their fate would be contrary to the\nUnited Nations ideal of solidarity. Despite the difficulties,\nthe United Nations must continue to be involved actively\nin the process of restoring peace to that country, through\na continuous search for mechanisms to promote national\nreconciliation, peace, security and stability in Somalia.\nOn the Middle East, my Government remains greatly\nconcerned by the latest developments in Jerusalem, in\nGaza and in the West Bank. The seriousness of these\nevents could jeopardize the peace process. We are\nconvinced that rapid approach of Palestinian autonomy in\nthe Gaza Strip, in Jericho and in the West Bank, and the\nnecessary continuation of the peace process are the\nresponsibility of the entire international community. This\nis why my delegation solemnly calls upon all the parties\ninvolved with the Middle East conflict, especially Israel\nand its Arab neighbours, to continue courageously on the\npath of peace, through the pursuit of negotiations, in\naccordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions\nand the Peace Agreements.\nThe Republic of Guinea, convinced that dialogue,\nthe creation of a climate of mutual trust and a greater\nmutual understanding constitute the only path towards a\nlasting solution on the Korean peninsula, will continue to\nencourage the two Korean States to persevere in their\nefforts towards independent and peaceful reunification.\nThe signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995\nhas opened up fresh prospects for the restoration and\nconsolidation of peace in the Balkans. With the recent\nelections in Bosnia, developments in the situation\nstrengthen the aspirations to peace, stability and security\nof the region\u2019s peoples. We must however remain\nvigilant. In this respect, my delegation welcomes and\nsupports the efforts of the United Nations, of the\nImplementation Force (IFOR) and of the international\ncriminal tribunal, aimed at consolidating peace and\nprosecuting those responsible for crimes against humanity.\nWe invite the international community to display firmness\nin dealing with this question, in order to extinguish any\nre-emergence of the practices of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d. The\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference must be involved\nmore closely in the process begun in this country.\nThe situation in Jammu and Kashmir continues to\ndeteriorate. At its various summits and ministerial\nconferences, the Organization of the Islamic Conference\nhas appealed to the international community to urge the\nprotagonists to abide by the relevant Security Council\n20\n\n\nresolutions and thus enable the Kashmiri people to exercise\nfreely its right to self-determination. We repeat this appeal,\nand invite them to begin a constructive dialogue.\nThe Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir of the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, which is chaired by\nthe Republic of Guinea, requests the United Nations and the\nSecurity Council to shoulder all their responsibilities by\nbecoming decisively involved in the search for peace in the\nIndian sub-continent. Security Council resolutions 47\n(1948), 91 (1951) and 122 (1957) on Jammu and Kashmir,\nwhich remain unimplemented after five decades, should not\nremain among the forgotten resolutions of our system. The\nRepublic of Guinea therefore gives its full support to efforts\nby the Government of Pakistan aimed at finding a peaceful\nsolution to the problem of Jammu and Kashmir through the\nopening of talks with India.\nMy country follows the development of the situation\nin Afghanistan with the greatest attention. It urges all the\nparties concerned to work fraternally for the restoration of\npeace and for national reconciliation.\nIn the context of its actions within the Organization of\nthe Islamic Conference, of which it is a founding member\nand current Chairman of its Council of Ministers for\nForeign Affairs, the Republic of Guinea \u2014 a secular\ncountry with a strong Muslim majority \u2014 is dedicated to\npromoting understanding and tolerance among civilizations,\ncultures and religions and to contributing to the rise of the\nforces of progress, justice and democracy in Muslim\nregions and in the world beyond.\nAt a time when the world is experiencing profound\nchanges of unequalled complexity and scope, it is essential\nto promote and consolidate an international environment\nthat will foster peace, growth and development. It is\nregrettable that Africa does not play a greater role in major\ninternational negotiations. We must not continue to be\nspectators while the rest of the world carries out\nnegotiations which involve us directly or indirectly. We are\nconvinced that Africa has a role to play in this area.\nIn the new configuration of today\u2019s world, a country\nsuch as the Republic of Guinea \u2014 through its policy of\npeace and because its interests do not diverge from those of\nother regions of the world; through the nature of its\nsometimes exceptional relations with the parties in latent or\novert conflicts in various regions; through its membership\nin several geo-political groups, several cultural zones and\nseveral continental and non-African organizations \u2014 could,\nwhere desirable, play a useful role in international\nnegotiations.\nThe permanence and fairness of development will be\nillusory so long as modalities that preserve and perpetuate\npresent inequalities continue to govern international\nrelations. Economic and social development, whose\ncorrelation with international peace and security is clear,\nrequires of States and of the international institutions that\nare our development partners a pragmatic and coherent\napproach which takes into account the specific socio-\neconomic needs and realities of our States.\nMy delegation is pleased with the efforts that have\nalready been made in the area of debt relief for\ndeveloping countries and appeals to the solidarity of the\ninternational community for a real increase in\ndevelopment assistance, whose current tendency to\ndecrease is a real source of concern for us in the face of\nour pressing development needs. In this regard, we\nwelcome the decisions of the last summit of the Group of\nSeven, held at Lyon.\nAlthough the conclusion of the Uruguay Round\nopens up new prospects for the stimulation of\ninternational trade, it is essential to introduce new,\nenergetic measures to save Africa from marginalization\nand impoverishment. It is a human, social, political and\neconomic imperative for the international community and\nfor all the actors and partners in development, in their\nown specific actions, to work responsibly for a more just\nand equitable framework for international trade, favouring\na free and democratic economic partnership.\nWe therefore congratulate the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his praiseworthy efforts\nwhich have made it possible to develop the United\nNations System-wide Special Initiative for Africa. My\ncountry would like to express the hope that this will not\nsuffer from the same lethargy which the United Nations\nProgramme of Action for African Economic Recovery\nand Development suffered from. Such a failure would be\nhighly prejudicial and damaging to the credibility of the\nUnited Nations. In this regard, my delegation seeks the\nurgent implementation of this ambitious Initiative, for it\nis undeniable that it is one of the best ways of giving\ndevelopment a chance and new hope for future\ngenerations.\nWe would also like to express our satisfaction at the\nconvening of the second United Nations Conference on\nHuman Settlements and to support the important\n21\n\n\nresolutions arising from that Conference promoting access\nto suitable housing for all.\nAlong these lines, my delegation would like to take\nthis opportunity to welcome the holding of the World Food\nSummit, which will take place from 13 to 17 November\n1996 at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations.\nMy Government believes that the enhancement of our\nOrganization\u2019s effectiveness lies above all in the\nredefinition of some of its objectives, especially in adapting\nthe functioning of its organs to reflect better the new face\nof international relations. With regard to the Security\nCouncil, my Government fully supports the review and\nexpansion of its current composition on the basis of\nequitable geographical representation so that the southern\nhemisphere \u2014 which since 1945 has been the theatre of\nmany conflicts \u2014 can participate in its activities which are\nfundamental to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity.\nMy wish, therefore, is for the United Nations to carry\nout its restructuring. Whether with regard to revitalizing the\nGeneral Assembly and its organs, to expanding or\nstrengthening the Security Council, to rationalizing\nactivities and procedures, to redefining programmes and\nmandates or to consolidating the financial and material\nbases of the Organization, all Member States must work\nwith courage, clarity and a high sense of responsibility for\nthe proper implementation of these reforms in order to give\nthe United Nations reliable and effective institutions worthy\nof the vision and aspirations of our peoples.\nThat is why my delegation, while expressing its\nsatisfaction at the evident willingness and efforts of our\nOrganization to adapt to the world\u2019s changes, is in favour\nof strengthening its potential and improving the interaction\namong the various organizations of the United Nations\nsystem and other development partners.\nIn conclusion, the Republic of Guinea would like to\nexpress the hope that courageous and realistic decisions will\ncome out of the work of this session, and it remains\nconvinced that \u2014 apart from divergences and differences\nin approach in the search for ways and means to achieve\nsolutions to the problems facing our States \u2014 the United\nNations community which we constitute will continue to\nwork successfully for peace, security and the well-being of\nall, in the spirit of active solidarity, as the founding fathers\nof this Organization dreamed.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Government\nof Kenya, I should like to convey to you, Sir, my sincere\ncongratulations and best wishes on your unanimous election\nas President of this session of the Assembly. Your election\nto this high office is a fitting testimony to Malaysia\u2019s\ncommitment to, and support for, the United Nations. Your\ncountry has been an ardent champion of the cause of\ndeveloping countries. I am confident that your sterling\nqualities and versatile diplomatic capabilities will steer this\nOrganization to greater heights.\nI also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, who presided over the last\nsession with great skill and dedication.\nIn the same vein, allow me to reiterate my\ndelegation\u2019s appreciation to the Secretary-General for the\nable manner in which he has borne the mantle of this\nOrganization. We wish to commend him for his\nachievements during the last five years, despite the many\nobstacles that the Organization has faced.\nSince its inception, the General Assembly has\nprovided Member States with the opportunity to exchange\nviews on issues of common concern to the international\ncommunity, with a view to securing a stable and peaceful\nworld. To this end, I wish to assure you, Sir, of Kenya\u2019s\ncommitment and determination to work together with\nother Member States in order to realize the Organization\u2019s\nideals and objectives. We believe that the success of the\nUnited Nations depends on the collective resolve of its\nMembers.\nThe international community still faces a number of\nconflicts that are of great concern, as they continue to\nundermine international peace and security. We are\npainfully reminded by history that good and evil coexist,\nand that without societal restraints, humanity is in eternal\ndanger. As we approach the twenty-first century, and with\nthe cold war behind us, the international community now\nfaces numerous new and complex challenges posed by\nglobalization, fragmentation, democratization and\nmarginalization. There is a need to redesign the\ninternational order to meet these challenges. In this\nregard, we welcome the recent initiatives by the\nOrganization to strengthen its conflict-prevention\nmechanisms and to promote preventive diplomacy and\nconfidence-building measures.\nThe scourge of armed conflicts in certain parts of\nAfrica constitutes one of the most urgent socio-political\nproblems facing the continent, resulting in a serious threat\nto security, social cohesion and economic progress. These\nconflicts have posed serious challenges primarily due to\nthe complexities associated with their internal character.\nInter- and intra-State conflicts have led to a multitude of\nproblems, including loss of life, destruction of property,\npoverty, ethnic tensions and underdevelopment in the\ncountries where they occur.\n5\n\n\nThese conflicts have been compounded by natural\ncalamities resulting in a large number of refugees and\ndisplaced persons. We wish to reiterate our call to the\ninternational community to increase its support in\nalleviating the suffering of these people.\nSince the inception of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) in 1963, we have witnessed no less than 20\nfull-fledged civil wars on the African continent. Over the\nyears, some of these wars have been resolved, while others\nhave intensified. We are pleased that peace has been\nachieved in most parts of Africa. Sadly, however, there are\nstill some intractable conflicts going on, notably in Burundi,\nthe Sudan, Somalia and Liberia.\nThe conflict in Burundi, with its accompanying ethnic\ncharacter, is of great concern to Kenya and the countries of\nthe subregion. The recent coup d\u2019etat in that country, which\noverthrew a constitutionally established Government, has\ncompounded the political crisis. It negates the efforts of the\nOAU to bring to an end the era of military coups which\nhave bedeviled the continent and remains an obstacle to\nAfrica\u2019s quest for peace and stability.\nIn their efforts to find a lasting political settlement, the\ncountries of the subregion \u2014 Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania,\nUganda, Zaire and Kenya \u2014 held a series of meetings\nculminating in the imposition of sanctions against that\nsisterly country. These sanctions are aimed at putting\npressure on the new regime to restore a democratically\nelected Assembly, unban political parties and enter into\nunconditional negotiations with all parties to the conflict.\nWhile we welcome the recent Security Council\nresolution on Burundi, we appeal to the Council to take\nmore decisive steps to ensure that the leaders in Burundi\ncomply with the peace initiative of the second regional\nsummit on Burundi held in Arusha. In this regard, my\ndelegation wishes to take this opportunity to commend the\nefforts of Julius Nyerere, former President of the United\nRepublic of Tanzania, who continues to facilitate the peace\nprocess in Burundi. We take this opportunity to urge the\ninternational community to render support to these\nmeasures and initiatives.\nThe situation in Somalia continues to be worrisome.\nThe prolonged nature of this conflict, with its\naccompanying negative effects on the neighbouring\ncountries, remains a matter of great concern to my country.\nIt is now time for the international community to bring\npressure to bear on the Somali faction leaders to come to\nthe negotiating table and reach agreement that will, once\nand for all, relieve the agony and suffering of the Somali\npeople. Kenya will continue to provide its cooperation\nand support.\nWith respect to the search for a durable peace in the\nSudan, Kenya, as the Chairman of the Intergovernmental\nAuthority on Drought and Development (IGADD)\nsubcommittee on the peace initiative on Sudan, is working\ntogether with the other member States to find appropriate\nremedies to the conflict. While there are no easy solutions\nto this conflict, the countries of the region, which remain\nseized of the matter, are hopeful that, through preventive\ndiplomacy, there will soon be an end to the atrocities and\nthat peace will be restored in the Sudan as well.\nI wish to take this opportunity to express the\nappreciation of my Government for the confidence the\nOAU has bestowed upon my country by endorsing Kenya\nas the sole candidate for the non-permanent seat in the\nSecurity Council allocated to Africa for the period\n1997-1998 at the elections to be held later this year. The\nelection of Kenya to the Council will provide us with the\nopportunity to contribute even further to the continued\nsearch for international peace and security.\nThe maintenance of international peace and security\nis a collective responsibility of us all. It was with this in\nmind that the General Assembly at its fiftieth session\nurged the Conference on Disarmament to conclude the\nnegotiations for a comprehensive and truly verifiable\ntreaty banning all nuclear testing. It was also with this\nunderstanding and expectation that Kenya and other\nAfrican countries affirmed their commitment to outlawing\nnuclear testing and the possession of nuclear weapons on\nthe African continent. Towards this end, the Pelindaba\nTreaty was signed in Cairo on 11 April 1996, declaring\nAfrica a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. We commend\nsimilar efforts that have been undertaken to declare other\nregions nuclear-free zones.\nKenya reaffirms its commitment to total nuclear\ndisarmament. There is no longer any justification for the\npossession of nuclear weapons nor for their testing. We\nmust work towards the achievement of the goal of\ncomplete elimination of all nuclear weapons within a\ngiven time-frame. Kenya therefore welcomes the recent\nconclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty as an important step in this direction.\nThe United Nations has a critical role to play in\nconsensus- building in international economic cooperation.\nKenya is confident that the Organization will continue to\n6\n\n\nuphold its principles of universality, sovereignty and\nmultilateralism in its decisions and operational activities.\nWe are of the view that the United Nations should be\nstrengthened in order effectively to carry out its mandate\nand follow-up on the programmes of action that have been\nagreed upon at the various international conferences. The\ncontinuum of global conferences in recent years has\nenabled us to create a new vision of cooperation towards\nglobal development needs. Indeed, the most recent of these,\nthe United Nations Conference on Human Settlements\n(Habitat II), which took place in Istanbul, Turkey, endorsed\nthe need for quick action in addressing the dual objectives\nof adequate shelter for all and sustainable human\nsettlements. To realize these objectives, the Conference\ncalled for new and additional resources and for the\nstrengthening of the United Nations Centre for Human\nSettlements in order for it effectively to carry out its\nmandate. In this context, Kenya believes that, for this to\nbecome a reality, international commitment is imperative.\nWe also view the World Food Summit to be held in\nRome this year as a major United Nations conference that\nwill address itself to the primary needs of mankind by\nensuring food security and sustainable development. We\nexpect the international community to render appropriate\nsupport in order to realize these objectives.\nWhile most developing countries continue in their\nstrenuous economic reform efforts, the question of the debt\nburden and debt servicing remains a major obstacle. Kenya\ncalls for an early consensus on debt relief, reduction and\npossible cancellation. It is expected that the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions will quickly conclude their consultations on the\nsteps to be taken to address the debt problem of developing\ncountries. These should include additional innovative\nmeasures that would provide social safety nets to vulnerable\ngroups, particularly children, women and the poor.\nMy own country, Kenya, under the leadership of\nPresident Daniel arap Moi, has undertaken far-reaching\npolitical and economic reforms. These reforms have been\nundertaken at painful costs and with adverse effects on the\npopulation. However, after suffering a decline in economic\ngrowth as a result of the stringent reform measures, our\neconomy is now on the path of recovery and has registered\na growth rate of between 5 and 6 per cent this year. The\nKenyan economy is now totally liberalized. All foreign\nexchange restrictions have been abolished, making Kenya\none of the most attractive investment destinations anywhere\nin the world. In order to achieve higher growth and to\nmaintain the development momentum, Kenya appeals for\nthe continued commitment, understanding and support of\nour development partners.\nWe are also committed to regional integration and\nthe widening of economic space, designed to integrate\nnational economies into formal groupings, centring on\ntrading blocs. The inauguration of the East African\nCooperation in Arusha early this year by the three Heads\nof State of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, marks an\nimportant milestone in our efforts towards political and\nsocio-economic integration. This arrangement, which\nbrings together a population of over 70 million people,\nhas created vast opportunities for investment in our\nsubregion. It also constitutes an important building block\ntowards the realization of the African economic\ncommunity.\nWe have also recently revitalized IGADD and\nexpanded its mandate to focus on issues of development\nand conflict prevention, management and resolution. The\nrevitalized IGADD will require full support from our\ndevelopment partners for a speedy implementation of the\nregional initiatives. In the wider subregion, the Common\nMarket for Eastern and Southern Africa continues to be\nthe main vehicle for regional integration in eastern and\nsouthern Africa.\nKenya\u2019s greatest asset is its environment. The herds\nof wildlife which migrate through the plains, the\nmysterious forests, the snow-peaked mountains, the\nancient lakes and the extraordinary landscapes of the\nGreat Rift Valley have attracted generations of visitors\nand have become to many a symbol of the beauty and\npurity of the African continent. Throughout the world,\nspace is being taken up for development purposes by\nexpanding populations. Inappropriate land practices run\ncounter to the conservation of natural resources. Precious\nspecies are becoming either endangered or indeed extinct.\nIn Kenya, our policies have been designed to\npreserve the environment as a common heritage for\nmankind. We have resisted all pressures against\nconservation and have created a sanctuary for a great\nvariety of biodiversity in all its grandeur. Furthermore, the\nGovernment of Kenya has recently initiated major\ninnovative steps that will ensure the protection of the\necosystem for the enjoyment of future generations. These\ninclude public awareness, environmental education, and,\nmost importantly, the Great Rift Valley Conservancy\nProgramme, which will ensure integrated utilization of\nland. We wish to appeal to the international community\nto make available the necessary resources to augment\n7\n\n\nsuch efforts, in order to realize the objective of sustainable\ndevelopment as called for in Agenda 21.\nIn the face of the complex nature of emerging\nproblems in the world today, the demands on the United\nNations continue to increase as Member States expect more\nand more from it. The pressures of facilitating conflict\nresolution and peacekeeping, promoting sustainable\ndevelopment and combating social problems associated with\npoverty, disease and famine, have made the demands even\nmore urgent.\nWe therefore welcome efforts to reform the United\nNations so that it can serve the interests of Member States\nmore effectively. However, as the United Nations continues\nin its reform endeavours, the General Assembly must be\ngiven greater visibility and authority. The Security Council\nmust be reformed to reflect the principles of democracy,\ntransparency and equitable representation. My delegation\nwishes to urge Member States to exercise greater flexibility\non the various innovative positions with regard to reform of\nthe Security Council in order to reach an early consensus.\nSimilarly, in undertaking financial reforms, bold and\npractical measures are necessary to ensure adequate and\npredictable resources. The obligation of Member States to\npay their assessed contributions for the regular and\npeacekeeping budgets, in full, on time and without\nconditions, cannot be overemphasized.\nWe wish to underscore that reform cannot be an end\nin itself but must be seen as a necessary tool for enabling\nthe Organization to achieve its objectives in a more\nefficient and cost-effective manner.\nWe welcome the recent arrangements to establish\nNairobi as the location of one of the four United Nations\nCentres \u2014 the only one in the whole of the developing\nworld. We regret, however, that the two United Nations\nprogrammes with their Headquarters in Nairobi continue to\nsuffer from lack of adequate funding and capacity\nunderutilization, despite their enormous potential.\nThe recent tendency to locate environment-related\nsecretariats away from Nairobi has had a negative effect on\nthe strengthening of the Centre and should be discouraged.\nWe are convinced that institutional linkage is a vital\ncomponent for the enhancement of efficiency and capacity-\nutilization of the limited resources. In this respect, Kenya\nwishes to record its appreciation to the Secretary-General\nfor holding the meeting of the Administrative Committee on\nCoordination in Nairobi in April 1996 \u2014 a first for the\ndeveloping world. We in Africa were particularly proud to\nhost that high-level meeting, which took place\nimmediately after the Secretary-General launched the\nUnited Nations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa.\nFinally, we wish to take this opportunity to\ncommend the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, for initiating far-reaching reforms within the\nUnited Nations system since his assumption of the high\noffice of chief executive of the Organization. My\ndelegation wishes to express its satisfaction at his untiring\nefforts to steer the Organization to greater heights as we\nmove into the next century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, at the outset, to warmly congratulate\nHis Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail, on behalf of the\nCambodian delegation, on his election to the post of\nPresident of this Assembly. His election is a tribute to his\nprofessionalism, as well as to his country, Malaysia, with\nwhich Cambodia has traditionally entertained close and\ncordial relations. My delegation is convinced that with his\ncompetence and experience, Ambassador Ismail will guide\nour session with wisdom and perspicacity to a successful\nconclusion.\nMy delegation would also like to congratulate and\nthank His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of\nPortugal for his successful presidency of the General\nAssembly\u2019s fiftieth session.\nI wish also to take this opportunity to express our deep\nappreciation to an individual to whom the Royal Kingdom\nof Cambodia owes profound gratitude for the role he has\nplayed in the peace process in our country \u2014 the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali \u2014 for his performance and sincere dedication in\naccomplishing this lofty mission.\n(spoke in English)\nThe forthcoming 23 October will be the fifth\nanniversary of the signing of the Agreement on a\nComprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia\nConflict. The Royal Government and people of Cambodia\nwill mark this historic event with a nationwide celebration.\nThe Agreement was forged\n\u201cto maintain, preserve and defend the sovereignty,\nindependence, territorial integrity and inviolability,\nneutrality and national unity of Cambodia\u201d (Agreement\non a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the\nCambodia Conflict, DPI/1180-92077, p. 8, para. 3)\nthrough the restoration of peace and the promotion of\nnational reconciliation in the country. The Cambodian\npeople will always remember the sacrifices made by the\ninternational community on their behalf, especially those\neminent persons who dedicated themselves to the cause of\npeace and democracy in our country. We are indeed\nindebted to them all and remain deeply grateful for their\ncontinued contribution to the reconstruction and\ndevelopment of Cambodia, allowing it once more to take\nits proper place in the concert of nations.\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia, presided over\nby His Royal Highness Samdech Krom Preah Norodom\nRanariddh and His Excellency Samdech Hun Sen, was\nborn of a free and fair election organized and supervised\nby the United Nations in May 1993. It is now barely three\nyears old, but thanks to the determination of the\nCambodian people and the invaluable assistance and\nsupport given by this world body and its agencies, other\ninternational organizations and friendly countries, the\nrebuilding of Cambodia has proceeded apace.\nIn \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d, His Excellency the\nSecretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali spoke of the\nneed for the United Nations to give careful consideration\nto the requirements of post-conflict peace-building. As\ncan be seen from the Cambodian experience, this is a\ncomplex and multifaceted process. The Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Representative in Cambodia The Honourable\nBenny Widyono commented in a recent article that\n\u201cpost-conflict peace-building is not just a collection\nof disjointed activities. It requires a holistic concept\nencompassing political, institutional, legal, economic\nand social objectives.\u201d\nThis holistic approach has also been very rapidly\nrecognized by the Royal Government. Nine months after\nthe general elections, it launched the National Programme\nfor the Rehabilitation and the Development of Cambodia,\nin February 1994. At the same time, it was able to ensure\npolitical stability, improve security and engineer a rapid\neconomic recovery, as reflected by a strong gross\ndomestic product growth of 7.6 per cent, an inflation rate\nkept at 3.5 per cent and a stable exchange rate of the\nnational currency throughout 1995. These figures,\ncombined with a liberal investment law and a low gross\ndomestic product of $287 per capita, are providing strong\nincentives for foreign direct investment, in particular now\n13\n\n\nthat Cambodia enjoys most-favoured-nation status with the\nUnited States, the European Union and other important\ncountries in the world. Soon Cambodia hopes to obtain\nGeneralized System of Preferences status.\nIn pursuing its aims of structural reforms and\ndevelopment while seeking to improve the quality of life of\nits citizens, the Royal Government is conscious of the need\nfor environmental protection. Cambodia has become a\nsignatory of the United Nations Convention on Biological\nDiversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification in\nThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\nDesertification. The Government is ever mindful of its\nresponsibility to protect Cambodia\u2019s rich natural heritage,\nin the interests both of its people and of the world at large.\nTherefore, as stated by the First Prime Minister at the First\nConsultative Group Meeting, held last July in Tokyo, the\nRoyal Government is committed to implementing a\nsustainable and transparent forest policy in line with the\nrecommendations put forward in a joint study made by the\nWorld Bank, the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\nUnited Nations (FAO).\nBeing profoundly conscious that development requires\nsecurity, problems linked with the Khmer Rouge have to be\naddressed through their reintegration into the national fold,\nand through the long-term policy of development of rural\nareas. Military operations near the northwestern border are\ndesigned to gradually reduce the nuisance they pose and to\nconvince them to join the national community. National\nunity remains the target of the Cambodian Government.\nThe recent massive breakaway of the core groups of the\nKhmer Rouge testifies to the correctness of the Royal\nGovernment\u2019s approach.\nRecognizing that Cambodia\u2019s tragic recent history\nrequires special measures to assure the protection of human\nrights and the non-return to the policies and practices of the\npast, the Royal Government has pursued an active policy to\nensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms\nfor all in Cambodia without discrimination as to race, sex\nor religion. In these efforts, it has received the technical\nassistance of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights,\nfor which the Royal Government is greatly appreciative. In\nparticular, Cambodia acknowledges the valued contribution\nof the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for\nHuman Rights, Ambassador Thomas Hammarberg.\nMindful that human rights encompass political rights,\nthe Kingdom of Cambodia adopted a policy of liberal\ndemocracy and pluralism, as stated in article 51 of the\nConstitution of the Kingdom, in 1993. This includes the\nfree exercise of political choice. In respect of its solemn\ncommitment to the Constitution, the Royal Government\nis making preparations for the holding of local elections\nin 1997 and national elections in 1998. To this end, it\nwelcomes international technical and financial assistance,\nas well as international observers.\nThe achievements of the Royal Government in a\nshort period of time have given it the confidence to\npursue efforts towards the declared aims of building a\nState governed by the rule of law, a market system that\nsecures social benefits and ensuring the long term and\nsustainable development of the national economy within\nthe framework of regional integration. Hence, last April,\nCambodia submitted its official request for full\nmembership in the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN) by July 1997, in the recognition that\nASEAN is the vehicle for peace, security, stability, shared\nopportunities and common prosperity in the region of\nSouth-East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region at large.\nCambodia also takes note that the ASEAN Regional\nForum is an invaluable setting to discuss in a frank and\nfriendly manner security issues of common concern and\ninterest to all participants in the Forum, whether large or\nsmall countries around the world. The ASEAN Regional\nForum has in fact already provided a sense of mutual\nconfidence, as reflected in the comfort felt by all the\nsenior officials and high representatives of the\nparticipating countries. It can be viewed as a first step in\npreventive, quiet diplomacy, thereby paving the way for\nagreements on substantive issues in the coming years\nbased on the traditional consensus principle, which\ncharacterizes ASEAN.\nCambodia is particularly proud to be able to\nassociate itself with all the countries in the region and to\nsubstantially contribute to regional and world peace\nthrough the signing of the South-East Asia Nuclear-\nWeapon-Free Zone Treaty on 15 December 1995. This\nmarks real progress towards the creation of a zone of\npeace, freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia.\nThrough the review of the Protocol to the Treaty, it is our\nearnest hope that all nuclear-weapon States will accede to\nthe Treaty, in line with the aspirations of the peoples of\nSouth-East Asia for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in this\npart of the world.\nCambodia\u2019s position on the question of nuclear\nweapons has been and remains that a complete prohibition\nof nuclear weapons and their destruction are basic to\n14\n\n\nworld peace. Thus, a complete test ban will lead towards\nthe ultimate objective of complete nuclear disarmament.\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia is proud to have been able to\nco-sponsor and sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty, considered a significant step towards promoting\nnuclear disarmament. This will be the greatest service that\nour generation can perform to free future generations from\nthe terrible prospect of a world holocaust.\nWhile we are addressing the issue of the CTBT and\nthe ban on weapons of mass destruction, we should not\noverlook the issue of landmines in various parts of the\nworld. Cambodia is the hardest hit nation in the world. The\nRoyal Government and the people of Cambodia pay great\ntribute to all the generous donor countries that have assisted\nus in our efforts to rid the country of the scourge of\nlandmines. But how many millions of these cold, cruel and\nsilent enemies still await our unsuspecting and innocent\ncivilian population in remote areas of the country near the\nwestern border? Banning them is an easy job. We need\ninternational support to fully eradicate them.\nIn his message to the Review Conference of the States\nParties to the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional\nWeapons last April, His Majesty Preah Bat Samdech Preah\nNorodom Sihanouk Varman, King of Cambodia, appealed\nto all countries and peoples, international organizations,\nStates and Governments to take, in a universal consensus,\nconcrete measures towards definitively outlawing, as soon\nas possible, the production, export, utilization and sale of\nmines.\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia is therefore gratified by\nthe recent Chairman\u2019s statement for the Third ASEAN\nRegional Forum held last July in Jakarta. On the issue of\nthe global elimination of anti-personnel mines, the Forum\nwelcomed the decisions of several States to impose\nmoratoria and bans on the production, export and\noperational use of these weapons. It recognized the need,\nfollowing conflict, for reinforcing international support for\nefforts to detect and remove landmines and to assist\nvictims. Cambodia welcomes the initiatives of the Federal\nRepublic of Germany and of Canada in this General\nAssembly and gives its full support to the proposed\nresolutions.\nPermit me to inform you, Sir, and all distinguished\ndelegates that my country is presently facing severe floods\naffecting 1.3 million people, or one tenth of our population.\nOn behalf of the Royal Government of Cambodia and on\nmy own behalf, I would like to sincerely and deeply thank\nthe friendly Governments that have immediately given\ngenerous humanitarian assistance to our afflicted people.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to our\nother friends to help relieve this blight.\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia recognizes the need to\nfocus attention on such issues as the trafficking in\nnarcotics and other criminal behaviour, which transcend\nnational borders and which can so intimately affect the\nlives of each one of our citizens and undermine our social\nstructures. Such transnational issues do not appear\namenable to resolution other than by immediate ongoing\nmanagement through shared information and coordination.\nOf particularly urgent concern is the issue of drug\ntrafficking.\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia is a victim of a rapid\nescalation in the traffic of drugs transiting through its\nterritory. Unfortunately, Cambodia at present lacks the\nappropriate legal, technical and financial means to deal\neffectively with this problem. It nevertheless affirms its\nstrong commitment to drug control through effective\ninternational cooperation. The Royal Government wishes\nsincerely to thank the United States of America for its\nstrong support under the United States-Cambodia\nAgreement to Counter Narcotics.\nCambodia is pleased with the decision taken by the\nThird ASEAN Regional Forum to consider at the next\nmeeting the question of drug trafficking and other related\ntransnational issues such as economic crimes, including\nmoney laundering, which could constitute threats to the\nsecurity of the countries of the region.\nThrough the good offices of the United Nations,\nmultilateral approaches to problems have provided useful\nsources of information and highlighted issues close to the\nhearts of many of our citizens. The past summit\nconferences in Cairo, Copenhagen, Beijing and Istanbul\nhave contributed to the promotion of gender equality, and\nhave given recognition to the role of women and children,\nthe improvement of the quality of life through health care\nand adequate housing, respect for human rights, and\nprotection of the environment.\nA further vital, and perhaps fundamental, issue for\nthe attention of every member of the international\ncommunity must be that of the widening gap between rich\nand poor nations. This gap and its effects on the quality\nof life of the citizens of the developing world is directly\nrelated to the nature, organization and health of the world\neconomy. Vital decisions determining the shape and\nnature of the world economy are, however, well outside\n15\n\n\nthe control of a vast majority of nations, particularly those\nin the third world.\nSince the Non-Aligned Summit in Jakarta in 1992, no\nindications have been observed of a rapid and solid\nrecovery in the world economy. Instabilities spread more\nquickly from one country to another, particularly to\ndeveloping countries, which are now more vulnerable and\nsensitive to external factors. The continuing trend towards\na global economy, with the increasingly free flow of capital\nthroughout the world without reference to national borders,\nmeans that the ebbs and flows of the world economy have\nan almost immediate effect around the world. For many\npoorer nations, this has resulted in an increased national\ndebt burden with the consequence of greater instability in\nthe daily lives of their citizens.\nNotions of competition are not realistic for countries\nthat from the outset have a mammoth burden of debt,\nlimited access to technology, and populations ill-equipped\nto meet the challenges of the global economy. It is\nCambodia\u2019s strong hope that through the United Nations we\ncan go a long way towards ameliorating this situation,\nwhich is already at a crisis point for many nations in the\nworld community.\nTherefore, the democratization of international\neconomic relations is essential to ensure that the\ndevelopment interests of developing countries will be taken\nfully into account. In this regard, it is also essential to place\ndevelopment cooperation at the centre of the United Nations\nmandate, role and functions. To do this, the United Nations\nitself needs to begin the process of reform so that it is\nbetter able to deal with the conditions of the new global\neconomy. The United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the United Nations Industrial\nDevelopment Organization should play a key role as focal\npoints of the United Nations system in the areas of trade\nand development of developing countries. UNCTAD, in\nparticular, needs to study trends and issues in the world\neconomy, especially those that have an impact on\ndeveloping countries, and propose policies and measures\nthat can address projected problems. For instance,\nGeneralized Special Preference (GSP) donors should\nsimplify and harmonize the rules of origin. By the same\ntoken, all political conditions attached to international trade,\ndevelopment assistance and investment should cease. They\nrepresent, in fact, a new wave of protectionism.\n(spoke in French)\nThe delegation of Cambodia is deeply concerned at\nthe financial crisis in the United Nations today. With its\nmodest resources, Cambodia intends to meet its\nresponsibilities to do what it can to ease the financial\ncrisis. But if this Organization is to continue to exist true\nto the spirit of its Charter, an equitable and fair solution\nmust be found, taking into account the need for sweeping\nreform in United Nations structures which must reflect the\nrapid changes in various parts of the world that have\ntaken place since the end of the cold war.\nThe broad reforms and restructuring of the United\nNations must also extend to the Security Council to\nensure that its work is both democratic and more\neffective. In particular, Cambodia supports closer relations\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly\nthrough greater accountability of the Council to the\nAssembly. Priority must be given to reform in economic,\nsocial and other areas so as better to meet the challenges\nand take account of the economic priorities of developing\ncountries against the backdrop of globalization.\nAs one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned\nMovement in 1956 in Brioni, Yugoslavia, Cambodia has\nconsistently worked to promote solidarity among\nMembers and cooperate in the search for lasting peace in\nthe world and economic development that goes hand in\nhand with social justice for all humankind.\nAs His Majesty the King emphasized in his message\non the thirty-fifth anniversary of its creation, the Non-\nAligned Movement is currently meeting challenges unlike\nthose that existed when it was established. Many lofty\naspirations for national independence and freedom have\nbecome fact, but as His Majesty said:\n\u201cThe majority of our members still have to deal with\nhuge problems caused by unemployment, poverty,\nfamine, drought, landmines, illiteracy, deforestation,\nracial discrimination and terrorism. We must\ntherefore try to reduce military expenditure and the\nproduction of landmines in order to devote our\nnational resources to the economic and social\ndevelopment of our peoples.\u201d\nIn recent years, the world has seen several\ndevelopments regarding the strengthening of regional\nsecurity and political stability. First of all, the Kingdom\nof Cambodia wishes sincerely to welcome the\nestablishment of the Southern Philippines Council for\nPeace and Development and the peace process in\nMindanao. It fully supports the peace agreements\n16\n\n\nconcluded between the Government of the Philippines and\nthe Moro National Liberation Front on 2 September 1996.\nThese agreements will undoubtedly contribute to an end to\nthe conflict in the southern Philippines, bringing both\nlasting peace to Mindanao and prosperity and national\nharmony to the fraternal people of the Philippines.\nCambodia welcomes the Dayton Peace Agreement and\nthe signing on 14 December 1995 in Paris of the General\nFramework for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (the\nFramework Agreement) between the Republic of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and other concerned parties.\nCambodia welcomes the announcement of the end of\nthe war in Chechnya, thereby ending the suffering of the\nwarring parties, and particularly the innocent civilian\npopulation.\nCambodia welcomes progress made since August 1995\nin the Middle East peace process, particularly the\nimplementation of the Declaration of Principles on Interim\nSelf-Government Arrangements between the Palestine\nLiberation Organization and Israel, the Israeli-Palestinian\nInterim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of\n28 September 1995, the first Palestinian elections on 20\nJanuary 1996, as well as the beginning of negotiations on\nthe final status between the Palestinians and Israelis in Taba\nin May 1996. Cambodia calls for the continuation of the\npeace talks, bearing in mind the inalienable right of the\nPalestinian people to self-determination and to an\nindependent State on its national territory with the support\nof the international community.\nMy country is deeply concerned at the recent situation\nin Afghanistan where war continues to bring death and\ndevastation. We hope that our Afghan brothers will be able\nto overcome their differences and will soon find the path to\ndialogue.\nWith regard to the situation on the Korean peninsula,\nCambodia supports the reunification efforts of the Korean\npeoples on the basis of the principles set forth in the Joint\nDeclaration on Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula of\n4 July 1972 and the accord of February 1992. We also\nwelcome initiatives to formulate a definitive peace\nagreement promoting solid peace and security on the\npeninsula.\nIn respect of Africa, the Royal Government of\nCambodia welcomes the adoption by the General Assembly\nof resolution 49/142. We are aware of the tremendous\ndifficulties facing African States in bringing development\nand prosperity to their respective peoples. Cambodia calls\nfor the speedy implementation of the United Nations New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s and\nthe consolidation of efforts to diversify the African\neconomy. We hope that with the helping hand of the\ninternational community, particularly the donor countries,\nthis great continent will profit from the opportunities\navailable to it and join in the efforts to achieve\nsustainable development, a major challenge facing all the\ncountries of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, allow me, Sir,\nto say how gratified we are to see you presiding over this\nAssembly. Your election to that high office is a well-\ndeserved recognition of your personal qualities and\nexperience, and also of Malaysia\u2019s important role in this\nOrganization and in the international arena. I have no\ndoubt that you will lead the work of this Assembly to a\nfruitful conclusion.\nIt is also my privilege to pay tribute to your\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral\nof Portugal, for the exemplary manner in which he\ndischarged his onerous responsibilities.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to pay\ntribute to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his untiring efforts in the\ncause of peace and development. While we realize the\ndifficulties and the complexity of the challenges that lie\nahead in the years to come, we remain confident in his\nwisdom and competence in steering this universal\nOrganization towards the fulfilment of its responsibilities\nin accordance with the principles of the Charter. My\ndelegation sincerely wishes him every success in his\nendeavours.\nLast year, we proudly celebrated 50 years of\nachievements. As we slowly begin the countdown to the\ncentenary celebration of the United Nations, on behalf of\nthe generations to come, we see ourselves coincidentally\non the threshold of a new century as well. My delegation\nfeels that this is a unique opportunity for all of us to\nrededicate ourselves to the purposes and principles of the\nCharter with greater determination and commitment to\nstrengthening the United Nations so that the menacing\ntrends in human relations which caused so much misery\nand destruction in the past can be halted and reversed,\nand that existing inequalities among nations and peoples\ncan be eliminated, creating a new atmosphere of tolerance\nand mutual respect, and a new sense of shared\nresponsibility for development and progress.\n6\n\n\nOver the past 50 years, the Organization has grown\nfourfold and has become the most representative \u2014\ncertainly the only universal \u2014 institution serving the\npurpose of maintaining international peace and security.\nThis truly global Organization has an immense capability to\nmobilize international efforts to deal with global problems\nrelating to economic, social and environmental issues. It\nalso possesses the potency to promote universal standards\nof human rights despite differences in the historical, cultural\nand religious backgrounds of nations and communities.\nAdmittedly, the Organization has experienced rough times\nand has suffered several setbacks during the course of its\nexistence. However, with the demise of the cold war that\nhaunted the Organization for nearly four decades, a more\nfavourable environment has emerged, enabling us to\nrespond collectively to the challenges of the future.\nMy country is among the smallest and the least\ndeveloped countries of this Organization. For us, the United\nNations is extremely important in safeguarding our\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. For us,\nit is the protector of freedom and justice, particularly for\nthe weak and the vulnerable. It is also the beacon of hope\nfor hundreds of millions of people in the developing world\nfor a better future free from hunger and disease. Therefore,\nwe feel the need to steadily strengthen, revitalize and\nreform the Organization in order to make it more effective,\nmore democratic, and ready to react and respond without\nbias to situations that threaten international peace and\nsecurity.\nIt was with this in mind that we joined in the\ninitiative, way back in 1979, to include on the agenda an\nitem on the question of equitable representation on and\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council. My\ndelegation welcomes the reform and adjustment process that\nis now under way and sincerely hopes that the process will\nnot compromise the principles of the Charter, which\nemphasize multilateralism, mutual respect and shared\ninterests, including the interests of small States. In this\ncontext, my delegation feels that the proposal made by Italy\nin the Working Group on the reform and restructuring of\nthe Security Council deserves our attention and careful\nconsideration. There is no doubt that the more\nrepresentative the United Nations is, the more democratic\nit will be; and that the more accountable the United Nations\nis, the more effective it will be, thus benefitting us all,\nsmall or large, weak or powerful, rich or poor.\nReforming the Organization alone will not serve the\ndesired purposes unless the commitment of Member\nStates to uphold and abide by the principles of the\nCharter and their obligations is fulfilled. We are\nconcerned that the Organization is undergoing the worst\nfinancial crisis in its history. We are reminded that the\nmain cause of the financial predicament is the failure of\nMember States to meet their financial obligations on time\nand in full. While my delegation has every sympathy\ntowards those countries which have genuine difficulties,\nwe note that by far the greater number of cases in arrears\nare those which have the capability to pay. We note with\ndisappointment that the richest Member of this\nOrganization is among those who fail or refuse to pay\ntheir dues. It is ironic that the effects of this severe\nfinancial crisis have to be borne most adversely by the\nsmaller and the poorer States of the Organization, which\nin many cases are obligated under the current scale of\nassessments to pay more than their fair share. In spite of\nits limited resources and the frequent economic\ndifficulties it faces, I am pleased to say that my country\ncontinues to pay its share of contribution in full, as we\nare convinced that only resources and efforts can produce\nresults.\nMeanwhile my delegation believes that the efforts of\nthe international community to reform the administrative\nand budgetary functioning of the United Nations should\naim at utilizing the scarce resources of the Organization\nmore efficiently. In this regard, the efforts of the\nSecretary-General to achieve a more lean and effective\nSecretariat geared to take on the challenging tasks\nentrusted to it warrant recognition. We also welcome the\nrecent measures towards eliminating redundancy,\nduplication and waste, for only a sound organization can\nensure the success of its mission.\nThe world has never offered a greater opportunity\nthan today to address critical developmental problems and\nchallenges. The international community has emphasized\nthe importance of a revitalized and enhanced system of\ninternational cooperation for development. The sheer\nnumber of major international conferences held during the\npast few years and the collective resolve documented\noffer adequate testimony to this strong desire. The\noutcome of these conferences fostered a common concept\nof sustainable economic development for the betterment\nof mankind as a whole. However, despite all these\npositive developments on the international economic and\nsocial scene, my delegation is convinced that unless these\nambitious programmes are backed by the necessary\nresources and political will, no change can be achieved.\n7\n\n\nWe also feel that all activities of international economic and\ndevelopment cooperation, including those undertaken by the\nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\nOrganization, must be coordinated and closely linked with\nthe development strategies and programmes of the United\nNations system. After all, this Organization remains the\nmost representative institution.\nWhile the globalization and liberalization of the world\neconomy gave some developing countries the opportunity\nto assume a more prominent status in the world economy,\nthe least-developed countries \u2014 a category to which my\ncountry unfortunately belongs \u2014 continued to be\nmarginalized. The standard of living in least-developed\ncountries has in effect declined over the years, and the\npoverty level has intensified in many of these countries due\nto indolent economic growth, which in turn was subject to\noutside factors. The overall decline in official development\nassistance over the years has further aggravated the\nconditions of the least-developed countries at a time when\naid is most needed.\nThis unfavourable situation, if allowed to drag on,\ncould be calamitous for countries, such as the Maldives,\nwith severe resource constraints and fragile infrastructures.\nFor this reason, my delegation can only appeal for priority\naction on various international development commitments,\nsuch as the Paris Declaration and Programme of Action for\nLeast Developed Countries for the 1990s. These have been\nendorsed at various recent global conferences. Admittedly,\nliberalization of trade has resulted in greater trade.\nHowever, liberalization has also meant the loss of the only\nadvantage that the least-developed countries had \u2014 their\nprivileged status \u2014 and the consequent loss of their\nmarkets. Liberalization has therefore, in effect, contributed\nto the marginalization of many developing countries.\nThe inherent obstacles facing small States, particularly\nsmall island States, and their vulnerability, deserve special\nattention. Small island States like my own require favoured\ntreatment to prevent them from slipping back from their\nwell-earned achievements.\nIn this context, I also wish to express the need for an\nincisive examination of the criteria for least-developed-\ncountry status and related issues, including the graduation\nprocess, in order to do justice to the poorest among the\npoor countries when the criteria come up for review next\nyear. The per capita index used to classify countries for\nassistance purposes is no longer adequate, particularly in\nthe case of small States. It fails to capture the special\nproblems faced by these countries and their vulnerability to\nexternal shocks. In this context, the development and use\nof a vulnerability index, along with other criteria, may be\nfeasible in order to minimize these inadequacies.\nOn the other hand, many of the poorest countries are\nstill entangled in a web of external debt from which they\nare unlikely ever to be able to free themselves. My\ndelegation believes that more steps should be taken to lift\nthe debt burden from the poorest and most indebted\ncountries by increasing the debt relief measures of\nbilateral creditors and by greater involvement of\nmultilateral agencies in this responsibility. The developed\ncountries can also help in eliminating the situation by\ndemolishing the barriers they still maintain against\nimports from the less developed countries, in particular\nthose which are suffering from the burdens of external\ndebt.\nPoverty cannot be eliminated through charity, but\nonly through cooperation. In this context, we welcome the\nproposal of the countries of the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development to cut the\nnumber of people living in absolute poverty by half in the\nnext two decades.\nWe are fully committed to the efforts of the\ninternational community to safeguard the global\nenvironment, especially by building the capacity of the\nUnited Nations to promote sustainable development for\nall. We welcome the work carried out by the Commission\non Sustainable Development in this regard, and are\nlooking forward to the forthcoming United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development review\nconference in 1997. My delegation is confident that this\nreview process will give the international community the\nopportunity to rededicate itself once again to the\npreservation of the global environment. Only concerted\nefforts on all fronts can produce encouraging results in\nthis daunting challenge. For the Maldives, the\nenvironment is an important issue. We are conscious of\nthe fragility of our islands and we hope to be able to\nprotect them from the potential dangers arising from\nglobal warming and sea-level rise. We are also\ndetermined to keep our country environment-friendly,\nclean and unpolluted. Though the land area we have is so\nlimited, I am happy to mention that in the Maldives we\ninitiated a programme in January this year for planting\none million trees in three years; I presume that if all\ncountries represented here would initiate similar\nprogrammes at a rate of four trees per capita, the world\nwould be greener and cleaner in 10 years.\n8\n\n\nThe importance of disarmament for the preservation\nand maintenance of world peace and security cannot be\noveremphasized. We believe that, with the treaties and\nbilateral agreements concluded, and the ongoing\nnegotiations among the nuclear-weapon States, and also\nwith the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons last year, the international\ncommunity is now reaffirming its commitment to global\ndisarmament and renewing the hopes for the eventual\nelimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\ndestruction. My delegation is pleased about the positive\napproaches taken by the nuclear-weapon States towards the\nadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\ndespite the lack of consensus. We are particularly happy\nthat the Treaty has now been opened for signature.\nWe also would like to praise the role played by the\nUnited Nations in demining and mine clearance, and to\ncongratulate those involved in this dangerous activity for\ntheir bravery and dedication. Anti-personnel landmines have\ncaused enormous human suffering and continue to maim\nand incapacitate countless innocent men, women and\nchildren. We look forward to a worldwide ban on this\nhorrible and inhuman instrument of killing.\nMy delegation is firmly committed to the concept of\nthe establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones\nof peace and would like to take this opportunity to call\nupon all regions, especially the countries in the region of\nSouth Asia, to which we belong, to make every effort to\nbring about the proposed nuclear-weapon-free zone in South\nAsia without any further delay.\nInternal strife generated and fanned by ethnic,\nreligious and other factors is a recent trend, which is\ncausing large conflagrations in some parts of the world.\nWhile our Organization gropes for effective mechanisms to\nrespond to such exigencies, we should not ignore the\nserious threats posed by drug traffickers, terrorists and\nmercenaries, particularly to small States. Terrorist incidents\nhave increased alarmingly over the last few years. My\ndelegation is fully convinced that the international\ncommunity should intensify its efforts to combat terrorism.\nThe early entry into force of the Convention against the\nRecruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries\nwill be a step forward in addressing these threats. We urge\nall States which have not yet done so to ratify the\nConvention as early as possible. Similarly, my delegation\nwould like to call for the strongest possible international\naction against drug traffickers, who are not only poisoning\nthe fabric of human life but also draining the potential for\nproductivity and prosperity of nations by exploiting the\nvulnerable elements in our societies.\nThough deeply concerned over the recent violence in\nPalestine and in the occupied lands, which resulted in the\ndeath or injury of hundreds of men, women and children,\nmy delegation is happy to observe that despite the\nnumerous difficulties that exist, the Middle East peace\nprocess is continuing to move forward. We fervently hope\nthat the agreements reached so far will be implemented\nfully and without further delay.\nThe important and critical role played by the\nproponents of the peace process, especially the United\nStates, deserves the appreciation and praise of the\ninternational community and should not be forgotten. My\ndelegation is convinced that their positive role will\ncontinue to be instrumental to the success of the peace\nprocess. At the same time, we also feel that the United\nNations should continue to play its important role in\nproviding means to the Palestinian people in their just\nstruggle for the restoration of their inalienable rights,\nincluding the right to self-determination and to the\nestablishment of a sovereign State which could coexist\nwith its neighbours in peace and harmony.\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is\nencouraging, but we need to remain alert. The Dayton\nAgreement has finally paved the way to creating a lasting\npeace in Bosnia. The fulfilment of the commitments of\nthe international community is, however, critical to the\nachievement and consolidation of full peace. We also\nbelieve that it is important and necessary to bring those\nresponsible for the atrocities and the crimes of genocide\nto justice and to punish them.\nMy delegation remains convinced that the United\nNations is the most viable and dependable universal\ninstitution today. It is the responsibility of all of us to\nallow this universal Organization to play a more central\nand active role in shaping and harnessing international\ncooperation for economic growth and development. It is\nalso our conviction that the dedication and collective\nendeavours of the international community, which have\nenabled the United Nations to survive the past 50 years,\nwill inspire us all to greater heights of unity and\ncooperation so as to preserve and maintain the principles\nof the Charter, promote its objectives, and strengthen the\nOrganization, thereby enabling it to better serve and\nenhance the well-being of the peoples of the world.\n9\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffA year ago, from this same rostrum, I began my\nstatement by reading some 10 hair-raising news items of\nthe moment from the international press, on bellicose\nconflicts, violence and death in the cities and deadly\nepidemics claiming new victims. Intending to do this again\ntoday, I found that the situation remains the same, or is\nperhaps even worse. Unfortunately, the world wasted\nanother 12 months without doing anything to stop such\ncatastrophic events.\nAs if it were necessary to illustrate this with specific\nfacts, even as we gathered here we once again witnessed\nthe bloodshed of the heroic Palestinian people. First and\nforemost, I denounce the new Israeli aggression and the\npolicy of hegemony that defends these acts, and I express\nsupport for our Palestinian brothers in their struggle for\ntheir legitimate right to finally have an independent state,\nwith Jerusalem its capital.\nAlso about a year ago, the Prime Minister of\nMalaysia, the country of the President of the General\nAssembly, very rightly stated that the United Nations\nshould support the collective needs of peoples and nations\nin order to serve humanity as a whole, and that it was\ntherefore necessary to correct the trend of making them an\ninstrument of the wealthy and the powerful. Today it must\nbe recognized that we are meeting again without having\nremoved that danger.\nHence, in expressing my Government\u2019s satisfaction at\nhaving President Razali lead us in our work, I cannot but\nexpress confidence that his diplomatic professionalism, his\npersonal achievements and his long and proven experience\nin the work of this Organization will give him strength in\nleading us in a remarkably difficult and complex session of\nthe General Assembly.\nFar from being more democratic and universal, the\nOrganization in which we come together today is tending\nto tighten more and more the exclusive circle of those who\ngovern it. The just demands heard from this rostrum are\nnow sounding the alarm at the march of ideas being\npromoted mainly in our host country.\nJust a few weeks ago, the Chairman of the United\nStates Senate Foreign Relations Committee issued an\nultimatum for the United Nations to carry out reforms in\naccordance with the prescriptions of that country or else\nface the consequences. His articles in renowned\npublications question precisely the principles on which this\ninstitution is founded, particularly the principle of\nsovereign equality of States.\nFor this influential United States politician and those\nwho identify themselves with his primitive views, there is\nonly one argument: some States deserve more privileges\nthan others. In this way they try to make a dead letter of\nthe principle of sovereign equality of States, the\ncornerstone of the Charter adopted over 50 years ago in\nSan Francisco.\nBut there is more: the Government of the United\nStates of America, which owes the United Nations the\nshameful amount of over $1.5 billion, assumes, with no\nembarrassment whatsoever, the right to determine\nunilaterally who can or cannot be the Secretary-General\nof the United Nations and to declare how an Organization\ndeliberately deprived of the resources required for the\nfulfilment of its functions should or should not be\nmanaged.\nEighty per cent of the work of the United Nations\nsystem is devoted to assisting the developing countries\nand to strengthening their ability to help themselves. This\nendeavour includes the aspiration to receive fair treatment\nin international economic relations; to try to save children\nfrom starvation and disease; to promote emergency\nassistance to refugees and disaster victims; to attempt to\ncombat crime, drug addiction and disease; to promote\neducation and the development of human resources; and\nto tackle the enormous task of halting or slowing the\nprogressive ecological deterioration of our planet.\nThese are precisely the functions that the notorious\nUnited States Senator is trying to abolish, and it is\nbecause of the existence of those programmes that the\nmanagerial approach of the Secretary-General is so\nfiercely attacked.\nThat position of the planet\u2019s most powerful country\nis not aimed against one person; rather, using the question\nof the Organization\u2019s efficiency as a pretext, it stands\nagainst the United Nations mandate to attend to the needs\nof the great majority of mankind. It is a new and gross\nattempt to impose on the community of nations the will\nof a single State in the management of the multilateral\nforum of cooperation that should be the most\nrepresentative and democratic one in the world.\nWe should ask ourselves if we, the members of this\nAssembly, can passively accept the threat posed by this\nunilateral imposition. It is fitting to recall what Harry\n24\n\n\nTruman said of the Charter of the United Nations at the\nSan Francisco Conference in 1945:\n\u201cIf we fail to use it, we shall betray all those\nwho have died in order that we might meet here in\nfreedom and safety to create it.\n\u201cIf we seek to use it selfishly \u2014 for the\nadvantage of any one nation or any small group of\nnations \u2014 we shall be equally guilty of that betrayal.\u201d\n(Documents of the United Nations Conference on\nInternational Organization, San Francisco, 1945,\nvol. 1, p. 687)\nFurther comment is unnecessary; subsequent history\nhas been quite eloquent enough. But the most dangerous\nthing, as has often been said, is that the United Nations is\nmerely the reflection of the world in which we live. This\ndomineering unilateralism shows up even more crudely in\nthe daily conduct of international relations. In a world in\nwhich relations of respect, good-neighbourliness and\ncooperation among the peoples and Governments should be\nfostered every day, the fact is that one Power, resting on its\nunquestionable economic, military and technological might,\nseeks to impose rules and norms of conduct on the rest of\nthe world, thus undermining the sovereign rights of each\nand every one of our nations.\nWhat political, legal or moral reason underlies and\nlegitimizes the missile attack against the Republic of Iraq\nby the United States Armed Forces just a few days ago?\nWhat principles or claims can be used to cover up the\nunilateral and unjustified use of force? The Security\nCouncil did not yield to that unilateral aggression, but it has\nnot been able to formulate a clear position on the matter\nbecause of its well-known structural and procedural\ndeficiencies and also because of the tolerance and impunity\nwith which the international community has recently\naccepted the haughty arrogance of a Government that\nassumes the right to punish sovereign nations at its whim\nunder spurious pretexts.\nThere is no justification for trampling the territorial\nintegrity of a full-fledged Member of this Organization, and\neven less for that action to be taken by a single\nGovernment, nor for threatening the peace and security of\na region inhabited by tens of millions of persons. And all\nthis has taken place while the political experts of the\naggressor country could not agree on which was its\nstrongest motivation: the wretched oil interests or the frenzy\nof the ongoing carnival-like electoral campaign in the\nUnited States.\nIt is incredible that world politics can be paralysed,\nthat foreign ministries postpone decisions and that\nGovernments advance or delay responses to national or\ninternational dilemmas, thinking only of their\nrepercussions in that North American simulacrum of\ndemocracy. Anything can happen, and no country, legal\nprecept or moral principle seems to be safe. Fortunately,\nthe super-elections are held only every four years,\nbecause if they took place annually, like the sessions of\nthe General Assembly, living on this planet would be true\nmadness.\nThe Helms-Burton Act, aimed against everyone\u2019s\nsovereignty and against Cuba, a sovereign State, was\nconceived as an additional effort to subdue our people\nthrough hunger and poverty. It is an eloquent example of\nthe absurd will to impose imperial designs on sovereign\nand independent countries in the conduct of their own\ninternational and trade relations. For that reason, it has\nbeen unanimously rejected by the international\ncommunity. That law, ignoring the General Assembly\nresolutions on the issue, is intended to strengthen further\nthe blockade against our country.\nFor a century \u2014 and especially during the last 37\nyears \u2014 the Cuban people have had to face the\nhegemonic vocation of successive United States\nGovernments. The extraterritorial ambitions of our\nneighbour, its attempts to question the sovereign decisions\nof another State and its violation of the universally\nrecognized principles of international trade are realities\nwith which Cuba has been familiar for a long time.\nWhen we denounced the crime that was about to\ntake place, it was neither to frighten nor to play with\nanyone. The Helms-Burton Act, the most sophisticated\nbungle of the economic war against Cuba, attacks many\ncountries and compels them to experience in their own\nsovereignty what we Cubans have been facing for a long\ntime. The world can now better understand what so many\nyears of continuous offences and extraterritorial acts have\nmeant for my homeland.\nAnother instance of unipolarity and of the attempt to\ndictate the conduct of sovereign States is the law known\nas D\u2019Amato-Kennedy, which has also received universal\nrepudiation. It repeats the philosophy of imposition and\nratifies the tendency to apply United States law beyond its\nborders. The argument for this is the alleged war against\nterrorism, when, in fact, the United States was the main\npromoter of terrorism in its dirty wars in Nicaragua, El\nSalvador, Angola and South Africa, against the\n25\n\n\nPalestinian patriots and in many other countries \u2014 the\nUnited States has always supported the bloodiest regimes\nthat have ever existed in this world.\nThere are just causes and unjust causes. No one will\never have the right to kill innocent people, regardless of the\nobjectives being pursued. This does not negate any people\u2019s\nright to use weapons against its oppressors: to fight cleanly,\nyes; to kill innocents, never. A State cannot be allowed to\narrogate to itself the right to accuse, condemn and sanction\nother nations and to impose by force an illegitimate crusade\nthat often serves to disguise the real terrorists.\nCuba \u2014 which has been the victim of many terrorist\nactions and has for many years faced repeated attempts on\nthe lives of its political leaders, as well as sabotage,\nbiological warfare, the destruction of a passenger plane in\nflight and the hijacking of aircraft, and which suffers even\ntoday from armed infiltrations and which has been, above\nall, the victim of brutal economic terrorism \u2014 expects a\njoint and conscious effort from the international community\nto address the terrorism that has its origins in Langley,\nVirginia \u2014 that is to say, at the Central Intelligence\nAgency \u2014 and later spreads to many countries of the\nworld.\nDrug trafficking, in our opinion, should be dealt with\nin the same manner. The drug issue should not be\ntransformed into an instrument of pressure against\nunderdeveloped countries, many of which do not have\nsufficient resources to tackle this scourge. This problem has\ntaken on global dimensions and can be confronted only by\nsharing responsibilities and using the mechanisms offered\nby the United Nations.\nThe policy of conferring arbitrary certifications is\nunacceptable, and even more so is its use as a pretext to\ninterfere in the internal affairs of sovereign nations. The\ncountry whose enormous rates of consumption have become\nthe main market for and driving force behind this criminal\nindustry, the country in whose territory the greatest profits\nof this business are generated, does not have the moral\nauthority to assign responsibility to or demand it from\nothers. What would happen if the world, truly concerned by\nthe scourge of drugs, were to decertify unanimously the\ngreatest drug consumer? To put it another way, people who\nlive in glass houses should not throw stones, and he who\nhas a beam in his eye should not be so concerned about the\nmote in another\u2019s.\nNo one can disregard the immense influence of the\nUnited States in the so-called post-cold-war period, but\nmankind would be making a mistake if it were to look\nwith indifference upon the currents of thought within that\ncountry that entertain the possibility of governing the rest\nof the world or of acting with utter disregard for the\nrights and interests of other peoples. We are facing a\nKing Kong escaped from his cage, destroying and\ncrushing everything around him, aimlessly and out of\ncontrol.\nWe are not trying to convince this forum that the\nUnited States is the source of all the evils of the planet,\nbut it would be a mistake to ignore reality and not to take\ntimely preventive actions \u2014 preferably collective ones \u2014\nto admonish to sanity the persons charged with guiding\nthat country politically, to do so with a minimum of\nresponsibility and to understand that the power of any\nnation, important as it might be, has its limits.\nThe world is more plagued by uncertainty today than\nwhen the new world order was demagogically proclaimed.\nOn the threshold of the new millennium, the numbers of\narmed conflicts between States, ethnic groups and\nreligions have increased. What we see everywhere is not\na new order but, rather, a disquieting world in perfect\ndisorder. The social and economic consequences of these\nconflicts have no parallel in contemporary history, but we\ncannot simply pretend that military imposition, coercion\nand sanctions are a universal panacea that can solve the\nnumerous humanitarian problems of the world.\nInequalities, rampant underdevelopment,\nglobalization and the interdependence that is increasingly\nturning into the worst form of dependency should\ndisappear so that these new conflicts may, in turn, be\neradicated for ever from this world, which, based on\ninjustice, is becoming increasingly ungovernable.\nEconomic models based on neoliberal philosophy\nhave spread throughout much of the third world with the\nsupport of the international financial institutions. Although\nthese models have generated deceptive, apparently\nattractive macroeconomic indicators, in practice they go\nhand in hand with an increase in poverty, marginalization,\nenvironmental degradation, disease, ignorance, social\nconflict, a loss of national resources and sovereignty \u2014\nin short, with the most brutal and increasingly irreversible\nunderdevelopment.\nThis neoliberal school of thought is based on\nartificial paradigms that should be unmasked. It is false\nthat the market, with its magical invisible hand, is the\ndefinitive solution for the immense disruptions affecting\nthe international economy and that it is the miraculous\n26\n\n\nremedy that would liberate many countries, home to the\nvast majority of the earth\u2019s population, from\nunderdevelopment and poverty.\nIt is false that absolute privatization, which can benefit\nonly the few, brings well-being to the legions of the poor\nand the wretched living in the third world.\nIt is false that geography determines the economic\npower of peoples.\nIt is false that genetics determines which human\nbeings are born to be poor and wretched and which are\nborn under the shining star of wealth and extravagance.\nIt is false that the State or Government is the main\nsource of corruption and inefficiency and should renounce\nresponsibility for welfare, health and education, leaving\nthese obligations mainly in private hands whose motivations\nwill always be limited and discriminatory and are frequently\nbased on greed.\nIt is false that the poor, the oppressed and the\nexploited should have a lesser role in ultra-modern\nsocieties.\nIt is false that social justice and equity always have to\nbe sacrificed for the sake of commercial efficiency.\nIt is false that the total removal of protection for\nnational industries in the developing countries will yield\nhigher productivity, wealth, employment and well-being for\ntheir peoples.\nIt is false that the sovereignty of nations is an\noutmoded principle of international coexistence and that\nGovernments and countries are ready to abandon it because\nof the strength of transnational capital and the social-\npolitical models exported by the North.\nFinally, it is false that the neoliberal models that have\nbeen sold to us will raise the indicators or levels of human\ndevelopment set as objectives by the United Nations.\nOne should check the statistics and compare annual\nreports, not just between one country and another, but also\nbetween indicators for the third world from one year to the\nnext in areas such as infant mortality, poverty, education,\nlife expectancy, access to drinking water, human\nsettlements, schooling for children, and doctors per number\nof inhabitants.\nAll these falsities, many of them recorded in United\nNations documents, hide the bankruptcy of development\nprospects for most of the poor countries, which is already\nthreatening world stability and aggravating the ecological\ndeterioration we all recognized several years ago at the\nhistoric Rio Conference. The poor are already falling into\nthe immense and ever wider chasm separating them from\nthe rich, who continue to grow disproportionately and\nirresponsibly without realizing that sooner or later their\nown weight will also drag them down into the same pit.\nAnd, in this aberrant context, what are we to say\nabout the arms race? The rivalry between the big Powers\nand the arms race have supposedly disappeared. Why,\nthen, in spite of the adoption of international instruments\nsupposedly to that end, is there such resistance to real\nnuclear disarmament that will free humanity for ever from\nthat scourge? Who is responsible for the fact that the\nrecently adopted Treaty to ban all nuclear tests does not\ncover simulated laboratory tests in which new lethal\nweapons will be perfected by those who monopolize\nthem, or any commitment to the destruction of arsenals?\nUnless we discover life in other galaxies, where will the\nenemies endangering the big Powers come from?\nFifty-one years after the creation of the United\nNations, instead of seeing wealth and development extend\nfrom the North to the South, we see the growing threat of\nunderdevelopment moving inexorably from the South to\nthe North.\nIt is said that hunger and poverty are on the rise. In\nfact, what has also happened is that wealth is more and\nmore concentrated, increasingly exclusive and limited,\nwhile walls higher than the one that fell in Berlin are\nbeing built.\nLet us be frank: the North is not as rich as it seems,\nnor is the South as poor as they want to make it. Almost\nall the wealth of the North comes from the wealth and\nresources of the South. And all the hunger and poverty of\nthe South is nothing other than the legacy of over 500\nyears of exploitation and disregard for our human rights.\nIf we cannot reverse this situation collectively, by\nsharing the burden and improving living conditions in the\ndeveloping countries, no one will be able to stop the\nwaves of migrants attracted by the siren\u2019s song of wealthy\nand opulent societies.\nThe United Nations has a vast arsenal of documents,\nresolutions and initiatives conceived for those purposes\n27\n\n\nbut never implemented. Soon it will be too late. Today we\ncan still act.\nWhile all this is happening, the blockade of Cuba\ncontinues. With the Helms-Burton Act, it has become even\nclearer that it is not just an embargo, because in the last\nfew months, the United States, through its words and deeds,\nhas sent the world sure signals that what is really being\nwaged against my country is a long and dirty economic war\nfor total control over our sovereignty and our markets.\nThe criminal blockade, as part of its frightening\nnetwork of measures created over 35 years, has now a\nDraconian law that publicly calls for a world crusade to\nchange forcibly the Cuban constitutional order and undo a\nrevolution defended by our people at the cost of their lives.\nWhat have we come to when United States diplomats,\non the ugliest mission since the Viet Nam war, tell the\nworld that they are granting it a few months\u2019 sovereignty\nbefore trampling upon it if the world does not join their\nwar on Cuba?\nI am fulfilling the mandate bestowed on me by the\nfree people of Cuba to proclaim in front of the\ninternational community of nations that we will persevere\nin our efforts to defend our social, political and economic\nactions aimed at ensuring equality, justice and well-being\nfor all Cubans.\nOur own experience is the best contribution we can\nmake as a nation towards meeting the enormous\nchallenges facing humanity, as has been shown by Cuba\u2019s\neconomic, political and social achievements in the last\nyear. A country that has overcome a serious economic\ncrisis, that maintains its governability, that grows and\ndevelops with the solidarity of many, that expands its\nrelations throughout the world and that grows stronger \u2014\nthis is a country with a future.\nThe socialism we have chosen for our homeland is\nour only emancipatory, moral and ethical alternative, with\nroots firmly planted in the history of our nation. It is a\npath that we chose in freedom and sovereignty, a path\nthat we shall not renounce and that no one imposed on us.\nWe wish to live in harmony with all the countries of\nthe world, including the United States. Cuba wants and\nneeds peace. But let us be clear: Cuba is not and never\nwill be willing to sacrifice, under pressure from anyone\nor in exchange for anything, the independence,\nsovereignty and self-determination that it has achieved\nand defended at such a high price.\nToday, in that blue Caribbean that shelters us, we\nCubans will continue with our heads held high, with our\nfeet on the ground and with our eyes on the future. Thus\ndo we defend our choice: to live in the free and sovereign\nhomeland dreamed of by our founding fathers and\nachieved by our fathers and grandfathers.\nLet there be no doubt. We shall overcome."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first to congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-first session. I wish also to pay tribute\nto your predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of\nPortugal, who presided over the fiftieth regular session of\nthe General Assembly.\nThe Assembly will agree with me that present-day\ninternational relations are characterized by two\ncontradictory trends. On the one hand, there is an\noverriding desire and wilful movement to enhance\ninternational cooperation through the expansion of trade and\ninvestment. This trend is inextricably linked to the pursuit\nand maintenance of peace and stability. However, parallel\nwith and contradicting this positive trend, we see a\nproliferation of high- and low-intensity conflicts in various\ncorners of the world triggered by different causes. The\npursuit of viable mechanisms to reduce and seek a\npermanent solution to these conflicts in order to promote\ninternational cooperation for the welfare of mankind\nremains, therefore, the key challenge that the United\nNations will continue to face in the coming years.\nThe Horn of Africa region remains, likewise, in the\ngrips of this dichotomy. On the positive side, the\ncountries of the region are committed to promoting\nregional cooperation, and continue to make strenuous\nefforts to this end. This is indeed manifested by the\nsubstantial progress achieved to date to revitalize the\nInter-Governmental Authority on Drought and\nDevelopment (IGADD), the regional instrument for\nachieving this objective. At the same time, the region\ncontinues to bleed due to grave internal conflicts within\nsome member States. The painful bloodletting that has\ndestroyed the social fabric in Somalia continues unabated;\nthe internal conflict in the Sudan and the climate of\nregional tension created by the activities of the National\nIslamic Front (NIF) regime continues to deteriorate.\nThe pursuit of peace and stability, with the attendant\nopportunities that this provides for economic and social\ndevelopment, have special significance for peoples that\nhave suffered the physical and psychological traumas of\nwar. In this connection, as the Assembly is aware, my\ncountry has borne the brunt of a long war which has\nexacted enormous human sacrifices, leaving its economic\nand social infrastructure a shambles. Accordingly, peace\nis crucial to the young State of Eritrea to heal the scars of\nwar, to recoup lost opportunity and to reconstruct what\nhas been devastated.\nBut my Government\u2019s profound aspirations and\ncommitment to the maintenance of peace continue to be\nthreatened by the hostile and unprovoked acts of the NIF\nregime in the Sudan, whose antagonism and subversion\n\n\nagainst Eritrea began soon after it took power in 1989. I\nhardly need emphasize here that the acts of subversion and\nState-sponsored terrorism are not directed against Eritrea\nalone, but have in fact been adopted as an instrument of\npolicy by the NIF in its attempts to destabilize its\nneighbours and export its expansionist designs through\nsubversion and violence.\nIn pursuit of these aims, the NIF regime has propped\nup and provided safe haven to assorted terrorists from\nvarious countries and facilitated their acts of sabotage and\nterror. Khartoum\u2019s barely veiled hand is discernible from\nthe litany of border incursions by mercenary groups in a\nnumber of countries in the region and acts of naked terror\nin the international arena.\nI must stress here that my Government has left no\nstone unturned in its efforts to reduce and stave off the\nclimate of tension provoked by the acts of the NIF regime.\nAs a matter of fact, for five long years my Government\npursued a policy of constructive engagement, patiently and\ntirelessly, hoping against hope that the authorities in\nKhartoum would turn back from the dangerous alley that\nthey are heading for.\nUnfortunately, the language of moderation and peace\nonly whetted the NIF\u2019s appetite to spread its subversive\ntentacles deeper and wider. In the event, Khartoum not only\nrefused to heed these continuous appeals, but escalated its\novert acts of terror and subversion beyond limits.\nAnother grave matter I wish to bring to the attention\nof this Assembly is the maltreatment of Eritrean refugees\nat the hands of Sudanese authorities. The NIF regime not\nonly is doing whatever it can to obstruct the organized\nrepatriation of the refugees to their home country, but is\nengaged in reckless and deplorable acts to drive a wedge\nbetween the refugees and the people of the Sudan, who\nhave offered commendable hospitality during the long years\nof war. And when this policy did not work, the NIF regime\nbegan subjecting the refugees to arbitrary imprisonment,\ntorture, and banishment after confiscation of their property\nby its security authorities. Moreover, young refugees were\nforcibly conscripted and given military training to be\ndeployed in subversive activities across the border.\nOrganized repatriation of these refugees, the pilot phase of\nwhich has been successfully achieved, is impeded by the\nlame excuses the NIF fabricates. All these pressures have\ncaused the refugees to return home spontaneously at high\nrisk.\nAll these acts of hostility perpetrated by the NIF\nregime to implement its designs of destabilizing\nneighbours should surely be of grave concern to this\nAssembly and the international community at large, given\ntheir wider regional security ramifications.\nAllow me further to recall the incident that erupted\nbetween Eritrea and the Republic of Yemen in December\n1995, following the latter\u2019s occupation of the Eritrean\narchipelago of Hanish-Zuqar, at the southern entrance to\nthe Red Sea. Perhaps due to its sensitivity, the incident\naroused immediate international concern and mediation\nendeavours.\nThe Government of Eritrea, which all along had\nsought international arbitration to the dispute, promptly\naccepted, with full appreciation, the mediation initiatives\nof the Ethiopian and Egyptian Governments, and later that\nof the United Nations Secretary-General, which greatly\nhelped to defuse tensions and paved the way for the\npeaceful handling of the dispute. When facilitation by the\nFrench Government was proposed, the Eritrean\nGovernment accepted it wholeheartedly.\nThese decisions were taken by the Eritrean\nGovernment against a background of mendacious\naccusations and irresponsible campaigns by the Yemeni\nauthorities to escalate the situation. The incident was also\nfanned by those in certain quarters who sought to serve\ntheir vested interests in the troubled waters. However,\ngenuine desires and a sincere political will prevailed.\nUltimately, restraint and careful handling of the\nissue, in addition to positive and constructive regional and\ninternational intervention, culminated in the Agreement on\nPrinciples, signed by both parties on 21 May 1996 in\nParis.\nIn this Agreement, both the State of Eritrea and the\nRepublic of Yemen unequivocally expressed their desire\nto settle their dispute over the Hanish-Zuqar archipelago\nby the verdict of a court of arbitration. Developments\nsince the signing of the document could be considered\ngenerally positive and encouraging. However, allegations\nwere made by the Republic of Yemen that Eritrean forces\noccupied the island of Lesser Hanish on 10 August 1996,\nand the matter was hastily referred to the Security\nCouncil. The fact of the matter was that units of the\nEritrean forces were on that island both before and after\nthe signing of the Agreement on Principles on 21 May\n1996. Despite this truth, the Eritrean Government\nwithdrew its forces as a gesture of goodwill and in the\n2\n\n\ninterest of the smooth progress of the arbitration process\nand to preserve and promote the peace of the region.\nThe Eritrean Government has time and again affirmed\nits adherence to the Agreement on Principles of 21 May\n1996, and expressed its commitment to abide by the\ndecisions of the court of arbitration. I am pleased to\nunderline that the subsidiary agreement reached between the\ntwo sides in Paris last week, on 3 October, will now allow\nfor the proceedings of the court of arbitration to start early\nnext year.\nThe agonizing and intractable reality in Somalia\ncannot but impel the international community to search for\nways and means of expediting an end to this long, drawn-\nout tragedy. The complexity of the situation is too apparent\nto require more elaboration here. But it is clear that no\namount of well-meaning external support will succeed in\nrestoring normalcy to Somalia unless the Somalis\nthemselves take stock of the senseless bloodshed that has\ntorn the country apart and produce what it takes to forge\npeace and national reconciliation. Admittedly, the countries\nof the region could have played a more catalytic part in this\nmulti-pronged effort. The lack of a consistent and\ncoordinated regional and international initiative, however,\nmay entail more preoccupying negative developments.\nIndeed, there are indications these days of a growing\ninvolvement of various external actors that seem bent on\nexploiting the vacuum to promote their hidden agendas.\nSomalia is in fact drifting towards becoming fertile ground\nfor extremist groups. For the sake of the Somalis, and in\nthe interest of regional peace and stability, it is vital that\nthese trends be checked before it is too late and that the\nregional initiative be resuscitated.\nThe recent developments in the Middle East which\nappear to have cast some shadows on the Oslo agreement\nare naturally a matter of preoccupation to all those who\nwish to see an enduring settlement to the conflict between\nthe Israelis and the Palestinians. Whatever the shortcomings\nof the agreement, there can be no alternative to the peace\nprocess. My Government therefore appeals to both sides to\npersevere in the process of dialogue and negotiations so that\na lasting peace that ensures the well-being of all the peoples\nof the region will be assured.\nIn conclusion, we share the views of many Member\nStates on the imperative of restructuring the decision-\nmaking bodies of the United Nations, particularly the\nSecurity Council. The Security Council continues to play a\nvitally important role in the maintenance of international\npeace and security. It is my delegation\u2019s belief that now\nis the opportune moment to revitalize it, make it more\ndemocratic and improve its value, effectiveness and\nlegitimacy so as to make it reflect the universal character\nof the Organization. Powerful and convincing arguments\nhave been made by many speakers to the effect that, at\npresent, the Security Council is neither equitable nor\nrepresentative. The circumstances of international politics\nhave altered so fundamentally that there are compelling\nreasons for change.\nIn spite of the broadly shared wish for reform,\ndiscussions so far have not really come close to the\ngeneral agreement needed. It is our firm belief that\nflexibility and compromise will be necessary. There are\na number of interesting elements in the proposals, to\nwhich thorough attention should be given so that we can\ntry to bring about the necessary change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow\nme first, Sir, to congratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his\nunanimous election as President of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-first session and to wish him every success. I\nwould also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas\ndo Amaral, for the outstanding manner in which he carried\nout his duties.\nThe succession of Governments, which is a defining\nprinciple of Israeli democracy, has recently brought to\npower a new Government in Israel. A section of the\ninternational community has deemed this democratic Israeli\nchoice impertinent, suggesting that it would work against\nregional peace. In response to this prejudice I would like to\nmake a simple statement: Israel is united in its quest for\npeace. It is not a question of good people and peace-seekers\non one side and mischief-makers and people who reject\npeace on the other. In Israel, those on the left and right\nconverge in their quest for peace, their sensibilities and\ndifferences notwithstanding.\nI wish to raise the recent history of the Israeli-Arab\npeace process in order to dispel any ambiguity regarding\nthe practice of peace in Israel and to show that the new\nmajority cannot be disqualified from efforts to achieve\npeace. The peace between Israel and Egypt is a founding\nlandmark of coexistence between Israelis and Arabs. The\nMadrid Conference, to which I had the honour of\ncontributing, also bears the special stamp of the pioneers of\npeace, to whose achievements the new majority in Israel are\nthe direct heirs.\nThe firm commitment of the Netanyahu Government\nwith respect to the Oslo accords is also closely tied to the\npeace process, which our immediate neighbours, Egypt and\nJordan, helped to shape. However, my Government\u2019s swift\nengagement in the peace process has been minimized,\nreduced and distorted. The meetings that the Prime\nMinister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel\nand I have had with the Chairman of the Palestinian\nAuthority have been met with sarcasm and given only\nsecondary importance. Those meetings dealt precisely\nwith the substance and the content of peace. They\ninitiated the ways and means necessary for the\nachievement of peace. They amplified the resonance of\nthe Oslo accords and extended mutual Israeli-Palestinian\nrecognition to new sections of society and Israeli political\nclasses. It is Israel\u2019s determination to reach peace\naccording to the policies and fundamental guidelines of\nthe new Government.\nOn its road to peace, the Government of Israel is\nguided by several principles, which I would like to\nexpound. For us, security is neither an obsession nor a\nblind belief. It touches upon our very existence in a\nregion where, unfortunately, threats and instability still\nrage. Security must be the cornerstone in the architecture\nof peace. It cannot, under any circumstances, tag along\nbehind a process in which terrorism and violence have not\nyet spoken their last word.\nNegotiations themselves, through their joint creative\nenergies, allow us to control the dangers and drifts. The\nbattle against terrorism and its infrastructures and its\nsources of financing and assistance is not only for us to\nfight. We solemnly call upon the United Nations\nrelentlessly to pursue active cooperation in the struggle\nagainst terrorism and in condemning it unequivocally. It\nis imperative to preserve the Israeli-Palestinian peace\nprocess free from violence.\nI have just returned from the Washington summit,\nheld at the initiative of President Clinton. On behalf of\nthe Government and the people of Israel, I wish, from this\nrostrum, to thank the President and the Secretary of State\nof the United States for their exemplary contribution to\npeace by bringing the parties together and for their\nprofound commitment to reinvigorating the peace process.\nIn this respect the role and contribution of the United\nStates remain of great importance.\nOn Sunday the Israeli and Palestinian teams will\nconvene again in an attempt to resolve their differences in\nrespect of the various agreements. We are responsible to\nour people and to our whole region in this matter. We\nmust therefore display good faith and mutual\nunderstanding in order to fulfil our mission, and to send\nout the message of stable peace and lasting security.\n12\n\n\nThe Washington summit reconfirmed the principles\nand guidelines for the negotiations. I associate myself\nwholeheartedly with President Clinton\u2019s statement that face-\nto-face negotiations in a constructive atmosphere are the\nkey to resolving problems. A future free of hostility and the\nrenunciation of violence: these represent the very basis of\nmutual efforts for peace.\nThe choice is in our hands. Will we opt for\ncooperation, progress, real peace and security? Or will we\nrevert to the dark days of conflict, confrontation and\nviolence, thereby putting an end to all hope? For its part,\nIsrael has chosen hope.\nAnother major principle in our search for peace is the\nwill of the partners to allow a tangible peace to exist.\nRegional cooperation is a critical factor in ensuring peace\nand stability. Israel entertains no dreams of economic\nhegemony; it wishes to play its fair role in the creation of\nregional cooperation. This is a basic principle of\nnormalization. Peace and normalization are one and\nindivisible. Consequently, if we are to follow the logic of\npeace and dialogue, we cannot risk having normalization\ntaken hostage and brought to a halt.\nIsrael makes no secret that normalization of its\nrelations with the Arab world must be fully implemented.\nThis means comprehensive political and economic relations,\nand the broadest possible intellectual, cultural and spiritual\nacceptance. Some of our neighbours still view Israel as a\nbody foreign to the region. Normalization must erase\nforever the residue of this ideological negation.\nNormalization is the indispensable cement for keeping\ntogether the edifice of peace.\nOne of our immediate goals is the resumption of\nnegotiations with Syria on the basis of the Madrid\nprinciples, which inaugurated the dialogue between the two\ncountries. We recognize Syria\u2019s important role in the\nestablishment of lasting peace in our region. From this\nrostrum, we call upon President Al-Assad to resume\nnegotiations.\nAs to Lebanon, we have no territorial disputes with\nLebanon. We are committed to its sovereignty. Lebanon\ncan be fertile ground for the restoration of confidence and\nthe building of peace.\nEgypt and its President, Mr. Hosni Mubarak, are our\npartners in peace. They are the authors and actors that have\nalways been engaged in all stages of the peace process.\nJordan is unquestionably a decisive factor in the\nbuilding of peace in our region. A man of peace and\ndialogue, His Majesty King Hussein has actively\nsupported the peace process and has provided a vital\nguarantee of continuity. The Washington summit enjoyed\nhis complete support.\nOn the long path to peace, the country of Morocco,\nthe country of my birth and family roots, has always\nwalked and illuminated the path of Israeli-Arab\nreconciliation. The vision displayed by His Majesty King\nHassan II has left its distinctive mark on the entire Arab-\nIsraeli dialogue. The Moroccan King will continue his\nessential role and breathe into peace the remarkable\ninspiration of his solidarity.\nI would like to pay tribute also to the active support\nof Tunisia. Oman, Qatar and, more recently, Mauritania\nhave all helped to consolidate peace efforts.\nThe peace process has benefitted from the\nconsiderable support of the co-sponsors, the United States\nand Russia, and from the active and positive contribution\nof the European Union and Norway and of Powers such\nas Japan and Canada.\nOnce again, I wish solemnly to reaffirm Israel\u2019s\nirreversible commitment and determination to pursue the\npath of peace.\nSince the dawn of history our region has been a\nmeeting point of diverse civilizations and cultures, a\nvibrant wellspring of progress for all of humanity. At the\ncrossroads of continents and countries, the Middle East\nmust, in times of peace, discover again the genius of this\nplace and the richness of its edifying civilizations. Arabs\nand Jews must pool their knowledge and wisdom to\nregenerate their vocation as the promoters of life and\nhumanity.\nThrough international cooperation, Israel is sharing\nwith young countries from Africa to Asia, from Latin\nAmerica to China, its achievements and assets in the\nfields of agriculture, health and science.\nWe hope that the day will come when a regional\nsecurity system will be established in the Middle East to\nprovide a cooperative multilateral response to all security\nproblems. The advantage of this regional approach is that\nit is based on direct negotiations between the States of the\nregion. The first stage is to build confidence, and\nthereafter we must put arms control and disarmament\n13\n\n\nmechanisms into place. For this reason, Israel welcomed the\nestablishment of the Arms Control and Regional Security\nWorking Group as part of the multilateral talks. We hope\nthat in the future this framework will encompass all States\nof the Middle East.\nIsrael\u2019s position is defined by a dual mandate: to set\nambitious objectives, and to pursue them pragmatically and\nrealistically. After peace and reconciliation have been\nestablished among all the States of the region, Israel will\nendeavour to establish in the Middle East a zone free of\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as\nballistic missiles. This demilitarization will be subjected to\nrigorous verification.\nNegotiations to establish such a zone will commence\nfollowing the signing of bilateral peace accords between\nIsrael and all the countries of the region. In the meantime\nIsrael will implement confidence-building measures that\nwill increase openness and transparency and, thereby, make\na contribution to easing tensions and preventing all armed\nconflict.\nWe generally prefer regional security arrangements.\nHowever, Israel is in favour of the implementation of\ncertain aspects of international mechanisms for arms control\nand disarmament where appropriate. Accordingly, Israel\nsigned the Convention on conventional weapons and\nadopted a moratorium on the manufacture and export of\nanti-personnel landmines. It has also signed the Treaty\nagainst the use of chemical weapons and now the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Israel will\nconsider ratification of that Treaty depending upon\ndevelopments in the region, particularly the adoption of that\nTreaty by the major countries.\nIsrael has thus demonstrated its determination to be\ninvolved, whenever possible, in the efforts of the\ninternational community to prevent the spread of\nconventional and non-conventional weapons.\nIsrael strongly desires to be an active and fully-fledged\nmember of the family of nations represented in this\nOrganization. We note with regret and deep disappointment\nthat the question of our membership in a regional group has\nstill not been resolved. Israel is thus deprived of the right\navailable to all States Members of the United Nations to\nparticipate on an equal footing in all its activities. This\nimpairs the principle of equality among sovereign nations\nunder the Charter of the United Nations. I hope that this\ninjustice will be rectified and that Israel will finally be able\nto act within this Organization on the same footing as all\nother Member States.\nIt is with the subject of Jerusalem, whose very name\nis invoked in so many prayers for peace, that I wish to\nconclude. Jerusalem is the cradle of the three great\nreligions. We reaffirm this status daily by respecting and\nensuring total freedom of worship and spiritual expression\nfor all believers. It is an entirely shared religious reality\nto which Israel has made a profound contribution.\nJerusalem, the horizon of our dreams and prayers,\nhas throughout our exile and dispersions constituted the\nsummit of our collective being. Capital of Israel, both in\nancient and modern times, never has Jerusalem been the\ncapital of any country other than Israel.\nRarely if ever has any sovereign State been denied\nthe right to freely determine its capital. Israel, the people\nof peace restored to sovereignty after 2,000 years of exile,\nhas returned to the city of peace, Yerushalayim:\nJerusalem. Thereby it demonstrates its unswerving\ndevotion to its ancestral capital to renew its psalm of\npeace: \u201cPray for the peace of Jerusalem\u201d. We shall\ntirelessly dedicate all our efforts to that search for peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your rich experience in bilateral and multilateral\ndiplomacy is, for my delegation, a guarantee for the success\nof our work. My country, the Republic of Vanuatu, and\nyours, Malaysia, enjoy friendly and cooperative relations.\nI also wish to express my country\u2019s thanks to your\npredecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for the\ncommitment, competence and skill with which he guided\nour work at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\nI wish to express my country\u2019s appreciation to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the\nremarkable work that he has consistently done since the\nvery beginning of his term of office in the service of our\nOrganization. I reaffirm here my Government\u2019s support for\nthe principle by which, according to tradition, Africa has a\nright to a second mandate.\nMy Government has made its modest contribution to\ndisarmament and arms-control measures. This modest\ncontribution has been made in the areas of conventional\nweapons and weapons of mass destruction alike. With\nregard to conventional weapons, on 10 July 1996 the\nRepublic of Vanuatu provided the Secretary-General,\nthrough the Centre for Disarmament Affairs, with\ninformation on imports, exports and the re-exportation of\nweapons covered by the Register of Conventional Arms\nestablished by the Secretary-General under General\nAssembly resolution 46/36 L of 9 December 1991. The\ninformation I have mentioned is contained in the report of\nthe Secretary-General in document A/51/300 of 20 August\n1996.\nI wish to reaffirm the position of the Government of\nthe Republic of Vanuatu on the complete elimination of\nanti-personnel landmines. Indeed, at the fiftieth session of\nthe General Assembly, the Republic of Vanuatu voted in\nfavour of resolution 50/70 O entitled \u201cMoratorium on the\nexport of anti-personnel landmines\u201d. As we all know, the\nmajority of the victims of anti-personnel landmines are\nwomen and children.\nIn the area of weapons of mass destruction, my\nGovernment has made its modest contribution through\nmeasures at both the regional and international levels. Let\nus take a look first at the regional level.\nThe Republic of Vanuatu acceded last year to the\nTreaty of Rarotonga establishing the South Pacific\nNuclear Free Zone. I take this opportunity, on behalf of\n\n\nthe people and the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu,\nto congratulate the United States of America, the French\nRepublic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\nNorthern Ireland, which signed the Treaty last year. My\nGovernment welcomed the ratification last September by\nthe French Republic of the Protocols to the Rarotonga\nTreaty and pays tribute to its initiative of sending an expert\nteam from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\nto conduct a radiological study at the sites of French\nnuclear tests in French Polynesia.\nIn the area of global nuclear disarmament, on 24\nSeptember 1996 I signed, on behalf of my Government, the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly on 10 September 1996. Moreover, my\ncountry acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, opened for signature in Moscow, London\nand Washington on 1 July 1968, and supports the indefinite\nextension of that Treaty.\nThe Republic of Vanuatu, like other Members of our\nOrganization, took note of the Advisory Opinion rendered\nlast summer by the International Court of Justice, the legal\norgan of the United Nations, on the legality of the threat or\nuse of nuclear weapons. This Advisory Opinion is an\nadditional commitment in favour of nuclear disarmament.\nThe major objective of measures taken and to be taken by\nthe Republic of Vanuatu in the coming years is to\ndemonstrate our commitment to the complete and general\ndisarmament of our entire planet.\nI would like to express my Government\u2019s views on\nsome regional conflicts, namely, those in the former\nYugoslavia in Central Europe, in the Great Lakes region in\nthe heart of the African continent, and in the Middle East.\nRegarding the situation in the former Yugoslavia in Central\nEurope, my Government welcomes the elections held on 14\nSeptember as an important step forward for the future of\nBosnia and Herzegovina. In the Great Lakes region of\nAfrica, my Government supports the efforts of our\nOrganization, in close cooperation with the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, to avert a widespread war in that region.\nFinally, with respect to the situation in the Middle East, my\nGovernment congratulates the Palestinian and Israeli\ndelegations on having decided last Sunday, 6 October 1996,\nto resume discussions that should lead to a lasting peace in\nthat region.\nIn the area of international law, the United Nations,\nthrough the International Law Commission, must continue\nto play a major role in the codification of international law.\nIn this respect, the Republic of Vanuatu joins with other\nMembers of the United Nations in calling for the\nconvening of an international conference of\nplenipotentiaries entrusted with considering the draft\nstatute of an international court prepared by the\nInternational Law Commission and with concluding a\nconvention establishing an international criminal court.\nIn the area of human rights, in September 1995 the\nNational Parliament of the Republic of Vanuatu adopted\na law on the office of mediators. The mediator began his\nwork in late 1995. I take this opportunity to thank the\nGovernment of Papua New Guinea, in the context of\ncooperation between members of the Melanesian\nSpearhead Group, for its valuable technical assistance in\nhelping my Government to implement fully and with\nrelative celerity the provisions of the aforementioned law.\nAbove and beyond the role of mediator, there is,\nobviously, the fundamental law \u2014 the Constitution of the\nRepublic of Vanuatu \u2014 which guarantees the\nfundamental rights and individual freedoms of all of its\ncitizens.\nI wish to recall the statement made here by the\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu at last year\u2019s\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption\nof the Charter of the United Nations, in which he\nreaffirmed the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu\u2019s\nsupport for the reform and rational management of the\nUnited Nations system. I also take this opportunity to\nexpress my Government\u2019s opinion that the scale of\nassessments for the apportionment of the expenses of our\nOrganization must faithfully reflect the capacity to pay of\nthe Member States of our Organization.\nIn the area of development, my Government will\nparticipate in the special session of the General Assembly\nnext year devoted to the assessment of Agenda 21 and\nhopes, with other delegations that have expressed this idea\nhere, that new commitments will be undertaken towards\nthe environment. In this respect, the Environment Unit of\nVanuatu\u2019s national bureau of the environment, created in\n1986 under the auspices of the Ministry of Natural\nResources, will work in close collaboration with the\nenvironmental programme of the Oceanian region in\npreparing the Pacific region\u2019s contribution to the work of\nthe special session of the General Assembly.\nLast year, through a decision of the Ministry of\nHome Affairs and Decentralization to apply the law on\ndecentralization within the Republic of Vanuatu, my\nGovernment reduced the number of provinces from 11\nto 6. The purpose of this reduction was, first, to allow the\n2\n\n\nmajor islands to help the smaller ones; secondly, to allocate\nfinancial and human resources to all of the provinces; and,\nfinally, to demonstrate the will of my Government to\ndecentralize administrative and public functions for the\nbenefit of provinces. In other words, it encourages\ncommunities and individuals to participate in the economic\nand social development of the Republic. In this regard, I\ntake this opportunity to thank the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme in its capacity as a multilateral\npartner in the regional efforts of all Oceanian States and,\nmore particularly, for its valuable assistance to the\nGovernment of the Republic of Vanuatu in drafting its book\non sustainable human development in Vanuatu. My\nGovernment presented this book to the press on\n23 September.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm here the faith of the\nRepublic of Vanuatu in the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like to\nbegin my presentation by congratulating Mr. Razali Ismail\non his election to the presidency of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly. It bears testimony to this Organization\u2019s\nconfidence in and high regard for his skills and abilities.\nAlso, I wish to express my gratitude to Mr. Freitas do\nAmaral for the efficient manner in which he presided over\nthe fiftieth anniversary session of the United Nations.\nAt last year\u2019s session, I spoke of the faith of the\nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis in the United Nations\nas the only global Organization able to balance the interests\nof the weak against those of the strong. I spoke also of the\nneed for individual countries to work to develop approaches\nto collective problem-solving and partnership. Saint Kitts\nand Nevis reiterates this faith, which, I believe, is amply\njustified.\nVery recently the United Nations came to the\nassistance of my country and made available support and\nresources to aid the process of constitutional reform, which,\nhopefully, will avert further fragmentation and preserve the\nintegrity of Saint Kitts and Nevis. I should like sincerely to\nrecord my thanks to the Secretary-General for this kind\ngesture.\nI said previously that my Government does not ask for\nhand-outs. We do not expect charity. Our participation in\nthis forum is the result of our commitment to\nmultilateralism. All we ask for is genuine partnership,\nopportunity and an environment in which we all can\nprosper.\nMy party, while in opposition, developed an action\nplan for the progressive growth of the people of Saint\nKitts and Nevis. Today, as the duly elected Government,\nwe have readily realized that the problems facing small\ndeveloping States keep increasing. But this has not\ndiminished our resolve. One year ago, my Government\nbegan the difficult and trying task of implementing our\npolicies and devising new strategies to address the\nstubborn problems facing my country. We recognize that\nthe coexistence in any society of the threat of narco-\ntrafficking, youth unemployment and poverty is a recipe\nfor social chaos. We in Saint Kitts and Nevis are\ntherefore committed to ensuring that the young people\ninherit a legacy of hope and live in an environment in\nwhich dreams are not only kept alive but are realized.\nWe fully appreciate that the challenges ahead are\ngreat, but we also see great possibilities, and we are\ndetermined to embrace the opportunities. However, to\nmove our people forward we will require partnership; we\ncannot do it alone.\nTo this end, I welcome with enthusiasm the\nstatement last week by the Secretary of State for Foreign\nand Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom. I am\nencouraged by his intervention because it speaks to the\nfundamental issues that we in small States have for so\nlong worked to bring to the top of the international\nagenda.\nLast year I appealed to Member States to commit to\na genuine partnership between the developed and the\ndeveloping worlds. The developing world \u2014 small States\nin particular \u2014 have for far too long been languishing on\nthe periphery of international affairs and are often\ncorralled into the mainstream only when issues of votes\nor candidatures are at the centre of debates and individual\nnational policies.\nThe Secretary of State for Foreign and\nCommonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom spoke of\nthe need for the developed world to pursue policies that\nwill allow the economies of developing countries to\nexpand through export-led growth and the abolition of\nbarriers to trade in the developed world. I fully support\nthis call. My delegation would like to see the Bretton\nWoods institutions come to the aid of small States by\ncreating adequate structures to allow these States to\ndevelop economically and participate better in the world\n17\n\n\nsystem. There must be a period of transition to encourage\nsmall States to integrate into the mainstream of\ninternational interaction.\nWe all share a common responsibility to ensure that\ndeveloping countries are more equitably integrated into the\nworld economic system. We must break the insidious cycle\nof dependency and replace it with bonds of partnership and\ncooperation. We are our brothers\u2019 keepers. This must be\ngiven priority in our national and international policies.\nThe developed world must avoid outmoded\nperceptions that suggest that it is best qualified to prescribe\nstrategies for growth in developing countries. Attention will\nalso have to be paid to indigenous priorities in developing\ncountries. I say to the Assembly that there can be no\nprescription without consultation. Attempts at development\nwithout recognizing the peculiar problems of small States\nand the responsibilities of the developed world will not\npromote sustainable growth.\nWe speak repeatedly of hope, and the promise of the\nnew millennium, yet sometimes overlook many of the\nproblems plaguing us today. My Government looks to this\nnew era with great optimism and unbridled hope that we\ncan achieve sustainable development, that sustainable\nhuman growth can be realized, and that our people can\nafford to dream of a life beyond the expectations of their\nforebears.\nHowever, I fear for our children\u2019s dreams in a world\nwhere the products of developing countries are\ndiscriminated against and dubious tariffs make our goods\nseem uncompetitive. I see definite cause for concern when\nfriendly countries that are fully cognizant of the need for\nthe limited preferential access our region enjoys, pursue\npolicies inimical to the development and growth of our\ncountries. This strategy is not free trade. I fear for the\nprogress of my people when development is measured in\ncold statistical terms that ignore social transformation and\nsustainable development.\nI fear for the future of my children if small, vulnerable\nStates such as my own are continuously graduated out of\naid-recipient-country status simply because the gross\nnational product per capita is considered high. This policy\ndoes not take into account our high per capita cost of\ninfrastructure development; it does not take into account the\nfrequency of hurricanes and other natural disasters, or the\ndiseconomy of scale faced by our small enterprises.\nI fear for my brothers and sisters in the Windward\nIslands, whose very livelihood is threatened and could be\nseriously undermined by the disputes over Windward\nIsland banana exports. If the economies of the Windward\nIslands are affected, my country, too, will suffer. Our\neconomies are very closely linked. We share a common\ncurrency, a common central bank and, of course, a\ncommon future.\nIt seems that the international community would\nreadily punish growth. Whenever small States experience\nrelative growth, instead of lending further assistance to\nensure that they emerge from the quagmire of deepening\npoverty, necessary resources and support systems are\ntaken away, and these countries find themselves being\ngraduated out of concessional assistance programmes.\nThis is wrong. This is inhumane. When we rob a man of\nthe means to feed and educate himself and his family,\nhow can we expect him to contribute productively to civil\nsociety? This is a world of people, and its organization\nmust be about people. Their needs should not become\nsecondary to systems, policies and experiments. Structures\nshould be used to further the goals and aspirations of our\npeoples despite differences in economies, populations and\nsize. Our peoples all share a common dream: the dream\nof freedom to chart their own destinies; the dream of self-\nreliance; the dream of a better standard of living.\nOn the question of the environment, it is\ninconceivable that the very countries that agree to\ncontribute to coastal erosion management and fund studies\non environmental protection would wish to trans-ship\nhazardous toxic waste through our waterways. The\nfragility of my region\u2019s ecosystems, the openness of the\neconomies, the overwhelming reliance on food imports,\nand the susceptibility of the tourism product put us\nprecariously, and, perhaps, uniquely, at the mercy of\nexternal forces.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis intends to preserve the\nstandard of living we have achieved and to ensure a\nprosperous future for all of our peoples. My Government\nstrongly urges the international community to respect our\ndetermination to make the Caribbean a nuclear-free zone\nand to keep it free from toxic pollutants. The region\nalready suffers from the consequences of rising sea levels,\ncoastal erosion and the destructive effects of natural\ndisasters. The catalogue is very long; we cannot add\nfurther problems to it.\nSmall island developing States require committed,\nlong-term assistance in environmental protection. I am\n18\n\n\nconvinced that sustainable development and environmental\npreservation are inexorably linked. We cannot make token\ngestures of support on one level only to undermine support\non another. We need to enforce existing international\ninstruments, promote cooperation and allow the United\nNations to play a more central and coordinating role in\ndeveloping appropriate machinery for bringing together\npolitical will and financial and technological resources to\nguarantee results.\nI call on the United Nations to devise a comprehensive\nand integrated approach to addressing sustainable\ndevelopment. Additionally, I urge developing countries to\nwork more closely together to develop indigenous strategies\nand innovative approaches in order to solve the problems of\ndevelopment.\nThe plethora of issues which come before the United\nNations are critical. Therefore, it is necessary that the\nUnited Nations undergo substantive reform that will address\nresource distribution and the implementation of\nrecommendations. We must be careful not to address\nreform in a superficial way. We have to commit ourselves\nto reforms which allow the Organization to respond more\neffectively to the problems which face Member States.\nIt is our collective responsibility to restore and\nstrengthen the international agenda of the United Nations\nand support its role and performance in the social,\ninstitutional and economic fields. I believe that the\nOrganization can help to fuse our individual and collective\ngoals. However, Member countries must believe in the\ninternational relevance of this Organization.\nIt is important for us to promote consensus in\naddressing the important questions of budgetary and\nadministrative reform of this, our Organization.\nIrrespective of national ambitions, irrespective of size\nor resources, the United Nations is the only global\ninstitution whose membership gives it the mandate to\nexamine the vast array of problems that affect the entire\ncommunity of nations.\nThe work being undertaken to reform the United\nNations should be structured in such a way as to eliminate\nunnecessary wastage and bureaucratic inefficiency. At the\nsame time, we should not use the problems as an excuse to\ndiminish our commitment to the strengthening and re-\nenergizing of the United Nations.\nWhen we look at international affairs, democracy is\nstill one of our most sacred aspirations. But it needs\ntangible institutional and infrastructural support. My\nGovernment welcomes the extension of the United\nNations mission in Haiti which we believe is crucial to\nconsolidating and furthering the cause of democracy and\nhuman resource development in Haiti. We should not\nexpect to strengthen democracy in Haiti without\naddressing the systemic causes of poverty, illiteracy and\nviolence and the absence of democratic institutions. The\npeople of Haiti will eventually inherit the rewards of\npeace when commitment to long-term social, political and\neconomic development is assured. It is unwise for States\nto use politics and partisanship to impede progress in\nHaiti. Its people long for an opportunity to become\nmasters of their own fate, and they should be given that\nchance to pursue their national aspirations.\nMy delegation welcomes the prospects for peace in\nBosnia and Herzegovina and the progress towards\nimplementing the recommendations of the Dayton\nAccords. We welcome the willingness of the parties to\ndevelop democratic institutions, enhance human rights and\nsee to the return and settlement of displaced persons. The\nsituation in this region is still quite fragile. We must\ncontinue to struggle for peace, and people must be made\nto believe that such atrocities will never, ever happen\nagain.\nThe situation in the Middle East has regrettably\ntaken a turn for the worse. I appeal to the region\u2019s\nGovernments to recommit themselves to peace, the only\nviable option for attaining coexistence, security, stability\nand genuine progress for all parties concerned. We further\nurge the Governments to continue to respect the\nagreements reached and to commit to their\nimplementation. The successes of past years should never\nbe squandered.\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis lends its\nsupport to the work of the International Criminal Tribunal\nfor Rwanda and commends the work of the United\nNations and the Organization of African Unity in\nattempting to resolve these challenging and often thorny\nissues. We also urge all factions in Burundi to give\nnegotiations a fighting chance. Violence breeds violence,\nbut peace gives birth to partnership. Peace gives birth to\ngrowth and to economic development.\nWe have circulated a document which reflects our\npolicy regarding Taiwan. Our policy is to respect the\nterritorial integrity of all countries and to refrain from\n19\n\n\ninterference in the internal affairs of all Member States.\nBecause of our traditional relationship with the 21.3 million\npeople on Taiwan, we have come to respect their economic\nstability and progress. Their growing democracy and their\ncontribution to the developing world have not gone\nunnoticed.\nWe believe they have an important and continuing role\nto play in international development strategies. We are\nconfident that whatever difficulties exist between the\nChinese people separated by the Taiwan Strait can be\nresolved by the Chinese people themselves and in a spirit\nof fraternity and good will. We urge the international\ncommunity to be ready, if necessary, to provide the\nmechanisms to facilitate dialogue and cooperation.\nResolution of the stalemate would significantly contribute\nto the cause of development worldwide and to peace and\nsecurity in the region.\nWe look forward to the implementation of the\nPlatform for Action adopted at the Fourth World\nConference on Women in Beijing. My Government believes\nthat this is a significant step and a triumph for all women\nworldwide. It will allow them to achieve full equality of\nopportunity and equitable integration into the mainstream of\ndecision-making and the development process.\nWe should bear in mind when discussing the question\nof human rights that we commit a fundamental error by\nselectively disregarding the right to economic survival and\nsocial well-being. When we single out human rights and\nfreedom we do grave injustice to those people languishing\nbelow the poverty line, unable to determine the course of\ntheir own lives.\nFundamental to achieving tangible results is the\nnecessity of adopting a comprehensive and wholesome\napproach to human rights. It is not nearly enough to ensure\npolitical suffrage and freedom of expression, although these\nare extremely important, without establishing mechanisms\nto foster social self-reliance and economic independence.\nTo promote human rights in the wider sense is to\ncomplement and consolidate a democratic culture within\nany given society.\nHuman rights protection also means protecting the\nrights of children against hunger, against mental and\nphysical abuse, against prostitution, against trafficking in\nchildren and against pornography. Therefore, we must\nattack the ills of poverty, illiteracy and deprivation and\nenact punitive legislation. We support the first international\nconference on the sexual exploitation of minors, held in\nStockholm, as a significant step and an important\ninitiative to raise awareness and develop strategies.\nIn conclusion, I challenge the international\ncommunity to give effect to promises with solutions and\ntangible results. If we fail to design appropriate strategies\ntoday to address present problems, we are doomed to\nrepeat past mistakes.\nThe time for action is overdue. Please, we can wait\nno longer and we must delay no longer.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLast year we met in a\ncelebratory mood. But after every party comes the sober\ndawn, and we now face the sombre reality that the United\nNations risks marginalization. Its role in the twenty-first\ncentury is not to be taken for granted.\nThe sad truth is that today the United Nations plays\nlittle or no practical role in the management of the most\nimportant political, strategic and economic questions of our\ntime. But this was not always the case as we recall: the\nUnited Nations played a significant role in easing the pangs\nof decolonization. Even at the height of the cold war, the\nUnited Nations was not an unimportant instrument through\nwhich the super-Powers could manage regional proxy\nconflicts and, on occasion, even direct nuclear\nconfrontation.\nThis contrast with its past should lead us to regard the\npresent and future of the United Nations with deep concern.\nWe can no longer postpone a critical examination of\nfundamental issues. It is for this reason that my delegation\nis especially gratified to see Malaysia occupy the\npresidency of the General Assembly at this important\nturning point for the future of the United Nations. We in\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\nknow Tan Sri Razali Ismail for his commitment and clear\nthinking.\nI can do no better than echo what you, Mr. President,\nsaid about reform in the first plenary meeting of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session; we entirely agree\nwith you. The interminable debates about the need for\nUnited Nations reform have led to precious little real\nreform. These debates have served to conceal and not to\nclarify basic issues. An important theme has been the need\nfor greater efficiency; we all support that. No one can\nseriously argue against more productivity, better\nmanagement and less waste. The key question, however, is:\nefficient to do what?\nWhat kind of United Nations do we really want and\nfor what purposes? We all know that the purposes of the\nUnited Nations are enshrined in the very first Article of\nthe Charter. Nevertheless, the answers are not self-\nevident. We all know that the first of the United Nations\npurposes is\n\u201cTo maintain international peace and security\u201d.\nBut what does this mean? The more extravagant post-cold\nwar hopes for a new Agenda for Peace have proved\nillusory. The failure of the United Nations Protection\nForce (UNPROFOR) raises troubling questions about the\nrole of the United Nations after the cold war. The\nessential lesson to be drawn from UNPROFOR\u2019s fate is\nnot merely how the Security Council became a political\ntheatre to assuage the domestic concerns of some of its\nprincipal members; nor is it only the truism that the\nUnited Nations could do no more than what its principal\nmembers allowed it to do. The real tragedy for the United\nNations in Bosnia is that when the major Powers finally\ndecided to get serious about what they determined to be\na threat to international peace and security, their preferred\ninstrument was clearly not the United Nations.\nAgain, we all agree that poverty breeds conflict, and\nthat the gap between the rich and poor is widening. Yet\nthe Agenda for Development has been mired in\ntheological arguments about the definition of sustainable\ndevelopment. Now I do not mean to suggest that clarity\nof objectives is unimportant. But the real issues are not\nthat complicated, because what the least developed most\nurgently need is not intellectual sophistry but help: help\nto build the institutions and formulate the policies that\nwill allow them to plug into the global economy. The\nUnited Nations has not adequately met these challenges.\nThe stalemate in reform is not merely because of the\ndifficulty of the questions or because of conflicting\ninterests. Of course, the issues are thorny and differences\nin interests inevitable in any system of sovereign States.\nThat is precisely why we need the United Nations, as the\nCharter envisages, \u201cto be a centre for harmonizing the\nactions of nations\u201d.\nWhy then is the United Nations today less able to\nperform this vital function? In my view, it is because it\nhas been reluctant to adequately confront the implications\nof the two most significant developments of our time.\nFirst, the end of the cold war and, secondly, the\nemergence of a truly global world economy. The\nconjunction of these two events is changing the manner\nin which States relate to each other in unprecedented and\nfundamental ways. Yet these developments are at best\n12\n\n\nonly imperfectly reflected in the United Nations. And any\ninternational organization that divorces itself from\ninternational realities has no future.\nThe most obvious consequence for the United Nations\nsince the end of the cold war has been the great increase in\nmembership. But the change in the nature of Members has\noccasioned less comment. In 1945, small States, which I\ndefine as those having a population of 10 million or less,\nformed 59 per cent of a United Nations with 51 Members.\nHalf a century later, in 1995, small States by the same\ndefinition formed the same percentage of a United Nations\nof 185 Members. And 23 of the 26 countries \u2014 more than\n88 per cent \u2014 that joined the United Nations after 1989\nwere also small States. I expect that when the United\nNations membership expands further, as it surely must, the\nmajority of new Members will also be small States.\nThis is because changes in the structure of the\ninternational economy engendered by technological\nadvances and the end of the cold war have made size less\nimportant in the determination of a country\u2019s viability.\nWhat matters most today is not merely the extent of a\nState\u2019s frontiers or the wealth of its resources; the key is\nthe ability of a State to integrate itself as part of a network,\nand size is irrelevant to this.\nThe most important international networks are not\ncomposed of relations between States. The critical networks\nare increasingly defined by transnational patterns of\nrelationships between cities, regions and subregions that\nmay only imperfectly fit in with the formal political\nboundaries of individual States. This again makes a\ncountry\u2019s size or its resources less important than its ability\nto access these networks.\nIt is a fact that many small countries are also among\nthe less developed. This is not surprising given the skewed\ndistribution of international wealth. But the significant point\nis that to be small is no longer an automatic or fatal\ndisability. It can even be advantageous. This has\nemboldened many to seek self-determination. And since the\nsame trends have loosened the ability of capitals to control\ntheir peripheries, many have succeeded.\nWhere economics leads, politics inevitably follows.\nParadoxically, the political consequence of increasing\neconomic integration of a globalized world economy is a\ncertain loosening of political bonds. We see the effects of\nthis most dramatically in the physical breakup of large and\ndiverse States. But these are exceptional situations. Even\nwhen, as is more usual, the formal political boundaries\nremain intact, the ability of capitals of large and relatively\nhomogeneous States to impose a single direction over all\ntheir constituent parts is clearly diminishing. Power is\ndevolving everywhere. This trend is a new international\nreality.\nI do not wish to overstate the argument. So long as\nsovereignty remains the chief organizing principle of the\ninternational system, the exercise of force cannot be\ndiscounted in inter-State relations. In war, size is not\nentirely irrelevant, even though technology has made it\nsomething less than the totally decisive factor it was in\nthe past. But war is an extreme condition of international\nrelations. Under normal conditions, the very notions of\npower and wealth are being redefined and becoming more\ndiffuse, their different dimensions less prone to be\nfocused in just a few world capitals. Hierarchy is still a\nfact of international life. But what does it really mean to\nbe a \u201cgreat Power\u201d at the end of the twentieth century?\nThe very phrase today sounds anachronistic.\nBereft of a simple strategic enemy, the post-cold-war\nforeign policy decision-making of the major Powers is\nincreasingly localized, with domestic politics exercising\ngreater impact. The policies of big Powers in a globalized\nworld, where the economic and other interests of their\ncomponent parts may be at odds with those of the capital,\nis becoming less coherent. The very notion of a single\nnational interest is becoming somewhat ambiguous.\nAll this is making it increasingly difficult for even\nthe biggest countries to routinely bring their power to\nbear in an interdependent world, where an attack on an\nopponent may well damage their own interests. Wielding\npower is becoming more unpredictable even for those\nwho control its greatest instruments. It is not an accident\nthat the big Powers are now somewhat more cautious\nabout exercising power nakedly save in exceptional\ncircumstances and against States that are marginal in the\nglobal economy.\nI do not mean to suggest that the traditional notion\nof international relations structured by the interactions of\na few big Powers pursuing their individual national\ninterests is entirely obsolete. But it is surely an inadequate\ndescription of the world today. The balance of military\npower is still important. But the strict distinction between\nhigh politics and low politics on which the traditional\nbalance of power rested is increasingly blurred.\nNow, all this ought to make a consultative,\nmultilateral process more attractive to everyone, and not\n13\n\n\nless attractive. Alas, this is not so. Herein lies the root of\nthe problems of the United Nations. All States, big and\nsmall, are adjusting to the changing international system.\nIndeed they have no choice. But not all are choosing to do\nso in or through the United Nations. In the United Nations,\nmost of the Powers that we traditionally designate as\n\u201cgreat\u201d have reacted with varying degrees of disquiet to\nthese new international realities.\nSome, troubled by their decreasing ability to control\nevents even within their own frontiers, are frustrated at their\ninability to impose their order on what is perceived as a\nrecalcitrant, unfamiliar and intrusive Organization. Others\nsee a threat to their position and prestige. Psychological\nadjustments are always the most difficult to make. It is thus\nnot surprising that in the United Nations their reflex\nreaction has generally been a stubborn defence of the status\nquo.\nIn discussions on United Nations reform, this simple\nfact is all too often obscured by the use of arcane and\nconvoluted jargon. I am encouraged, Mr. President, by your\nreputation for plain speaking, for pulling aside the veil of\nrhetoric and letting the truth be known. If the United\nNations is to be marginalized, let the responsibility clearly\nbe seen to lie where it should. This is most evident in the\ntwo most critical and inter-related areas: Security Council\nreform and finance.\nDiscussions on Security Council reform have\nemphasized the Council's size and composition, and in\nparticular the possibility of the admission of new permanent\nmembers. There is a wide consensus that in the event that\nthere should be agreement for an increase in the permanent\nmembership, an increase only by industrialised countries\nwould be unacceptable. Many countries agree that Japan\nand Germany should become new permanent members\nwhen consensus is reached on the expansion of the Security\nCouncil. Nevertheless, crucial ambiguities remain about\nwhether new permanent members should have the veto. It\nis especially difficult to imagine major Powers allowing\ndeveloping countries the veto over their policies. And\ntherefore the stalemate continues.\nThere is also widespread agreement that Security\nCouncil reform should comprise a comprehensive package\nthat would include changes in the working methods of the\nSecurity Council in the direction of greater transparency\nand participation by the membership of the Organization as\na whole. But the permanent members have been reluctant\nto admit any but the most cosmetic of changes to the\nSecurity Council\u2019s working methods. Yet this is the most\ncritical aspect of Security Council reform for the small\nStates which form the majority of United Nations\nMembers. Small countries do not aspire to permanent\nmembership. But as the principal organ for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the\nSecurity Council\u2019s working methods and its decision-\nmaking processes are of vital and legitimate interest to\nthem because they can have direct a impact on their\nsecurity.\nOne of the most important and innovative proposals\ncurrently on the table is for a reinterpretation of Article\n31 of the Charter. This would allow greater participation\nby non-members in informal Security Council\nconsultations when questions affecting them are being\nconsidered. It was extremely discouraging that this\nmodest proposal was categorically rejected by almost\nevery permanent member. Indeed, most refused even to\nseriously discuss it. It must surely be a basic principle of\nelementary justice that parties most directly affected by a\nparticular situation should be allowed to present their\nviews directly to the body that will have the most\ninfluence over any action that the United Nations may\ntake on that situation. That is in fact the precise reason\nwhy Article 31 was included in the Charter in the first\nplace. The intention was clearly to reconcile great-Power\nleadership with the principle of sovereign equality.\nInformal consultations are an innovation that has\nevolved over the years. All the most important decisions\nthe Security Council takes today are made informally by\npermanent members. Even the participation of non-\npermanent members in the real decisions is sometimes\nmore symbolic than significant. Formal meetings are\nclearly only a choreographed ritual to set the final seal of\napproval. A reinterpretation of Article 31 would not\nrequire an amendment to the Charter, nor would it mean\nthat non-members must participate in all informal\nconsultations. It is therefore no real threat to the authority\nof the permanent members; it is just an important reform\nthat would undoubtedly enhance the legitimacy, and hence\nthe general acceptability and effectiveness, of Security\nCouncil decision-making by bringing the process more in\ntune with the temper of our times.\nI do not wish to be misunderstood. I am not\nsuggesting that the size and composition of the Security\nCouncil are unimportant. I understand the merit of the\nclaims for new permanent membership that have been\nadvanced by both industrialized and developing countries.\nSingapore supports the expansion of the Security Council\nby up to five new permanent members as part of a\n14\n\n\ncomprehensive package that would, among other things,\ninclude the consequent adjustment of non-permanent\nmembership to maintain a balanced ratio. But given the\nprofound changes in international relations that are under\nway, refusing to seriously discuss anything but membership,\nand even that with critical ambiguities, would be akin to\ntrying to prepare the United Nations for the twenty-first\ncentury by applying a nineteenth-century model of great-\nPower politics to it.\nThe same resistance to seriously engaging the\nlegitimate interests of the small-State majority of United\nNations Members also underlies the financial problems of\nthe United Nations. No one disagrees that the key reason\nfor the cash flow problems of the United Nations is the\nfailure of Member States to pay their dues in full and on\ntime.\nThere are various reasons why various Member States\nhave not met their legal obligations. Some are poor. But no\none has ever suggested that the largest debtor lacks the\ncapacity to pay. Its argument is that its assessed\ncontributions must be reduced because the state of its\ndomestic political consensus does not permit it to sustain its\ncurrent share of the United Nations budget. The financial\nburdens, it is consequently argued, ought therefore be more\nwidely spread. I do not lightly dismiss such arguments.\nThey reflect the increasing difficulty of defining and\nexercising great power that I had earlier called one of the\nnew international realities. I can therefore sympathize with\nsuch arguments. But it is not politically acceptable to pick\nand choose which of the new realities to emphasize when\nuseful, and which to ignore when inconvenient.\nSeveral permanent members have complained of the\nfinancial burdens they bear, and have sought to spread them\nmore widely. But there has never been any suggestion by\nany of the big Powers that their control over critical United\nNations expenditure decisions, in particular peacekeeping\nexpenditures, should be proportionately diffused among the\nmajority of small countries which would be expected to\ntake up the financial slack that they want to discard. All the\npermanent members have been reluctant to allow anything\nmore than the most superficial reexamination of their\nauthority or their relationship with the membership as a\nwhole. Discussions on the role of the General Assembly,\nwhich is the only universal and truly representative United\nNations organ, have touched mainly on peripheral issues,\nsuch as the timing of plenary meetings, the duration of the\ngeneral debate and the organization of the General\nAssembly\u2019s work.\nNo one should disagree that to put the United\nNations on a sound financial basis ought to be a common\nendeavour. We certainly do not. But it must really be a\ncollective enterprise involving fair give and take. Political\nresistance coalesces because it has become clear that the\nmajority are expected to give, while the few only take.\nResistance is underscored by the historical fact that the\npercentage financial contributions of all permanent\nmembers, except France, have been steadily reduced over\nthe years while their privileges have not. Resistance is\nstrengthened by the recollection that the United Nations\nhas in fact repeatedly made the financial adjustments\nasked for, but as yet without any appreciable change in\nthe payment record of the largest contributor.\nI do not suggest that this situation is the result of a\ndeliberate policy, since no country takes any pleasure in\nbeing unable to pay its dues for whatever reason. But it\nis politically incongruous and basically unfair to ask the\nmajority to assume a greater share of the financial\nburdens without at the same time being prepared to allow\nthem any more authority over the most important\nexpenditure decisions. It is untenable to have an almost\ntotal separation between the authority for launching\npeacekeeping operations and how and who should pay for\nthem. The United Nations is the only organization in\nwhich a small number of Members run up the largest bills\nwhile everybody else pays them.\nThe stubborn defence of the status quo is all the\nmore striking because no one has asked for anything more\nthan the most modest and incremental adjustments to the\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the\nSecurity Council to allow the general membership a little\ngreater participation in and shared responsibility for the\ndecision-making with the greatest budgetary implications.\nSingapore is, of course, a small State, and I do not\nclaim to be a disinterested party. As a small State, we are\npassionately concerned about and vitally engaged in the\nfuture of the United Nations. However, our drawing\nattention to the real obstacles to reform is not just in the\ninterests of small countries alone.\nI have suggested that the paradoxical political\nconsequence of a globalized world economy is a certain\nenhancement of centrifugal tendencies everywhere. A\nuniversal international organization to play an integrative\nrole is therefore needed by everyone, big and small, if\nthis is not to lead to conflict. Only the United Nations can\nplay this role, and if it did not exist, we would have had\nto invent it. But the United Nations can play this\n15\n\n\nintegrative role only if the legitimate aspirations of the\nsmall States are not ignored and if the majority do not\nbecome increasingly alienated from the very Organization\nthat purports to represent them.\nSome may dismiss the distance between the rhetoric\nand the reality of the big-Power attitude towards United\nNations reform as simple hypocrisy. I do not accept such a\nsimplistic explanation. I can empathize with the far more\ncomplex and wrenching psychological adjustments that the\nbig Powers need to make. The big Powers must summon\nthe political courage to begin this process and embrace the\nreality of, and necessity for, change. I appeal to them to\nwork with us, the small-State majority, to make this truly\na United Nations for all \u2014 all \u2014 its Members.\nPrestige does not depend solely on privilege, and\npower shared is not power lost. The new international\nrealities are making a zero-sum conception of State power\nobsolete. A credible United Nations, one that is not\nregarded as the mere tool of its largest Members, will be a\nmore effective instrument for the foreign policies of all its\nMembers, big and small.\nIn closing, let me say that my delegation looks\nforward to close collaboration with you, Sir, and all other\nmembers over the next year to advance a collective vision\nof a truly representative, effective and united United\nNations for the twenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of Korea, Sir,\nI would like to express my sincere congratulations on your\nassumption of the presidency of the fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly. We are confident that under your able\nleadership the Assembly will take action to revitalize the\nworld Organization, building on the foundation laid by your\npredecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal. My\ngratitude goes also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, and the staff of the Secretariat for their\nexcellent work for this session.\nThe most pressing business of this Assembly is to\ncreate the architecture for United Nations renewal. The\nMember States, with vision and determination, need to\nconstruct step by step a consensus on reform that will not\nonly bring the Organization out of its present crisis, but will\nalso prepare the world community to meet the challenges of\nthe twenty-first century. We welcome the ongoing efforts\nto strengthen and revitalize the United Nations. But at the\nsame time we must admit that unless progress is accelerated\nin the months ahead, there is a real danger that the\nmomentum and sense of purpose spawned by the fiftieth\nanniversary could well be lost.\nMy Government actively supports the various working\ngroups of the General Assembly as they seek ways to make\nthe United Nations more effective, efficient and democratic.\nAs a member of the Group of Sixteen States in support of\nrenewing multilateralism, we are also pleased to actively\nparticipate in the efforts to enhance the principle of\nmultilateralism. The Group\u2019s joint statement embodying this\nprinciple was reported to the General Assembly last\nWednesday by Prime Minister Persson of Sweden, on\nbehalf of the 16 Heads of State or Government.\nAll these efforts, however, will be of no use if\nMember States fail either to meet their financial\nobligations or to make the political compromises\nnecessary to produce a durable package of reforms. Let us\nnot forget that the very principles of multilateralism on\nwhich the United Nations was founded are at risk. As was\nso aptly put by the President of the General Assembly in\nhis 17 September inaugural speech, \u201cthe syndrome of\nbusiness as usual'\u201d (Official Records of the General\nAssembly, Fifty-first Session, Plenary Meetings, 1st\nmeeting, p. 3) must be discarded.\nOur Organization is in serious financial trouble due\nto the arrears and outstanding contributions of Member\nStates. The Security Council needs to be modernized to\nreflect the expansion in United Nations membership, to be\nmore equitably balanced geographically and to work\nefficiently, transparently and democratically. To better\nserve the needs of economic development and to reduce\nduplication, we should undertake a sweeping reassessment\nof the scores of subsidiary bodies of the Economic and\nSocial Council and of the Assembly itself. While we\nwelcome General Assembly resolution 50/227 as a step in\nthe right direction, much more needs to be done. History\nwill not judge the United Nations on how many\ncommittees it forms or how many resolutions it passes,\nbut on how much it does on the ground, day in and day\nout, to further peace, prosperity and justice for the\nworld\u2019s peoples.\nToday I would like to focus my remarks on four\nmajor challenges facing the United Nations and then to\nsay a few words about the situation on the Korean\npeninsula.\nIn considering the architecture for United Nations\nrenewal, we should shape an Organization better prepared\nto respond to the following four priority needs: first,\nrestraining the proliferation of dangerous and destructive\nweaponry; secondly, bolstering United Nations capabilities\nfor effective peacekeeping and peace-building; thirdly,\nassisting economic and social development while\nenhancing protection of the environment; and fourthly,\nimproving mechanisms for ensuring respect for\ninternational law and human rights.\nCalls for a new international order will ring hollow\nwithout more reliable controls on the spread of dangerous\n\n\n\narmaments, particularly those capable of mass destruction.\nAs a supporter of the early conclusion of a comprehensive\ntest-ban treaty (CTBT), my Government heartily welcomed\nthe long-awaited adoption of the Treaty earlier this month.\nThe conclusion of the CTBT will help curb nuclear\nproliferation in all its forms and will contribute towards\nnuclear disarmament. As an original signatory to the CTBT,\nthe Republic of Korea aims to ratify the Treaty swiftly. In\norder for the CTBT to become universal and verifiable, my\nGovernment urges all countries to accede to the Treaty at\nthe earliest possible date.\nWhile the Conference on Disarmament failed to reach\nconsensus on the CTBT, the Conference, through two and\na half years of intense negotiations, was instrumental in\narticulating the eventual Treaty. I would like to take this\nopportunity to pay tribute to the Conference and to assure\nthe Assembly that the Republic of Korea, as a new member\nof the Conference, will spare no efforts to contribute to its\nvital work.\nDespite much progress towards a world free of nuclear\nweapons, the Korean peninsula still faces the threat of\nnuclear proliferation. North Korea has yet to achieve\nnuclear transparency. Once again, my delegation urges\nNorth Korea to comply with its obligations under the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards in\na comprehensive manner, and to implement fully and\nfaithfully the Framework Agreement between the United\nStates and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. We\nalso renew our call on North Korea to live up to its\nobligations under the South-North Joint Declaration on the\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nUntil they are eliminated from the face of the Earth,\nchemical and biological weapons too will pose a grave\nthreat to humanity. Towards this end, the Republic of\nKorea, as an original signatory to the chemical weapons\nConvention in 1993, recently concluded the domestic\nprocedures to ratify the Convention. We look forward to its\nswift entry into force, for universal adherence to the\nConvention is critical to achieving a total ban on chemical\nweapons. My delegation therefore strongly urges those\ncountries which have not yet joined the Convention,\nincluding the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, to do\nso as early as possible.\nMoreover, my Government, which acceded to the\nbiological weapons Convention supports the efforts to\nintroduce a strict verification system into the Convention.\nBoth of these non-proliferation measures are essential\nbuilding blocks for world peace.\nMy Government, moreover, shares the international\nconcern over the millions of anti-personnel landmines\nscattered throughout the world. We are looking forward\nto working closely with other Member States to minimize\nthe suffering and casualties among innocent civilians\ncaused by these indiscriminate weapons. To this end, I am\npleased to announce that the Republic of Korea will again\nextend its moratorium on the export of anti-personnel\nmines for another year.\nThe second priority for United Nations renewal\nshould be to adapt and bolster its uniquely valuable\npeacekeeping and peace- building work to meet new\nchallenges. Following several years of rising expectations\nand expanding mandates, Member States have developed\nover the past two years a more sober appreciation not\nonly of the limits of United Nations capabilities but, more\nimportant, of their own willingness to provide the\nrequisite material and human support for a more\nambitious role for the world body. Both the scope and the\nnature of peacekeeping operations are being tested as the\ndemands for United Nations involvement remain high in\na world confronted by an alarming number of intra-State\nconflicts and acts of terrorism.\nToday\u2019s peacekeepers are often required to undertake\ndiverse tasks such as monitoring violations of human\nrights, staging elections, rehabilitating civic institutions\nand reintegrating combatants and refugees into peacetime\nsociety. Thus, peacekeeping now directly contributes to\npeace-building and conflict prevention. Post-conflict\npeace-building, by rehabilitating a country\u2019s war-ravaged\neconomic and social base, can serve to prevent the\nrecurrence of conflict. Member States should recognize,\nhowever, that the broadening of peacekeeping objectives\nshould be matched by an expansion in the resources and\ncapabilities of the United Nations for carrying out these\ntasks. Peace, too, has a price.\nRecently, several promising proposals have been put\nforward for enhancing the rapid deployment capability of\nthe United Nations. We consider the United Nations\nsystem of standby arrangements \u2014 currently comprising\nof 59 countries, including the Republic of Korea \u2014 to be\nan innovative and practical mechanism for coping with\nemergency situations. We also believe that the growing\ninterest and participation of Member States have boosted\nthe credibility of the system of standby arrangements,\nmaking it easier to secure the consent of parties in a\n12\n\n\ngiven conflict to United Nations peacekeeping involvement.\nIn addition, we support the establishment of a rapidly\ndeployable headquarters team within the Department of\nPeacekeeping Operations, as proposed by the friends of\nrapid deployment. The Korean Government is willing to\ndetail personnel to the team as part of our contribution to\nstrengthening the United Nations rapid deployment\ncapability.\nSince we first dispatched an engineering unit to the\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operation in Somalia in 1993,\nthe Republic of Korea has contributed to many\npeacekeeping operations around the world. We intend to\nexpand our participation in terms of human resources, and\nmaterial and political support for practical steps to improve\nthe peace-management capacity of the United Nations.\nIn an uncertain world, terrorism poses an ever-present\nthreat to international and domestic peace and security.\nHaving been a direct victim of terrorism, the Republic of\nKorea strongly condemns all acts of terrorism. We urge the\ninternational community to take firm action to contain and\ncombat terrorism. The 1994 Declaration on Measures to\nEliminate International Terrorism clearly states that\nterrorism in all forms is not only criminal, but also\nunjustifiable under any circumstances, regardless of\npolitical, ideological, ethnic or racial motivation. My\nGovernment reaffirms its strong commitment to join the\nongoing efforts to eradicate terrorism worldwide.\nEconomic and social development should also remain\na high priority at a time when scientific progress and\ninformation technology are globalizing the world economy\nat a rapid pace. Driven by unprecedented levels of cross-\nborder trade and investment, globalization presents new\nopportunities to bolster economic development and improve\nquality of life. Nonetheless, we must not lose sight of the\ndetrimental effects of this trend, which threaten to leave\nsome developing countries increasingly marginalized.\nThe United Nations has an obligation to try to help\nthose least developed countries, particularly in Africa, that\nare truly in need. My delegation fully supports the United\nNations System-wide Special Initiative for development in\nAfrica, a joint undertaking by the United Nations and the\nBretton Woods institutions launched last March. We look\nforward to joining other Member States in a common effort\nto bring this worthy endeavour to fruition.\nHaving risen from the devastation of the Korean War,\nthe Republic of Korea has achieved sustained economic\ngrowth and advancements in living standards over the past\nthree decades. Seeking to share the lessons of our own\ndevelopment experience, we have worked to help other\ndeveloping countries apply two key elements of our own\ngrowth: capacity-building and human resource\ndevelopment. The Korean International Cooperation\nAgency is implementing diverse programs to assist other\ndeveloping countries in this regard. At the same time,\nKorea will increase its voluntary contribution to the\noperational activities of the United Nations by 120 per\ncent during 1996-97. In these and many other ways, we\nare determined to participate in United Nations efforts to\nbring about economic and social progress throughout the\nworld.\nSince 1994, my Government has worked with the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to\nestablish the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul. This\nInstitute will be dedicated to capacity-building for\ndeveloping countries in the development and use of\nvaccines, particularly for children and the impoverished.\nThe official launching of the International Vaccine\nInstitute will take place in New York on 28 October. We\nwould encourage as many countries as possible to show\ntheir support for this worthy and noble project by\nbecoming party to the agreement.\nThe emergence of unprecedented global\nenvironmental issues, such as climate change and\nbiodiversity, calls for genuine global partnership based on\nequitable burden-sharing. The special session on\nenvironmental issues of the General Assembly in 1997\nwill provide us with a valuable opportunity to formulate\na clear, sustainable development strategy for the twenty-\nfirst century. On 5 June 1997, immediately before the\nspecial session, my Government will co-host World\nEnvironment Day, together with the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP), as part of our efforts\nto contribute to the resolution of environmental issues.\nThe fourth theme for United Nations renewal, in our\nview, should be to reinforce the unique United Nations\ncapacity for codifying, monitoring and encouraging\nrespect for international law and human rights. As the\nCharter so eloquently attests, genuine peace and stability\ndepend upon a healthy respect for international law and\nhuman rights norms. The continuing United Nations\ncommitment to human rights and social justice was\nreaffirmed by a series of international conferences during\nthe 1990s. They include the Vienna World Conference on\nHuman Rights, in 1993, and the Fourth World Conference\non Women, held in Beijing in 1995.\n13\n\n\nIn particular, the Beijing Conference underscored the\ncritical principle that gender equality \u2014 through the\nprotection of women\u2019s human rights and the eradication of\nall forms of violence against women \u2014 forms the\nfoundation of a sound and prosperous society. The Republic\nof Korea is committed to maintaining its support for\ninternational efforts to advance the status of women.\nAll of us need to do more, however, to help the\nUnited Nations live up to its potential for promoting human\nrights. Its mechanisms for furthering respect for universal\nhuman rights need to be reinforced and upgraded across the\nboard. We need to enhance the coordinating role of the\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and of the resources\nof the Centre for Human Rights. The Korean Government\nwill do its best to make a meaningful contribution to this\nend.\nEnvisioned since the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals\nof a half century ago, the idea of an international court to\npunish crimes against humanity is now being materialized,\neven as the Yugoslavia and Rwanda Tribunals are\nstruggling to bring to justice criminals who have committed\ngenocide and other mass crimes. A preparatory committee\nis refining the draft statute of the international criminal\ncourt, prepared by the International Law Commission. We\nlook forward to the early establishment of the court, which\nwe believe will deter violators of human rights. We also\nwelcome the establishment of the International Tribunal for\nthe Law of the Sea, which should contribute significantly\nto the strengthening of international law and order.\nThe road to democracy in the Republic of Korea has\nbeen long and difficult. Indeed, laying the foundation for\ndemocracy in a developing country is never easy. It\nrequires a vigilant public conscious of democracy and\nhuman rights and a government willing to nurture the will\nof its citizens. This has been and will remain a primary\nobjective of the Korean Government. We are making every\neffort to promote further human rights and democracy\nthrough the enhancement of our legal and institutional\nmechanisms.\nMy Government has also been active in the endeavour\nto assist the democratic impulse throughout the world.\nLending our support to the electoral assistance activities of\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\nwe provided a dozen election monitors, as well as supplies,\nfor the international operation to ensure free and fair\nelections in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the past, we also\nparticipated in the electoral observer missions in\nMozambique, Cambodia, South Africa and Palestine.\nLet me now turn to the situation on the Korean\npeninsula. Despite the easing of tensions worldwide since\nthe end of the cold war, the Korean peninsula continues\nto be a source of instability, posing threats to the peace\nand security of north-east Asia and beyond.\nUnfortunately, the tides of openness and reconciliation\nthat swept other parts of the world have not yet reached\nthe Korean peninsula, the last remaining legacy of the\ncold war.\nLast week North Korea dispatched a military\nsubmarine to infiltrate armed commandos into the South.\nWe uncovered this infiltration when the submarine ran\naground on the shore of Kangrung, a city on the South\nKorean east coast, and 26 armed agents are believed to\nhave come ashore. Of these, 21 were killed and one was\ncaptured. According to the captured agent, the armed\ninfiltrators were all military officers from the North\nKorean defence ministry. Subsequent examinations also\nrevealed shocking findings. The 11 North Koreans found\ndead on the day of the landing were apparently killed by\ntheir cohorts for reasons unknown.\nThe investigation is still under way to find out the\npurpose of the infiltration and other details, but the\nfindings to date present a strong possibility that last\nweek\u2019s infiltration is part of a larger-scale infiltration\noperation.\nThis brazen act of military provocation by North\nKorea constitutes not only a serious infringement of our\nterritorial waters and sovereignty, but also a blatant\nviolation of the Armistice Agreement. It also clearly\ndemonstrates that North Korea still seeks Korean\nreunification by any means, including the use of force.\nNeedless to say, this act of provocation poses a direct\nthreat to peace and stability on and around the Korean\npeninsula.\nWe once again urge North Korea immediately to\nrenounce its absurd goal of unifying Korea by force and\nto pursue peaceful coexistence with the South. The North\nshould also abide by the Armistice Agreement and end\nany attempt to disrupt the current armistice regime.\nWe also take this opportunity to renew our call on\nNorth Korea to accept our proposal for four-party talks\ninvolving both Koreas, China and the United States,\nwhich will enable constructive negotiations for the\nestablishment of a lasting peace on the peninsula. In the\nabsence of Pyongyang\u2019s positive response and given the\nseriousness of North Korea\u2019s violation of the armistice,\n14\n\n\nmy country firmly believes that the Armistice Agreement\nshould remain in full force.\nAt the historic fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly, we took a collective look at where the United\nNations had been and where it was going. In an open and\nforward-looking spirit, we compared visions of the kind of\nworld body that will be needed to meet the challenges of\nthe twenty-first century. Now, with this fifty-first session,\ncomes the hard part: redoubling our collective commitment\nto the world body so that it can become a means for\ntranslating our visions into realities.\nTogether, we can fashion the architecture of United\nNations renewal. Can we achieve harmony out of diversity?\nCan we refocus our energies on the four priorities of\nstemming the spread of weapons of mass destruction,\nbolstering United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building\ncapabilities, advancing sustainable economic and social\ndevelopment, and reinforcing our joint commitment to\ninternational law and human rights? The answer to these\nquestions must be a resounding collective \u201cyes\u201d. The\nRepublic of Korea stands ready to make its share of\ncontributions, through the United Nations, to meet the\nchallenges of the next century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation and I are pleased, Sir, to see you\npresiding over the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly. Your great experience of multilateral\ndiplomacy, along with the apt initiatives which your great\ncountry, Malaysia, and you yourself have taken in many\nfocal areas of international relations make you the right\nperson to guide us and to ensure the success of this\nimportant session.\nI extend my sincere congratulations to your\npredecessor, Ambassador Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for\nthe outstanding work he did in heading the General\nAssembly at a difficult time, marked by a financial crisis\nunprecedented in the history of our Organization. Thanks\nto his abilities and diplomacy, he helped to preserve the\nfounding roles of this institution, namely the maintenance\nof peace and of economic and social development, and to\nguide it towards new areas. We are particularly grateful\nto him for his excellent work at the last session, which\nmarked the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization.\nThe delegation of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire would also like to\nthank the Secretary-General for the active and\ndetermined part that he has always played in heading the\nSecretariat, particularly in the areas of peacekeeping and\neconomic and social development. Accordingly, the C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire endorses the Declaration of African Heads of\nState or Government, who, at the thirty-second Summit of\nthe Organization of African Unity, held at Yaound\u00e9,\nreaffirmed Africa\u2019s right to a second term and\n4\n\n\nrecommended the candidature of Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali.\nNearly a year ago, on 22 October 1995, a Special\nCommemorative Meeting of the General Assembly took\nplace, involving 129 Heads of State or Government who\nhad come here solemnly to reconfirm their belief in the\nideals of the Charter of the United Nations, namely peace,\ndevelopment, international cooperation, equality and justice,\nand also to demonstrate their commitment to the reform and\nmodernization of our Organization so that it can take up the\nchallenges of the future. In the Declaration on the Occasion\nof the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations, adopted\non 24 October last, we committed ourselves to assuring that\nwe:\n\u201cwill give to the twenty-first century a United Nations\nequipped, financed and structured to serve effectively\nthe peoples in whose name it was established.\u201d\n(resolution 50/6)\nEncouraged by Ambassador Diogo Freitas do Amaral\nover the past year, the General Assembly and the\nSecretariat have advanced on the path of reform for the\nUnited Nations and clarification of its objectives and\nmissions. The open-ended working groups of the General\nAssembly responsible for examining \u201cAn Agenda for\nPeace\u201d, the Agenda for Development, Security Council\nreform, the financial situation of the United Nations, and\nthe strengthening of the United Nations system, have\nsufficiently progressed in their considerations to allow the\ngreatest hopes as to the restructuring of our Organization,\nits revitalization with an eye to greater effectiveness\nadapted to contemporary needs and challenges.\nI would add that after a decade of study and reflection\non United Nations reform, it is now imperative to proceed\nwith such reform so that we can focus on what constitutes\nthe raison d\u2019\u00eatre of our Organization: its essential missions,\nnamely, the maintenance of peace and security, the\npromotion of economic and social development, the\nstruggle against poverty, humanitarian assistance, the\nprotection of human rights and democracy, the protection\nof the environment, dialogue among cultures and respect for\ndiversity.\nConcomitant with this progress by Member State\ntowards reform, there has been an equally commendable\neffort by the Secretariat to correct the Organization\u2019s\ndisfunctions, particularly those relating to fragmentation\nwithin the United Nations system and the inadequacy of\ncertain coordinating mechanisms, as well as, in some cases,\nthe absence of a rational division of labour, which has led\nto overlapping and duplication.\nI would particularly like to mention, among other\nthings, the progress that has been made towards the\nrestructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in\nthe economic, social and related fields pursuant to\nresolution 50/227. On the basis of that resolution, the\nEconomic and Social Council will carry out its work\nwithin a rationalized framework that should enable it to\nattain the objectives assigned to it under the Charter. Its\nworking methods will also be adapted to the necessity of\nbetter time management and greater budgetary savings,\noperating on the basis of a rational reduction in the many\noutputs of this body, with a view to assuring greater\neffectiveness. Thanks to this resolution, we should be able\nslowly to move away from the heavy and spendthrift\nbureaucracy associated with our Organization.\nIt is in this spirit that, in anticipation, the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) was able to\nreform its working methods, redeploy its people in the\nfield and develop its activities thanks to a fruitful\npartnership within and beyond the United Nations system,\nnotably with representatives of civil society. This truly\nremarkable transformation of UNDP over the past two\nyears has enabled it to regain a central role in operational\nactivities for development on all continents, particularly\nin Africa, where it is steering the United Nations System-\nwide Special Initiative for Africa.\nReform is an act of the will that plays itself out over\ntime. It must be carried out from the inside and under the\nimpetus of Member States. In this regard, we may\nwelcome the evaluation of the Efficiency Board chaired\nby Under-Secretary-General Joseph Connor, whose work\nis highly encouraging as to the rational management of\nthe United Nations system.\nThus, all the sectors where overlapping and\nduplication were most obvious have now been singled out\nwith a view to proper management that will generate\nsubstantial economies in the budgetary performance of the\nSecretariat. Here we would like to say how pleased we\nare that the Secretary-General was able to hold the United\nNations budget for 1996-1997 within the strict limits\ndefined by the General Assembly. The $150 million in\nsavings are the result of a set of measures aimed at\nrationalizing and maximizing the cost-effectiveness ratio\nof the work of the Secretariat, as can be seen in the first\nreport of the United Nations Efficiency Board, which was\nmade public last month.\n5\n\n\nThe new spirit of budgetary strictness and\nadministrative efficiency that is becoming prevalent within\nthe Secretariat and among those in charge of the agencies\nand programmes of the United Nations system seems to\nhave given us a new awareness of the need for self-\nexamination and for concrete responses to the needs of\nMember States.\nWith close links between thinking and operational\nactivities, and with an increasing presence on the ground,\nthe United Nations will be closer to the people, and thus\nbetter able to take into account their needs in a number of\nareas, such as employment, education, health, humanitarian\nassistance and environment.\nSpecifically on the question of humanitarian\nassistance, we should highlight the remarkable way in\nwhich the United Nations has adapted in dealing with the\nrefugee problems resulting from internal conflicts in various\nparts of the world. There are millions of displaced persons,\nand this situation is without precedent since 1945. The\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs, the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) have been\nparticularly effective in this area.\nI think these examples are enough to rehabilitate the\nUnited Nations in the minds of some. If we were to believe\nits detractors, our Organization would be bureaucratic,\nbehind the times, ineffective and yet extravagant. While\nsome of these criticisms were perhaps justified to some\nextent in the past, today we can say that our Organization\nis moving resolutely towards reform and a structural and\nfunctional transformation that started a decade ago.\nLast year in San Francisco, 50 years after the founding\nof the United Nations, the international community\nreaffirmed at the highest level of leadership the relevance\nto today\u2019s world of the Charter and its purposes and\nprinciples. Through this important act, the international\ncommunity enshrined its commitment to attaining the\nobjectives set out in the Charter. The Declaration of\n24 October 1995 also confirmed the essential tasks of the\nUnited Nations for the year 2000: promoting peace,\ndevelopment, equality, justice and understanding among\npeoples. It also gave a special place to the advancement of\nwomen and the protection of children.\nIn order to carry out these tasks, in the last few years\nMember States have worked out careful strategies through\nthe cycle, ending this year, of thematic conferences that\nbegan in New York in 1990 with the World Summit for\nChildren, continued in Rio with the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development, in Vienna\nwith the World Conference on Human Rights, in Cairo\nwith the International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, in Copenhagen with the World Summit for\nSocial Development, in Beijing with the Fourth World\nConference on Women and in Istanbul with the Second\nUnited Nations Conference on Human Settlements\n(Habitat II). In this connection, we should also emphasize\nthe importance of the upcoming World Food Summit, to\nbe held under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) in Rome in\nNovember 1996. Complementing these initiatives, the\nAgenda for Peace and the Agenda for Development\nprovide an appropriate framework for thinking about the\nimportant interrelationship and interaction between peace\nand development.\nAlong the same lines, and without being exhaustive\nin my list, I would like to recall the progress made last\nyear in the areas of peace and disarmament with the\nsigning on 24 September 1996 of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The establishment of new\nnuclear-weapon-free zones in South-East Asia, the South\nPacific and Africa, and measures relating to nuclear safety\nand security are also positive achievements in this area.\nIn conflict prevention, on the initiative of Canada\nand the Netherlands excellent progress has been made in\ndeveloping the rapid-reaction capability of the United\nNations to respond to threats to peace and security. Other\ninitiatives from various sources also bear witness to the\ngrowing concern over preventing conflicts and acting in\nadvance, particularly in the area of development, so as to\ncreate conditions for consolidating social peace in\nMember States.\nWith regard to human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms, I would underline the specific, dynamic and\npublicly visible results of some recent United Nations\ndecisions, such as the establishment of a High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, the establishment and\neffective functioning of International Tribunals to\nprosecute and judge persons accused of serious violations\nof human rights in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda,\nand measures taken, or scheduled to be taken, in\ncombating terrorism and organized crime.\nFor these reasons, I think we can say that the United\nNations is now a much more coherent instrument vis-\u00e0-vis\nits objectives, its missions and its strategies. However, we\n6\n\n\nmust complete the renewal that is now under way. I have\nalready stressed that the Secretariat\u2019s efforts to adapt,\ncarried out through austerity measures, are healthy, but the\ndividends should be used to strengthen operational activities\nfor development.\nThe other central organs \u2014 the General Assembly, the\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council \u2014\nmust make continued, deeper-going transformations to\nupdate their structures, their functioning and their working\nmethods and adapt them to special circumstances that are\nunlike the post-world-conflict circumstances of 1945.\nIn this connection, and with particular regard to the\nGeneral Assembly, I should say, as I did when I presided\nover the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly, that\nthis body, within the context of the institutional balances\nprovided for in the Charter, should continue to play its full\npart in the reform process under way. The General\nAssembly, because of its unique form of legitimacy, is still\nthe best guarantor of the common interests of the Member\nStates.\nAs this fifty-first session begins, we find ourselves at\na crossroads. Last October we resoundingly reaffirmed the\nirreplaceable nature of the United Nations. Today, showing\npolitical will and above all a spirit of solidarity, we must\nnow translate that commitment into action. Without this\nreaffirmation of solidarity, the values on which the\ninternational community rests will become rather\nmeaningless. Our Organization must tirelessly continue to\nseek ways of strengthening this solidarity. We do not see it\nas much as we would like to, and the frustration of\ndeveloping countries is growing because of situations in\nwhich international cooperation targets are simply\ndisregarded and many promises remain unkept.\nIt is one thing to establish aid programmes and time-\nframes, but it is another to move ahead and actually do\nwhat the international community has committed itself to\ndo. Of course, the United Nations is often judged by\ninternational public opinion on the basis of its ability to\nconsolidate peace. But its credibility also depends on its\nability to act firmly in order to fill the increasingly wide\ngap between the rich and the developing countries.\nIt is high time that development aid found its place in\nan effort to mobilize, in which the actors, the industrialized\ncountries and the developing countries all get their fair\nshare. One cannot talk simultaneously about the existence\nof universal values, such as democracy or human rights,\nand still feel satisfied with a situation in which poverty and\nthe AIDS epidemic are steadily gaining ground, thus\nexacerbating the divisions within the international\ncommunity and thwarting national efforts.\nIn this context, the effort to combat AIDS must be\na subject of particular concern because of its devastating\nworld-wide effects, especially in developing countries,\nwhere 90 per cent of HIV-positive individuals are\nlocated \u2014 60 per cent in Africa alone \u2014 but which do\nnot have the resources to deal with this pandemic. On the\nquestion of access to medicines, particularly anti-\nretrovirus agents, it seems unacceptable to us that such\npreventive medicines are available to only 10 per cent of\nthose suffering from AIDS/HIV.\nHowever, also within the context of international\ncooperation to combat AIDS, we welcome some strong\naction that has been taken. For example, we welcome the\nEconomic and Social Council resolution making the\nquestion of AIDS as one of the topics for its 1997 high-\nlevel segment. We would also place great hope in the\ncommitments made to provide the Secretariat with an\nappropriate structure and relevant resources to support the\nUnited Nations AIDS Programme.\nI would like to speak more about Africa, as many\nrepresentatives already have, because the picture painted\nis often very far from the reality. There is little in\ncommon between the usual cliches about the wretched\nsituation in Africa and the velvet revolution which our\ncountries are engaged in carrying out. We have suffered\nfrom the scourge of the economic crisis which has spared\nno continent. We have suffered from the globalization of\nthe economy, in which we have been marginalized. We in\nAfrica are now beginning to reverse this trend. All the\nspecialists agree that Africa has set forth on the path to\neconomic recovery, with an average growth rate last year\nof 5 per cent.\nFor my own country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, I can say that\nafter the l980s, which were marked by a difficult\neconomic and financial crisis, the Government adopted a\ncoherent economic policy, backed by thorough sectoral\nstrategies to obtain viable, strong, self-sustaining growth.\nStabilization and adjustment programmes begun in 1993\nenabled the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to meet the conditions in 1994\nfor a recovery with greater diversification in our\neconomy, greater weight being given to the private sector\nand careful management of public finances, and a re-\ncentering of State control in the areas of regulation\nmonitoring and in the environment of economic activities.\nThis policy enabled us to achieve a 7-per-cent growth rate\n7\n\n\nin 1995, and suggests that we can achieve double-digit\ngrowth in 1998, which is the goal of President\nHenri Konan-B\u00e9di\u00e9, whose plan is to make C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire a\ntruly industrialized nation.\nAlong with efforts to win the fight for development,\nAfrican countries have also committed themselves to\ndemocratization, as can be seen, inter alia, in the\norganization of multi-party elections, the establishment of\nthe rule of law and the emergence of a responsible civil\nsociety. Backed up by true legitimacy, political leaders are\nabout to succeed in building modern States with the\nprimary purpose of ensuring national cohesion and progress.\nThe advances that we see here and there on our\ncontinent must be backed up by more sustained action by\nthe industrialized countries. Time is running out, and we\nmust move quickly from speeches, promises and good\nintentions to concrete action. The adoption of the Agenda\nfor Development ought, therefore, to be an opportunity for\nre-thinking the philosophy underlying development\nassistance, its mechanisms and its modalities, so that socio-\neconomic activities can be placed at the centre of the work\nof the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is an honour for me to\naddress the fifty-first session of the General Assembly of\nthe United Nations, confident that it will make yet another\npositive contribution to the advancement of world peace\nand cooperation among nations and countries of the world.\nThe current international political and security\nsituation is burdened with many crises, cases of blatant\nviolation of international law, the uncontrolled hoarding of\narms, upsets of the ecological balance, disrespect for human\nrights, widespread international terrorism, and tensions in\neconomic and social development. Such developments\nhave confronted the United Nations with the need to\nreform its system in order to preserve its ability to carry\nout its functions. This is especially so in the case of the\nplans that should determine global development in the\ntwenty-first century, alleviate existing gaps in the\neconomic and social development of countries and\nregions, and advance world peace.\nThe subject of the expansion of the Security Council\nis undoubtedly one that should receive priority treatment\nat this session. In view of the changed structure of the\ninternational community and the growing role of the\nSecurity Council in recent years, and of the need for\nfurther democratization of the decision-making process as\nregards global peace and security, the conditions for\nexpansion seem ripe. The Republic of Macedonia is\nactively taking part in the activities of the Working Group\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council. We\nbelieve that the proposal for including the Federal\nRepublic of Germany and Japan as permanent members\nof the Security Council, as well as the expansion of the\nnumber of rotating members is realistic and deserves\nspecial attention. At the same time, other constructive and\ncomplementary approaches in circulation should also be\nkept in mind. If necessary, the Republic of Macedonia is\nprepared to make an individual proposal in this respect\nwith a view to overcoming any possible delay in the\nresolution of this issue.\n\n\nWishing to make a constructive and active contribution\nto the work of the United Nations, the Republic of\nMacedonia has submitted its candidacy for rotating\nmembership in the Security Council for the 1998-1999\nterm. We are convinced that our demeanour during and\nfollowing the dissolution of the former Socialist Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, the constructive and peaceful\npolicy we have upheld, our acknowledged position as a\nfactor of stability in the Balkans, our commitment to its\nEuropeanization and our activities within the United\nNations to date will be a sufficient basis and guarantee for\nsecuring the support of United Nations Members for our\ncandidacy. I wish to assure them that we will fully justify\nthe confidence they bestow.\nFrom the very onset of our independence, the Republic\nof Macedonia, the only one of the former Yugoslav\nrepublics to achieve independence peacefully, has\ndistinguished itself as an example of a country whose\nleverage in the international community and whose foreign\npolicy are founded on consistent respect for the principles\nof the United Nations, a readiness to cooperate with\nneighbouring and other countries and to resolve all open\nissues in a peaceful manner on the basis of mutual respect,\nthe inviolability of borders and non-interference in the\ninternal affairs of other countries.\nLed by these commitments, the Republic of\nMacedonia submitted two resolutions for good-neighbourly\nrelations among the Balkan countries. They were sponsored\nby more than 30 countries and adopted unanimously, with\nthe aim of undertaking measures and preventive action that\nwill create a stable zone of peace and cooperation in the\nBalkans by the end of the year 2000. In accordance with\nthe resolutions, the Republic of Macedonia will be the host\nof a high-level international meeting of the Balkan countries\nin January next year, dedicated to the advancement of\nstability in the region.\nLed by the principles of the United Nations, last year\nthe Republic of Macedonia signed the Interim Accord with\nthe Republic of Greece within the framework of the\nnegotiations held under United Nations auspices. The\npositive results of this Accord are already evident. We are\nconfident of the prospects for good and friendly relations\nbetween our countries and that we will reconcile the\nremaining differences.\nThe level of democratization we have achieved, our\nreforms aimed at adapting the economy to market\nmechanisms, and our high human-rights standards confirm\nour intentions of becoming fully integrated into\ninternational and regional economic and security\nstructures. Today, the Republic of Macedonia is a full-\nfledged member of the Council of Europe, the oldest\nEuropean political organization, and the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). It is a\npartner in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s\n\u201cPartnership for Peace\u201d. It has also concluded a\ncooperation agreement with the European Union, with\nprospects for closer association and membership in the\nUnion.\nThe peace-keeping forces of the United Nations that\ncomprise the United Nations Preventive Deployment\nForce (UNPREDEP) in the Republic of Macedonia have\nset the precedent for the United Nations successful\ninvolvement in the concept of preventive diplomacy. They\nhave clearly demonstrated the justification and merit of\nthis concept. We have a very high regard for the role that\nUNPREDEP plays in the preservation of peace and\nsecurity in the Republic of Macedonia and the region.\nConsequently, and in view of the existing and potential\nthreats to peace in the region, we have already requested\nan extension of the UNPREDEP mandate for an\nadditional six months.\nThe region in which my country is situated, the\nBalkans, is one of the most sensitive in Europe. It is\npresently in the midst of the so-called \u201cpost-Dayton\u201d\nera encompassing the process of bringing to life the\nfragile peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the\nnormalization of relationships among countries and the\nopening of prospects for development and cooperation in\nthe region. In this context, the Republic of Macedonia, as\na peaceful country oriented towards Europe, remains\nsteadfast in its policy, especially in terms of resolving the\neconomic and social problems it is facing as a country in\ntransition and particularly with regard to the rights of\nnational minorities as a precondition not only for\ndemocratization and security in Macedonia, but also for\nwider security in the southern Balkans. The Republic of\nMacedonia has opted for the model of respect for human\nand minority rights and for the implementation of\ninternational standards pertaining to the rights of national\nminorities. This is guaranteed by the firm provisions of\nthe Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and\nthrough its legislative and political practice. We remain\ndeeply convinced that, in the ethnically inter-mixed\nBalkans, the guaranteed rights of national minorities are\nthe most important long-term factor for stable peace and\ncooperation. This is why we have proposed the idea of a\ncomparative study regarding national- minority rights in\nthe Balkans that will enable much more efficient action to\n2\n\n\nbe taken by such international institutions as the OSCE, the\nCouncil of Europe and most certainly the United Nations.\nAllow me to conclude my address by expressing my\nconviction that a vision of the world in the twenty-first\ncentury as one of peace, democracy and well-being will\nprompt all of us and the United Nations to act with\npersistence and determination. It is my hope that the\ndecisions and the direction set out by this year\u2019s General\nAssembly will be a step towards that goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOnce again the United Nations General\nAssembly is meeting to take stock of the global situation\nand of the role that the Organization plays in that context.\nI am confident that the experience, talent and diplomatic\nskills of our President, His Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail,\nwill play a decisive role in this complex undertaking. I\nwish him every success in his sensitive work.\nI wish also to express my delegation\u2019s gratitude for\nthe excellent job done by Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal, in the course of\n17\n\n\nthe last General Assembly session, which commemorated\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the founding of this Organization.\nMy country has been observing very closely the\nadministrative activities of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his\ncapacity as Secretary-General, and we feel bound to express\nour recognition of the poise with which he has guided the\nUnited Nations during these difficult times for the\nOrganization and for the whole world. His undeniable\nqualities of statesmanship have averted crises, and his\nstrength of character has succeeded in upholding the ideals\non which this Organization is founded. I wish to convey to\nhim, on my own behalf and on behalf of my Government,\nmy sincere respect and admiration.\nHonduras reiterates its conviction that international\nconflicts must be settled by peaceful and diplomatic means.\nFor this reason, we recognize the importance and value of\nthe 1995 Dayton peace agreement, the 1996 Paris\nagreements and the subsequent international agreements and\ncommitments for which the international community\nprepared the way. These have led to a cessation of\nhostilities, the resumption of political talks, international\nrecognition between Belgrade and Zagreb, and the\nestablishment of relations between the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia and The former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia.\nIn the Americas, Haiti is an example of the results that\ncan be achieved through concerted action and political will\non the part of the international community in establishing,\nthrough the United Nations, operations designed to achieve,\nmaintain and consolidate peace. My country wishes to\nexpress its satisfaction at having taken part in those\noperations, as well as in those carried out in Western\nSahara.\nIn the same vein, we cannot overlook the problems of\nthe subregion. Honduras has always viewed with concern\nthe problems besetting its sister republics in Central\nAmerica. For this reason, we acknowledge and support all\nefforts in this regard, in particular the agreements reached\nbetween the Government of Guatemala and the URNG.\nAt the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly,\nmy country secured unanimous support in this body to\noccupy a seat in the Security Council as a non-permanent\nmember. We believe that we have fully lived up to the trust\nvested in us, since we have worked in the Council in strict\nadherence to the principles and norms of international law\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and in keeping\nwith the foreign policy pursued by the President of the\nRepublic, Mr. Carlos Roberto Reina.\nThroughout our first term of presidency of the\nCouncil, in July last year, we succeeded in maintaining\nthe necessary equanimity and balance to steer the work\nand the debates on the various issues brought before the\npresidency of the Council. These included humanitarian\noperations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda and\nBurundi, as well as peace operations in Haiti, Angola and\nLiberia.\nTomorrow we will assume the presidency of the\nSecurity Council for the second time, and we shall work\nin the same spirit of cooperation and with genuine resolve\nto help bring about solutions to problems that arise in the\narea of international peace and security.\nCentral America has now returned to the world\nscene with a new, integrational approach that promotes\njoint action and allows it to speed up its development\nprocess. Our approach, grounded in history, tradition,\nsolidarity and, above all, our awareness of a shared\ndestiny, has made it possible for us to pool our efforts in\nseeking to achieve a higher level of economic\ndevelopment in all areas.\nIn the framework of the integration process in our\nsubregion, since 1986 we have held a series of\npresidential summits, the first six of which were highly\npolitical in nature, fulfilling the purpose of securing peace\nand democratization in the region. The following ones,\nfocusing on economic topics, led to the formation of the\nCentral American Integration System (SICA) and defined\nour current agenda: alliance for sustainable development.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank this\nAssembly for the support it gave our System last year by\ngranting it the status of observer, which will make it\npossible to achieve greater cooperation between the\nUnited Nations System and the Central American\nIntegration System.\nAs we stand on the threshold of a new millennium,\nmy Government is strongly committed to the\nresponsibilities imposed by the world around us. In this\nrespect, Honduras is in favour of greater democratization\nof the principal organs of the United Nations. We take the\nview that an increase in the number of permanent and\nnon-permanent Members of the Security Council should\nbe carried out in accordance with the principles of\nsovereign equality of States and equitable geographical\n18\n\n\ndistribution, and that it should reflect the expansion in the\nmembership of the United Nations in recent decades so as\nto transform the Security Council into a more democratic\nand representative organ, that would thus be a more\ncredible and effective instrument in fulfilling its primary\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity without affecting its efficiency or the speed of its\ndecision-making processes. Genuine democratization and\nreal representativity in the Security Council should be the\nprincipal basis for the expansion of twenty-first-century\nworld government.\nWe would all like to see a more competent, responsive\nand responsible United Nations. We should all like it to be\nbetter administered and more consolidated and to yield\ntangible results. To this end, it is essential to undertake\nmeaningful reform in order to enhance its efficiency and to\nensure that the United Nations can have a secure financial\nfooting, robust administration and structural capacity, and\na clear sense of purpose in tackling its tasks.\nThe General Assembly should play the role now\nplayed by costly world conferences, and it should be the\nforum for sustained thematic debates on important and\ntopical issues held at regular intervals. At the same time,\nthe traditional agenda of the Assembly should be cut back\nradically. Recurring items should be considered less\nfrequently. We should impose a time limit on our\nstatements, and we need to reform the structure of the\ncommittees and auxiliary bodies so as to avoid overlapping\nand duplication.\nMy country, Honduras, is continuing to work\nvigorously to strengthen, among other things, its democratic\nsystem of government, to bolster judicial power, to organize\nthe national police under civilian rule, to modernize the\nState, in addition to striving to create a new frame of\nreference to promote development on the basis of full\nparticipation by all sectors of society.\nHonduras, like all other developing countries, is deeply\ncommitted to processes designed to combat poverty and\nunderdevelopment and to mobilize the potential of its\npeoples and resources in order to attain speedy, fair and\nsustained growth, working jointly to enhance the effect of\nnational efforts through solidarity, cooperation and mutual\nconfidence.\nHowever, there are still many economic and financial\nobligations that need to be met in the short- and medium-\nterm. International cooperation is steadily declining, and\npoverty indicators are becoming worse.\nWe wish to see a world where countries, mindful of\ntheir diversity, act together to attain common goals, a\nworld in which peace, security and dignity will be the\ncommon heritage of all peoples, a world in which the\nadvances of science will serve to benefit humankind and,\nin short, a world in which existing resources are used\nrationally in order to meet everyone\u2019s needs. This is our\nunderstanding of what, in essence, North-South\ncooperation should mean.\nAs the United Nations enters its second half-century,\nwe have an opportunity to work towards the objective of\nits Charter \u2014 world cooperation in deterring and halting\naggression \u2014 and to foster peaceful, productive and\nsustainable human progress. In this respect, \u201cAn Agenda\nfor Development\u201d offers a unique opportunity to make the\nissue of economic and social development a central\npriority of the multilateral system. Promotion of sustained\neconomic growth and eradication of poverty in the\ndeveloping countries, as well as the legitimate leadership\nthat the United Nations should show in this field, must\nalso be key objectives of the Agenda.\nMy country hopes that the negotiations on the\nAgenda for Development being held by the Ad Hoc\nOpen-ended Working Group of the General Assembly on\nAn Agenda for Development will conclude promptly and\nsuccessfully in the course of the fifty-first session of the\nAssembly. The completion of this work will be a point of\ndeparture because it will give rise to firm commitments\nand mark the beginning of the task of putting the actions\nagreed upon into practice.\nHonduras, as a peace-loving country, reaffirms its\ntotal support for the principles and objectives seeking the\ncomplete elimination of nuclear weapons and to establish\na universal, verifiable, multilateral and effective\nmachinery that will help to promote nuclear disarmament\nand to prevent proliferation of such weapons in all its\naspects.\nConsistent with these principles, I am pleased to\nannounce that Honduras has signed the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty at this session of the General\nAssembly, and I would venture to appeal to all States\nMembers of the United Nations to sign it as soon as\npossible. We would also urge all States possessing\nnuclear weapons to take resolute steps to reduce them\nwith a view to their elimination.\nThe existence of landmines and other undetonated\nexplosive devices in various regions of the world is a\n19\n\n\ntremendous humanitarian problem and a grave threat to the\nsecurity, health and survival of the local population where\nthese deadly devices have been scattered. These devices\nprevent the return of refugees and displaced persons to their\nhomes in the States affected by this ongoing menace and\nimpede humanitarian operations and programmes, national\nreconstruction and economic development activities and\npeacekeeping operations.\nFor this reason, we urge Member States, particularly\nthose that have the capacity to do so, to lend their\nassistance to the affected countries, including those of the\nCentral American region, with a view to establishing and\nrefining national mine-clearance mechanisms. We also\nappeal to the international community finally to agree on\nthe total prohibition of the production, exportation, sale and\nuse of anti-personnel mines.\nMy delegation wishes once again to place on record its\ninterest in seeing the Republic of China in Taiwan admitted\nas a Member of the United Nations. At this moment in\ntime, when democratic systems of government and the rule\nof law are gaining ground in most of the nations that make\nup this Organization, it seems contradictory to continue\nexcluding the Republic of China in Taiwan from\nparticipation. This is a country which struggled\ndeterminedly for democracy and succeeded in establishing\nit this year with the election of a Government by the direct\nvote of the majority of its people. This is a nation that\nrespects human rights, possesses one of the strongest\neconomies on earth and has been constantly struggling to\neradicate poverty, and whose population of 21 million\npeople enjoys an enviable cultural level. In short, the\nRepublic of China in Taiwan fully meets the requirements\nestablished in the Charter for membership of the United\nNations.\nFor the developing countries, its participation in the\nvarious international forums would be extremely beneficial,\nsince we would be able to draw on its valuable experience\nin cooperation programmes, as demonstrated when it\noccupied a seat in this General Assembly from the day it\nsigned the Charter until 1971.\nIn this respect, my Government supports the resolution\nadopted on 19 July 1996 by the European Parliament\nentitled the \u201cRole of Taiwan in International\nOrganizations\u201d, which explicitly states its support for the\nidea that the Republic of China in Taiwan should have a\ngreater level of recognition and representation in\ninternational agencies. It also urges the United Nations to\nestablish a working group to study the possibility of its\nparticipation in the activities of the United Nations and its\ninternational agencies.\nThe problem of drug production is not as severe in\nthe Central American region as it is elsewhere, although\nour countries are not unaffected by drug use. For this\nreason, on 21 June, the Ministers of the Interior of our\nregion agreed to develop a plan of cooperation to fight\nthis evil. In this regard, we support the initiative of\nconvening a special session of the United Nations General\nAssembly in 1998 in order to strengthen the international\nstrategy to combat narcotic drugs.\nWith a view to beginning to address the problem of\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations\nsystem, 1996 could be a year of meditation and reflection.\nCalls have been made for a redefinition of the purposes\nof the Organization and, in particular, of the tasks of the\nSecurity Council. In order to achieve this important task,\nwe must work on the basis of a shared and balanced\nvision of the future of the Organization. The construction\nof a culture of international peace, security and prosperity\nshould be the ultimate goal in this redefinition of tasks.\nThis is something that the United Nations must\naccomplish in response to the needs of our peoples.\nAs we approach the end of the century and the\nmillennium, the globality of economies and the grouping\nof countries into systems of integration are becoming\nirreversible facts. One consequence of this will be the\nresurgence of mega-States in which smaller States will\nremain submerged. We are concerned for the future of\nweaker and less developed nations which, like ours,\nrequire great external and internal efforts to retain the\nidentity that distinguishes them from the rest of the world.\nThe right of peoples to decide their own destiny on\nthe basis of sovereignty is enshrined in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. This right must be observed in the new\nworld order if we wish to preserve, as is our duty, peace\nand cultural plurality among nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to congratulate the\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session\non his election to his high office. I would like to express\nmy confidence that he will accomplish his important\nmission honourably.\nThere is no doubt that the fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly will go down in the history of mankind\nas an important milestone on the world community\u2019s road\nto global peace and security. One of the most important\ndiplomatic documents of our century, the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, has been opened for signing.\nOn that occasion the President of Kazakstan,\nMr. Nursultan Nazarbaev, made a special statement,\nwhich has been circulated as an official United Nations\ndocument. The people of Kazakstan, having fully\nexperienced the destructive power of nuclear weapons,\nresolutely voted to end the testing of these lethal\nweapons. In 1991 the President of Kazakstan, expressing\nthe wish of his people, made a decision to shut down the\nSemipalatinsk nuclear test site. Thus, Kazakstan had\nalready taken decisive measures to ban nuclear testing\nfive years ago.\n20\n\n\nKazakstan is consistent in its policy of non-\nproliferation of nuclear weapons. Recently, we completed\nthe dismantling of the nuclear infrastructure on the territory\nof Kazakstan, thereby eliminating the capability that was,\nuntil recently, the fourth largest in the world.\nThat is why, when giving their due to all the countries\nwhich have trod the thorny path of preparing this Treaty, I\nbelieve it is necessary to recognize my country\u2019s significant\ncontribution to this extremely important cause.\nHowever, considerable progress in disarmament does\nnot, regrettably, guarantee the stability of the present world\norder. We still witness some negative impulses destroying\nthe basis of the relationship between the States which\nunited more than half a century ago. We have to admit that\nwith the disappearance of a bipolar world, our planet has\nnot become safer. On the contrary, the potential for global\nconflict has increased considerably increased. That is why\nthe issue of reforming the United Nations, so that our\ncommon Organization can adequately respond to conflicting\nrealities of international relations at this juncture, is\nbecoming ever so urgent.\nReforms are an indispensable element of any system\u2019s\ndevelopment. They are even more important in the case of\nsuch a universal forum as the United Nations. In his speech\nat the Special Commemorative Meeting of the General\nAssembly, the President of Kazakstan underscored the\nimportant need to increase the world community\u2019s efforts\nto elaborate a conceptual model of a renewed United\nNations. It involves new objectives, tasks and functions of\nthe United Nations of the next century.\nThe United Nations, being a genuinely universal\nOrganization, requires a special approach. It is important to\nkeep in mind that the United Nations is our common home.\nWe cannot count on hotels in case of emergency. That is\nwhy United Nations reforms should be approached from\nrational positions. We want the United Nations to keep up\nwith the times and to tap the potential for self-improvement\nand elimination of the vestiges of the past. We want the\nUnited Nations structure to be more effective and flexible\nin dealing with the problems threatening peace and security.\nSupporting the desire of Japan and Germany to become\npermanent members of the Security Council, Kazakstan is\nin favour of an expansion of the Council\u2019s non-permanent\nmembership on the basis of an equitable and balanced\nrepresentation of all regions. All other proposals should also\nbe taken into consideration.\nCriticism of the United Nations can hardly be a\nreason for doubting its ability to function and for shifting\nall the blame onto the Secretary-General. I am sure that\nwe have not yet fully mobilized the creative potential of\nthe United Nations. This applies first of all to the Charter.\nWe should carefully reread it, taking into consideration\ntoday\u2019s world order, not to drastically revise, it but to find\nadditional opportunities hidden in this truly\ncomprehensive document. It is our opinion that despite\nthe piles of studies on the legal framework of the United\nNations, the Charter itself contains enormous unexplored\npotential for the renewal of the United Nations. Until the\nUnited Nations mobilizes these dormant capabilities it\nwill create the impression of a dormant Organization\nunable to respond to the challenges of today.\nWe have to take a closer look at those provisions of\nthe Charter that deal with cooperation between the United\nNations and regional organizations, or, speaking the\nlanguage of the Charter, with regional arrangements and\nagencies. This kind of interaction would be extremely\neffective for the development of an early warning system\nand preventive diplomacy. Besides, active cooperation\nwith regional organizations would be beneficial when\ndealing with economic problems.\nI would like to recall President Nursultan\nNazarbaev\u2019s proposal to include in the agenda of a future\nsession of the General Assembly an item entitled \u201cUnited\nNations reforms \u2014 an adequate response to the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century\u201d.\nOne does not have to elaborate on the need to ensure\nstability and security in the Central Asia region.\nKazakstan, as a strategically important State in this\nregion, makes every effort to guarantee tranquillity in\nCentral Asia.\nHowever, the situation in the region defies\nstraightforward assessment. There are zones of\ntranquillity, including Kazakstan, but there are also zones\nof conflict. One matter of great concern is the situation in\nAfghanistan. Further escalation of the conflict in\nAfghanistan could have negative effects on the situation\nin Central Asia. We are grateful to the Security Council\nfor paying attention to the situation in that country. There\nis no doubt that the Security Council statement of 28\nSeptember 1996 is important for the resolution of the\nsituation there. At the same time, we urge the Security\nCouncil to take up this item again in order to elaborate\nmeasures to stop the conflict.\n21\n\n\nThe situation in Central Asia underscores the need for\ngreater interaction between the region and the United\nNations. Such interaction would cause Central Asia to\nbecome more involved in international cooperation. Central\nAsia could undoubtedly contribute to the establishment of\na safer world order.\nIn this regard, we pin great hopes on the establishment\nby the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\nPacific (ESCAP) and the United Nations Economic\nCommission for Europe (ECE) of a joint commission for\nCentral Asia. We appreciate the positive United Nations\nreaction to this initiative of our Head of State.\nKazakstan wants to join the World Trade Organization\nas soon as possible and is taking concrete steps in this\ndirection.\nWe are grateful to the United Nations for its support\nof Kazakstan\u2019s proposal concerning the resolution on transit\nenvironment in the landlocked States of Central Asia.\nWe are also pleased at the positive reaction of the\nUnited Nations to the initiative of the leaders of the three\nCentral Asian States concerning the formation of a Central\nAsian peacekeeping battalion. I would like to take this\nopportunity to state that the Central Asian peacekeeping\nbattalion will be committed to the United Nations Charter\nand will serve the ideals and purposes of our Organization.\nFour years ago, speaking at the United Nations, the\nPresident of Kazakstan pointed out the necessity of\nconvening a conference on interaction and confidence-\nbuilding measures in Asia. It is with deep satisfaction that\nwe can report that our quest for peace and security on the\nAsian continent is being supported by an ever increasing\nnumber of States. Experts are at work on a permanent\nbasis. A conference on Asian security took place at the\nlevel of Deputy Foreign Ministers. We are especially\ngrateful to the United Nations for its assistance in the\nimplementation of the initiative of our Head of State.\nKazakstan regards the convocation of this conference on\ninteraction and confidence-building measures in Asia as its\ncontribution to United Nations global peacekeeping efforts.\nKazakstan fully supports the peace-making activities\nof the United Nations in different parts of the world. We\nhave no doubt that the United Nations should play a\npriority role in the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. Our common task is to prevent United Nations\npeace-making functions from being delegated to any other\norganizations. The diminished peace-making potential of\nthe United Nations is not its fault, but its misfortune.\nKazakstan believes that United Nations peace-\nmaking activities could be rendered more effective\nthrough a more precise formulation and strengthening of\nthe missions\u2019 mandates. They could thereby make a\nsignificant contribution to the resolution of crisis\nsituations.\nWhen we talk about international issues we cannot\nignore a trend as alarming as the growth of secessionism.\nThis phenomenon has become one of the major causes of\ncrisis situations in the world, particularly in the post-\nSoviet context. We think that the United Nations must\npay close attention to the destructive consequences of\naggressive secessionism. The time has come to put an end\nto the absolute right of nations to self-determination.\nBasically, the world has already realized the right to self-\ndetermination; further continuation of this process will\ncreate new trouble spots and lead to more bloodshed. The\ncurrent world order should rest on the principles of the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States. If we really\ncare about the stability of the current world order we\nmust firmly reject any manifestation of secessionism. Our\nhighest values should be the peace, well-being and\nhappiness of peoples, and we can achieve these goals not\nby instigating peoples to self-determination but by\ncreating appropriate conditions for the sustainable\neconomic development of all nations.\nFrom this lofty rostrum it is impossible to ignore\nanother problem that brings great pain to humankind, a\npain which our country feels especially acutely. I am\nreferring to environmental disasters. There may be no\nother place in the world where such vast territories are\naffected by the consequences of these disasters. Indeed,\nmore than half of Kazakstan\u2019s territory could be declared\nan environmental disaster area. However, it is not only a\nmatter of territories, but people who are still suffering.\nThe Semipalatinsk nuclear test site and the Aral Sea have\nbecome disaster areas of global dimensions. Furthermore,\nwe should not forget that Kazakstan has been the site of\nchemical and biological weapons tests.\nAll these problems require priority attention from the\nUnited Nations. During economic transition, even large\nStates cannot cope alone with environmental problems of\nsuch magnitude. It is also important to remember that it\nis innocent people who suffer, not the ones who created\nor tested these lethal weapons. They are the victims of the\narms race between the two opposing systems, victims of\n22\n\n\nthe totalitarian thinking of the cold war period. They have\nevery right to demand the attention of international\norganizations and donor countries.\nWe cannot say that the United Nations has been\nindifferent to the consequences of the environmental\ndisasters in Kazakstan. But, at the same time, we cannot\nclaim that the victims of these environmental disasters have\nfelt practical results of the activities of international\nmissions. We are grateful to the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank for the\nelaboration of large-scale programmes for the rehabilitation\nof the Aral Sea zone. At the same time, we are looking\nforward to a more active execution of these programmes.\nMeanwhile, the situation in this region, as well as in other\nenvironmental disaster areas, remains extremely serious.\nKazakstan welcomes and supports the resolution of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly to convene a special\nsession on environment and sustainable development in the\nmiddle of next year. We hope that this forum will adopt\nmeaningful decisions on environmental problems that also\naffect our country.\nThis century, which has witnessed two world wars, the\ncollapse of the colonial system and the disintegration of the\nsocialist system, has begun a new phase. This phase has\nnew dimensions, both geo-political and geo-economic.\nIn politics, a trend towards the globalization of\ninternational problems has been apparent. With the end of\nthe cold war, the problems of nuclear non-proliferation have\nnot been solved. The problem of environmental security has\nacquired global dimensions. The globalization of\ncommunications has triggered illegal trafficking in weapons,\ndrugs and money of giant proportions. A new information\nrealm has been formed in which national borders have\nbecome merely symbolic.\nPreviously unknown methods of production have\nemerged, increasingly referred to as \u201ccomputer civilization\u201d.\nScientific research and technological factors have grown in\nimportance as never before. New technologies have become\nthe hottest items in world markets. The role of a State in\nworld economic ties is changing; it is no longer the\ndominant institute. International institutes function as\nindependent international economic entities.\nIt is with this list of problems, which is far from being\ncomplete, that we are entering the next century. We have\nyet to sort them out and find optimal ways to adapt to new\nrealities which will be facing us in the twenty-first\ncentury. We have to admit that humankind, creating these\nproblems through its activities, still cannot find adequate\nways to solve them.\nThat is why we turn to the United Nations. Our\ncommon home is becoming a quintessence of the human\nmind. We have to help the United Nations reach a new\nlevel in dealing with global trends. A renewed\nOrganization, promptly reacting to the challenges of\ntoday, will not only enrich itself but will also give us a\nsense of confidence on the eve of the next century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me pleasure, as we begin the work of this\nsession, to convey to you, Sir, on behalf of the delegation\nof the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, our sincerest\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly. Your\nassumption of that important position reflects the\nappreciation of Member States both of your personal\nqualities and of the positive role your country plays in the\ninternational arena. We wish you success in fulfilling your\nmission and assure you of our readiness and desire to\ncooperate with you fully in achieving the objectives of this\nsession.\nI wish also to take this opportunity to congratulate\nyour predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for his\neffective guidance of the affairs of the General Assembly\nlast session, which witnessed the celebration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of our Organization.\nI would also like to convey my sincere appreciation to\nthe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, who manages the affairs of this international\nOrganization with exceptional ability and competence in\na rapidly changing world. In order to deal with increasing\nexpectations regarding the present and future role of the\nUnited Nations, we consider that a renewal of his tenure\nwill provide him the opportunity to complete ongoing\nplans and efforts to reform the United Nations and to\nrestore its constructive role in the international arena.\nA year has passed since we celebrated the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations. That celebration,\nattended by many world leaders, gave us a valuable\nopportunity to recall the importance of the role of the\nUnited Nations in maintaining international peace and\nsecurity and in enhancing international legitimacy. It also\nprovided us with an opportunity to review the\nOrganization\u2019s accomplishments and challenges over the\npast 50 years.\nThe current session of the General Assembly marks\nthe beginning of a new era for the United Nations, which\nwe hope will witness a consolidation of its role on the\ninternational scene to the benefit of Member States and in\naccordance with the principles and purposes of the\nCharter. It is our firm belief that this international forum\ncan play an extremely important and effective role in\nmanaging crises, in averting wars and conflicts, and in\nproviding the means for international cooperation. This\nobliges us to be more persistent than ever before in\nsupporting this institution and enhancing its constructive\nrole.\nThe changes which have occurred in the world over\nthe past decade are so dramatic that they have created a\nnew international reality with a host of new challenges.\nThese developments offer new opportunities to bolster the\nprinciples of the United Nations for the benefit of\nstrengthening international legitimacy including justice\nand equality among nations, the rejection of the use of\nforce in the settlement of conflicts, the preservation of the\ndignity of mankind, and providing security and prosperity\nfor all. We should also recall the fact, to which many\nworld leaders referred during the fiftieth anniversary\ncelebrations, that the ability of this international\nOrganization to resolve global problems, crises and\nconflicts depends greatly on the political will of Member\nStates to abide by the principles of the United Nations. It\nis our hope that the future will witness greater\ndetermination by Member States to ensure the\nachievement of the objectives upon which the future of\nour Organization depends, a future which is also ours.\n8\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is fully cognizant of the\nimportance of reforming United Nations bodies so that they\nmay fulfil their prescribed roles and deal effectively with\nthe global changes we have witnessed in recent years.\nAmong these bodies, the Security Council, as the principal\norgan directly concerned with the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, remains the focus for\nreform. My country\u2019s view was and remains that any\nchanges to the structure of the Security Council should be\ngeared towards enhancing its ability to accomplish its role\neffectively as stipulated in the Charter and to refrain from\nany action that would limit its effectiveness in fulfilling its\npurposes.\nArab leaders, at their summit meeting in Cairo last\nJune, expressed their firm commitment to continue the\npeace process which they regard as an irreversible strategic\ngoal. The Cairo meeting reaffirmed that the realization of\na just and comprehensive peace within the realm of\ninternational legitimacy presupposes a serious and\nunequivocal commitment by Israel to abide by the\nprinciples of the Madrid Peace Conference and Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978),\nas well as by the land-for-peace formula. The Arab leaders\nalso reaffirmed that any breach by Israel of these principles\nand agreed-upon commitments and agreements, or any\ndelay in their implementation, would result in a setback to\nthe peace process, with all its dangerous consequences.\nWe view with great concern the Israeli Government\u2019s\nfailure to demonstrate a degree of seriousness and\ncommitment to the peace process comparable to that\ndemonstrated by the Arab States. Since assuming office, the\nGovernment of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has\ncontinued to issue statements and undertake actions that do\nnot serve the cause of peace. In contrast to the Arab States\u2019\ncommitment to the Madrid principles, to Security Council\nresolutions and to the land-for-peace formula, the\nstatements made by the Israeli Government indicate an\ninsistence on consolidating of its occupation of Arab lands;\nmaintaining its annexation of East Jerusalem; and delaying\nthe agreed-upon redeployment of its troops from Al-Khalil.\nWe are also concerned by the Israeli Government\u2019s\ncontinued closure of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,\ntogether with its proclaimed rejection of withdrawing from\nthe Syrian Golan Heights. Recently, the Israeli authorities\nopened a tunnel under the Al-Aqsa Mosque. This was a\nflagrant infringement upon the Islamic sanctuaries and a\nclear violation of binding international resolutions on the\nstatus of Jerusalem. We welcome Security Council\nresolution 1073 (1996), which the Council issued after the\nevents that resulted from the Israeli measures. We hope that\nthe summit conference sponsored by the President of the\nUnited States of America will help with the\nimplementation of that Security Council resolution and\ngive momentum to the peace process on the basis of that\nresolution and in accordance with its principles.\nStatements by the Israeli Prime Minister that Israel\nis prepared to resume negotiations without preconditions\nare no more than an attempt to distance himself from the\nMadrid-based principles and fundamentals of the peace\nprocess, in particular the land-for-peace formula. Such a\nposition can only mark a serious setback. Hence, we call\nupon the United States of America and the Russian\nFederation, as the co-sponsors of the Madrid Peace\nConference, to do their utmost to continue the peace\nprocess on all tracks in order to reach the desired results.\nIn this context we value the positive and constructive\npositions on this matter reflected in the Florence\nstatement of the European Union and the Lyon statement\nof the Group of Seven. Furthermore, we reiterate our call\nto all parties concerned to fulfil their commitments to\nprovide economic assistance to the Palestinian people.\nWhile we call upon members of the international\ncommunity to increase their economic assistance to the\nPalestinian Authority, we should remember the need to\ndeal with actions undertaken by the Israeli Government\nwhich might prevent the Palestinians from benefiting from\nthis aid. Moreover, any efforts to achieve regional\ncooperation will be meaningless and ineffective unless\naccompanied by tangible progress in the peace process on\nall its tracks.\nWe are greatly concerned about the issue of\nJerusalem \u2014 Al-Quds Al-Sharif \u2014 which is at the heart\nof the Arab-Israeli conflict and is of utmost concern to\nthe Arab and Muslim world. The manner in which this\nissue is dealt with could determine the future of the peace\nprocess. We regret to see the Israeli authorities continue\ntheir measures aimed at changing the demographic\ncomposition and creating new realities in the status of\nJerusalem with the intention of prejudicing the\nnegotiations on the final status of the city. We believe\nthat in any settlement of this issue Israel must take into\nconsideration internationally binding resolutions legality,\nin particular Security Council resolutions 242 (1967),\nwhich calls on Israel to withdraw from occupied Arab\nterri tories, and 252 (1968) pertaining to\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif. We also believe that any settlement\nshould take into account the importance of the repatriation\nof Palestinian refugees and the release of Palestinian\nprisoners who have been detained in violation of the\n9\n\n\nDeclaration of Principles, international law and the Geneva\nConventions.\nThe honourable and firm stand taken by the\ninternational community following the brutal Iraqi\naggression against the State of Kuwait in 1990, including\nthe adoption of a series of historic Security Council\nresolutions to repel the aggression and restore to the State\nof Kuwait its legitimacy and sovereignty, constitutes the\nkind of firmness we hope the United Nations will always\ndemonstrate. The position of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\non this issue is unwavering, and is based on two\nfundamental principles. So long as the Iraqi Government\nhas not fully complied with the internationally binding\ndemands set out in Council resolutions, the problem will\nnot be solved and the suffering of the Iraqi people will not\nbe mitigated. This is a matter of deep concern for all of us.\nWe believe that recent developments in northern Iraq\ncould have adverse effects on the unity, sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of Iraq, since certain neighbouring\ncountries have in various ways attempted to interfere in the\nKurdish conflict. In the light of these realities, we have to\nbe very careful lest the situation lead to a collapse of the\ninternational coalition which is responsible for full\nimplementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions,\nthe foremost of which relate to the release and repatriation\nof all prisoners of war and detainees from Kuwait and other\ncountries, the return of stolen assets, compliance with the\nmechanism for compensation, and full cooperation with the\nefforts of the United Nations Special Commission to\noversee the elimination of Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass\ndestruction. These are the objectives the international\ncoalition should strive to fulfil, bearing in mind the need to\navoid any measures that might damage the unity,\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq.\nThe Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy\nMosques expressed great interest in efforts to eliminate all\nweapons of mass destruction from the Middle East,\nincluding those aimed at keeping that sensitive part of the\nworld free of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. In\nthis perspective, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia actively\nparticipated in the Review and Extension Conference of the\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) held in New York last year, and welcomed\nthe efforts that have led to an agreement on the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nWe believe in the need to make the NPT more\neffective and universal through the activation of the\nsafeguards system of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency. We also see a need to adopt measures and\ncriteria that would enhance all aspects of the process of\ndismantling weapons of mass destruction in accordance\nwith General Assembly resolution 1 (I), which addresses,\ninter alia, the issue of eliminating all weapons of mass\ndestruction. In this respect, we urge all States that have\nnot yet become parties to the Treaty to take the necessary\nsteps to do so, thus contributing to the maintenance of\nworld peace and stability.\nThe occupation by the Islamic Republic of Iran of\nthree islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates \u2014\nAbu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb \u2014 is a source\nof great concern, not only to the United Arab Emirates,\nbut also to the States of the Gulf Cooperation Council\n(GCC) as a whole, which desire the best possible\nrelations with their neighbour, Iran. We have repeatedly\nurged the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond to the call\nof the United Arab Emirates to settle this long-standing\nproblem peacefully through serious bilateral negotiations.\nConsequently, we reiterate our call upon the Government\nof Iran to cease imposing a status quo by force and to\nhalt preparations for unilateral construction on any of the\nthree islands. Furthermore, we also call upon the\nGovernment of Iran to initiate efforts to resolve this\ndispute peacefully in accordance with the norms and\nprinciples of international law, including the referral of\nthis matter to the International Court of Justice. In view\nof the persistence of the conflict, the Security Council\nshould place this issue on its agenda.\nBased on the determination of the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia to maintain the security and stability of the\nArabian Gulf region, we support the wise actions of the\nState of Bahrain to foster its security and stability. These\nactions were approved and supported by the GCC and the\nLeague of Arab States, since the security of the State of\nBahrain is part and parcel of the security of the\nGCC States.\nNearly 10 months have passed since the signing of\nthe Dayton Agreement, which brought an end to the\nviolence and destruction that accompanied the Serb\naggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina. This\nAgreement did not materialize until the international\ncommunity expressed sufficient will and firmness to stem\nthe Serb aggression. We hope that the recent elections\nwill mark a new beginning and a new future of peace,\nstability and economic development for the country.\n10\n\n\nNonetheless, we must point out that the peace in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina will remain fragile until it takes root. The\nreconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the\ninternational support necessary to help it address the\nproblems resulting from years of war should be viewed as\nconditions of peace without which the goals of the Dayton\nAgreement can never be realized. It is also important to\nemphasize the need to apprehend and bring to justice the\nperpetrators of crimes against humanity and to ban them\nfrom any political office in the future. Their apprehension\nis an international responsibility that should not be taken\nlightly. It is also incumbent upon the international\ncommunity to confront any attempt to divide the country\nalong ethnic or religious lines.\nHelping Bosnia and Herzegovina set out on the road\nto peace early this year was the first of a series of positive\ndevelopments in many troubled areas of the world. We\nhope that the recent announcement of an agreement\nbetween the Government of the Philippines and the Moro\nNational Liberation Front will mark the end of\nconfrontation between the Philippine authorities and their\nMuslim minority after a long period of tension and conflict.\nAs for the conflict in Chechnya, we hope the current\ntruce and reports of the Russian Government\u2019s intention to\nwithdraw its forces from the area will pave the way for a\nresolution of this crisis.\nUnfortunately, the statuses of other conflicts have not\nchanged. The Pakistani-Indian dispute over Jammu and\nKashmir is still tense and complicated. There is no\nalternative to following the peaceful path based on the\nresolutions of the United Nations guaranteeing the people\nof Jammu and Kashmir the exercise of their right to self-\ndetermination.\nThe situation in Somalia remains desperate. The\ncountry is awaiting a decision by the clan leaders on a\nprocess to save the country and its people. We urge all\nfactions to put aside their differences and shoulder their\nnational responsibilities by forming a national authority\nrepresenting the different factions of the Somali people in\norder to restore unity, stability and security to that country.\nIn Afghanistan \u2014 in spite of all the sincere efforts of\nthe United Nations and all the good offices of the\nGovernment of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques to\nachieve national reconciliation in that country \u2014 the\nfighting still rages between the different factions as a result\nof disagreements between their leaders. This has prevented\nthe country from enjoying the fruits of its victory against\nforeign occupation.\nThe issue of international terrorism was the main\ntopic throughout last year. Many conferences and\nworkshops addressed ways and means of confronting this\ngrowing phenomenon, which has become a source of\ngrave concern for the international community. The\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, recognizing the need to\nconfront and address this serious phenomenon, has voiced\nits support for all international efforts to confront this\nproblem. This position was illustrated collectively in the\nstatement issued by the Gulf Cooperation Council\nfollowing its last session. The GCC States have\nemphasized that extremism, violence and terrorism are\nglobal phenomena that are not limited to a specific people\nor region and have unambiguously denounced and\ncondemned all forms of violence and terrorism. They also\nexpressed their support for all international efforts aimed\nat preventing and combating terrorism, including denying\nsafe haven to terrorists anywhere and making efforts to\napprehend, convict and severely punish those involved in\nsuch crimes.\nA cursory review of world economic problems and\nthe role of the United Nations in overseeing international\neconomic cooperation shows that the success of the\nUnited Nations in dealing with economic issues and\npromoting international development has also been tied to\nthe commitment of Member States to the United Nations\nCharter.\nAlthough the international community has succeeded,\nby dint of serious negotiations, in resolving many difficult\nproblems and has achieved important results in many\nsensitive areas through the establishment of the World\nTrade Organization, we are still concerned by the\ncontinuing practice of trade protectionism, which runs\ncounter to our belief in the importance of allowing market\nforces to play their natural role in economic affairs. It is\nalso necessary to free international trade from certain\nrestrictions, such as that of using the pretext of protecting\nthe environment as a justification for protectionist\nmeasures. Such restrictions undermine the economies of\ndeveloping nations and have a negative impact on their\ndevelopment, which is the cornerstone of their peace and\nstability.\nThe Secretary-General has taken a commendable\ninitiative in this direction with his \u201cAn Agenda for\nDevelopment\u201d, which, given concerted effort, could\nbecome a realistic tool for enhancing global economic and\n11\n\n\nsocial development. Here, the developed countries in\nparticular bear a special responsibility for building fruitful\ncooperation to the benefit all countries, rich and poor. We\nbelieve that an increase in the amount of assistance\nprovided by developed to developing countries is a\ncornerstone of such hoped-for cooperation.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a founding Member of\nthe international Organization and a signatory of the San\nFrancisco Charter, is eager to have the United Nations\ncontinue to play its leadership role in strengthening\ncollective security. It reaffirms its responsibilities as a\nfounding Member of the Organization. This reaffirmation\nwas reiterated in a speech by the Custodian of the Two\nHoly Mosques, King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz, which was\ndelivered on his behalf by His Royal Highness Prince\nSultan Bin Abdul-Aziz, Second Deputy Prime Minister and\nMinister of Defence and Aviation, on the occasion of the\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. Today, the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia takes this opportunity to\nreconfirm its continued commitment to achieving the\nobjectives of the United Nations Charter. It will spare no\neffort to enhance the capabilities of the United Nations in\norder to achieve justice and to promote security, stability\nand prosperity throughout our troubled world.\nThe Holy Koran provides us with guidance to lead us\ntowards creative actions, as exemplified in the following\nverse:\n\u201cAnd say: Work righteousness.\nSoon will God observe your work,\nAnd His Apostle, and the Believers.'\u201d\n(The Holy Koran, IX:105)\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me offer Ambassador\nRazali my sincerest congratulation on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly. This session will\naddress many difficult and important questions. I am\nconfident that under his experienced and wise leadership\nwe shall achieve good and constructive results. I should\nalso like to express the thanks and appreciation of my\nGovernment to the Secretary-General and to the many\ndedicated women and men in the Secretariat.\nLet me refer to the statement made by the Deputy\nPrime Minister of Ireland on behalf of the European\nUnion. My Government fully endorses that statement.\nAs the United Nations enters its fifty-first year, one\nconclusion is self-evident: questions of peace,\ndevelopment and human rights can no longer be neatly\nseparated. They interact, and nowhere more so than at the\nUnited Nations.\nLet me begin with human rights. There can be no\nsustainable peace in societies where the human rights of\nindividuals are not respected or where their democratic\naspirations are denied. Widespread violations of human\nrights, including the rights of minorities, breed instability\nand conflict. The United Nations is then, often too late,\ncalled upon to deal with them. There can be no\nsustainable development in societies where economic and\nsocial rights, as well as political rights, are flouted.\nAuthoritarian rule is no answer to poverty or\nenvironmental degradation. The universality of human\nrights cannot be questioned. True, civilizations differ;\nsocieties differ. But that does not mean that cultural,\nreligious, ideological or any other factors can be invoked\nas legitimate justifications for human rights violations. To\ndo so is to deny the inherent equality of human beings.\nBut adherence to general principles is not enough.\nThe litmus test is, of course, practice. Here at the United\nNations we must ask ourselves what we can do together\nto promote respect for human rights. I see at least three\nareas where the General Assembly can and should act.\nFirst, we must see to it that the United Nations\nmechanisms that have been created to promote and\nmonitor respect for human rights are not impaired through\nlack of funds. The High Commissioner for Human Rights,\nhis special rapporteurs and the human rights treaty bodies\nwithin the United Nations system are entitled to our\nsupport. The General Assembly should insist on the\nnecessary funding.\nSecondly, we must help establish, in accordance with\nthe conclusions of the Preparatory Committee, a\npermanent international criminal court to deal with\nflagrant violations of international humanitarian law and\n3\n\n\nhuman rights. I do not have to belabour the reasons why.\nOne look at Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia is enough.\nThirdly, we must ensure sustained and integrated\nfollow-up of the United Nations conferences from Vienna\nto Istanbul, so as to implement fully the agreed programmes\nof action. Nationally, Governments must commit the\nresources necessary to make the agreed actions a reality. In\nthe case of the Vienna and Beijing Conferences in\nparticular, full and equal enjoyment of human rights by all\nwomen everywhere must be the first goal towards which\nthe United Nations and all Governments must aspire.\nIn Finland, women gained full political rights \u2014 the\nright to vote and, just as important, the right to be eligible\nfor Parliament \u2014 as early as 1906; that is, 90 years ago.\nFinland thus became the very first country in the world\nwhere this was made possible. We have come a long way\nsince then, but we still need to do better until, finally,\nwomen are just as equally empowered in Finnish society as\nmen. I know that the same is true to varying degrees in\nother countries too.\nChildren, whether girls or boys, are full-fledged\nsubjects of human rights. Almost universal ratification of\nthe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child\nhas been achieved. States Parties must now ensure universal\nimplementation too. The message from the recent\nStockholm World Congress against Commercial Sexual\nExploitation of Children was clear: full implementation of\nchildren\u2019s rights is also the best guarantee against sexual\nexploitation. The United Nations must now, along with\nGovernments, follow up the commitments of Stockholm,\nand with vigour.\nEven the most democratic societies are vulnerable to\nconflicts, even to armed ones. We should therefore do our\nutmost to prevent them and, to this end, make full use of\nall means available to the international community.\nFinland believes in United Nations peacekeeping. We\nhave participated for 40 years and stand ready to continue.\nThe sheer complexity of modern-day conflicts has turned\nUnited Nations thinking towards comprehensive peace\noperations. Peacekeeping must be seen as a part of a\ncomprehensive peace process. We welcome this approach.\nThe civilian and military elements of a peace operation\nshould operate in close cooperation. Artificial barriers\nseparating the two should be eliminated right at the outset\nin devising the mandate for an operation. It is also\nimportant that peace operations be linked with longer-term\npeace-building efforts to promote stability and sustainable\nhuman development.\nLessons have been learned the hard way in the past\nfew years. United Nations peacekeepers are not suited for\npeace enforcement. That job should and can be entrusted\nby the Security Council to others \u2014 whether regional\norganizations or other outside ad hoc coalitions \u2014 if\nnecessary. But these are exceptional cases. For the vast\nmajority of conflicts, the United Nations will be the one\ncalled upon for peacekeeping. Even if the United Nations\nmust be able to say no on occasions, the world\nOrganization cannot shirk its responsibility. Moreover,\nwhen the United Nations acts, it should act on time and\nwith the support of its members, including funding.\nTime is of the essence in responding to crises.\nFurther development of the existing standby arrangements\nwith Member States is the most practical way to enhance\nthe rapid-reaction capability of the Organization.\nTherefore, Finland strongly supports the establishment of\na rapidly deployable headquarters unit at the United\nNations as soon as possible.\nPrevention, naturally, is better than cure. In\npeacekeeping as well, preventive deployment is an\ninnovation that is working right now in The former\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Finland is convinced\nthat the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force\n(UNPREDEP) operation is making a crucial contribution\nto stability in the whole region. It is a full-fledged\noperation in preventive diplomacy encompassing good\noffices, monitoring and human and institutional\ndevelopment, as well as troop deployment. That\ncontribution, based on the present mandate, should\ncontinue until peace and stability in the whole region are\nbetter assured.\nThis is the year of the nuclear-test ban. That is what\nthe General Assembly demanded a year ago, and that is\nwhat the vast majority of the world\u2019s nations has now\nagreed. I was proud to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty for my country. That Treaty will\nstrengthen the security of all of us, without exception.\nBanning nuclear-test explosions is a goal to which the\ninternational community has been committed for decades.\nThe Treaty accomplishes that goal. At the same time, the\nTreaty is a step towards the ultimate elimination of\nnuclear weapons.\n4\n\n\nHowever, focusing on nuclear weapons is not enough.\nWe also need to focus on weapons that maim and kill\npeople today. Those weapons are conventional weapons,\nparticularly landmines, other small arms and light weapons.\nThe excessive accumulation and proliferation of small\narms threaten to destabilize communities, countries and\nentire regions. A United Nations expert panel, on which my\ncountry is represented, is looking into the problem right\nnow. Finland, for one, expects concrete recommendations\non how to deal with this clear and present danger\nnationally, regionally and through the United Nations.\nThe indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines is\nthe most visible manifestation of the small-arms emergency.\nWhen they finally achieve peace, societies already ravaged\nby years of war are severely hampered in their\nreconstruction efforts by landmines that have been\nindiscriminately sown by the millions. A concerted\ninternational effort, led by the United Nations, is needed to\nassist in mine clearance. Demining should also be made an\nintegral part of peacekeeping mandates, as was recently\nsuggested by Germany and endorsed by the Security\nCouncil.\nIt is increasingly clear, however, that in the end only\na prohibition of inhumane and indiscriminate landmine use\ncan bring a real solution. To be effective, such a solution\nmust be legally binding, global and verifiable. As the first\nstep, all States should adhere to and abide by the\nsignificantly strengthened landmine Protocol to the\nConvention on conventional weapons. I find it very hard to\nunderstand why two out of three United Nations Member\nStates continue to remain outside that Convention.\nAs a concurrent step Finland proposes the initiation of\nglobal negotiations on a treaty banning anti-personnel\nlandmines altogether. A natural forum for such negotiations\nwould be the single negotiating body for disarmament that\nthe international community has at its disposal, namely, the\nConference on Disarmament in Geneva.\nFinland will work actively for the inclusion of a ban\non anti-personnel landmines in the negotiating agenda of\nthe Conference on Disarmament when the Conference\nreconvenes in January.\nIn assisting in the creation of conditions of stability\nand well-being, the United Nations has effective economic\nand social tools at its disposal. A review of how the United\nNations does its business in this field is under way. The\napproval in May of the resolution on restructuring and\nrevitalization of some areas in the Economic and Social\nCouncil sector was an encouraging sign.\nThe yardstick in measuring United Nations impact\non development should be how the Organization has been\nable to alleviate poverty and contribute to the\nimprovement of the quality of life. The first priority now,\nas we see it, should be to assess the impact of the\ndevelopment activities of the United Nations system at the\ncountry level. We were pleased to note that last year the\nGeneral Assembly initiated a process to that effect.\nI have two remarks in this regard. First, it is\nnecessary to concentrate United Nations development\nactivities on the poorest countries and the most vulnerable\ngroups of society. Secondly, better integration of the\nUnited Nations at the country level would enhance\nefficiency. It would promote closer coordination between\ndevelopment activities, on the one hand, and humanitarian\nand peacekeeping activities on the other.\nThe commitments made at recent United Nations\nconferences provide a comprehensive agenda for\nfollow-up. One of the conferences, the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development, will be\nprominently present at this fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly. That Conference is a promising\nexample of the capabilities of the United Nations. It has\nmade global environmental concerns an everyday reality\nfor all of us. The follow-up session next year will afford\na unique opportunity to assess progress and review\npriorities.\nIn my view, one of the emerging priorities would be\na political commitment at the global level for sustainable\nforest management. Finland attaches great importance to\nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Forests, which has been\nestablished and which expects to submit concrete action-\noriented recommendations to the special session.\nBefore concluding my statement, I wish to refer to\nthe statement issued by the Presidency of the European\nUnion yesterday regarding the killings and violent\nincidents in the West Bank and Gaza. I want to state that\nmy Government fully endorses that statement. On behalf\nof the Government of Finland, I appeal to the parties\nconcerned to take every measure to restore calm and\nrefrain from acts of violence and provocation. We also\nurge the parties to re-engage the peace process, which had\nalready achieved such promising results.\n5\n\n\nIn view of the Security Council\u2019s primary role in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the reform\nof the Council is of particular urgency. The discussions on\nthis subject during the fiftieth session were thorough and\nuseful. Convergence of views emerged on many important\nissues, yet on others, differences still remain. I believe that\nthe time is now ripe to take a step forward and engage in\nreal negotiations on a comprehensive reform of the Council.\nMeanwhile, in a few weeks we shall elect new non-\npermanent members to the present Security Council. As is\nwell known, the five Nordic Countries give their full\nsupport to Sweden. I am confident that the other Member\nStates will also recognize the merits of our neighbouring\ncountry.\nThe Deputy Prime Minister of Ireland, Mr. Dick\nSpring, when speaking on behalf of the European Union,\nunderlined the obligation of all Member States to pay their\narrears and their assessed contributions to the United\nNations. Finland having been the first Member State to pay\nin full, on time and without conditions its assessed\ncontribution to the regular budget of the United Nations in\n1996, I feel it both my right and my duty to reiterate that\nappeal.\nThe United Nations, we agree, needs renewed focus\nand streamlining. Let us now find the determination and\nwill to proceed with the necessary reform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset to warmly congratulate\nthe President on his election to his post at the fifty-first\nsession of the General Assembly. I am deeply honoured\nto speak from this rostrum for the first time, and would\nlike to take this opportunity to thank all our friends in the\nworld community for the valuable assistance given to us\nin the construction of a new, democratic Georgia.\nIn recent years, Georgia has undergone every\npossible trial in the transition from the old and obsolete\nto the new and progressive. Overcoming the totalitarian\npast has been very painful, demanding many sacrifices. In\nconditions of post-communist chaos, ongoing ethno-\npolitical conflicts and a precipitous decline in the\neconomy, Georgia has managed, with the help of the\ninternational community, to stabilize the situation. Over\nthe past two years, democratic institutions have been\nestablished, economic stability has been achieved, a\nnational currency has been introduced, the process of\nprivatization is being completed and favourable conditions\nfor foreign investment are being created. The presidential\nand parliamentary elections held last year confirmed the\nstrong determination of the Georgian people to continue\non the path of democratic development. All this has been\ndone in order to further the gradual integration of\nGeorgia, and indeed the whole of Transcaucasia, into the\ninternational economic system. Georgia has had to\novercome a number of obstacles on this course, both\nsubjective and objective in nature.\nToday I would like to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention\nto the phenomenon that has become the main obstacle in\nGeorgia\u2019s path to recovery: aggressive separatism, which\ncan completely nullify the beginnings of peace and\nstability not only in Georgia, but in the entire region.\nAggressive separatism is not a new phenomenon, but it\nhas only recently come to the attention of the world\n15\n\n\ncommunity, due to its global nature and its destructive\nimpact on international security. I can say with certainty\nthat the world community has no right to take the position\nof an outside observer on this question, because countries\nand entire regions are subjected to separatism, regardless of\ntheir geographic location and level of development.\nDespite differences in the underlying reasons for the\nemergence of separatist movements, in their nature and in\ntheir scale they have one thing in common: they establish\nregimes on the ideological basis of terrorism under the\nbanner of \u201cthe self-determination of suppressed people\u201d.\nWe are certain that everyone present in this Hall considers\nthe principle of self-determination for nations and peoples\none of the most important basic principles of international\nlaw. Contemporary international law has established a clear\nframework for the implementation of this principle. Yet it\nis unacceptable for the principle of self-determination to be\nexploited by national minorities or small nations that have\nhistorically constituted a single society with other nations,\nwithin the framework of sovereign States that today are\nMembers of the United Nations.\nThere is good reason for us to have singled out the\nproblem of aggressive separatism, as we consider it to be\nthe main threat to international peace and security at this\nstage. Georgia has made enormous efforts to introduce the\nnotion of aggressive separatism into the agenda of the\nworld. Aggressive separatism uses \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d as the\nmain tool of vengeance against other nations and ethnic\ngroups.\nHere I must bring up the example of Abkhazia:\n300,000 peaceful Georgian citizens have been expelled\nfrom the territory of Abkhazia. Thousands more have been\nshot, burned, hanged or tortured to death. Furthermore, the\npersecution of the Georgian population on the basis of\nethnic origin was raised by the separatist regime to the\nlevel of state policy. This is a most serious crime against\nhumanity.\nAnalogous manifestations of aggressive separatism are\ntaking place in other parts of the world. Consequently, the\nstream of refugees increases constantly, and this process has\nacquired the form of a powerful new global factor fraught\nwith unpredictable social and economic consequences. We\nbelieve we need more fully developed measures in order to\noppose it effectively.\nWhat can we do about this? As a rule, the response of\nthe world community to separatism as a phenomenon is\nnearly always late and consequently inadequate to existing\nconditions.\nThe first resolution of the Security Council on the\nconflict in Abkhazia was adopted on 9 July 1993; the\nmost recent, on 12 July 1996. Comparing them, we can\nsee that it took three years to call something by its proper\nname: to call an aggressor an aggressor, a criminal a\ncriminal and a victim a victim.\nIt is obvious that we need a doctrine to contain\naggressive separatism. This should include a number of\nmeasures directed at revealing the underlying causes and\nat preventing and overcoming any manifestation of\nextremist separatist tendencies.\nWe consider it necessary, first, to define the\nphenomenon of separatism in terms of international law\nand, to that end, to establish a corresponding juridical and\nlegal basis, namely, a well-defined system to identify and\ncategorize aggressive separatism in international legal\ndocuments.\nSecondly, it is necessary to introduce and enforce\neconomic measures. One might respond that the practical\nimplementation of economic sanctions already exists.\nHowever, these should be binding in nature and their\nenforcement fall under the strict control of the\ninternational community; moreover, there must be follow-\nup implementation of sanctions against violators, if\nnecessary. At the same time, in order to eliminate\neconomic incentives for armed hostilities, we should\nprovide economic assistance and other means of support\nto regions where separatist tendencies are growing in\nstrength.\nThirdly, we must consider measures of a military-\npolitical character, such as the imposition of arms\nembargoes against those regions where separatism takes\non aggressive forms.\nFourthly, those who have committed these crimes\nagainst humanity must be fully aware that they cannot\navoid severe punishment and that, sooner or later, they\nwill have to stand before an international tribunal. It is\nclear that international terrorism and aggressive\nseparatism are interconnected and that we must combine\nour efforts in the struggle against both.\nThe efforts of the countries of the Group of 8 aimed\nat the elimination of international terrorism give us cause\nfor hope. The Government of Georgia fully supports the\n16\n\n\nrecent initiative of the President of Egypt to establish a new\nspecialized international organization dedicated to the\nstruggle against these evils. We must also work as speedily\nas possible on the creation of a stable system of regional\nsecurity, without which the process of aggressive separatism\nthat has contributed to the political and economic\ndisintegration of traditional regional structures of mutually\nbeneficial cooperation and ethno-cultural exchanges will\nonly grow, hastening the division of regions into hostile\nmicrosystems under the permanent influence of\nneighbouring regional Powers.\nOnce again, let us focus concretely on the prospects\nfor a peaceful settlement of the Abkhaz problem. The\ncurrent negotiations continue under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations and through the mediation of the Russian\nFederation. The \u201cFriends of Georgia\u201d group of countries is\nalso making concerted efforts. The settlement of the conflict\nhas thus taken on an international scale.\nWe have repeatedly declared Georgia\u2019s position on the\nsettlement of this conflict and the determination of\nAbkhazia\u2019s status. First, it is necessary and very possible to\nsettle the conflict through a peaceful process of negotiation.\nThrough the new Constitution of Georgia, adopted last year,\nthe question of the state territorial structure of our country\nwas deliberately left open. At the same time, proposals\nwere elaborated according to which Abkhazia would be\ngranted autonomy in accordance with the highest possible\ninternational standards.\nJust over a month ago, the President of Georgia made\na statement in which he once again set forth his suggestions\nregarding the settlement of the conflict in the Caucasus,\nincluding his assertion to the authorities in Sukhumi of his\nreadiness to meet immediately for serious discussions.\nUnfortunately, these efforts have borne no fruit. The\nresponsibility for that lies with the separatists. It has proven\nhitherto impossible to achieve progress towards a political\nsettlement. Moreover, the separatist regime, sensing its\nimpunity, has undertaken a new series of provocations,\nattempting to organize so-called parliamentary elections on\nthe same territory which was ethnically cleansed and on\nwhich less than one-fifth of the native population presently\nresides. The regime has cynically ignored the mediation\nefforts of the Russian Federation, the United Nations and\nthe world community, numerous resolutions of the Security\nCouncil and the decisions of various forums.\nThe growing concern on this point is also\nunderstandable. Has not the perfunctory evaluation of acts\nof \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and genocide in Abkhazia, by\naccident or a design, strengthened the confidence of the\nseparatists that they will get away with their crimes and\neven legitimize the status quo?\nIn the recent past, Transcaucasia acted as a boundary\nbetween two opposing systems, two military-political\nblocs separated by the iron curtain and implacable\nideologies. These confrontational orientations did not\nallow the innate human and natural resources of the\nregion to be fully exploited, relegating it to a secondary\nrole on the periphery of the world stage.\nAs a consequence of historic changes that occurred\nbefore our very eyes, we believe that the time has come\nseriously to reappraise the role of our region. Our final\naim is to turn it into the very opposite of what it once\nwas. The Caucasus can become and is already becoming\na region of multilateral cooperation, not only between the\nStates geographically located within it. The prospects for\ncreating a transportation corridor across our region are\ngradually becoming reality. The States of Central Asia,\nthe Black Sea basin and Western and Eastern Europe are\ndirectly involved in the process of its creation. There has\nthus been a logical growth in the international\ncommunity\u2019s interest in the fate of the Caucasus.\nThe Caucasus today is a complicated interlacing of\npolitical economic and financial contradictions and\ninterests. Therefore, it is necessary to respond\nappropriately to these emerging circumstances. Otherwise,\nwe run the risk of creating a new, powerful and large-\nscale breeding ground for international tensions.\nWhile pondering the creation of a new global and, in\nparticular, European infrastructure of stability, we have in\nmind very specific elements that will create a single and\nindivisible unit. In this context, the initiative of President\nShevardnadze on a peaceful Caucasus, proposed in the\nspring of 1996, can serve as the basis for the creation of\na regional model that could, in its own right, become a\nmajor component in a general and comprehensive model\nof security for Europe in the next century. The ideas set\nforth in this initiative were discussed and approved in\nprinciple at the summit between the Presidents of the\nRussian Federation, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia,\nand the leaders of the northern Caucasus Republics within\nthe Russian Federation in June 1996.\nThese proposals are aimed not only at the peaceful\nsettlement of conflicts currently besetting the Caucasus,\nbut also at post-conflict settlement, insuring the security\n17\n\n\nand multi-level development of the region. They advocate\nthe application of generally recognized, fundamental\nprinciples of international law, the observance of which\nwould guarantee peace and stability in the region.\nI am not engaging in wishful thinking. The road to\nachieving all this will, of course, not be easy, but I am\nconfident that the States of the region possess sufficient\ndetermination and political will, together with the active\nparticipation of the international community, to make the\nonly correct decision and, like one of Brecht\u2019s characters,\nbreak out of the \u201cCaucasian Chalk Circle\u201d.\nI would like to share some of my concerns on the\nprospects for new United Nations activities. The impending\nreforms, supported by practically all Member States, testify\nto a qualitatively new stage in the development of\ninternational relations. At the same time, the need for\nreforms places great responsibility on us. We have no right\nto take hasty decisions that might result in unforeseen\nconsequences. On the other hand, excessive dilatoriness\ncould also harm our cause.\nGiven the new realities in international relations, it is\nclear that these changes should be reflected in the body of\nthe United Nations that is entrusted with the primary\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. ln order to enable the Security Council to respond\nadequately to contemporary challenges, new geopolitical\nrealities should be reflected in its structure. I refer to the\ntimely question of increasing the number of permanent and\nnon-permanent members of the Council. We are fully\nconvinced that increasing the number of members would\nexpand the geopolitical base of the Security Council, which\nin turn would make it more effective and representative.\nIn considering in this context the candidacy of\nGermany and Japan for possible permanent membership, we\nare guided by the hope that we would finally and\nirrevocably have an opportunity to overcome the\npsychological consequences of the Second World War and\nthe cold war. In 1992 our President argued, from this\nrostrum, for the need to expand the membership of the\nSecurity Council by including Germany and Japan; and\nGeorgia has repeatedly advocated this since.\nCareful consideration should be given to proposals put\nforward by Italy and other Member States with regard to\nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council.\nHowever, the Security Council should remain a\ncomparatively small body, which makes it more dynamic.\nMost importantly, in considering an increase in Council\nmembership, due attention should be paid primarily to the\ndegree of participation of Member States in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nThe changes should also touch upon the practical\nside of Council activities, especially with regard to\nconflict resolution. The criteria that guide the Security\nCouncil in the use of its discretionary rights, provided for\nin Chapters VI, VII and VIII of the Charter, should be\nmore clearly formulated and universally applied.\nIn order to improve the management of\npeacekeeping operations, the Secretary-General\u2019s Special\nEnvoy should be responsible for coordinating the\nimplementation of peacekeeping operations, with the\ndirect participation of regional organizations. We should\nalso note that a significant number of conflicts throughout\nthe world do not fall within the category of threats to\ninternational peace and security under Chapter VII of the\nCharter, although they are characterized by gross and\nmassive human rights violations and are considered to be\ncrimes against humanity.\nThus, in most cases, the initiators and executors of\nthese crimes, which include \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and\ngenocide, feel that they enjoy impunity because of the\ninability of the international community to take legal\naction. Consequently, we should consider the\nestablishment of a permanent United Nations special\ninternational observer institution, which would investigate\nthe facts pertaining to such crimes.\nGeorgia, having undergone the tragedy of conflict in\nAbkhazia, and having experienced \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and\ngenocide in its own population, is keenly interested in the\nrapid establishment and effective functioning of an\ninternational criminal court. Such a body should become\nan effective tool for implementing the law on behalf of\nthe international community. We are inspired by the fact\nthat the International Law Commission has already\napproved the text for a list of crimes against peace and\nhumanity.\nWe are also happy that the United Nations has\nalready taken steps in laying the foundation for\ndeveloping peacekeeping contingents of stand-by forces.\nGeorgia has already declared its readiness for active\nparticipation in the establishment of stand-by forces. We\nbelieve, however, that the United Nations should not take\nhalf measures, as the use of stand-by forces cannot\ncompletely resolve problems of effective and timely\n18\n\n\nreaction to conflict situations arising in different parts of\nthe world.\nIn this connection, we are convinced that we should\nfinally implement the idea of establishing a United Nations\nrapid deployment force to carry out the tasks prescribed by\nthe Security Council to restrain the escalation of conflicts\nand deploy the main peacemaking contingents of the United\nNations.\nIn conclusion, we would like to see the world\ncommunity as a union of free nations that enrich each other\nspiritually, economically and culturally. Mutual efforts in\nthis direction will inevitably lead to the establishment of a\npermanent, cooperative peace in a world free of wars and\nethnic conflicts.\nThe General Assembly offers a unique opportunity to\nelaborate a uniform and coordinated approach to the real,\nglobal problems of humanity. This is our chance to reach\nglobal consensus, and we should take full advantage of it.\nI thank the Assembly for its attention, and express my\nhope that our pain and our hopes will be taken into account\nby the entire international community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like to extend to the President\nand to all the delegations of Member States the cordial\ngreetings of the people and Government of El Salvador.\nI should also like to congratulate the President on his\nelection to preside over this session and to express thanks\nto Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for the dedication with\nwhich he carried out his mandate. At this session, we\nmust adopt very important decisions designed to\nstrengthen the Organization. We are convinced that the\nPresident\u2019s pragmatism and experience will help our\ndebate to take a proper course, overcome obstacles and\ngive impetus to the reforms called for by Member States.\nIn October 1995 we celebrated the golden\nanniversary of the United Nations, an occasion that\nafforded us an opportunity to assess the work of the\nOrganization, to recognize the importance of this\ninstitution in deepening understanding among nations and\nto ensure that its purposes and principles remain fully in\neffect. At that time, world leaders agreed to support the\nimplementation of the reform needed to ensure that the\ninternational community would indeed have an effective\nOrganization able to meet the requirements presented by\na constantly changing world.\nIn the light of that commitment, we believe that at\nthis session debate should avoid unnecessary\nconfrontation and be focused on the formulation of\npractical recommendations to ensure that the joint efforts\nof Member States will be in accordance with the\nDeclaration adopted at the fiftieth anniversary. In so\ndoing, important decisions can be taken that will give the\nOrganization the capabilities and resources to meet the\nchallenges of the new millennium effectively.\nThe dynamics of the international system in recent\nyears lead us to an even greater appreciation of the\nvarious initiatives that have been discussed with regard to\nthe common problems that affect us all. In solving them,\nwe must act together and share the successful experiences\nof each individual State in order to improve the standard\nof living of all our peoples.\nWe commend the successful convening of summits,\nat which programmes of action on global problems\nrelating to women, children, human rights, the\nenvironment, social development, population and human\nsettlements have been adopted. These conferences are a\nclear demonstration of the political will and the moral\ncommitment of the international community to redefine\nthe paradigms for sustainable development by means of\n19\n\n\nrekindled creativity focused on the individual as well as the\nfamily.\nThe complexity and interdependency of our problems\noblige each and every Member State to redouble their\nefforts to participate more actively in finding solutions.\nSuch solutions must emerge from a new vision of the\ncurrent international situation, characterized by increasingly\nglobalized economies and requiring greater efficiency and\ncompetitiveness in the productive sectors in order\nsuccessfully to confront higher levels of competition.\nDespite the positive elements of this picture, we must\nnot confound joint efforts with the principal responsibility\nthat each and every government bears in solving the\nproblems affecting its own society.\nIn the global political situation, we note with\nsatisfaction that progress has been made in participatory\ndemocracy throughout the world. This is one of the most\nimportant phenomena at the end of this century, as it\nenables individuals to participate directly and creatively in\nsolving their own problems.\nWe are convinced that United Nations efforts to\nresolve and contain conflicts by means of peacekeeping\noperations are beneficial to the achievement of world\nharmony. In addition to having benefited from this process,\nEl Salvador has been an active party to it.\nOur country\u2019s experience in effectively settling its\nrecent armed conflict can help other countries dealing with\nsimilar situations. This makes it possible for us to share our\nknowledge and experience with the international\ncommunity, to contribute to solving such conflicts by\nmeans of dialogue and common work, leading to the\nconsolidation of peace, democracy and respect for human\nrights.\nWe have said that there has been a sea change in the\ninternational system, but conflicts and problems remain. At\nthis time, we wish to encourage their resolution in an\natmosphere of cooperation, dialogue and negotiation by\nmeans of frank and objective discussion.\nIn recent years, 25 new States have exercised their\nsovereign right to self-determination and become Members\nof the United Nations, thereby reaffirming the\nOrganization\u2019s principle of universality. Unfortunately this\nprinciple has not been fully respected and will not be fully\nrespected until all States, including the Republic of China\nin Taiwan, are represented in the United Nations.\nThe creation of jobs, the rule of law, the security of\ncitizens, access to proper housing, health, education,\nmedical care and nutrition for children, and a clean and\nlife-sustaining environment are all requirements that\ndeserve priority. If at the United Nations we can\nformulate policies and carry out innovative, effective\nactivities in this connection, people throughout the world,\nparticularly the most dispossessed, can benefit from this\nimportant step forward in solving their problems. This is\nthe only way the Organization can truly make a creative\nand effective contribution to ensuring that democracy is\nperceived as a positive process for humankind.\nThe financial problems of our Organization are an\nobstacle to the proper functioning of its programmes and\nactivities, especially those in less developed countries.\nThe needs of development require that the United Nations\nfunction more transparently, effectively and, above all,\nefficiently. For this, our beliefs and our actions must be\nconsistent.\nThe new vision that is emerging in the international\nsystem can be explained by the domestic transformations\ntaking place in many countries throughout the world.\nCentral America is a part of this process. Allow me to\ndescribe the current experiences of our region. A few\nyears before the start of the new millennium, the Central\nAmerican countries have left behind our sad history of\nconfrontation and have embarked upon the path to peace,\nfreedom, democracy and development, as shaped by the\nCentral American Presidents in our Alliance for the\nSustainable Development of Central America. This\nAlliance comprises policies, programmes and activities\nthat provide a new system for integral development and\nare creating progressive change in living standards by\nensuring economic growth with social equity, and\ndevelopment that is in harmony with nature, thus ensuring\nthat future generations will have a high quality of life.\nThe Central American Presidents also adopted a\nseries of commitments to work together to meet the\nobjectives of the Alliance for Sustainable Development.\nIn political terms, these include strengthening and\nconsolidating the rule of law and democratic security as\nwell as modernizing the public sector; in economic terms,\nimproving economic integration, harmonizing\nmacroeconomic policies and modernizing regional\ninfrastructures; in the social sphere, systematically\nreducing poverty, emphasizing job-creation and\ninvestment in human capital, giving priority to eduction,\nhealth and training; in the cultural area, ensuring the\npreservation of the values and traditions of the cultural\n20\n\n\nheritage of the Central American peoples; and in\nenvironmental terms, preserving and protecting the bio-\ndiversity of the region, promoting reforestation and the\nappropriate utilization of water catchment areas, biological\ncorridors and protected areas.\nIn El Salvador, barely four years after the signature of\nthe peace accords, we are pleased to note that we have\ncome close to full implementation of the commitments\nentered into at the time and are moving strongly towards\nestablishing democratic institutions and national\nreconstruction. Our peace process has been held up as an\nexample, and we are pleased to serve as a model and an\nencouragement to ensure that situations similar to ours can\nbe solved in other areas of the world. After having solved\na prolonged domestic conflict by political means, we\nSalvadorans have many challenges before us which can be\nsummed up in a few words: the achievement of a lasting,\nstable and modern democracy based on the rule of law that\nwill enable us to achieve social peace and the building of\na new El Salvador.\nFor these reasons, we are determined to expedite\nactions aimed at satisfying the deepest aspirations of our\npeople: worthwhile and well-paid work; a participatory\neducation stressing the creation of a culture of peace based\non civic and moral values; a health system that is not only\ncurative but preventive; the promotion of micro-enterprises\nand small businesses; full respect for and promotion of\nhuman rights, including special emphasis on the rights of\nwomen and children; the restoration and preservation of our\nenvironment; strengthening the rule of law; and the\nconsolidation of a true system of civil liberties. On this\nbasis, the Salvadoran people will be able to put all of their\ntalents and efforts into achieving the sustainable and\nintegral development of society.\nWe believe that human and economic development are\ntwo sides of the same coin, and mutually dependent.\nGreater human development makes possible conditions\nunder which economic development can increase, which in\nturn produces increased resources to stimulate human\ndevelopment.\nAccordingly, the Government of President Armando\nCalder\u00f3n Sol is carrying out reforms that will allow for the\ncreation of a country replete with opportunities for all\nSalvadorans, thereby breaking the vicious circle of poverty\nin which those born poor are condemned to die poor.\nThis objective can be achieved as long as we, as a\nnation, have a single vision that goes beyond different\nideological or political circumstances. The great task\nfacing this generation in El Salvador is to recognize that\nsociety is a whole and to ensure that all the force of\nhistory is brought to bear in order to find solutions that\nbenefit the entire population.\nThe people and Government of El Salvador wish to\nreaffirm their recognition of the contribution made by the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, his\nrepresentatives and the agencies of the United Nations\nsystem, to the consolidation of peace, democracy and\nreconstruction in our country. We would like also to\nthank the international community for its material,\ntechnical and financial support to complement the efforts\nof the Salvadoran people to achieve peace and sustainable\ndevelopment, which has enabled us to begin a process of\nmodernization, so as to meet successfully the challenges\nof the twenty-first century.\nIn conclusion, we would like to express our absolute\nconfidence that, at the conclusion of the fifty-first session\nof the General Assembly, the peoples of the world who\nare represented here will have reached a greater level of\nunderstanding, trust and cooperation, enabling them to\ndeal together with the problems affecting the international\ncommunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I should like first of all to\ncongratulate Mr. Razali Ismail wholeheartedly on his\nassumption of the presidency of this session. His close\nassociation with the United Nations during these years as\nhis country\u2019s representative makes him not only highly\nqualified for the office but also fully cognizant of the\nactivities, including the needs and challenges, of this, our\ngreat Organization. I would assure him of my delegation\u2019s\nsupport at all times.\nIn the same vein, I should like to extend appreciation\nto his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, who\nworked tirelessly to ensure that the work of the Assembly\nwas both effective and successful. My delegation\u2019s thanks\nand gratitude also go to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for the successful holding of this session in\nthe face of serious financial and other constraints, and for\nthe selfless service he is rendering to our Organization. The\nquality of his work, as well as his untiring efforts to\nrevitalize our 50-year-old Organization, deserve our full and\ncollective support and encouragement. The Gambia remains\ncommitted to the Organization of African Unity\u2019s (OAU)\ndeclaration of support for His Excellency Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali to continue in office as Secretary-General for\na second term.\nLast year, when the delegation of the Gambia\naddressed the Assembly, we dwelt at length on the twin\ndemocratization and development processes in the Gambia.\nIt is fitting today to report on the progress made so far and\nthe successes achieved. Concerning the democratization\nprocess, I am pleased to inform this gathering that we\nsuccessfully conducted a referendum on 8 August 1996 to\nadopt a new Constitution, and we elected a new President\non 26 September 1996. These two activities have been\ncharacterized by a high sense of political maturity and civic\ninterest and a high level of voter turnout.\nThe Constitution was adopted by a vote of 270,093 in\nfavour against 113,744 opposed, with a total turnout of 86.9\nper cent for the referendum. Not only is this new\nConstitution the best we have ever had, but it also embraces\nthe people\u2019s political expectations for the advent of a true\nsense of justice and fair play as well as their deep love of\nfreedom, respect for human rights, and a strong nationalistic\nfeeling predicated on a desire to associate with the rest of\nthe world on a free and equitable basis. Furthermore, the\nnew Constitution ensures that the Second Republic will\nprogress and flourish under the universally respected\nprinciples of transparency, accountability and probity \u2014\na sine qua non for any honest and well-meaning\nGovernment. The presidential election, the penultimate\nphase of our two-year transitional programme, was held\non 26 September 1996. Four political parties presented\ncandidates, and His Excellency Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh,\nleader of the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and\nConstruction (APRC), emerged as the winner. The\nPresident-elect polled 220,011 votes, or about 56 per cent\nof the total votes cast. This resounding victory indicates\na strong endorsement by the Gambian people of the\npolicies of the now-dissolved Armed Forces Provisional\nRuling Council (AFPRC). The distribution of the results\nand the actual percentages of the votes captured by the\nrespective candidates depict an election that was free and\nfair \u2014 free from the obvious abuses of the position of\nincumbency.\nIn keeping with the APRC\u2019s philosophy of national\nunity, the President-elect has extended a message of peace\nand reconciliation to all Gambians. In his address to the\nnation on 27 September 1996, following the presidential\nelection, he said:\n\u201cIn democratic elections no voters lose, since the\noutcome is the collective will of all.\u201d\nHe invited all Gambians, irrespective of political\nconviction or affiliation, to come together and work for\nthe development of the country. In concluding the\ndemocratization process, the Gambia will hold its\nNational Assembly elections on 11 December 1996. Both\nthe Government and the Provisional Independent Electoral\nCommission attach a great deal of importance to these\nelections and have therefore been encouraging interested\nparties and individuals to contest for seats in the National\nAssembly. We have no doubt that the peace and\norderliness that characterized the referendum and\npresidential election will prevail in the forthcoming\nelections.\nIt is noteworthy that the electoral process in the\nGambia has been complemented by the Government\u2019s\npriority development projects. During the last two years,\nthe Government demonstrated to the whole world that an\nimportant ingredient of national development is the\ncommitment and honesty of a Government in\nimplementing realistic programmes for the benefit of its\npeople. In the education sector, several primary, junior\n16\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\nand secondary schools were built and a university extension\nprogramme launched. In the area of communication, the\ncountry\u2019s first-ever television station was commissioned,\nand the international airport was expanded and modernized.\nGenerally, there has been significant improvement and\nexpansion of the country\u2019s road network to ease the chronic\ntransportation problems. In the health sector, the\nGovernment has built a third referral hospital, and more\ndoctors and nurses have been recruited from inside and\noutside the country. As regards the agricultural sector,\nmechanization has received greater attention as a step\ntowards achieving food self-sufficiency. In short, more has\nbeen achieved in all sectors of the economy during the two\nyears of AFPRC rule than during the 30 years of the\nprevious regime.\nThe resilience of the Gambian economy during the last\ntwo years \u2014 in spite of the unjustified sanctions imposed\non the Gambia by our development partners for purely\npolitical reasons, and in the face of other powerful external\nshocks deriving mainly from trends in the global economy\nand in world trade \u2014 has been reassuring. The\nGovernment\u2019s macroeconomic policies and development\nefforts have helped to create an enabling environment for\nprivate investment, including foreign direct investment. In\neffect, the country\u2019s economic and financial performance\nduring the 1995-96 year showed real gross domestic\nproduct growing by 3 per cent. The projections for 1996-97\nare for it to grow by 3.5 per cent, with inflation limited to\n5 per cent.\nAs we forge ahead, we in the Gambia are proud of our\nGovernment and its laudable achievements since it took\nover the reins of power on 22 July 1994. We have learned\nthe true meaning of democracy: an amicable partnership\nbetween people and Government. It is through such a\npartnership that the Civic Education Programme was\nsuccessful and that Vision 2020 \u2014 a national strategy for\nsocio-economic development, aimed at raising the standard\nof living of the Gambian population \u2014 was launched.\nI should like at this stage to express the sincere\ngratitude of the Government and people of the Gambia for\nthe support and assistance received from some members of\nthe international community during the critical period of the\ntransition programme. We fervently hope that this support\nfrom our friends and well-wishers will continue to enable\nus successfully to conduct the National Assembly Elections\non 11 December 1996. With the successful end of the two-\nyear transition programme and the peaceful return of our\ncountry to democratic civilian rule, we also expect that the\ninternational community will now join us in our pursuit\nto achieve sustainable development.\nThe recently concluded United Nations Conference\non Human Settlements (Habitat II) in Istanbul will go\ndown in history as one of the most successful\ninternational conferences organized by the United Nations.\nThe Habitat Agenda, adopted by the Conference, reflects\ngenerally the acute shortage of shelter and the growing\ninternational concern for more and better shelter.\nAdequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlement\ndevelopment in an urbanizing world remain basic human\nneeds and a universal concern. In fact, the statement by\nthe Secretary-General of Habitat II, Mr. Wally N\u2019Dow,\nthat\n\u201cIstanbul will be the gateway to development into\nthe next century\u201d,\nwill hold true well into the twenty-first century. The\ncommitment of the Government of the Gambia to the\nimplementation of the Habitat Agenda \u2014 including the\nGlobal Plan of Action and, in particular, the forging of\nsustainable partnerships with all actors in the field of\nhuman settlements \u2014 remains high.\nThe mid-term review of the United Nations New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s in\nSeptember 1996 provided an opportunity to review\nprogress in Africa\u2019s development. The review reaffirmed\nthe New Agenda as a fundamental and achievable\nprogramme for the socio-economic development of\nAfrica, if both Africa and its development partners adhere\nto the programme\u2019s stated responsibilities and\ncommitments. The review revealed the gradual but\nencouraging growth of the African economy, with an\nincreased gross domestic product (GDP) of 2.3 per cent\nin 1995, as compared to 2.1 per cent in 1994. The\nimplementation of the New Agenda, however, continues\nto be constrained by failure to achieve the United Nations\ntarget of devoting 0.7 per cent of the GDP of developed\ncountries, including 0.15 per cent of their GNP, for\noverseas development assistance to the least developed\ncountries.\nAfrica\u2019s huge external debt burden, which grew at an\naverage annual rate of 1.5 per cent between 1990 and\n1995, remains the single most serious constraint to\nAfrica\u2019s consistent economic recovery and sustainable\ndevelopment. Major donors, creditors and the international\ncommunity should collectively devise a multilateral debt-\n17\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\nrelief programme aimed at completely writing off the debt\nof developing countries by the turn of the century. The\nimplementation of the United Nations System-wide Special\nInitiative for Africa alongside the New Agenda, and in\ncollaboration with the Bretton Woods institutions and other\nagencies, will constitute a new and dynamic global\napproach of working with Africa to accelerate its\ndevelopment. The attainment of the objectives of the\nSpecial Initiative within a decade will depend to a large\nextent on the availability of new and additional funds,\nrather than on the reprioritizing of programmes and\nremarshalling of funds identified under the New Agenda.\nOnly in this way can the international community realize \u2014\nas the President of the World Bank, Mr. Wolfensohn, said\nin connection with the launching of the Special Initiative \u2014\nthat\n\u201cthere is a need for us to give the push, that help, the\nassistance which can keep the momentum\u201d.\nGlobalization continues to hold much attraction, but its\nbenefits continue to elude the majority of developing\ncountries. The impact of globalization and liberalization on\nemployment and sustainable socio-economic development\nin general has been negative. The recent Ninth Meeting of\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD) in South Africa, while reaffirming the\ninternational community\u2019s commitment to partnership for\ndevelopment, recognized the disparities among nations as\nwell as the need to help developing countries reap the\nbenefits of globalization and development and to ensure\ntheir full and effective participation in the world economy\non an equitable basis.\nThe case of the least developed countries has always\nreceived the attention and support of the international\ncommunity, particularly through the adoption of the Paris\nDeclaration and the Programme of Action for the Least\nDeveloped Countries for the 1990s. The mid-term global\nreview of this Programme of Action, held in September\n1995, failed to confirm the realization of the programme\u2019s\nprimary objective, which is to arrest and reverse the\ndeterioration in the socio-economic situation in the least\ndeveloped countries and to revitalize their growth and\ndevelopment. It is noted that the lack of progress in\nimproving the socio-economic performance of LDCs is\nattributable, in the main, to the failure of the international\ncommunity to provide the necessary support and assistance\nthrough official development assistance, debt relief and\nbenefits from globalization and liberalization. The success\nof the Programme of Action during the second half of its\nexistence will depend to a large measure on the amount\nof international support for the economic growth of least\ndeveloped countries.\nThe attainment of international peace and security\nremains a vital aspect of our Organization\u2019s work. It is\nfor these reasons that my delegation joins the international\ncommunity in supporting the United Nations effort to\nensure peace and the resolution of conflicts throughout\nthe world. In this regard, the set-back in the peace process\nevidenced by the upheaval of April 1996 in Liberia was\nof great concern to the international community.\nHowever, thanks to the ceaseless efforts of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS),\nespecially through its Committee of Nine on Liberia, the\npeace process is back on track, and so far there has been\nsatisfactory progress on its implementation. In spite of the\ndifficulties encountered over the past few years in the\nimplementation of the Abuja Agreement, it is still our\nfirm belief that the Agreement remains the best\nframework for restoring durable peace to Liberia. With\nthe genuine commitment and goodwill of all parties and\nthe continued support of the international community,\nespecially the United Nations, I am confident that a\nlasting solution will soon be found.\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina gives some\nhope that the brokered peace will continue to hold. The\nelections of 14 September 1996 and the new federal\nGovernment which has been created should hopefully lead\nto national unity and reconciliation.\nIt is sad to note that the civil war in Somalia, after\nsimmering down for some time, has suddenly flared up\nagain. The renewed fighting has put a great deal of strain\non the peace process. The efforts of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity and of the international community in\ngeneral to contain hostilities and restore peace, security\nand stability continue to receive our fullest support.\nThe dramatic deterioration of the situation in\nBurundi is a major source of concern for all peace-loving\npeople the world over. We are indeed saddened by the\nspate of ethnic killings in this country, which continue to\nclaim many innocent lives. It is our collective\nresponsibility to put an end to this sorry state of affairs\nand thus avert a replay of the tragic events that occurred\nin neighbouring Rwanda some two years ago. In this\nregard, we continue closely to monitor the evolution of\nthe political situation in Burundi and hope that peace,\nsecurity and order will be permanently restored. We\n18\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\ntherefore strongly support the OAU peace initiatives, in\nparticular the Mwanza peace process and the Arusha peace\ninitiative, aimed at guaranteeing security and democracy for\nall people in Burundi.\nThe peace dividend so far achieved in our search for\na lasting peace in the Middle East should not be allowed to\nfade away. Rather, we should continue to pursue the peace\nprocess in order to achieve a lasting peace in the region on\nthe basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nThe quest for peace is a universal concern of the\ninternational community. At the same time, the desire for\nequality and recognition continues to elude some nations.\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan\u2019s quest for recognition\nand readmission into the United Nations has failed to have\nthe necessary impact on the attitude and goodwill of the\ninternational community. Today, the Republic of China on\nTaiwan stands very high in the international arena in the\nfield of economic growth and social development. It is\nnoted not only for its economic achievements, but also for\nits exemplary political reform. The direct election of its\nPresident on 23 March 1996, an event unprecedented in\nChinese history, marked the culmination of Taiwan\u2019s\npolitical democratization. This accomplishment ought to be\nrecognized by the United Nations, in accordance also with\nthe principle of universality. My country believes that the\nprecedent of parallel United Nations membership, which\napplied to the former East Germany and West Germany and\ncurrently applies to North Korea and South Korea, should\nbe applied in the case of the Republic of China on Taiwan.\nBesides the membership factor, which is in accordance\nwith Article 4 of the United Nations Charter, there is a\njustice factor relating to Articles 1 and 2 of the same\nCharter. It is regrettable that this factor was not included in\nour debate when the matter was considered at the meeting\nof the General Committee of the General Assembly, held\non 18 September 1996, in connection with the item on the\ndraft agenda entitled \u201cConsideration of the exceptional\nsituation of the inability, resulting from General Assembly\nresolution 2758 (XXVI), of the 21.3 million people on\nTaiwan, Republic of China, to participate in the activities\nof the United Nations\u201d. As we all know, one can quantify\nnumbers of signatures, but not emotions \u2014 that is,\nsympathy with and an interest and belief in the justification\nand rightness of the case of Taiwan. It is our conviction\nthat the parallel participation of the two sides of the Taiwan\nstrait in the United Nations and other international\norganizations would be conducive to the maintenance of\npeace and security in the Asia-Pacific region and in the\nworld in general. Let us therefore give the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan the opportunity to share with us their\ncapabilities and experience in a collective effort to realize\nhumankind\u2019s hope for the equitable development of every\nregion of the world.\nThe practice of the unilateral imposition of an\neconomic embargo against one Member State by another\nMember State should have ceased with the end of the\ncold-war era. For more than three decades now, Cuba has\nstruggled, against all odds, to survive economically and\nfinancially. With patience and determination, Cuba has\ncontinued to make great strides towards socio-economic\ndevelopment. Indeed, among the family of nations, it has\nexcelled in some activities of common benefit to\nhumankind, such as genetic engineering and modern\nmedicine. These laudable achievements and progress\nmade by Cuba deserve to be encouraged.\nThe application of the principles of international law\nand the effort of the international community to propagate\npeace and security should be all-embracing. In this\nconnection, as regards Libya\u2019s alleged complicity in the\ndowning over Lockerbie, Scotland, of Pan Am flight 103,\nwe support the OAU resolution adopted by the sixty-\nfourth session of the Council of Ministers in Yaound\u00e9\nfrom 1 to 5 July 1996, as a basis for overcoming the\npresent impasse on the issue.\nConcerning the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, we\nwould like to urge the international community not to\nrelent in its efforts to find a just and peaceful settlement\nto the dispute in accordance with the relevant resolutions\nof the Security Council. The Gambia reaffirms its\ncommitment to the international community\u2019s resolve to\ncombat naked aggression, particularly between States, and\ninternational terrorism from whatever quarter. Pursuant to\nthe relevant Security Council and Organization of the\nIslamic Conference (OIC) resolutions, we support the\nefforts of Kuwait to preserve and defend its territorial\nintegrity while seeking a just and speedy redress to the\nconsequences of the Iraqi invasion.\nLast year we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe United Nations. The occasion afforded us the\nopportunity to review the operations and mandate of the\nOrganization. The ongoing exercise of strengthening the\nUnited Nations system is complementing this review and\nthe rededication to the ideals of the United Nations. In\nparticular, we should give our full support to the\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly and\n19\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\nthe Economic and Social Council, and to the reform of the\nSecurity Council \u2014 including the question of equitable\nrepresentation of all geographical regions on this important\norgan of the United Nations. The proposals for the reform\nof the Security Council made by the African Group and\nItaly, among others, should also be given due consideration.\nThe reform of the Security Council should ensure that the\nhegemonistic interests of a few will not be promoted to the\ndetriment of the majority.\nThe reforms of the United Nations put in sharp focus\nthe present financial crisis of the Organization and the\ngallant efforts of the Secretary-General to improve its\nfinancial situation. The serious consideration the General\nAssembly has given this matter since 1994, leading to its\nsetting up a High-level Open-ended Working Group on the\nFinancial Situation of the United Nations, once more\ndemonstrates Member States\u2019 commitment to the\npreservation and continued operations of the Organization.\nThe cumulative effect of the financial reforms, including\nthe huge staff reductions, should, as much as possible,\nneither compromise the efficiency and productivity of the\nOrganization nor deflect it from its traditional operations\nand renewed mandate. The Organization\u2019s precarious\nfinancial situation is our collective concern, and we should\ntherefore resolutely strive to ensure that it is promptly\naddressed. This of course requires that all Member States\nhave the clear political will to pay their contributions\npunctually. Member countries should desist from\nwithholding their contributions for purely political\nconsiderations, as this would paralyse the functioning of the\nUnited Nations.\nIt is fitting at this juncture to refer to the work of this\nbody in pursuing the objectives of the Agenda for Peace\nand the Agenda for Development. The search for a common\nbasis for international cooperation on conflict resolution,\nrelief operations and development remains an active agenda\nof the United Nations. The success of any international\ncooperation on these issues would require greater focus on\nthe effective implementation of the development priorities\nof developing countries. The link between peace and\ndevelopment is not only essential but forms part of the\nUnited Nations Charter. The two serve as twin pillars of the\ninternational community\u2019s effort to achieve universal peace\nand security based on the promotion of the social and\neconomic development of all peoples. We remain fully\ncommitted to their effective realization.\nThe manifold problems of illicit drug trafficking and\nabuse are becoming increasingly universal. In many\nrespects, both producer and non-producer nations are\nrapidly falling victim to the pernicious effects of illicit\ndrugs. Today countries that once were drug free are either\ngradually becoming infested with the sale and use of\nillicit drugs or are being made transit posts in the illicit\ntrafficking of narcotics and psychotropic substances. For\nmany years now, the United Nations has led a steady, all-\nembracing fight against the global drug menace,\nespecially through its International Drug Control\nProgramme and Global Programme of Action, and,\nrecently, by making drugs the subject of the 1996 high-\nlevel segment of the Economic and Social Council\nsession. The effort of the United Nations in combating the\ntrafficking and sale of illicit drugs cannot succeed unless\nthe international community lends it its full support\nthrough improved and effective international cooperation\nin drug control. The Gambia will continue to participate\nin any international effort to combat and defuse the global\ndrug menace. At the national level, appropriate organs\nand control measures have been put in place to discourage\nthe use of the Gambia as a transit post in the illicit global\ndrug trade and to save Gambians from falling victim to its\nharmful effects.\nIn the area of nuclear disarmament, it is gratifying\nto note that the General Assembly recently adopted the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. That\nendorsement by the international community should not,\nhowever, overlook the legitimate concerns and\nreservations expressed by India.\nThe convening of the World Food Summit next\nmonth in Rome to address hunger and food security\nprovides the opportunity to renew the international\ncommunity\u2019s commitment to the eradication of hunger\nand malnutrition and the attainment of food security for\nall.\nThe linkage between the problem of food security\nand poverty cannot be overemphasized. The Gambia,\nwithin the framework of the United Nations Development\nProgramme and in observance of the International Year\nfor the Eradication of Poverty (1996), has been\nparticipating effectively in the fight against poverty.\nNational programmes have been designed and put in place\nto achieve poverty eradication.\nThe last decade of the twentieth century has\nwitnessed some landmark activities in international\ncooperation. The series of United Nations global\nconferences signifies the international community\u2019s\n20\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\npreoccupation with the preservation of international peace\nand security, the promotion and preservation of human\nrights and fundamental freedoms, the propagation of\ndevelopment techniques and the attainment of sustainable\ndevelopment, the provision of adequate shelter for our\nrapidly growing population and, indeed, the attempt to\nensure the social and economic well-being of all peoples all\nover the world.\nThe Gambia is proud to be associated with this\ninternational crusade for a secure and better life for every\nhuman being."

        "file_text": "\ufeffLast year we\ntook stock of half a century of United Nations history. The\nrock we are pushing up the hill like Sisyphus always seems\nto roll back a little. We must not be discouraged by this. It\nremains our responsibility to do what we solemnly\nreaffirmed on the fiftieth anniversary of the world\nOrganization: maintain peace and to help people who are\nsuffering from want and poverty.\nYou, Mr. President, have issued a warning to us all for\nthis fifty-first General Assembly. We must look beyond our\nnational borders, and think and act accordingly. After\nmaking those anniversary promises, let us not fall back into\nthe old routine and rituals. The vision of a more peaceful\nand more equitable world must not be lost.\nThe world Organization must continue to be the\nworld\u2019s conscience. For who else other than this forum is\nto keep watch to prevent murder and torture, to ensure that\nrefugees have the basic necessities of life and that our\nchildren are protected and cared for?\nThe world is grossly unjust. From the moment of birth\nmillions of people have hardly any chance of living in\nconditions worthy of humankind. No one can turn away\nfrom this; it concerns us all. No country, no region and\nno group of States can bear all of the world\u2019s burdens and\ntroubles alone. All, even the strongest among us, need\nsolidarity, need the help of others. How can terrorism, for\ninstance, a cancer of our time, be stopped without\ninternational cooperation?\nDevelopments over the past 10 years have shown\nthere is no cause for resignation. There can be\nprogress \u2014 provided we pool our resources and act\ntogether. That is the lesson of Bosnia, of South Africa\nand of the Middle East, and of the historic achievements\nin the field of disarmament in recent years. Every child\nthat is saved from death in Rwanda or Burundi, every\nrefugee able to return to his native village in Bosnia,\nevery rainforest area we can preserve, must strengthen our\nhope. The one world requires us to act as one.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, a free election has been\nheld for the first time after four terrible years of war. It\nhas provided a crucial foundation for the country\u2019s\nrecovery. Joint institutions must now be created without\ndelay. The future members of the three-person presidency\nshould meet in Sarajevo before the end of September.\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (OSCE) had a very difficult task supervising the\nelection in Bosnia. That organization\u2019s scope for action\nmust be increased at the Lisbon Summit in December this\nyear. The OSCE remains an indispensable pillar of the\nnew peaceful order for Europe, which we believe to be\nnecessary now that the iron curtain has come down.\nThe forces working for peace in the region are\nthemselves not strong enough; there is still no self-\nsustaining stability. In Bosnia and Herzegovina there can\nbe no permanent international police force \u2014 even the\n60,000 troops of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO), of the United Nations and of all the other\ncountries cannot guarantee peace on the ground \u2014 but I\nthink that for a limited time that country continues to\nrequire a \u201cfire brigade\u201d. This presupposes a fresh mandate\nfrom the Security Council.\nGermany is willing to provide a military\ncontribution. By admitting more than 320,000 war\nrefugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany has\npractised human solidarity. We also have more than\n130,000 Yugoslav nationals, most of them from Kosovo,\nwho have to return to their native regions. This is a heavy\nburden for us, including in financial terms. But we gave\n7\n\n\ntemporary protection and shelter to these people on\nhumanitarian grounds, and we will not be found wanting in\nthis respect now that their repatriation is becoming possible.\nEurope has been torn by fratricidal wars for centuries.\nThe current peaceful unification of that continent is a\nmessage of hope for the whole world. The first of our\ncentral and eastern European neighbours will soon belong\nto the Euro-Atlantic institutions.\nMy country Germany owes its unity to the confidence\nwhich the world placed in our policy of reconciliation and\ngood neighbourliness. In our eyes that implies a duty:\ntogether with France, we will remain the motor of European\nUnion.\nAddressing the Assembly in 1989, my predecessor\nHans-Dietrich Genscher extended a hand to Poland. Today\nI turn to our Czech neighbours in particular and say that the\nGerman-Czech declaration will be adopted shortly. Czechs\nand Germans can look confidently to a common European\nfuture.\nThe Russian people too must be winners in the process\nof European unification. The special partnership which\nNATO is seeking with Russia is of central importance for\npeace and security in Europe. And that is why we want as\nquickly as possible to draft the fundamentals of a charter\nbetween NATO and Russia, as I suggested in Carcassonne\n18 months ago at a meeting of the European Union foreign\nministers. Our offer stands. Russia should help shape\nEurope\u2019s future as an equal partner. That large and\nimportant country must be given a place in Europe\ncommensurate with its size and importance.\nPart of the European Union\u2019s peace message is that\nwe Europeans stand for a policy of international\ncooperation among equals, and for a global partnership for\ndevelopment and the environment in the twenty-first\ncentury. New opportunities for such a partnership derive\nfrom the globalization of industry and technology. Never\nhave so many people experienced so much progress as in\nthe past 10 years. In the year 2020, if the present trend\ncontinues, the 15 countries with the largest gross national\nproducts will include nine of today\u2019s developing countries.\nThe recipe is free markets, democracy, reliability of\nthe judicial system, and integration into the global\neconomy. This kind of good governance was rewarded with\n$150 billion of private direct investment in 1995.\nHowever, 90 per cent of that investment has gone to\nonly 12 countries, and the gap between the poor and the\nrest of the world continues to widen. The World Summit\nfor Social Development put the number of poor people at\n1.3 billion, nearly a quarter of the entire human race. This\ncalls for action from both sides, help from the community\nof nations and self-help on the part of the countries\nconcerned. The one is the precondition for the other.\nThis evening I am having another meeting with my\nAfrican colleagues. I take a very keen interest in the\nfuture of Europe\u2019s vast neighbouring continent. We\nshould not see only Africa\u2019s negative side but the hopeful\nsigns as well, and there are such signs. Democratization\nis progressing, as shown by the fact that elections have\ntaken place or are scheduled in 17 countries this year.\nAverage economic growth has outpaced population\ngrowth for the first time in many years. Life expectancy\nhas increased by more than 25 per cent since 1960, and\never more children are going to school.\nGermany supports Africa\u2019s integration into the world\neconomy and the development of its own capabilities. The\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\nAfrica in the 1990s is a sound foundation for these\nefforts. The Secretary-General\u2019s United Nations System-\nwide Initiative on Africa should likewise be used by all\nconcerned as a basis for joint action.\nHowever, much remains to be done. The ghastly\nevents in Rwanda must not be repeated in Burundi. On\nthe other hand, the United Nations should not be the\norganization of first resort in every conflict situation. It\ncannot solve every problem. Hence, the regional\norganizations must assume a larger measure of\nresponsibility.\nThe Organization of African Unity, like the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, has\nmatured to a degree that commands respect. Germany,\nwith one eye on Burundi, has to date provided one\nmillion deutsche mark in support of that organization\u2019s\nconflict prevention mechanism. High hopes have been\nplaced in the efforts of Julius Nyerere. The proposed\nconference on the Great Lakes region has the support of\nGermany and the European Union.\nGermany will remain a good partner and friend to\nthe nations of Africa. That will also be my message at the\nforthcoming second European Union-Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC) ministerial meeting in\nWindhoek. The regionalization process in Africa is an\n8\n\n\nelement of hope. The outstanding example is southern\nAfrica with the SADC. That region must become a\nlocomotive for the whole continent.\nOne neighbouring region whose fate touches Europe\nis the Middle East. That is also the main reason for our\nstrong commitment in the whole Middle East region. For\nhistorical reasons, Germany has a special relationship with\nIsrael; that remains unshakable. Bilaterally and through the\nEuropean Union we are the most important donor for the\nPalestinians. Germany will maintain that commitment. I\nconfirmed this in my recent meetings with Israeli Foreign\nMinister Levy and with President Yasser Arafat in Bonn.\nTerrorists should not be given any chance to block the\npath to peace. The sealing off of Gaza and the West Bank\nmust be eased and discontinued as soon as possible. That\nis our common endeavour. The struggle against terrorism\nmust remain at the top of the international agenda. I\nurgently appeal to all concerned to resume the peace\nprocess without delay. There is no alternative.\nIt has been estimated that the world\u2019s population will\nnumber about 10 billion in 2030. For their sake, for the\nsake of our children and grandchildren, we must take steps\ntoday to ensure that the Earth remains habitable. Peace and\nhuman dignity, economic progress and protection of the\nnatural foundations of life are inseparable. Without social\njustice, without any vision for the world\u2019s economic\nprogress, we shall not be able to break the vicious circle of\npoverty, environmental destruction and population\nexplosion.\nWe have no time to lose. Every second three babies\nare born, and every year the world\u2019s population increases\nby nearly 100 million. All of them need food, clothing,\nschools and a home. Every minute about 12 acres of\ntropical rain forest are lost, an area the size of 40 football\npitches.\nAntoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry warned that the human race\nhad not inherited the Earth from its fathers but had\nborrowed it from its children. We became acutely aware of\nthis at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. North and\nSouth, East and West, are struggling to survive together in\nspaceship Earth, whose blue protective shield is becoming\nincreasingly fragile.\nOur task now is to convert that environmental\nawareness into environmental action. The year 1997 will be\ncrucial for such action. The special session of the General\nAssembly devoted to environment and development must\nchart the course for the next millennium in order to\nrestore the balance between man, nature and the economy.\nGermany\u2019s industrial community has voluntarily\nundertaken to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by\n20 per cent by the year 2005. Since 1990, Germany has\nreduced those emissions by nearly 13 per cent and\nthereby has led the way for the rest of the world.\nWe are contributing 312 million deutsche mark to\nthe pilot programme to protect Brazil\u2019s tropical forests.\nThat represents 60 per cent of the total contributions\nmade so far. We appeal to the community of nations to\nbecome more heavily involved in this programme. We\ncan only succeed together or fail together.\nAt the 1997 climate conference in Japan we must\nachieve the objective agreed upon in Berlin 12 months\nago: the adoption of a substantive and binding protocol to\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. At the recent Geneva\nconference, the great majority of nations came out in\nfavour of specific targets and time limits. This is\nencouraging.\nI wish to thank all members once again for\nsupporting our efforts to have the secretariat of the\nFramework Convention on Climate Change established in\nBonn. May I also ask members to support our proposal\nthat the secretariat of the Framework Convention to\nCombat Desertification likewise be located in Bonn, as it\nhas to cooperate closely with the climate secretariat. The\nUnited Nations will find that living and working\nconditions in our country are good.\nThe Rio Declaration on Environment and\nDevelopment rightly makes people the focal point of all\nefforts. We must continue to concentrate on combating\npoverty and providing basic and vocational education.\nEven if that is not the kind of subject that makes\nheadlines, it is and will remain, together with\npeacekeeping, one of our principal tasks.\nEqual opportunities for women must not remain\nmere theory.\nNothing is more powerful than an idea whose time\nhas come, is a saying that applies to human dignity and\nhuman rights. The fall of the Berlin Wall showed that the\npeople\u2019s pursuit of freedom and personal happiness is, in\nthe long run, stronger than any dictatorship. That is why\nthe worldwide defence of human rights will likewise not\nbe in vain.\nIt all boils down to something quite natural: that we\ntreat one another as humans and that we do not inflict upon\nothers what we would not like to have inflicted upon\nourselves. Murderers and torturers must not be allowed to\nsleep peacefully. Mladic\u00b4 and Karadzic\u00b4, and all for whom\narrest warrants have been issued, deserve to be brought\nbefore the International Tribunal in The Hague. Germany\ncalls for the early convening of a conference to establish an\ninternational criminal court.\nThere is a core of human rights that are common to us\nall and that are universally valid. This fact received\ninternational confirmation at the Vienna Conference on\nHuman Rights. There can and should be no withdrawal\nfrom that position.\nWith the East-West confrontation now consigned to\nthe past, intercultural dialogue assumes ever-greater\nsignificance. Close to 2.5 million Muslims are living in\nGermany. If only for this reason, it is of special importance\nto develop greater mutual understanding between\nChristianity and Islam.\nA subject very close to my heart, as former Minister\nof Justice, is the protection of our children, the weakest\nmembers of society. Universal Children\u2019s Day was\nobserved on 20 September. Its motto: \u201cChildren have\nrights\u201d. What do those rights look like in reality? Every day\n35,000 children die of hunger. Twelve million children do\nnot live beyond the age of 5. Two million are forced into\nprostitution. Two hundred thousand children around the\nworld are used as soldiers in war. Millions of them are used\nas cheap labour.\nThe Stockholm conference on sexual abuse of children\nhas awakened world opinion, and I should like to thank the\nSwedish Government for having hosted and organized this\nconference, which shocked us all into action. The atrocious\nway many of our children are being treated is a disgrace \u2014\na disgrace \u2014 to our civilization. The Stockholm Plan of\nAction must be followed by global action. This we owe to\nour children. And I should like to make it very clear that\nanyone who violates the weakest members of society \u2014\nchildren, that is \u2014 deserves to be outlawed by society.\nPeace is not everything, but without peace everything\nis nothing. These words originate from the time when East\nand West faced each other armed to the teeth. In the\nmeantime the nightmare of a nuclear inferno has been\ndispelled. Yesterday\u2019s signing of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was another momentous step in\nthis process, I believe, after half a century of international\ndebate and protest against nuclear testing.\nIn expressing my thanks to Australia I appeal to all\nnations to ratify the Treaty as soon as possible. Since the\nend of the Second World War upwards of 2,000 nuclear\ntests have been carried out. We now have the chance to\nput a stop to them once and for all. Anyone who rejects\nsomething good because they will only accept something\nperfect should be mindful of their responsibility to future\ngenerations. We cannot force the atomic genie back into\nthe bottle, but we owe it to our children and\ngrandchildren to tame it \u2014 at least to tame it.\nThe total abolition of all chemical weapons is of\nsimilar consequence. The Chemical Weapons Convention\nmust enter into force next spring. All nations, and\nespecially those with the largest stockpiles of such\nweapons, must meet their tremendous responsibility and\nratify the Convention as soon as possible.\nI should also like to touch upon an issue that I take\na very personal, keen interest in, and that is a totally\ndifferent kind of mass-destruction weapon: anti-personnel\nmines. I travelled to Mozambique and Cambodia and took\na look at the situation there. Hundreds of millions of such\nanti-personnel mines are still in the ground. Year in, year\nout they kill and maim 20,000 people and make entire\nregions permanently uninhabitable. These treacherous\ntools of murder must be banned.\nGermany has completely renounced anti-personnel\nmines and imposed a unilateral, open-ended ban on\nexports. Residual stocks are to be destroyed by the end of\n1997. In my Seven-Point Programme of Action I have\nproposed a number of measures to maintain the\nmomentum generated in Geneva. My main objective \u2014\nbecause I think the motto should be \u201cfirst things first\u201d \u2014\nis to improve the efficiency of mine clearance. We will\nattend a conference in Canada very soon which deals with\nthe political aspects of this issue, trying to ban land-\nmines. But we should also at the same time try to\nconcentrate on improving the efficiency of mine\nclearance, that is, testing and using mechanical clearance\nequipment. We quickly need machinery that can be mass-\nproduced in order to remove this plague without harming\npeople. I do not know whether anyone here has watched\na mine-clearance operation. It is done by people and can\nbe compared to trying to remove a sand-dune with a\nspoon. I think it is incredible that highly developed\n10\n\n\nnations such as ours and many others are not able to\nproduce a piece of machinery for a large-scale de-mining\noperation. I want to focus the technical knowledge that we\nhave to make this matter progress as quickly as possible.\nIf we want to win peace, we must not only consider\nconflict prevention; we must also pay greater attention to\nthe situation after the termination of military hostilities.\nPeace-building was the subject of the international\nconference that we sponsored in Berlin in July. That\nconference produced a number of interesting and tangible\nresults, which we are making available to all Member\nStates in the form of a report. Together with other countries\nwe intend to submit to members during this session of the\nGeneral Assembly a draft resolution on peace consolidation\nthrough practical steps towards disarmament. Whether in\nBosnia, Rwanda or Angola, all previous efforts will prove\nin vain unless we can prevent a resurgence of violence.\nMost of the burden is borne by the 26,000 or so Blue\nHelmets and civilian personnel making up the peacekeeping\nmissions, as well as by the countless courageous staff of\nnon-governmental organizations who are doing their job all\nover the world under difficult conditions. Speaking here in\nthe United Nations, I should like to express my sincere\nthanks to the non-governmental organizations. We are\nproud of them.\nIn our resolution marking the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe United Nations, we solemnly undertook to pass on to\nthe next millennium a United Nations organization equipped\nand financed to perform its tasks. The greatest political\nsignificance attaches to reform of the Security Council, in\nwhose work we have been closely involved over the last\ntwo years. This, the principal guardian of world peace, still\nbears the countenance of the year 1945, but it now needs a\nnew one for the year 2000. It is a question of enhancing\nthat body\u2019s legitimacy, credibility and effectiveness. After\na three-year debate the time has come to put the various\nelements together and start the restructuring process, to now\nget things done after having analysed what can be done.\nWe are pleased that a large number of Member States are\nin favour of a permanent seat for Germany on the Security\nCouncil. I really believe that the time is approaching when\nthe General Assembly will have to decide.\nWhat continues to require our immediate attention is\nthe financial crisis. The Organization\u2019s rationalization and\nreform are indispensable and urgent. A glance at the books\nis enough to tell us that. The regular United Nations budget\nshows zero growth. The Secretariat has lost more than\n1,000 posts, and further reductions will follow next year.\nSo much has already been achieved.\nI therefore take this opportunity to thank the\nSecretary-General and his staff, who, both at headquarters\nand in the field, continue to achieve outstanding results\ndespite the reductions in their numbers and the constant\nlack of funds. I should like to thank them very warmly.\nI wish to add another word if I may. The United\nNations, in its actions and decisions, can be only as\nstrong as its Members allow it to be. People tend to\noverlook that fact so readily when they criticize this\nOrganization. I stress this point because I think that the\noutside world has a distorted image of the United Nations.\nThe United Nations is us, the Member States. We can\nonly achieve what we want to achieve together.\nI am afraid that I must repeat that we will have to\nsave and rationalize further still. The need for reform is\nno justification for refusing to pay contributions, however.\nMoreover, special rights also imply special duties. The\nGerman-American philosopher Hans Jonas said that\nresponsibility is the most important principle of the new\nage. Let us act in accordance with that principle.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset, Sir, to congratulate you\non your election as President of the current session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I salute you in my capacity as Chairman\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, which has found in your\nbackground a close identity with the defence of the interests\nof the developing countries. The same is true of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who\nhonoured us with his attendance at the last Non-Aligned\nMovement summit, held at Cartagena de Indias.\nOver the past several years in Colombia, we have been\nwaging a difficult war against drug trafficking. In that\nbattle, judges, police officers, journalists and innocent\ncivilians have lost their lives: more than 20,000 people in\nthe last 10 years. In fact, last week in the southern part of\nthe country more than 50 soldiers of the Colombia army\nwho were destroying illicit crops and cocaine processing\nlaboratories in the jungle region were massacred by\nguerrillas engaged in the defence of drug trafficking\ninterests. The mother of one of those murdered young\nmen \u2014 a 17-year-old soldier \u2014 asked me the following\nday with tears in her eyes: \u201cWhy\u201d?\nAllow me today to try to answer that mother and all\nthose who have been victims of this war, not only in\nColombia, but around the world. Values, democracy and\nnational security are threatened. We are waging this war\nto preserve and protect those values; to protect and\npreserve our youth and our democratic form of\ngovernment; but above all to protect our national security.\nNo country in the world must ignore the battle against\ndrugs. This war is occurring today in every country,\nowing to the broad power of powerful international\ncriminal and terrorist organizations which have extended\ntheir tentacles over the entire planet.\nNow that the cold war has ended, the United Nations\nand the world must design and develop a strategy to put\nan immediate end to the greatest threat to the world\u2019s\nsecurity and stability today: the threat of drugs. It is an\nepidemic that, more than any other war, can undermine\nthe value structure which supports the governability of\ndemocratic systems.\nAs we prepare for the twenty-first century, I invite\nall world leaders present or represented here today, to a\ncollective and above all sincere reflection on this\n\n\nproposal, which Colombia presents with the moral authority\nit has been granted, having been the nation which has\nsuffered most, which has invested most, and which has paid\nthe highest social and economic costs in this struggle\nagainst drug trafficking.\nIn recent years, Colombia has spent 14 times more\nresources fighting drug trafficking than what is invested\nannually by the international community through the United\nNations system for the same purpose. Thanks to this\ndetermined effort, Colombia has been able to avoid the\nannual distribution throughout the world of more than\n6 billion doses intended for drug users.\nI, too, have been a victim of drug trafficking. Several\nyears ago I was the target of an assassination attempt that\nalmost cost me my life. I received 11 bullet wounds, and\nstill carry four bullets in my body. More recently I fell\nvictim to another assassination attempt, this time of a moral\nnature. I was accused of having allowed money from a\ncartel to infiltrate my campaign. Despite that, from the very\nfirst day of my Administration we have worked\nsuccessfully to arrest the criminals and completely destroy\nthe powerful Cali cartel.\nI thank God that I survived that assault too. The\nCongress of the Republic of Colombia, which, under our\nConstitution is the judge of the President, completely\nexonerated me of all charges after a long trial that I\npersonally requested be held in public. Barely 48 hours ago,\nbefore coming to the Assembly, I was the victim of yet\nanother attempt. Heroin was smuggled onto my aeroplane\nin order to shame Colombia and its democratic\nGovernment. This new attempt proved that the criminal\norganizations have the power and the capability to penetrate\nalmost every institution in our society, anywhere in the\nworld. However, I stand here today, before this world\nAssembly of democracy, with complete dignity because\nnobody will stop me from presenting to the world\nColombia\u2019s proposals to deal with the drug organizations.\nI am speaking to the Assembly today bearing the\npainful scars of those encounters. Similar scars are borne\nby all Colombians who have been physically injured by\ndrug terrorism or morally wounded by international\nmisunderstanding. I am not here to complain; I am here to\npropose a solution to this modern-day epidemic. I am\nconvinced that the world is losing the war against drugs.\nThe solution will have to be as global as the problem itself.\nIt will have to be as swift and irreversible as the damage\nthat drugs and crime are causing to the minds of the young\ndrug users of the world.\nThe achievements of Colombia and other countries\ndo not imply that the problem of drug trafficking has\nbeen eradicated throughout the world. The drug problem\nwill be resolved only when all countries, without\nexception and without hypocrisy, shoulder their own\nresponsibilities, which cannot be delegated to others.\nTo achieve this, we must set out the parameters for\na great anti-drug alliance, which include immediate and\ndecisive action. If we do not accomplish this, drug\ntrafficking, the most sinister transnational enterprise in the\nworld, whose resources equal $500 billion per year \u2014\nmore than those of the world-wide petroleum industry \u2014\nwill continue to corrupt and contaminate our peoples.\nThe statistics on international action to date are not\nvery encouraging. Drug use continues to increase under\nthe tolerant attitudes of some Governments, and the level\nof drug seizures and confiscation barely exceeds 10 per\ncent of the total of such drugs circulating in the world. In\nthe face of this demoralizing reality we have only two\nalternatives: mutual recrimination, or cooperation. Either\nwe continue to criticize each other, or we work together.\nMultilateral focus on the problem is the only alternative;\ninterventionism is not the way. The only end that\nunilateral or interventionist measures achieve, as we have\nseen recently, is to break mutual trust, weaken the ability\nof Governments to take action, and open the way for the\nconsolidation of criminal organizations.\nColombia proposes an agenda of global action\nagainst drugs, based on the principles of shared\nresponsibility, equality and an integrated approach: shared\nresponsibility, because we are all responsible for the\nproblem of ethical, political, social and economic\ncontamination produced by drug trafficking throughout\nthe world; equality, because no country should assume the\nright to judge the conduct of another on a subject that\ninvolves the responsibility of all on standards of\nbehaviour that are worldwide and collective; and\nintegration, because every phase of the process \u2014 from\nagricultural production, to industrial processing, transport,\ndistribution, consumption, and money laundering \u2014 must\nbe addressed simultaneously, and with the same energy.\nColombia wants to be part of the solution. We do\nnot want to continue to be demonized by the world when,\nin fact, we are victims, as all peoples are. The issues for\nthe global agenda against drugs are as follows: first, with\nregard to the establishment of a social machinery for the\neradication of illegal crops, it is not enough to eradicate\n2\n\n\nsuch crops if we are not capable of offering alternative\nsolutions for small peasant farmers.\nColombia endorses the innovative proposal of French\nPresident Jacques Chirac to create a mechanism to enable\nthe purchase of produce grown as alternatives for illegal\ncrops at prices that closely approximate those paid for coca,\nopium poppies and marijuana. The establishment of this\nmechanism should be accompanied by a commitment to\naerial and manual eradication over five years, which would\nlead to the elimination of these illicit crops throughout the\nworld.\nSecondly, we need controls on the trafficking of\nchemical precursors and weapons, which are speeding drug\ntrafficking and the violence that it generates. The United\nNations system must define, within the framework of the\nVienna Convention, specific guidelines to regulate the pre-\nshipment certification of chemical precursors to\ndrug-producing countries, and contribute to producing\neffective systems to control arms sales to those same\ndestinations.\nAs regards a mandate to combat money laundering,\nonly decisive action against the profits generated by the\ndrug business can stop the recycling of these resources into\nproduction and distribution centres. Eighty per cent of drug\ntrafficking money circulates through the economic and\nfinancial channels of the industrialized nations. We need\nmuch stricter controls on the banking system and on\nindustries whose smuggling of goods and services are being\nused to launder this drug money.\nWe propose that the mandate of the European\nagreement governing money laundering, investigation,\nseizure and forfeiture of assets derived from drug\ntrafficking be extended to the global level. Concurrently, we\nshould expand globally those decisions reached at the\nWorld Ministerial Conference on Organized Transnational\nCrime held at Naples in 1994.\nAs regards a worldwide intelligence centre for\ncooperation in operations against cartels and drug\ntrafficking networks, we believe that in dealing with\ninternational crime which starts in one place, continues in\nanother and ends at the point of consumption, the combined\naction of all countries is required to develop the necessary\nintelligence and police operations to seize shipments,\ndismantle networks and pursue domestic drug dealers and\ndistributors. Colombia proposes such an organization of a\nworldwide intelligence centre against drugs. This centre\nwould coordinate the collection of evidence from every\npolice force in the world to fight the unified multinational\ndrug traffickers with an equally unified response.\nAs regards programmes which effectively curb\ndemand, statistics worryingly show that consumption is\ngrowing, not declining, and that it is doing so in the most\nvulnerable sectors of our society: among young people\nand ethnic minorities. Unless we curb demand, the task of\nfighting supply will be ineffective in achieving a\ndefinitive solution to the problem.\nOne cannot place the entire burden of drug fighting\non drug-producing countries, which are the weakest link.\nWe are speaking of a market that must be controlled from\nboth sides. Starting with an agreement on the goals for\nthe reduction of consumption, we propose the adoption of\nan integrated plan that includes prevention campaigns,\naction by non-governmental organizations and public\nhealth initiatives accompanied by stricter laws against the\ndistribution and consumption of illegal drugs.\nFinally, we propose a world treaty of judicial\ncooperation in the war against drugs and terrorism which\nmust have no frontiers. Recognizing the sovereign right\nof every nation to apply justice in its own territory for\ncrimes committed within its boundaries, no nation should\nagree to be used as a refuge or sanctuary for organized\ncrime. Judicial reciprocity and assistance in the exchange\nof evidence, the criminalization and judicial seizure of\nassets derived from drug trafficking and terrorism,\nextradition and the creation of high-security prisons with\nstandards subject to international monitoring must be an\nintegral part of this strategy.\nWithout undermining bilateral or regional\nagreements, these judicial cooperation agreements would\nestablish the basis for the eventual formation of an\ninternational tribunal against organized crime. Signatory\ncountries would submit international criminals such as\narms dealers, drug traffickers, money launderers and\nterrorists to the jurisdiction of this tribunal according to\nthe terms of their participation agreements.\nColombia proposes to this Assembly the formation\nof a group of experts who would be charged with\ndeveloping a timetable and action plan for this proposed\nglobal agenda for the war against drugs. An initial review\nof the group\u2019s progress could be made at the 1998 special\nsession of the General Assembly which has been\nproposed by the Government of Mexico. The group of\nexperts should be formed in four months\u2019 time, and\nColombia will be pleased to host its first meeting. I call\n3\n\n\non world leaders to communicate to Colombia their\nrecommendations on how best to organize the work of this\ngroup of experts.\nThe globalization of problems in today\u2019s world is\ntaking place much faster than the globalization of solutions.\nTerrorism, and drugs and arms trafficking do not respect\neither national boundaries or barriers. Developing countries\nhave fewer opportunities and more limited resources to\nconfront the invasive power of these threats, in the face of\nwhich there are neither weak nor strong, only victims.\nI invoke the memory of those killed by these wars\nwhich will also exist in the next century. I invoke our\nchildren\u2019s future, threatened by bombs, illegal drugs and\nguns. I invoke the plain cause of the coexistence of the\nworld in order to commit ourselves to this formidable task\nof blocking the path of organized crime which today\nchallenges our right to govern the world in peace. Finally,\nI invoke the tears of all the mothers and youths of the\nworld who have been sacrificed in the fight against drugs\nor through their use. May God illuminate our path that we\nmay continue this battle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I would also\nlike through you to convey my Government's\ncongratulations to Ambassador Razali Ismail on his election\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\nsession.\nThis is a transitional period for the United Nations and\nis therefore not devoid of complexities and uncertainty. Yet\nwe still have confidence in the ability of Member States\nand in the privileged forum provided by this Organization\nto develop new policies and management structures to deal\nwith the gamut of emerging international problems.\nAs this session of the General Assembly begins, we\nonce again renew our commitment to the principles and\npurposes of the Charter, the living instrument essential to\nthe future work of this Organization. The United Nations is\nan Organization which, through its nature, principles and\nobjectives, transcends any individual or national interests to\nrepresent, instead, the interests of all.\nNot even those who criticize the United Nations in the\nhopes that they can weaken it or shrink its role have ever\nbeen able to propose any better way for us to come\ntogether to address the major problems of an increasingly\ninterdependent world. That is why we are convinced that,\nfar from becoming weaker, this Organization will be called\nupon to play an increasingly important role in this new era\nof globalization, in which cooperation is the only possible\noption for a true international order.\nInternational peace and security, free trade, social\ndevelopment based on growth with equity, environmental\nprotection, democracy and human rights are the basic\ncomponents of the future work of our multilateral system.\nThese are the areas of action of our Organization to which\nChile attaches the highest priority and in which we will try,\nwithin our means to make our greatest contribution.\nIt has often been said that the end of the super-Power\nconfrontation that characterized the first 50 years of the life\nof this Organization makes it easier than ever to shape the\nconditions for peace and stability. And yet, the challenges\nof bipolar confrontation have been replaced by new ones\nposed by the emergence of numerous local conflicts.\nThese are often characterized by mass violations of\nhuman rights, uncontrolled population flows and\nhumanitarian emergencies that threaten the security of\nindividuals and States and eventually may affect the\ninternational system as a whole.\nOur participation in the work of the Security Council\nis aimed at contributing our fair share to the maintenance\nof international peace and security. We encourage\npreventive diplomacy, consensus solutions, the\nimplementation of measures to contain conflicts, the\npromotion of peaceful solutions through peace-keeping\noperations, conciliation, good offices and, in particular,\nthe protection of affected populations and victims.\nAt the same time, it is indisputable that peace and\nsecurity are not simply the absence of tensions and\nconflict between States. Harmony between people within\nthe same border has now become a fundamental factor in\ninternational peace and security. Chile has suggested that\nthe Security Council should act in cases where there is a\nreal or potential risk of mass and systematic violations to\nwhich the international community has reacted strongly\nand when earlier mechanisms or bodies trying to resolve\nthe problem have been exhausted.\nRecent measures adopted by the Council, such as\nresolution 688 (1991) on protecting the Kurdish minority,\n770 (1992) on providing assistance to victims of the\nconflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, resolution 986 (1995)\non alleviating the burden of sanctions on the civilian Iraqi\npopulation, are a few examples of a broader and more\nprogressive interpretation of what constitutes a threat to\npeace and establish valuable precedents for helping the\nSecurity Council to deal with these kinds of conflict.\nThese criteria also guided us in our active\nparticipation on the question of Burundi, which led to the\nadoption of resolution 1072 (1996) establishing\nprocedures for the various parties to the conflict to be\nable to agree on a political path to a peaceful resolution\nof their differences. We must continue to pay close\nattention to developments in this situation. The\ninternational community, the United Nations and the\nSecurity Council cannot risk another tragedy like that of\nRwanda and must exhaust all possible means of averting\nsuch a tragedy.\nToday we would also like to express our great\nconcern at the serious crisis that has arisen in the last few\n6\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\nhours affecting the peace process in the Middle East, a\nprocess we have supported from the outset. We urge the\nparties to the conflict not to waste what has been built up\nin the last few years and to resume dialogue within the\ncontext of respect for agreements reached and for the\nbeliefs of the peoples involved.\nEstablishing stability requires clear commitment to\ndisarmament and arms control and limitation. My country\nhas played an active role in this area, as shown in the\nrecent ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention,\nmembership in the Conference on Disarmament, which\nChile had long aspired to, ratification of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and our\nunstinting support for nuclear-weapon-free zones.\nLast Tuesday, 24 September 1996, I had the honour to\nsign on behalf of my country the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty. Just one year ago, this Assembly was\ndiscussing the nuclear-weapon tests still being conducted in\nthe South Pacific and Asia. Today we are meeting to sign\na Treaty that eliminates those tests once and for all and is\nthe combined effort of almost all the countries in this\nAssembly, including all the present nuclear-weapon States.\nWhen the United Nations is criticized for its alleged\ninefficiency I think we should also vaunt our successes.\nThese initiatives, along with progress in the area of\nconventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction,\nhelp to create the right conditions for peace and security\nand enable the international community to concentrate its\nefforts and material resources on the development of\nnations and environmental protection.\nPeacekeeping operations are one of the most important\ninstruments of this system. Peacekeeping forces have to\nstrive for results in the framework of clear and well-defined\nand legitimate mandates. Chile has participated in\npeacekeeping operations in India, Pakistan, the Middle East,\nCambodia and Kuwait, and we are currently taking part in\nthe activities of the United Nations Special Commission\n(UNSCOM) in Iraq.\nHowever, there is no doubt that this mechanism needs\nto be tailored to dealing with current political\ncircumstances. To this end, Chile is active in deliberations\non how to improve planning and rapid-reaction capacity to\ndeal with incipient conflicts. In all these aspects, a\nmultilateral approach, action that enjoys the consent of the\nparties and financing through the Organization all help to\nensure success in our work. We hope to increase\nsignificantly our contribution to operations such as the\nones I have just described.\nA broad understanding of the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security requires decisive action\nin the area of social development, democracy and the\npromotion of human rights. The world order of the next\ncentury will need broader basic freedoms. The global\nsociety of the next century is appearing as an open,\nheterogenous one, rich in material potential and new\ndevelopments. What is needed now is to create conditions\nto enable people and States to make the most of this new\nsetting, with increased access to the goods that are the\nfruit of rapid technological development.\nIn this respect, the six recent world conferences and\nsummits on the environment and development, human\nrights, population and development, women, social\ndevelopment and, most recently, human settlements, have\nall been geared towards promoting protection of the\nindividual and gradually creating a framework for social\nrights.\nOne tangible result of these meetings, in the social\narea, was the emergence of national coordinating bodies\nto implement the agreements signed. But these efforts are\nnot enough, given the tragic reality of most of the less\ndeveloped peoples, which means that the United Nations\nsystem must play an ever stronger role in the international\nsocial area. We must speed up the process of\nimplementation within the context of the United Nations\nand of the agreements that emerged from Rio de Janeiro,\nVienna, Cairo, Copenhagen, Beijing and Istanbul.\nThe first steps have now been taken within the\nvarious bodies of the system, particularly in the Economic\nand Social Council and its functional commissions. It is\nencouraging that the Economic and Social Council bodies\ndealing with sustainable development, women, social\ndevelopment and population have adopted multi-year\nagendas as a follow-up to the conferences.\nSimilarly, the agreements reached at the World\nSummit for Social Development include the decision to\nhold a special session of this Assembly in the year 2000\nto assess the implementation of the agreements.\nIn this connection, Chile wishes to propose the\nestablishment of a working group of this Assembly that,\nwith that special session as its basis, can provide follow-\nup to the six conferences, taking into account the Agenda\nfor Development, so that in the year 2000 the General\n7\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\nAssembly can take up a very wide-ranging and coordinated\nassessment of the implementation of the commitments of\nthe 1990s and make the necessary recommendations for\nfuture work.\nIn recent years Latin America has taken major steps\nforward with regard to free trade. This Assembly has\nalready heard about progress in the Southern Cone\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR), Chile's recent accession\nto that agreement and MERCOSUR\u2019s decision to negotiate\nsimilar agreements with the Andean Group and Mexico.\nTaken alongside the progress made by other subregional\ngroups, such as the Central America Common Market\n(CACM) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), these\nachievements all go to show the new impetus in Latin\nAmerica for integration based on economic ideas that differ\nfrom those of the past but that remain true to the political\nwill for unity that has always existed among our peoples.\nHowever, none of these regional developments in\nwhich Chile has been very active constitutes an alternative\nto multilateralism. Chile continues to believe that a\nmultilateral system to establish standards and practices to\nensure free trade throughout the world, with clear\ninstitutional machinery for negotiations and dispute\nsettlement, is the best option for the global economy and\nfor each of our countries.\nFor this reason we have always insisted that our\nnegotiations fit into the multilateral framework of the World\nTrade Organization (WTO). Latin America wants to be\nintegrated so that it can become more of a part of the\nglobal economy, not cut off from it. Our bilateral and\nregional agreements are based on open regionalism. The\nbest proof that this is being put into practice is that during\nthis period of increased integration, external tariffs in the\ncountries of our region have also fallen considerably,\ncompared with those of the rest of the world.\nOne of the most promising developments of recent\nyears has been the strengthening of the multilateral trade\nsystem through the establishment of the WTO. The\nexistence of a standing multilateral forum means that more\nenergy can be devoted to implementing the agreements\nreached and provides an institutional framework for\ncontinuous progress in negotiations and for opening up\nworld trade.\nIn this connection, Chile attaches great importance to\nthe follow-up meeting to the Uruguay Round, to be held in\nSingapore in December 1996. This, the first biannual\nmeeting in the framework of the WTO, will be crucial in\ndetermining how effective the new mechanism is.\nIn the last few years many regions and countries in\nthe world have made major progress towards broadening\nand consolidating democracy and respect for human\nrights. Latin America in particular has been experiencing\na rapid movement towards democracy that is\nunprecedented in its history. This is accompanied by a\nconsiderable increase in political dialogue and regional\ncoordination, evident mainly in the Rio Group, which has\nbeen active and fruitful for 10 years now.\nFar from making us complacent, this emphasizes our\nconcern that in many parts of the world there are still\nsituations of massive violation of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms. Sometimes these situations relate\nto the peace and security problems we mentioned earlier.\nAs democracies develop, the support given them by\nthe people depends more and more on their ability to\nensure stable, efficient and transparent governments. The\nlegitimacy of democratic governments is closely related\nto their accountability, but in many countries there is still\ncorruption, inefficiency and insensitivity to social needs.\nThis erodes the legitimacy of democracy and highlights\nits fragility.\nThe Government of our President, Eduardo Frei, has\nmade democratic governance the main subject of the sixth\nsummit of Ibero-American Heads of State and\nGovernment, to be held in Chile in November 1996. To\nthis end, we have enjoyed the valuable cooperation of the\nUnited Nations, through the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) and the United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). We hope\nthat our Organization's work in this area will spread to\nother regions in coming years.\nOne of the most dramatic changes for mankind in\nthe last few decades has been our awareness that nature\nis fragile in the hands of man. There is a vulnerability in\nnature we had not suspected until we saw the damage\ndone, much of it irreparable. And so there is a new\ndimension to human responsibility to nature. The\npossibility of altering life on our planet for the worse\nmeans that our unbounded scientific and technological\npower must be accompanied by a new principle: and that\nis the idea of shared responsibility.\nThe work facing us is hard, but the path was already\nlaid out in 1992 at the Conference on Environment and\n8\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\nDevelopment. In Rio de Janeiro there was agreement on\nfundamental aspects. On the basis of the consensus, and the\ncommitments reached there, my country is prepared to\nproceed. Since that Earth Summit, Chile has further\ndeveloped its environmental legislation. We have embraced\nthe principles of the Rio Declaration that we consider\nfundamental, such as preventing environmental pollution,\ncooperation and the primary responsibility of the polluter.\nThe State has accepted its obligation to adopt the most\nsuitable instruments for preventive environmental\nmanagement. But we also believe that society must be\ngiven a leading role in protecting the environment, and to\nthis end various social actors must be more committed and\nmore responsible.\nMy Government thinks it is also important to stress\nthe political commitment of the world community to this\nissue that is by nature international and in many respects\nglobal. Hence, we attach great importance to the\nfunctioning of the bodies set up and to the monitoring of\nthe agreements reached at the Earth Summit.\nDevelopments in the international arena, the increasing\ndiversity of issues to be taken up and the number of actors\ninvolved in the United Nations \u2014 all of this revitalizing the\nreform process of our Organization essential in order to\nadapt it to emerging realities and challenges. Integrated and\nmultidisciplinary focus must be given preference in dealing\nwith these problems. This constitutes the conceptual\nframework of the Organization and a basis for the urgently\nneeded process of reform. This requires a very thorough\nanalysis of the content of our multilateral work, of the\nOrganization's agenda, of the functioning of\nintergovernmental bodies, of our human and financial\nresources and of the structure of the Secretariat. By doing\nall that, we can carry out reforms that are more than\nrhetoric, that will enable us to take up the challenges of the\nnext century with policies and organizations adapted to the\nnew reality.\nChile wishes to reiterate its appreciation for the work\nbeing done by the Secretary-General in this area. In\ndifficult budgetary circumstances and facing a very difficult\npolitical situation, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has decisively\nbegun, within his purview, the process of reforming the\nOrganization.\nWe welcome all initiatives that can enhance the\nefficiency of our Organization, reduce its bureaucratic\nexcesses or alleviate its financial problems. But we believe\nthat United Nations reform should not be mistakenly\nidentified with one single issue of administration or\nbudgetary efficiency. There is quite a contradiction\nbetween saying that we need an Organization adapted to\nthe new challenges and focused on the next century, and\nthen reducing the practical debate simply to cost-cutting\nand better control of resources. We have to enhance\nadministrative efficiency, but we must also appreciate\nsubstantive effectiveness. Our objective should be to\nstrengthen the Organization as well as to streamline it.\nBefore concluding, I cannot fail to mention a\nquestion of reform on this year's agenda that is more\nurgent than it was in previous years. The plethora of\ndecisions taken by the Security Council has resulted in a\ngrowing desire on the part of the other Members of the\nUnited Nations to be more involved in Council decisions,\nso as to strengthen its legitimacy and the political support\nfor its actions.\nImproving the working methods of the Security\nCouncil has opened up additional ways of enhancing its\ncredibility. There has been progress, but much remains to\nbe done, particularly in connection with consultations with\ncountries that contribute troops to peacekeeping\noperations, consultations with countries neighbouring a\nconflict area that might be affected, and third States that\nare negatively affected by the application of sanctions.\nA second determining factor of legitimacy and\npolitical support for Council decisions relates to its\nmembership. In this connection, Chile believes it essential\nto resolve once and for all the problems of increasing the\nmembership of the Security Council, which have\nconcerned the Assembly since 1992. We think there is a\nbroad base of agreement for allowing Germany and Japan\nto become permanent members of the Council, and at the\nsame time for giving developing countries one permanent\nseat per region, the occupants of which would be elected\nat the regional level.\nAlso, in order to meet the need for representativity,\ngiven the great increase in membership of the United\nNations in the last decade, the number of non-permanent\nseats should be increased from 10 to 15, with appropriate\nequitable geographical distribution. A membership of\ntwenty-five members would not undermine the\neffectiveness of the Security Council but would enhance\nthe representativity of its actions.\nHowever, we wish to emphasize that Chile is willing\nto act with maximum flexibility here. This means we are\nwilling to consider other proposals by other Member\nStates that also seek to combine the two fundamental\n\nelements that should guide our decision: recognition of the\nnew international realities and a legitimate desire for\nrepresentativity in the principal bodies of our system.\nWe wished to touch upon those issues that, in Chile\u2019s\nview, will be the Organization\u2019s main tasks in the years to\ncome, with a view to establishing the framework of stability\nand legitimacy necessary to achieve United Nations\nobjectives. Chile commits its firm support to this difficult\nunderstanding, which will be attainable with the will and\nparticipation of all members of the international community.\n"

We hold his many contributions to\nthe work of the United Nations in very high regard and\nwe are convinced that his wisdom will guide this session\nof the General Assembly to a successful completion.\nI also take advantage of this occasion to thank\nProfessor Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal for his\nwise and dignified leadership of the General Assembly at\nits jubilee fiftieth session.\nThe first half-century of the United Nations has\nelapsed and the General Assembly is meeting at a time of\ngreat opportunities. Seldom has the United Nations\nenjoyed such a high level of freedom from friction in the\nrelations among the major Powers of the world.\nMoreover, our time is also one of profound and promising\nchange. Never before has the world been better equipped\nto seize the opportunities of economic and technological\ndevelopment for the benefit of all. The democratic\ntransformation which has taken place in large parts of the\nworld has substantially improved the quality of life and\nadded important opportunities for a large part of the\nworld\u2019s population.\nHowever, very serious problems persist. Poverty and\nsocial disintegration, environmental degradation and new\nforms of threat to international peace and security are\nserious dangers to our common future. The fact that our\nworld is no longer threatened by cold war rivalries offers\nlittle consolation if we think of the dangers which cast\ntheir shadows on our path towards the future. The unique\nopportunities of our time can be forfeited.\nNever before has the time been so precious and the\nneed for effective global action so clear. The United\nNations must be able to adjust so as to become more\neffective and more successful in addressing the challenges\nat hand. The essence of the principal task before the\nUnited Nations today can be captured in two words:\nadjustment and modernization. The compelling need to\nadjust and modernize the Organization should be guiding\nits activities, in particular those aiming at its reform.\nHowever, the United Nations experience of the\nreform efforts of the past year has not been entirely\nsatisfactory. The progress of various working groups of\n11\n\n\nthe General Assembly has been slow, a fact to be noted\nwith concern. The present session of the General Assembly\nand its general debate should provide fresh incentives and\nenergize the process of reform, which should proceed in a\ncoherent and balanced manner.\nThe process of downsizing the Secretariat, while being\nwelcome and necessary, should become part of a wider\nchange characterized by a clear definition of the priorities\nof the United Nations and by an adequate allocation of its\nhuman and material resources. Greater discipline must be\nachieved in the financing of the United Nations. This\nshould be accompanied by a new, more balanced scale of\nassessments. Furthermore, innovative forms of financing\nshould be devised, in particular in such domains as the\nprotection of environment and sustainable development.\nLast but not least, there is, in several parts of the United\nNations, a need for structural change. The necessary\nexpansion and reform of the Security Council \u2014 which\nincludes reasonable enlargement \u2014 is a case in point. It is\nobvious that the efforts at reform should go hand in hand\nwith the implementation of the basic tasks of the United\nNations.\nThe preservation of international peace and security is\nthe principal objective of the United Nations. One of the\nareas of implementation of this objective that is constantly\ngaining importance is cooperation between the United\nNations and regional organizations in the common efforts\nfor world peace. We see possibilities in different parts of\nthe world for the creation of durable security arrangements\nbased on regional organizations and their cooperation with\nthe United Nations.\nWe shall continue to support the efforts for\ncoordination and cooperation between the United Nations\nand regional organizations through such methods as\nincreased consultation, diplomatic support, mutual\noperational support and joint operations, in accordance with\nChapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations.\nIn Europe, the role of such regional organizations as\nthe European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope is constantly growing. We welcome and support the\ngrowing complementarity and cooperation between these\norganizations and the United Nations.\nDisarmament continues to be among the most\nimportant areas in which the role of the United Nations is\nfundamental. It can be said that, in recent years, the United\nNations has solidified its leading and coordinating role in\nthis area. The agreement on the non-proliferation of\nnuclear weapons achieved last year and the conclusion of\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention are witness to that.\nSlovenia welcomes the adoption of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which\nwe signed yesterday. Slovenia took an active approach\nfrom the very beginning to the CTBT negotiations. We\ndeeply believe that only strict implementation of the\nTreaty can contribute to a safer world in the future.\nThe interaction between the Conference on\nDisarmament and the relevant United Nations bodies has\nintensified. We should strive to improve further the\ndisarmament machinery. In this context, we note with\nregret that the project of expansion of the membership of\nthe Conference on Disarmament remains incomplete. We\ncontinue to believe that all States willing and able to\ncontribute to international disarmament efforts should be\nenabled to participate in the Conference on Disarmament\nas full members. Slovenia wishes to be and is capable of\nbeing among the members of the Conference.\nSlovenia also supports activities of the international\ncommunity needed to limit and eventually eliminate the\nuse of inhumane and excessively injurious weapons \u2014\nincluding anti-personnel landmines \u2014 and is ready to take\nan active part in these efforts.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, the process of return to\nnormality has started. Less than a year ago, Slovenia\njoined all the members of the international community in\nexpressing appreciation to the United States of America\nand all others involved in the preparation of the Dayton\nAgreement.\nAfter many years of tragically futile exercises, the\nmoment has come for a decisive step towards real peace\nin Bosnia and in the Balkans. The military action of the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization gave credibility to the\nwritten word and created conditions for a comprehensive\neffort to rebuild Bosnia and Herzegovina economically,\npolitically and socially. In Slovenia, we welcomed the\nholding of the presidential and parliamentarian elections\nwhich took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina 10 days ago\nas a positive step forward and as a substantial\ncontribution to peace and stability in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. Within the framework of post-conflict\nmanagement of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nthere is a growing need to ensure economic reconstruction\nand provide adequate economic aid. Slovenia is actively\nparticipating in the international efforts for the economic\n12\n\n\nreconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina and still hosts\nmany Bosnian refugees.\nSlovenia is a young country that obtained United\nNations membership in May 1992. Over the past five years\nof independence, Slovenia achieved positive results in the\nprocess of political and economic transformation. Growing\ncooperation with its neighbours and in the region enabled\nSlovenia to reach a high degree of economic and political\nstability. We strongly believe that such a policy is to be\nobserved as a contribution to the sustainable stability of the\nregion.\nAfter a successful transformation, Slovenia is now\nready to take its share of responsibility not only for\nregional arrangements, but also for international peace and\nstability. That is why Slovenia seeks to become a Security\nCouncil member for the 1998-1999 term: to participate\nactively in the Council\u2019s central role in developing an\neffective system of global security at a time when the\nSecurity Council faces significant challenges to international\npeace and security. We firmly believe that Slovenia is able\nto meet all expectations and to work with other member\nStates so as to make a full contribution to fulfilling the\ndemanding tasks of the Security Council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Lithuanian\nGovernment, allow me to warmly congratulate Mr. Razali\nIsmail on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at this session.\n20\n\n\nThis session marks the fifth anniversary of the re-\nentrance of Lithuania into the international community of\nstates. Five years ago, Lithuania was admitted to the United\nNations. At that time, the Organization, its Member States\nand the peoples of the world saw the chance to seize\nhistoric opportunities created by the new international\nsituation, with its promise of peace and stability.\nThe past five years leave no doubt that some of these\nopportunities have been taken in a positive way. We have\nseen that the highest levels of cooperation are possible, both\ninternationally and regionally. The destinies of different\npeoples around the world have been linked as never before\nby the globalization of the world economy and the\ninformation superhighway.\nBut many cross-border issues, such as crime, drugs,\nenvironmental pollution and terrorism, pose a major\nchallenge to us not only as individual nation-States, but as\na family of nations as well. These global challenges have\nfar-reaching implications for the world Organization.\nOriginally, the United Nations was entrusted with the\ntask of ensuring world harmony. Is it no less vital today to\nmaintain and promote this worldwide policy, as designed by\nthe founders of the United Nations? My answer is in the\npositive.\nFor this reason, we need an Organization that can be\nmore responsive to the demands of Member States, and\nMember States that act responsibly by setting realistic goals\nand providing the resources needed for their\nimplementation.\nDuring these past five years, Lithuania has progressed\npolitically and economically. Our relations with\nneighbouring States are friendly and mutually beneficial,\nthus ensuring a secure and stable environment in the region.\nWe are in the process of becoming integrated into European\nand transatlantic structures. Negotiations on accession to the\nWorld Trade Organization are well-advanced, ties with our\nneighbours that are members of the Central European Free\nTrade Agreement are gaining strength. The most valuable\ncooperation is being advanced with Nordic countries, the\nEuropean Union and the North Atlantic Alliance. These\ndimensions of cooperation have been fruitfully applied in\nother structures as well. Cooperation with the European\nUnion on core United Nations issues \u2014 humanitarian\naffairs, human rights, peacekeeping, structural and financial\nreforms \u2014 and with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nin the Implementation Force mission is the best example.\nWe are striving to deepen and broaden this cooperation.\nThe global challenges before us require the\ncommitment of Member States to the goals enshrined in\nthe United Nations Charter and call for structural and\ninstitutional reform of the Organization. We have begun\nthe reform aimed at streamlining the functions of the\nUnited Nations and rendering its institutional structure\nmore effective and flexible to deal with tasks which\nsometimes cannot be foreseen in advance. We must bear\nin mind that the future Organization can be only as\neffective as its Member States desire it to be.\nFirst, it goes without saying that we must put the\nUnited Nations on a sound financial footing and\nstrengthen its capacity to fulfil its vital tasks. We support\nthe proposals put forward by the European Union in this\nregard. A realigned scale of assessments, annual revision\nof the scale, phasing out the scheme of limits, lowering\nthe assessment floor and swift implementation of the\nproposals in practice would be the tools to overcome the\nfinancial crisis and would certainly be an incentive for\nMembers to regularize payments.\nLithuania remains committed to its financial\nobligations to the Organization. We also reiterate our\nfundamental belief that the scale of assessments must\nreflect the capacity to pay. At a time when many\ncountries, Lithuania included, are undergoing budgetary\nadjustments and reviews, sound management of the\nresources of the United Nations takes on added\nimportance.\nSecondly, we believe that the functioning of United\nNations decision-making bodies must be improved. The\nSecurity Council makes decisions that are binding on all\nMember States and influences the lives of millions. It is\nthus essential to make the Council more representative of\nthe world as it is today. More specifically, Lithuania has\ncalled for increasing the representational capacity of the\nSecurity Council in both categories of membership. The\nGovernment of Lithuania recognizes that developing\ncountries have a case for improving their representation.\nWe also recognize that some countries, such as Germany\nand Japan, can make a special contribution and that they\nare ready to assume special political, military and\nfinancial responsibility as new permanent members. In\nour view, due consideration should also be given to the\naspirations to an additional non-permanent seat of the\ncountries of Eastern Europe, whose numbers have tripled\nin recent years. We hope for agreement on the reform of\nthe Security Council. Lithuania supports proposals to this\nend and encourages stronger movement by States towards\nnegotiations on the implementation of reform.\n21\n\n\nIn terms of a comprehensive reform of the United\nNations system, any such reform is likely to fail if there is\nno clear vision of its objectives and of the strategies for\npursuing them. A stark reassessment of the mission and\nmandates is included in the United Nations medium-term\nplan for 1998-2001. We consider it to be a good basis for\ndebate on the enhancement of the United Nations and for\nstrengthening its capacity to face new emerging challenges.\nLithuania, striving to make its contribution to\ninternational cooperation in the maintenance of security and\nstability, is determined to continue to improve the skills of\nits peacekeepers, civilian police monitors and military\nobservers and will offer them to the United Nations in the\nservice of peacekeeping operations. Lithuania, in\ncooperation with Estonia and Latvia, and also with Poland,\nis advancing the development of joint peacekeeping units,\nan exercise which in itself is a testimony to ultimate\nunderstanding and cooperation between countries.\nThe costs and scope of United Nations peacekeeping\noperations have proliferated dramatically since 1990. One\nof the best ways to reduce this proliferation, and more\nparticularly to prevent human suffering, is to implement\nmany of the proposals put forward by the Secretary-General\nin his \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d, especially in terms of\nresolving disputes before violence breaks out.\nUnited Nations intervention too often comes too\nslowly and too late under very difficult circumstances.\nLacking resources, the Secretary-General is sometimes\nexpected to maintain peace where there is no will to\nmaintain peace. We feel that the emphasis needs to be\nplaced on strengthening the United Nations system\u2019s\npreventive capacity. We may need to adopt the\nmultidimensional approach to the concept of security,\nmobilize the United Nations system in order to prevent\nexisting disputes from escalating into conflict, and attack\nthe problem at its very roots.\nLithuania welcomes measures to strengthen the United\nNations administrative structures in charge of peacekeeping\noperations. The experience of the past few years leads us to\nbelieve that we need to explore non-traditional approaches\nto conflict prevention and resolution, including the\nOrganization\u2019s rapid response capability. While the demand\nin this domain still seems to be more than the United\nNations is equipped for, the burden-sharing of peacekeeping\nwith other regional organizations has to prevent the eruption\nof a severe crisis. The complexity of the maintenance of\npeace and security should not be solely a United Nations\nenterprise. In Europe, we have the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, which operates in\naccordance with agreed principles and is engaged in\nactivities to help parties to resolve disputes without\nrecourse to fighting.\nLithuania believes that any strategy for preventing\narmed conflicts also involves pursuing tangible\ndisarmament objectives, especially in the areas of nuclear\nnon-proliferation and the control of conventional arms.\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty now\nready for signature can be considered one of the historic\ndecisions of this decade. Today, I signed the Treaty on\nbehalf of the Republic of Lithuania. I believe this tangible\nachievement of humankind should fuel international\nefforts to take further effective measures towards nuclear\ndisarmament.\nA major challenge immediately ahead is the\nmaintenance of multilateral disarmament and non-\nproliferation efforts. We must find a key to freeze the\nproduction and development of weapons of mass\ndestruction. The adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty should set the tone for the disarmament\nprocess which will be accompanied by the Convention on\nthe Prohibition of the Development, Production,\nStockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their\nDestruction. We must cope with new nuclear challenges,\nsuch as nuclear leakage, smuggling of fissile materials,\nfailures in nuclear-custody systems and the potential\nthreat of nuclear terrorism.\nMoreover, the dangerously widespread use of\nconventional weapons undermines all attempts at the\npeaceful solution to conflicts. Sometimes, as in the case\nof land-mines, the deadly consequences persist for many\nyears, causing human suffering and resulting in enormous\ncosts. The growing support for banning the production of\nand trade in anti-personnel land-mines is one way to\ncorrect this problem.\nPeace and development are closely linked and\ndevelopment is a multifaceted process. Revitalization of\nthe United Nations in economic, social and related fields,\nand interaction between the United Nations and other\nmultilateral development institutions, including the\nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\nOrganization, should be addressed to better structure the\nOrganization for serving peoples\u2019 development needs.\nSustainable development must be based on participatory\ndemocracy and respect for human rights.\n22\n\n\nDemocratization must take hold inside a State and\nshould extend to the international community. The process\nof democratization cannot be separated from the protection\nof human rights. We will continue to support United\nNations programmes aimed at promoting a democratic\nculture and at consolidating new or re-established\ndemocracies.\nHumanitarian assistance efforts face the challenge of\nresponding to humanitarian crises that have increased both\nin number and complexity. United Nations programmes\ncould complement other initiatives already in place and\nshould be expanded in those fields where collective action\nis required, such as in comprehensive reconstruction and\nrehabilitation of war-ravaged areas.\nAlthough the merits of the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees in facilitating\nsolutions to acute migration problems are evident, some\ntendencies are cause for concern. The international\ncommunity needs updated approaches in resolution and\nprevention policy. The Conference on Refugees and\nMigrants in the Commonwealth of Independent States and\nneighbouring countries, held in Geneva in May 1996, was\na step towards action on a regional level. We hope that\ncountries will adhere to the Programme of Action, in\nparticular those provisions concerning illegal migration.\nWe are in favour of strengthening mechanisms to\nmonitor and protect human rights, especially in conflict\nsituations. When these rights are seriously violated despite\nall efforts to the contrary, we are in favour of turning to\njudicial recourse. For this reason, we support the creation\nof an international criminal court for the adjudication of all\nhuman rights violations, wherever they may occur.\nOne of the greatest challenges stymieing the efforts of\nthe international community to ensure sustainable\ndevelopment and democracy is transnational crime. This\noften takes the form of illicit sales of arms and drugs, illicit\ntrafficking in people, child prostitution and other crimes. No\nsingle country is able to cope with well-organized and well-\nfinanced criminal structures. We deem that efficient anti-\nmoney-laundering measures can be among the best tools to\nundermine the economic roots of the criminal world.\nThe window of opportunity for greater international\ncooperation is wider than at any time since 1945. We must\nseize the moment if international cooperation is to take a\ndecisive step forward. A reformed and streamlined United\nNations, concentrating on the tasks entrusted to it in the\nCharter, can make considerable progress towards fulfilling\nthe high expectations we place in it today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe course of history appears to unwind rapidly\nand with it, events occur, pass or recede into time,\nimbuing the lives of our societies with the dual sensation\nof dizzying progress and desperately slow evolution. It is\nessential for people to live in harmony and to face, with\na feeling of unity, goodwill and sharing, the great\nchallenges which they could not overcome alone. That is\nwhy we are gathered here. We believe that, without each\nother, we are weak and vulnerable and that, in order to\nlive better, it is essential that we be able to share and\nwork together.\nUpon reflection, however, it becomes more and more\nclear that some of the countries that are developing more\nrapidly, thanks to the advantages of technological and\nscientific progress, are losing interest in those still\nstruggling to survive and still facing economic difficulties,\nfood shortages and problems of health and education. To\nall this can be added other, equally serious evils: the\neffects of drugs, alcoholism, criminal behaviour and\nprostitution in all its forms.\nIn our international forums we often speak of\nsecurity, of action to combat international terrorism and\nof the war on organized crime. Just recently, we were\ntalking about working together against paedophilia. These\nare such horrible, painful things, but unfortunately so\ncharacteristic of our times.\nSo how can we not strongly condemn these attacks\non human security and dignity? But it is even more\nimportant that our rejection of these crimes affecting the\nworld be felt with the same degree of intensity, regardless\nof the country where they are committed \u2014 especially\n18\n\n\nwhen some countries lack the means to combat the crimes.\nShould not the spirit of solidarity imply a concern for the\nwell-being and security of all the inhabitants of the world?\nShould not each and every nation shed its selfish,\nhypocritical attitudes?\nBy not seeing further than our own interests, we treat\nothers as our lowly tools. And yet we are well aware that\nfeelings of frustration and injustice are the source of so\nmuch violence which so frequently plunges the world into\nmourning and makes people fear for their security.\nTherefore, if we want to world to develop harmoniously,\nwe must break the bonds of this indolent selfishness in\nwhich people see everything around them through the prism\nof self-satisfaction.\nIf the existence of the United Nations is now\nthreatened and if serious problems are undermining it and\nweakening the international community, it is precisely\nbecause the strongest partners will not agree to adopt the\nrules that govern any family, in which everyone\u2019s opinions\nare heard and discussed and the strong support and help the\nweak.\nInstead, what do we observe? The most-favoured\nnations seem to carry little about and refuse resolutely to\naddress the realities handicapping the developing countries.\nCalculations, assessments, criteria are separated into\ncategories, mechanically, as if nations and peoples can be\nreduced to mere statistics. It must be said that the generous\nefforts of some rich countries, while helping developing\ncountries, also benefit, one way or another, directly and\nindirectly, the stingiest countries.\nAre we still seeking justice, equality and sustainable\ndevelopment throughout the world? In any case, the image\nthe world projects of itself does not reflect these ideals, but\nrather two poles spinning further and further apart: the pole\nof wealth and the pole of poverty. It\u2019s not that there has\nbeen a lack of international meetings, at the highest levels,\nto try to find more effective solutions to reduce the level of\npoverty, increase the equity of trade and so forth. But it\nseems that, with each meeting, these problems get worse.\nThe firm ground of progress is crumbling under the\nfeet of the developing countries and their future \u2014 given\ntheir current relations with the Powers holding the reins of\nthe global economy \u2014 seems quite uncertain. This is\nespecially true for the small island developing States like\nthe Seychelles, whose only resources are the precarious\nrevenues of tourism, which is subject to so many\nvicissitudes, and fishing. Their meagre resources, pumped\ninto a network of tremendous competition, require them\nto make titanic efforts. Like many other countries whose\nterritories were long exploited by a great Power and then\nsuffered the repercussions of being suddenly abandoned\nwithout compensation, the Seychelles\u2019 economy is even\nmore vulnerable than it was before being buffeted by this\nphenomenon.\nAs they do every year, many speakers have\nunderscored the importance of preserving the environment\nin the context of sustainable development. The President\nof the United States himself underscored this fact:\n(spoke in English)\n\u201cOur planet is safer because of our common efforts\nto close Chernobyl, to address the challenges of\nclimate change, to protect the world\u2019s forests and\noceans. Now we must uphold our duty as custodians\nof our environment so that our children will inherit\nan even healthier planet.\u201d (Official Records of the\nGeneral Assembly, Fifty-first Session, Plenary\nMeetings, 6th meeting, p. 14)\n(spoke in French)\nAnd, at the annual meeting of the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, United States Vice-President Albert Gore Jr.\nalso made this point.\n(spoke in English)\n\u201cBut it also means giving greater attention to\nbroad issues that I firmly believe must shape and\ninform everything we do in our quest for equitable\nand sustainable global prosperity. The first of these\nis a commitment to sustainable development and our\nenvironment. We now know with perfect clarity that\neconomic development and growth cannot ignore\necological realities. We know that investments that\ngenuinely reduce poverty in an equitable and\nenduring way are investments that take their\nenvironmental implications fully into account. Not\nonly is such an approach consistent with our\ndevelopment objectives, but it will also be much\nmore cost effective. Win-win situations are not\nalways available, but this is one of them and it is\navailable.\u201d\n(spoke in French)\n19\n\n\nAnd yet, many of our countries, although their survival\ndepends on the entire world preserving the environment,\nfind themselves left by the wayside when certain great\nPowers \u2014 having no further need of the hospitality of their\nshores for their military or other installations \u2014 light-\nheartedly depart, leaving behind them a trail of debris and\nother things and leaving it up to the countries themselves to\ndo the rest. As for the damages and costs \u2014 let\u2019s not talk\nabout them.\nAs for the reforms of the institutions of the United\nNations system, the Seychelles is in favour of all proposals\naimed at improving the representation of the smaller States\nin our work. We believe that the international community\nmust hear our voices, understand us and deal with the\nspecifics of our situation. Furthermore, to be more\nobjective, the assessment criteria now being massively\napplied to all the developing countries, which require more\nfocused attention, should be re-examined in the light of the\nvulnerability index. The index is too easily ignored, but is\nnonetheless very important in the establishment of the\nobjective data defining the profile of any given country.\nThe fashion for what is commonly called \u201cdemocracy\u201d\nis sweeping the surface of the earth, and one of the\nprincipal criteria which the developed countries \u2014\ndemocracy\u2019s self-appointed guarantors \u2014 use for deciding\neligibility for development assistance is the establishment\nof a democratic system. Shouldn\u2019t that respectable\ninstitution, democracy, be manifest within the Organization\nitself when it elects a competent and honest leader in whom\nto duly vest its authority? In seeking to impose its logic by\none way or another, in seeking to make its choice the\nmajority\u2019s choice, we are far from honouring the principle\non which democracy is founded: majority rule. In other\nwords, for a matter such as the renewal of the mandate of\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, we should better\ngauge the pros and cons, leaving aside those which may\nseem a little too individualistic. We must be able to accept,\nparticularly if qualifications justify it, the choice of the\nmajority of the Members of this eminently democratic\ninstitution: the United Nations.\nTo conclude, I express my best wishes for greater\nconcord in the future of the United Nations, which\nrepresents the voice and the will of the peoples of the\nworld, so that the endeavour to which so much effort and\ngenerosity has been devoted may produce decisions and\nactions that will create for all the children, women and men\nof the Earth a way of life in which relations become more\nhumane and thus more conducive to the advent of a\nharmonious global society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, allow me,\nSir, to convey to you and to this Assembly the greetings\nand congratulations of the Peruvian people, as well as\ntheir best wishes and hopes for the future.\nPeru is a country that has successfully dealt with its\ndomestic contradictions, and which is looking with vision\nand determination towards the broad new horizons of\ninternational activity. A careful review of what has been\nachieved to date reveals that much remains to be done;\nbut it also shows that we are following the right course in\naddressing the demands of our times.\nHowever, it would be superficial to use this\nAssembly, whose central theme is the reform of the\nUnited Nations, to recapitulate the events of the past year.\nWe must wake up to the outcome of a long historical\nprocess that has accelerated markedly over the last quarter\nof a century and established around the world a network\nof international organizations that today exceed the\nnumber of States. We must also wake up to a fortunate\nnew development: the individual human being has\nacquired a position of cardinal importance in the\ninternational system.\nThe organizations established by States to satisfy\ninternational, human and regional needs, have acquired a\npermanent character and have created new systems of\ninternational relations. When we speak today of reforming\nthe United Nations, no one fails to acknowledge that new\nmechanisms are required to promote greater development\nand economic and social stability in the world, and to\nface current and future conflicts between and within\nStates.\nThere is discussion of the possibility of creating a\nnew economic council and a new social council, as well\nas expanding and strengthening the Security Council. At\nthe same time, the need has emerged to transform and\nrationalize the United Nations system, together with the\nimperative of resolving the Organization\u2019s financial crisis.\nBut in order to carry out those reforms, we need to have\na clear-sighted appreciation of the international scene and\nto adapt the Organization to that reality, so that we can\nachieve a fruitful and forward-looking perspective. It is\nnecessary for States, in the framework of the United\nNations system, to overcome their traditional activities\nand jointly engage in tasks to deal with those new\nrealities so as to achieve broader representation and\nfunctionality, with the possibility of future growth.\n13\n\n\nWhen the United Nations was founded in 1945, at the\nend of the Second World War, international relations were\ndifferent from today. The end of the cold war and the\nrealities of regional integration have made necessary a new\nvision of the relationship between State sovereignty and the\nsupra-national realities of the international system. Huge\nsocial and economic challenges make it necessary for us to\npersevere in pursuing the purposes and principles of the\nCharter, to strengthen diplomatic action, and not to\nsuccumb to arbitrary interpretations of international legality,\nwhich undermine the indispensable primacy of international\nlaw.\nToday the inadequacy of the nation State is more\nevident than ever, and the appreciation of supranational\nstructures is more widespread than in the past. We discard\nthe simplistic visions of pure internationalism, but we\nuphold the validity, of the entities that are active today\nalongside or above State sovereignty. The vitality of the\nAndean Common Market, the Southern Cone Common\nMarket (MERCOSUR) and the European Union shows us\na future of common and vigorous legal international\narrangements. We are facing the definitive crisis of\nnationalism, if not of full legal competence of the nation\nState. International law today appears as the only\nframework of standards with which to face the new\nrealities.\nThere can be no doubt that the nuclear reality was one\nof the factors that transformed the traditional concept of the\nnation State. The ability to foresee its results has made the\ndecision to accept war more exceptional, and non-atomic\narmies have adhered to broader, supranational military\norganizations. Atomic weapons have abolished the\nimpermeability of the nation State.\nWe are likewise faced with a crisis of the very\nconcept of borders. Traditionally, empires thought of\nthemselves only in terms of being an extension of their\nborders. Today borders are not an obstacle to integration.\nHowever, this does not imply that we are building a\nuniversal State, a global \u201ccosmocracy\u201d. There are natural\nlimits to the territorial applicability of laws, and it is true\nthat the concentration of power has unbreachable limits,\nbeyond which it cannot go. Accordingly, history has so far\nnot led us to a universal State, but rather to a freer\nstructure, a complex political pluralism with a common\ngeneral foundation of representative democracy, individual\nliberties and economic freedom. We are facing new,\nfunctionally limited supra-statal powers, with different\narrangements that differ in scope and intensity and that are\nsuperimposed upon the system of State borders.\nThe modern theory of the State forged by\nMachiavelli and Bodin, the concept of the State as an\nabsolute power that excludes any other power, is today\nfading. For more than 20 years States have recognized\nforces superior to themselves. The idea of the unlimited\nsovereign State has broken down; the linchpin of the\nwhole theory of the modern State has broken down.\nToday sovereignty continues to exist, but not as unlimited\npolitical power, but rather as full constitutional legal\ncompetence. That seventeenth-century concept that\ninspired the Peace of Westphalia, cuius regio eius religio\n\u2014 that each State should have a religion \u2014 has been left\nbehind. This is more apparent than ever at the end of the\ncold war, when the secular beliefs that confronted the\nworld have been discarded. Today the cohesion of human\nsocieties is governed by universal concepts.\nThe new reality leads us to assert that State\nsovereignty has already been made subject to international\nlaw \u2014 and, it can be said, to natural law \u2014 thus negating\nthe theoretical legitimacy of the State that was born with\nthe modern age. This in no way means that there is no\nlonger a need for patriotism, the concept of fatherland or\nnational histories. It means, instead, that the myth of the\nnationalist State has collapsed.\nIn a truly human breakthrough and not a purely\ntechnological one, all moral values today are reduced to\ntheir personal roots. Today, neither Governments nor the\ngoverned can shirk the ethical imperatives that rule\nequally over their public and private conduct. This is due\nboth to the process just outlined and to a wholly new and\nfar-reaching technological revolution in mass\ncommunications.\nThe law of nations was at first a principle of\ncommercial intercourse. It later came to apply to only one\nkind of actor: the nation State. Today, an open functional\nregionalism is bringing about far-reaching changes that\nare swiftly altering the existing order, and the United\nNations would be ill-advised to disregard that new reality\nin strengthening the Security Council and reforming its\ninstitutions.\nThis is the cornerstone upon which the United\nNations should be re-founded, now that the circumstances\nof power which governed its life at the close of the\nSecond World War and during the cold war have been\novercome. We should not lose sight of the fact that,\nalthough the act of consent that forged this new, open,\nfunctional regionalism was the work of the nation State,\ntoday that regionalism is already a supranational reality\n14\n\n\nthat has taken on a life of its own and is spreading around\nthe world. Inter-statal balances of power are giving way to\nregional balances of power that are not concentrated in a\nsingle focal point of power and that are more decentralized\nand more rational.\nThe future will be one in which an international\nsystem with freer and more flexible structures will be based\non the freedom of man as an individual, as a person. This\nobliges States, within the framework of the United Nations\nsystem, to go beyond their traditional activities and jointly\nengage in management activities in the Organization based\non the new cultural, economic and geographical reality\nmade up of broad functional regional areas. I say once\nagain: this is the keystone of the foundation of the new\nedifice of the United Nations.\nI have come here to reiterate the commitment of Peru\nand of the Peruvian people to the United Nations, but also\nto warn that the new realities that must not be ignored.\nThose realities have guided the policy of President Alberto\nFujimori and are the inspiration for his Government\u2019s\nfar-reaching and successful reform. Peru, in its continental\nrelations, today bases its foreign policy upon the principles\nof open functional regionalism and strives to link the\nPacific with the Atlantic through supranational\narrangements.\nRooted in its rich Latin-American heritage, my country\nsees its future in continental terms, drawing upon Latin\nAmerica\u2019s important contribution in the area of integration,\ninternational law and mechanisms for peace and security.\nAccordingly, we are convinced that organizational changes\nin the United Nations should be based on those same\nprinciples.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to extend my\ndelegation\u2019s sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-first session. It is with great pleasure that I assure you\nof Lesotho\u2019s support and cooperation as you conduct the\ndeliberations of this body. Let me also take this opportunity\nto pay special tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Diogo\nFreitas do Amaral, for the skilful manner in which he\nguided the work of the historic session of the General\nAssembly last year. My delegation truly appreciates his\nleadership and his tireless dedication to the heavy\nresponsibilities entrusted to him during the past year.\nI also take this opportunity to express our satisfaction\nwith the sterling work that the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has been doing under the very\ndifficult conditions of reduced financial resources. Were it\nnot for his tenacity, our Organization would not have been\nable to hold together as it has done.\nThe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations last year provided an opportunity for\nreflection about the global mission of our Organization. We\nretraced our past and took stock of the failures and notable\nsuccesses that the United Nations had engraved in the\nhistoric record of half a century of its existence. We also\nlooked ahead with renewed determination, resolved to\ncreate for mankind a future that would be brighter than the\npast, amidst the euphoria of hope and expectation in the\nnew international order that is still emerging from the ashes\nof the cold war.\nEven as we did so, we were aware how great the\npotential was for a relapse to the pitfalls of past years and\nfor the re-emergence of complacencies that could render\nour new hopes and expectations vain and futile. A\ndeliberate effort is required on the part of the international\ncommunity to build on the past experiences of our\nOrganization and to identify and reinforce the positive\ntrends that the end of the cold war era has yielded.\nThe first half-century was characterized by cold-war\nconflicts, the struggle against colonialism, the constant\nthreat of a nuclear holocaust and the fight against\napartheid. All these are either behind us or considerably\nabated. Our attention must remain focused on how we can\ngive the twenty-first century a United Nations equipped\nto serve as an effective instrument in the evolving global\nenvironment for the attainment of the noble goals\nenshrined in its Charter.\nA universal consensus for the reform and\nrevitalization of the United Nations was highlighted in the\nsolemn Declaration that was adopted in this very Hall a\nyear ago by, inter alia, 128 world Heads of State and\nGovernment. The momentum for the realization of that\naspiration and for the implementation of the commitments\nthat were made by the world community should not be\nlost. The actions and the path that we have to take are\nknown to all of us.\nWe would like to see a more democratized United\nNations, whose credibility and legitimacy are enhanced by\nthe representativeness of its structures.\nWe have identified the need for measures to ensure\ngreater consultation between the Security Council and the\nGeneral Assembly, particularly on crisis situations, and\nthe need to restore the role and authority of the General\nAssembly in the decision-making processes of our\nOrganization, without compromising the speed with which\nthe Security Council may take its decisions.\nWe have cautioned against regional selectivity in the\nattention paid by our Organization to international crisis\nsituations and have advocated a demonstration of good\nfaith and the upholding of the principle of the sanctity of\nhuman life in the enforcement of United Nations\nresolutions.\nWe have also stood in favour of exploring a new,\nbalanced formula for equitable burden-sharing, as well as\nfor a renewed commitment on the part of all Member\nStates to fulfil their financial obligations to the United\nNations in full and on time, just as we have joined in the\ncall to effect economies and improve efficiency through\nthe transformation of the management techniques within\nthe United Nations system.\n14\n\n\nThe events and experiences we have witnessed since\nthe last session of the Assembly once again present us with\nmixed signals. On the one hand, we have seen a steady\nexpansion of the frontiers of peace, tolerance and\ndemocracy, while, on the other, some problems that are\nrooted in the past not only have persisted but have been\ncompounded by new challenges arising from the evolving\ninternational environment.\nThanks to the efforts of the international community,\nthe carnage in the former Yugoslavia has been brought to\nan end. However, a conscious effort is still required to give\npermanence to the positive trends that are still evolving in\nBosnia and to suppress the ever present risk that the peace\ndividends already gained can be reversed.\nIn the Middle East uncertainty and the new obstacles\nthat have emerged in the path of a negotiated peace have\nthrown new doubts over the prospects for an early\nrestoration to the Palestinian people of their inalienable\nright to self-determination and statehood. We appeal to both\nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority to adhere in good faith\nto the provisions of the peace agreements they have\nconcluded and to implement them within the agreed time-\nframe, pursuant to the Declaration of Principles they signed\nin Washington in 1993.\nThe prerequisite for peace remains the withdrawal of\nIsrael and the cessation of the establishment of new Israeli\nsettlements in the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories,\nin compliance with the resolutions of the United Nations.\nIn Western Sahara recent developments have\ndemonstrated that peace in that area remains elusive. How\nlong will the will of the Saharan people for self-\ndetermination and independence be frustrated? The\nwithdrawal of the United Nations Mission for the\nReferendum in Western Sahara in May of this year due to\nthe lack of cooperation by the parties raises a real prospect\nfor a resumption of violence. The international community\nmust act now to reverse the tragic trends and to persuade\nthe parties to cooperate in the implementation of the United\nNations plan for the independence of Western Sahara.\nIn Burundi, Liberia and Somalia the situation\nregrettably continues to defy the efforts of the international\ncommunity to restore peace and stability. We appeal to the\ninternational community to support the current initiatives\nspearheaded by the Organization of African Unity and the\nneighbouring countries of Burundi aimed at protecting\ndemocracy in that country.\nLesotho shares Africa\u2019s deep disappointment at the\ndemonstrable lack of interest on the part of the\ninternational community in extending the necessary\nmaterial support to the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group\n(ECOMOG) countries that are engaged in the regional\npeacekeeping effort in Liberia. This, regrettably, calls into\nquestion the world\u2019s commitment to the universality of\nthe sanctity of human life.\nDespite the remaining hotbeds of instability,\nfortunately all is not doom and gloom in Africa, even in\nthe area of conflict resolution. The major strides that have\nbeen made in southern Africa to free the subregion of\nconflicts is a source of great satisfaction. If the\nmomentum for peace is kept in Angola, there is no doubt\nthat a subregion long associated with conflicts will have\nestablished durable peace and stability. The\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol \u2014 particularly the\nestablishment of a unified army and the formation of the\nGovernment of National Unity \u2014 are within reach, and\nwith more concerted action by the international\ncommunity should soon be attained.\nThroughout southern Africa, political stability, peace,\ndemocracy and human rights continue to be deepened.\nMultiparty general elections are being held, and other\npolitical and constitutional reforms are being put in place\nto ensure transparency and predictability, especially in the\nelectoral systems.\nThe establishment by the Southern African\nDevelopment Community of the Organ on Politics,\nDefence and Security reaffirms the region\u2019s resolve to\nconsolidate the gains that have been bequeathed by the\ndemise of apartheid and to face head-on the challenges of\npeace and democracy.\nThese measures have contributed to the strong\nperformance registered by the national economies of\nsouthern Africa in 1995, as well as to the improvement in\nthe overall investment climate of the region. We hope that\nthe international community will continue to assist\nsouthern Africa in its reconstruction efforts, particularly\nby encouraging the flow of private investment as a\ncontribution to the regional efforts for the economic\nrecovery of the subcontinent.\nThe past 12 months have presented the world with\ngreat opportunities for the attainment of durable peace.\nYet, I regret to say, we have sometimes failed to take\nadvantage of them. A scourge that has stalked humankind\n15\n\n\nfor the past 50 years has been the growth in the arsenal of\narmaments, especially nuclear ones. Last year, in a historic\nachievement, the nations of the world agreed to extend\nindefinitely the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons. In doing so they undertook to achieve a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty by September of this year.\nIt is with unbounded joy that we are able to stand here\ntoday and say that that goal has been attained. To be sure,\nit was not attained with ease, but the fact that it was\nachieved is a source of great encouragement that\nhumankind is slowly but surely moving towards the total\nelimination of nuclear weapons. Although Lesotho shares\nthe view that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT) that was adopted here in New York last month is\nnot perfect, we regard it as a giant step forward that will\nserve to put the nuclear-weapon States on notice that the\nrest of the international community is serious about its\naspiration to a nuclear-free world.\nIn spite of the fact that the cold war has ended and\nthat the START Treaties have been concluded, tens of\nthousands of nuclear weapons are still deployed by nuclear\nStates, and there is a very real possibility that many more\nStates could develop such weapons.\nWorldwide opposition to weapons of mass destruction\nhas resulted in Conventions banning biological and\nchemical weapons, but as yet there are no concrete\nproposals to negotiate a similar convention to outlaw\nnuclear weapons. The fact that nuclear weapons are not\nprohibited by convention weakens the willingness of many\nnon-nuclear States to abide by the Biological Weapons\nConvention and the Chemical Weapons Convention. These\nStates perceive an imbalance in the retention of certain\ntypes of weapons of mass destruction by some States,\nmostly States of the North, while other weapons of mass\ndestruction, often held by States of the South \u2014 are\nbanned.\nLesotho believes that the proliferation of nuclear-\nweapons technology and the manufacture of nuclear\nweapons constitute a very serious problem which the\ninternational community cannot and must not ignore.\nThe fact that only a handful of people have been\nbrought to justice for the millions of crimes against\nhumanity and the serious violations of humanitarian law\ncommitted since the end of the Second World War has not\naltered the international community\u2019s view that perpetrators\nof international crimes should be tried and punished for\ntheir acts. More recently, the growing global outrage against\ninternational crimes has been demonstrated by the\ncreation of the two ad hoc International Tribunals for the\nprosecution of crimes in the former Yugoslavia and in\nRwanda. These Tribunals were established by the Security\nCouncil to have jurisdiction over the most heinous crimes\nin the world: genocide, other crimes against humanity and\nserious violations of humanitarian law.\nIt is therefore a matter of concern that since their\ninception both Tribunals have been plagued by inadequate\nand short-term financing and have not received adequate\nbudgets from this Assembly. It is also a matter of concern\nthat very few Member States have enacted legislation\npermitting effective cooperation with the Tribunals.\nThe international community must send a clear\nmessage to those who commit genocide and other crimes\nagainst humanity that they cannot escape to fully account\nfor their actions before international law. We can do this\nby providing the much-needed support and resources to\nenable the ad hoc International Tribunals to bring to\njustice those who are responsible for atrocities both in\nBosnia and in Rwanda.\nAlthough Lesotho has not yet promulgated\nimplementation legislation for the Tribunals, it remains\ncommitted to fully cooperating with the two Tribunals in\naccordance with the provisions of Security Council\nresolutions. We hope that the international community can\nbuild on the experiences and the already noteworthy\nsuccess achieved by these Tribunals to pursue the project\nof the establishment of a permanent international criminal\ncourt.\nWhile we recognize the important work of the\nPreparatory Committee on the Establishment of an\nInternational Criminal Court, we are of the view that the\nGeneral Assembly should enhance the Preparatory\nCommittee\u2019s work by mandating it to begin serious\nnegotiations of a consolidated draft treaty based on the\nInternational Law Commission\u2019s 1994 draft statute. The\npresent momentum for the establishment of a permanent\ninternational criminal tribunal should not be lost, but\nshould be matched by commensurate political will to\nensure that the work is completed in time for a\nconference in 1998.\nDevelopment and the promotion of international\ncooperation as enshrined in the Charter, will continue to\nbe the principal objectives of the United Nations. The\nrecently concluded mid-term review of the United Nations\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\n16\n\n\nhas shown that many of the social and economic problems\nwhich led to the adoption of the Agenda in 1991 still exist\nand that poverty and unemployment in Africa are expected\nto increase substantially. Furthermore, the estimated\nresource mobilization levels in the Agenda are still far from\nbeing attained.\nConsequently, the mid-term review recommended that\nAfrican Governments should continue to promote, inter\nalia, economic reforms, respect for human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, good governance and administrative\nreform. For their part, international partners should seek to\nmobilize substantial new resources from all sources \u2014\npublic and private \u2014 and from traditional and new sources,\nto find a solution to Africa\u2019s external debt problem and to\nenhance Africa\u2019s recovery through trade facilitation and\nimproved market access.\nThe United Nations System-wide Special Initiative for\nAfrica, which was launched by the Secretary-General in\nMarch this year, promises to break new ground by assuring\nthe cooperation of the whole system, including the Bretton\nWoods institutions, in tackling the intractable problem of\naccelerating the development of the African continent.\nWhile this expression of interest in our continent is\nappreciated, we must also stress that the implementation of\nthe several initiatives currently on the table must be carried\nout in very close consultation with the African countries\nthemselves, to avoid the duplication of efforts. The\nOrganization of African Unity\u2019s Cairo Plan of Action is\nrelevant in this regard.\nAs we engage in this introspection one year after our\nhistoric Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth\nAnniversary of the United Nations, it is pertinent to inquire\nto what extent we are all fulfilling our commitment\nundertaken during the various global conferences, all of\nwhich \u2014 except the Vienna World Conference on Human\nRights \u2014 have a development dimension. Perhaps the one\nthat towers above all others in its significance for\nalleviating the plight of citizens of least developed\ncountries, such as mine, is last year\u2019s Copenhagen World\nSummit for Social Development.\nIn Lesotho there is a serious effort to attain the target\nof devoting 20 per cent of our budget to the health and\neducation sectors, but we have not witnessed a\ncorresponding commitment on the part of our development\npartners, as was agreed at Copenhagen.\nThe Commission for Social Development has been\ngiven the primary responsibility for the follow-up and\nreview of the implementation of the Copenhagen\nDeclaration and Programme of Action. Commitment 2 of\nthe Declaration and chapter II of the Programme of\nAction both deal with the goal of poverty eradication. In\nthis connection, 1997 is a crucial year, being the first year\nof the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of\nPoverty.\nBy its resolution 50/161, the General Assembly\ndecided to hold a special session in the year 2000 for an\noverall review and appraisal and of the implementation of\nthe World Summit for Social Development and to\nconsider further actions and initiatives. We support the\nview that, to enable this to happen, the Commission\nshould meet annually, that the length of its sessions\nshould be extended and that its membership should be\nincreased.\nMeasures to ensure that women have the same\ndegree of access as men to economic resources and\nopportunities are of equal importance for the attainment\nof economic progress. Poverty can be eradicated only\nthrough the empowerment of the poor. United Nations\nefforts should therefore be coordinated in such a manner\nthat all its activities for poverty eradication fully take into\naccount the gender perspective.\nThe ratification of the Convention on the Elimination\nof All Forms of Discrimination against Women was\nsupposed to be followed by the revision of all laws that\nact as an impediment to the social and economic\nadvancement of women. In Lesotho this goal, although\nnot yet reached, is still being actively pursued.\nLesotho has joined the other countries of southern\nAfrica in signing two Protocols to the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC) Treaty recently, one of\nwhich deals with politics, defence and security and the\nother with cooperation in combating transboundary crime,\nespecially trafficking in narcotics and money-laundering.\nA central element of the Protocol establishing an\nOrgan on Politics, Defence and Security is the\ncommitment to work for the protection and promotion of\nhuman rights in the region. Our endeavours in this regard\nare intended to reinforce the United Nations own\nprogrammes.\nThe increase in crime, particularly transnational\ncrime, has a considerable effect on the economies of\n17\n\n\nmany countries. New worldwide strategies are therefore\nurgently needed for combating this malaise. However,\ndeveloping countries cannot bear the economic burden of\ncombating transnational crime by themselves. Technical\ncooperation and assistance activities to develop the\ncriminal-justice capacities of developing countries should\ntherefore be accorded a high priority.\nThe activities of the Crime Prevention and Criminal\nJustice Division \u2014 particularly its training courses,\nseminars and workshops for criminal-justice personnel \u2014\nare to be commended.\nLet me conclude by observing that together we have\nthe capacity to make the United Nations of the next\ncentury a veritable instrument for meeting mankind\u2019s\naspirations for a better world in all respects. In our\ninterdependent world, the United Nations has to become\nan efficient working forum for searching for universal\nconsensus, a conscious regulator of the integration\nprocesses and a vehicle for establishing a stable world\norder.\nWe have deep confidence in the potential of the joint\nefforts of the entire international community in its\ncapability to enter the twenty-first century in an\natmosphere of peace, development and joint creative\nwork, and to provide comprehensive security for all, as is\ncalled for by the priority interests of humankind."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn this fifty-first year of the\nUnited Nations, we are particularly happy to see\nMr. Razali Ismail presiding over this Assembly. This is\nin no small measure due to his well-deserved high\nreputation. In large measure, too, our joy comes from my\nGovernment\u2019s appreciation of the deep commitment of his\nGovernment to national and international economic\nimprovement with equity. We are grateful, too, for the\nexcellent services rendered by his predecessor, Mr. Diogo\nFreitas do Amaral, in a year in which, under his guidance,\nreform of the United Nations system truly gathered\nmomentum.\nToday it is often remarked that there are many signs\nof the diminishing role of national sovereignty. In the\nsphere of human rights, the regional adjudicatory systems\ncontinue to flourish. Scrutiny is increasingly given by the\nregional bodies and by such other groupings as the\nCommonwealth of nations. We have good reason to\nbelieve that the new commonwealth of Portuguese-\nspeaking nations will soon travel along the same path. At\n21\n\n\nthe United Nations, the General Assembly, the Economic\nand Social Council (ECOSOC), the Commission on Human\nRights and the human rights treaty bodies all continue to\nscrutinize States for their rectitude in the field of human\nrights. It certainly seems that the High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights, together with the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees and other\nexecutive agencies, are performing a useful watchdog and\ncatalytic function.\nWhile this Organization\u2019s efforts at humanitarian\nintervention have not been overwhelmingly successful, they\nhave certainly provided evidence of the probable reality that\nabsolutist notions of State sovereignty are in decline. Thus,\nwe witness the acknowledgement, by States, of shared\ninterests which contribute to enhanced cooperation in joint\nefforts to combat the trafficking of narcotics and to\npreserve and regenerate the environment. Recently, too, the\nOrganization of American States launched an initiative that\npoints in the same direction: the inter-American convention\nagainst corruption.\nCorruption has been a scourge throughout our region,\nas it is elsewhere. In our region, therefore, we have\ndetermined drastically to reduce its impact, even if that\nmight have implications for State sovereignty. In the same\nway, the flurry of conventions and new organizations on the\nglobal environment, and the outpourings of the recent\nglobal conferences and summits on social and other issues\nbear witness to the rapid erosion of absolutist notions of\nsovereignty.\nDuring the past year efforts have been to bring into\nbeing the long-awaited International Tribunal for the Law\nof the Sea. Despite certain regrettable limitations, the\nAppellate Body of the World Trade Organization, the new\ntribunal for international trade disputes, has now issued its\nfirst judgment. We have also settled down to serious work\nin preparing for an international criminal court, just as the\nTribunals for the prosecution of war crimes in the former\nYugoslavia and in Rwanda are getting under way. These all\nconstitute a significant development in the international\nsystem, in which the State and its citizens are increasingly\nmade subject to international scrutiny.\nWe must insist, however, that what is sauce for the\ngoose is sauce for the gander. We therefore expect that\nlarge States, as well as small States, will fully submit\nthemselves to these new Tribunals. We also fully expect\nthat powerful States will refrain from exerting their\nsovereign wills over smaller or weaker States.\nOn a different subject, we have also witnessed a\ncertain contraction of the public sector both within nations\nand international organizations. The attrition of the\nnational budgets of capital-exporting and donor countries\nhas had a domino effect on international organizations\nand capital-importing and recipient countries. So-called\nreductions in force and other forms of structural\nadjustment have therefore become a painful way of life.\nIn this respect, this Organization and my country and\nmany others have not been spared. At the same time, my\ncountry and many others have now established modern\nand rational systems for the imposition and collection of\nindirect taxes and other revenues. I refer especially to the\nvalue-added tax, the use of which is now virtually\nuniversal.\nLike most Governments, mine has had to trim\nseveral vital services. Everywhere, Governments are\nobliged to experiment with the privatization of many\nformer State functions and have liquidated large chunks\nof State property. Even as these changes occur within\nmany economies and Governmental structures, other\nactors have stepped onto the national and international\nstage. These actors, of course, include civil society and\nthe non-governmental organizations, which now\nparticipate in almost every aspect of life.\nAt the same time, we are trying to understand and\ncope with the novel phenomenon of globalization.\nGlobalization has several positive aspects, especially\nliberalization, which it presupposes. However,\nglobalization also seems to presuppose the\nuniversalization of mammoth private-sector enterprises\nand associations. This universalization is accompanied by\nrevision or, in places, the reversal of aspects of such legal\nand economic doctrines as those that disapproved of\nexcessive industrial combinations and monopolies.\nNevertheless, globalization is a logical\naccompaniment to the reduction of the scope of\nsovereignty. But just as a loss of national autonomy is not\nan unalloyed blessing, this newfangled gigantism is too\nmassive to be swallowed whole. For one thing,\nglobalization as we are witnessing it today is an\nunprecedented phenomenon, even for the former empires.\nWhatever its advocates may say, it sometimes seems to\ncontradict our very humanity, since the micro-dimension\nshould never be neglected in the face of the\nmacro-dimension. Both dimensions are essentially\ncomplementary. Globalization, furthermore, sometimes\ndenies the tenets of, and the recent directions in,\nindividual and collective human rights. This is because,\n22\n\n\nwhen it is taken to its logical extreme, as it is in several\nplaces, it seems to lead to an international euthanasia. It\ncontributes to a \u201cdinner-table scraps\u201d mentality, or a \u201ccrabs-\nin-the-basket\u201d attitude, whereby the disadvantaged might\nstarve to death or destroy others in order to survive, while\nthose who are more advantaged are enabled to gorge even\nmore.\nFurthermore, certain forms of assertive globalization\nalso fly in the face of diversity. They are anathema to\ncultural, social and economic pluralism, whose validity is\nuncontrovertible in socio-biological terms. As globalization\nis increasingly manifested in the electronic and\ncommunications media, these problems loom very large as,\nthroughout the world, we see our youth taking on the\nmind-sets and the habiliments of corrupt, alien trend-setters\nwho are mainly interested in purveying unnecessary\nproducts and creating false desires. As well we know, the\nconsequences are often mindless violence and sexual and\nother exploitation of women, children and the weak. Surely\nthis Organization must seek to ensure that these\nconsequences are eradicated.\nGlobalization and the decline of State sovereignty\nevidence the dramatic changes sweeping the globe, a\nsubject on which many of us often comment from this\nrostrum. Change is indeed the order of the day, and change,\nin these specific respects, is actually part and parcel of this\nOrganization and its Charter. After all, despite the fact that\nsome would spin theories to the contrary, the very\nconception of the United Nations Charter was an\nenthronement of the doctrine of reduced sovereignty. Only\nby reducing sovereignty could the excesses that were\nevident before and during the Second World War be\ncurtailed. Clearly, the very conception of the United\nNations presupposes a type of essential globalization.\nIt is therefore surprising how, in some quarters,\nglobalization by private economic actors pursuing or\nmotivated by the dictates of acquisitiveness, cupidity or\nwhat is referred to as \u201cefficiency\u201d can be applauded, while\nsimilar but much more modest behaviour by groups of\nsovereigns is now decried. We urge that one crucial key to\nmeaningful reform of the United Nations must surely be\nenthronement of this Organization\u2019s globalism. We must,\nindeed, enhance efficiency by rationalizing the managerial\nstructure of the United Nations and the ways in which we\nselect its executives, as was intelligently suggested in the\nlatest edition of the important study by Urquhart and\nChilders, entitled A World In Need of Leadership.\nWe must act globally by harnessing in common the\nshared resources of the planet. We repeat our call from\nprevious general debates that this Organization, in keeping\nwith its global function, must be given autonomous\nrevenue authority in certain areas not presently in the\ndomain of nation States. We must acknowledge the utility\nof the concept of a modest, truly representative and\nrevocable trusteeship over certain ocean and aerial spaces.\nWe may also wish to acknowledge the fact that the\nnuclear Powers are merely revocable trustees over nuclear\nweapons, even as we move towards ending all forms of\nnuclear testing and comply with the recent Advisory\nOpinion of the International Court of Justice requiring the\nprompt negotiation, in good faith, of nuclear disarmament.\nAt the same time, we must eradicate everywhere the bitter\narsenals of mines and other injurious weapons and\nnoxious substances, and ensure that substances such as\nnuclear waste do not pass through our territorial or other\nwaters.\nResponsible globalism will reap for the world the\nfruits of the promises made in connection with this\nOrganization\u2019s wartime antecedents: that economic, social\nand all other forms of development are the absolute\nheritage of under-possessed and dispossessed individuals,\npeoples and nations. We are under a strict obligation to\nkeep this Organization\u2019s Agenda for Development on the\nfront burner. Belize has proposed that we should establish\nan annual special session of this Assembly immediately\nprior to the general debate, at which we would discuss\ndevelopment policy and regenerate the political will\nnecessary continually to revise the complex Agenda for\nDevelopment and the commitments made in this\nAssembly, as well as at the high-level global conferences\nof this last decade of the twentieth century. At that annual\nsession, we could also effectively discuss certain specific\nportions of the Second Committee items currently\ndiscussed during the regular session.\nEnlightened globalism will compel us, with alacrity\nand dignity, to make good the humanitarian obligations of\nthis \u201cone world\u201d to the least-developed countries, to\nAfrica, to small developing islands and low-lying\ndeveloping coastal areas like Belize, to land-locked\ncountries and to other disadvantaged places. We should be\nhappy to do so without repeating any of the recent tired,\nuncharitable and inaccurate nostrums about the death of\nthe obligation to accord economic preferences to poor\ncountries, even as we clamour that human rights and\n23\n\n\nhumanitarianism have now been elevated to a place of\nhonour in the international pantheon.\nEven as we extol the virtues of United Nations\nglobalism, we can discern another antidote or counterpart\nto the gigantism of private-sector globalization. This is the\nphenomenon of regionalism.\nRegionalism is the concept that drives many current\nproposals \u2014 including those of Belize \u2014 for reform of the\nUnited Nations Security Council and is a suggested basis\nfor the selection of additional so-called permanent\nmembers \u2014 privileged, although not serving indefinitely.\nIncidentally, such a selection could be done entirely within\nthe region or, as is done in many cases at present, by the\nAssembly.\nRegionalism is the essence of Belize\u2019s proposals for\nshared seats on the Security Council, whereby adjacent or\nproximate States can pool their resources to serve the\ninternational community in that rather expensive enterprise.\nWe gratefully acknowledge the fact that Belize\u2019s proposals\nhave attracted some attention.\nEven as portions of Central Africa appear to teeter on\nthe brink, regionalism has been relatively effective and\nremains the main hope for preserving peace and security in\nseveral parts of this troubled world. It acknowledges the\nreality that the Organization is not structured to carry out\npeacemaking and peacekeeping undertakings on a sustained\nbasis.\nMy delegation also believes that regionalism can\nbecome a critical element in the quest successfully to\nconfront the menace of narcotics without leading to\nunwitting hegemonism.\nWe now see an abundance of formal arrangements for\nsubregional integration. These are occurring throughout the\nfive regions of the United Nations. Informal arrangements\nalso abound. These lead us to urge nations in all parts of\nthe world, as well as the global body politic, to explore\nfunctional cooperation on a regional and subregional basis,\nas we now try to do within the Association of Caribbean\nStates and as we have done for centuries in several\nsub-areas of the Caribbean. We are now witnessing much\nfruitful regional liberalization and the integration of labour\nmarkets, competition policy, labour standards, monetary\nsystems, investments, technical cooperation and trade.\nWe are happy to witness such functional regionalism\nin Africa, Asia, Europe and other parts of Latin America.\nWe are also witnessing a reordering of the globe as new\nregions are identified and new relationships developed\nbetween regions. Thus, instead of imagining that the\nPacific islands are worlds apart from the Caribbean and\nCentral America, as we did when we looked eastward at\nthem, we now see them as neighbouring fellow citizens\nof the tropics as we look westward at them over our\nfragile isthmus of Central America.\nFrom this geopolitical vantage point as well, we see\nEast Asia as a partner to the Caribbean and Central\nAmerica. This helps us appreciate that the contemporary\napproach to statehood fully justifies the aspirations of a\ndemocratic Asian country that is one of the most\nsubstantial players in the global economy for a greater\nmeasure of political participation in the system of\ninternational organizations. That country is Taiwan. In the\nview of my delegation, such participation would be quite\nconsistent with prevailing notions of sovereignty. At the\nsame time, it is assumed that the territorial integrity of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China would be completely\nunimpaired. We believe that the statehood and dignity of\nthe latter ancient, honourable and global Power should\nand would be safeguarded in any situation we have\nposited. Without meaning to interfere, we would hope\nthat, in this connection, as has been stated in other\ncontexts in these remarks, noblesse oblige.\nTurning to another region, we must reiterate our\nconcern about the recent retardation of the peace process\nbetween Israel and its neighbours. Again, we call for\nimprovement of conditions in southern Lebanon and\nelsewhere and for the genuine autonomy that is the\nbirthright of the Palestinians.\nFinally, we wish to suggest that regionalism,\nincluding functional cooperation, will contribute\nsignificantly to the fulfilment of the millennial dreams of\nthe architects of this great global Organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the\noutset to congratulate Mr. Ismail Razali on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session,\nwhich is being held at a particularly difficult juncture. I am,\nhowever, persuaded that his personal attributes as well as\nhis proven diplomatic experience will ensure the success\nthat is expected from this Assembly.\nAllow me to express to His Excellency\nMr. Freitas do Amaral my congratulations on the\noutstanding commitment he demonstrated during his term\nin office. Our best wishes for the future go to him as he\nresumes his work as an educator and conducts research for\npeace and progress for all peoples.\nAllow me also to express my warm appreciation to the\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, for the dynamic and visionary manner in which he\nconducted the business of our Organization during a time\nof great change in the international arena. At this time the\nUnited Nations is more and more frequently called upon to\nrise to new challenges and is compelled to face tests that\nare not always peaceful. For this difficult mission the\nRepublic of Angola will continue to render its modest\ncontribution for the successful accomplishment of his\nmandate.\nAt the threshold of the new century of the third\nmillennium we are increasingly faced with new and\ngreater challenges, the solutions to which require joint and\nconcerted actions by all States, irrespective of their size,\neconomic potential or military might. In this context,\ncountries that have Portuguese as an official language \u2014\nAngola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Portugal and\nSao Tome and Principe \u2014 have recently decided to\nestablish a community of Portuguese-speaking countries\nin order better to serve the interests of their peoples. We\nwould like to thank the Government and people of\nPortugal for fostering a cordial climate for this\ncommunity of Portuguese-speaking countries.\nIt is essential, therefore, that a broad and in-depth\nreform programme be adopted for multilateral institutions,\nwhich would make a decisive contribution towards the\ndemocratization of international relations on the basis of\nthe primacy of law, the safeguarding of the sovereign\nequality of States and reciprocity in the comity of nations.\nIt is along these lines that we approach with all\nseriousness the restructuring of the United Nations and its\nsystem.\nOur goal is to optimize the functioning of bodies\nthat coordinate the work of maintaining international\npeace and security and fostering social and economic\ndevelopment. Although innumerable international\nconferences held by the United Nations in recent years\nvalidate this concern, a great deal remains to be\naccomplished. We must go from words of intention to\ndeeds.\nIn this context, we believe that the current session of\nthe General Assembly must approach with daring and\npolitical resolve all current issues of common concern,\nincluding those in the areas of international peacekeeping\nand security and the healing of the economic and social\ncrisis that afflicts the developing world.\nLast year our Organization celebrated its fiftieth\nanniversary, and there was unanimous recognition by all\nmankind of its role as the most important forum for\nconcerted action among nations. Although the\nrestructuring of the United Nations has always been an\n19\n\n\nissue of concern, it is now even more essential if we are to\nrise to the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nIn this connection, I would like to avail myself of this\nopportunity first of all to congratulate the Open-ended\nHigh-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the\nUnited Nations System for the positive achievements we\nhave witnessed. Nevertheless, there is still a long road\nahead before we achieve our final objectives and make it\npossible for our Organization to play its true role. As a\nmatter of fact, we are quite concerned by the current\nfinancial crisis, which is affecting the proper operation of\nour Organization and even threatening its very survival. In\nthis context, we support proposals that suggest practical\naction for the correction of the financial situation, such as\nthe revision of the scale of assessments, the downsizing of\nthe Secretariat and some of its bodies, with a view towards\nrendering them more efficient, less bureaucratic and less\nburdensome.\nBy way of example, allow me to point out that several\ndevelopmental assistance projects or humanitarian aid\nprogrammes are entrusted to foreign officials while they\ncould perfectly well be carried out by local officials with\nsimilar qualifications, which could cut down the\nimplementation costs to less than one third. This is only\none example among the many we could cite that could go\nfar towards assisting with the financial healing of the\nOrganization.\nThe measures we have alluded to are feasible and\ncould bring about greater benefits and substantially improve\nthe functioning of the Organization and its specialized\nagencies.\nAs regards the Security Council, my Government has\nalways supported its restructuring in order to strengthen its\nrole and effectiveness and ensure greater transparency in\nthe decision-making process and in the implementation of\nits resolutions. Our position therefore is identical to the one\nadopted by the Organization of African Unity. It would\nexpand the Security Council and provide for fair and equal\nrepresentation by permanent and non-permanent members,\nwith equal rights and duties. Africa\u2019s claim to at least two\npermanent seats on the Security Council is nothing but its\nproper and due right. We likewise support the right of other\nregions to representation on the Council, with the status of\npermanent members.\nRegarding the modes of operation of the Security\nCouncil, we believe that the areas concerned will find their\nappropriate modus operandi.\nIn several regions of our planet, there are still\ndecades-old conflicts, and new sources of tension are\nbreaking out in areas that previously enjoyed a certain\npeace and stability. This offsets the most optimistic\nexpectations of our peoples, who had hoped that the\nworld would be on the threshold of a new era of peace in\nthis post-cold-war period, paving the way for cooperation\nand development.\nIt is therefore with great apprehension that we note\na proliferation of regional conflicts, social and economic\ncollapse in some of our countries, environmental decay,\nand the coming of new scourges such as transnational\ncrime, drug trafficking, a rising wave of criminality, racial\ndisturbances, xenophobia, and religious and cultural\nintolerance.\nIt is in the face of this bleak picture that we come\ntogether for the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly, compelling us to pause in deep introspection\nand firm resolve to handle this time bomb. In this context,\nthe Republic of Angola urges all Member States to do\ntheir very best in the search for ways and means to\nachieve this. One of the main tools available to us is\npreventive diplomacy and the political resolve of all those\nwho are in a position to make a decisive contribution to\ninternational peace and security.\nIn the Middle East, recent events are showing\ndangerous trends, jeopardizing the Washington agreement\non the autonomy of the Palestinian people and the first\nsteps towards the joint peaceful settlement of peace issues\nin that region, all of which are matters of the greatest\nconcern to the Republic of Angola.\nThe Republic of Angola reiterates the stand adopted\non the Middle East by African Heads of State or\nGovernment at the thirty-second summit meeting of the\nOrganization of African Unity, in Yaound\u00e9, and appeals\nto the parties for strict compliance with their\ncommitments, because nothing can resist the resolve of a\npeople to be free. As stated by a great leader of our\ncentury, Ho Chi Minh, \u201cNothing is more precious than\nfreedom and independence\u201d.\nWe are likewise concerned at the grievous situation\nin East Timor, a non-autonomous territory illegally\noccupied by Indonesia, in violation of the principles\nestablished in the United Nations Charter and applicable\nresolutions of the General Assembly and the Security\nCouncil.\n20\n\n\nMy Government reaffirms that the United Nations has\na great responsibility vis-\u00e0-vis the people of East Timor and\nshould not fail in it. In this context, the Republic of Angola\nsupports and encourages dialogue between Portugal, the\nadministering Power, and Indonesia in search of a\nsettlement that will bring self-determination and\nindependence to the people of Timor.\nWe are, likewise, profoundly concerned by the\ndifficult social and economic situation in the Republic of\nCuba resulting from the financial and economic blockade\nimposed on that member State of the General Assembly.\nThe Government of Angola supports the General\nAssembly resolutions appealing for the lifting of the\neconomic blockade in favour of the Cuban people, which\nis suffering under the negative effects of that measure. We\ntherefore encourage a dialogue with a view to normalizing\nrelations between those two sovereign Member States of the\nOrganization, which we call the United Nations, not the\ndivided nations.\nIn the course of the next century, one of the greatest\nchallenges to the United Nations will be the protection and\npromotion of human rights. The Government of Angola has\nalways recognized the indivisible and universal character of\nthe fundamental rights of every human being and the\nintrinsic correlation between human rights, democracy and\ndevelopment. Thus, at the Commission on Human Rights\nand other forums, Angola has always categorically\ncondemned selectivity and its politicization.\nWe condemn human rights violations, wherever they\nmay occur. This attitude, however, should not serve as a\npretext for sectarianism, exerting pressures designed to\ncreate political instability in sovereign States, or the\nimplementation of hidden agendas. This practice harms\nrather than fosters the promotion and protection of human\nrights.\nAllow me to take this opportunity to inform the\nAssembly that, at the proposal of President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo\ndos Santos, and in coordination with the United Nations\nCentre for Human Rights, the 32nd summit meeting of the\nHeads of State and Government of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity decided to hold this year a ministerial-level\nmeeting devoted exclusively to in-depth consideration of the\nissue of human rights in Africa. The Republic of Angola\nwill have the privilege of hosting this conference, which we\nbelieve is of tremendous relevance in the lengthy and\ndifficult process of democratization in our continent.\nThe crisis that is currently affecting the global\neconomy is mostly structural in nature and results from\ninconsistency, lack of coordination, and the adoption of\nmacroeconomic policies incompatible with the growth\nneeds of the developing world. Of great concern is the\nrealization that the current growth rate of some of our\ncountries is often negative. This compels whole\npopulations to lead lives of starvation and extreme\npoverty. It is indeed unfair that, at the threshold of the\nthird millennium, there are still some 800 million\nmalnourished people across the world.\nAfrica is the continent most lacking in capital and\ntechnology and, as a result, its population growth rate far\nexceeds its food-production capacity. In turn, this\nincreases poverty and starvation and can lead to serious\nsocial unrest. These consequences can be avoided if we\nare able to rely on the understanding and goodwill of our\ncreditors and major international financial institutions,\nwhich impose economic management prescriptions\nwithout regard for each nation\u2019s realities.\nIn our view, one of the basic keys to the economic\nand social development of our countries lies in the\nexpansion and reorientation of economic cooperation for\ndevelopment. We must map out as soon as possible a\nglobal developmental strategy that will contribute to the\nsolution of the problems now affecting the survival of our\neconomies.\nToday, our world has reached such a level of\ninterdependence that new levels of interaction among our\neconomies are required if we are to survive, enjoy\nstability and avoid the threat of the imminent breakdown\nsuffered by the weaker nations. My Government reaffirms\nits support for the United Nations special initiative on\nAfrica and, at the same time, underscores the need for\ngreater assurances of success, in view of our experience\nwith similar programmes in the past. Once again, a word\nof praise is due to the Secretary-General for this initiative,\nwhich again demonstrates that the world, and the United\nNations in particular, has not turned its back on Africa.\nIf the African continent is to overcome its social and\neconomic crisis, a broad marshalling of financial and\nother resources will be necessary before the end of this\ncentury in order to meet the social and economic\ndevelopment needs of the continent. Likewise, we are\ndeeply concerned by the growth of the external debt of\nAfrica and other developing countries, as well as by the\nheavy burden involved in debt servicing, which is one of\n21\n\n\nthe causes of the continuous economic and social\ndeterioration of our standard of living.\nWe believe that a fair and lasting solution can be\nfound for the African foreign-debt crisis, as long as there is\nunderstanding and a strong political resolve on the part of\ncreditors. For certain developing nations, the negotiation of\na debt roll-over is a feasible solution. For the less-\ndeveloped nations, however, the sole viable solution is total\nforgiveness of the debt and a massive effort in the area of\ninternational cooperation for development through\npartnerships. The strengthening of South-South cooperation\nand regional economic integration are processes that pave\nthe way for the establishment of a more equitable, new\ninternational economic order, free from measures of\nprotectionism that hinder international trade and give rise to\ndiscrimination against our nations.\nOf equal concern is the deteriorating food situation in\nAfrica due to drought and other natural disasters. This can\nbe addressed only through special assistance from the\ninternational community for the development of the food\nand agricultural sectors and of food self-sufficiency in\nAfrican countries. We extend our best wishes for success to\nthe World Food Summit scheduled to take place in\nNovember in Rome, of which His Excellency Mr. Jos\u00e9\nEduardo dos Santos will be a sponsor.\nMy Government has focused special attention on\nissues of environment and human settlements and we take\nthis opportunity to underscore the positive impact in Angola\nof the programmes and related activities in our continent\nsponsored by the United Nations Environmental Programme\nand the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements. In\nspite of all the difficulties it faces, Angola has spared no\neffort in combating desertification and drought in Africa.\nWe congratulate those countries that volunteered to host the\nConvention to Combat Desertification and urge all countries\nto ratify it, thus enabling it to enter into force as soon as\npossible.\nIllegal drug trafficking and the chemical-precursors\ntrade, together with money laundering, represent another\nscourge that is destabilizing our nations. Drug trafficking\nfor us, therefore, is an international problem requiring\ncooperation among all countries worldwide. With the\nsupport of the United Nations International Drug Control\nProgramme and the assistance of other United Nations\nspecialized agencies, my Government has drafted and\nsubmitted to our Parliament updated legislation relating to\nour struggle against the traffics in illegal drugs,\npsychotropic substances and chemical precursors. This law\nwas enacted recently, but we still lack the technical and\nexpert resources to ensure the success of that campaign.\nIn southern Africa, we have coordinated our policies\nin this area so as to score significant successes, both\nnationally and regionally. The results are satisfactory and\nencouraging.\nToday, just as it was 51 years ago , the struggle for\npeace continues to be one of the fundamental goals of our\nOrganization. We must therefore devote all our efforts\nand energy to the creation of a better world instead of\npreparing for new wars of self-destruction.\nMy Government has signed, and the Angolan\nParliament has just ratified, the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We support the efforts\nto ban new nuclear tests. We also reiterate our appeal for\nrespect for and preservation of the African continent and\nits contiguous areas as a nuclear-free zone, in accordance\nwith the Pelindaba Treaty.\nThe Republic of Angola is today one of the\ncountries in which the largest number of anti-personnel\nland-mines can be found. There are over 10 million mines\nlaid in Angolan territory. These mines have inflicted\ninnumerable casualties, and over 100,000 people have\nbeen mutilated in my country. My Government supports\nall efforts towards a total ban on the production and\nexport of anti-personnel land-mines and their use in\ndomestic or international conflicts.\nWith the Assembly\u2019s permission, I would like to\naddress the situation in Africa, which today seems like a\ncorpse on which vultures come to feed.\nSome countries of our continent still face serious\nobstacles due to negative interference in the peace process\nand in their efforts to promote economic development, the\nwell-being of African peoples and the establishment of\npeace, security and political stability.\nThe problem of conflicts in Africa is undoubtedly\none of the crucial issues affecting the development and\nstability of our continent. The Government of Angola\nwould like to praise the efforts of the Central Organ of\nthe Organization of African Unity\u2019s Mechanism for\nConflict Prevention, Management and Resolution in\nvarious African regions and countries, such as Burundi,\nLiberia and Somalia.\n22\n\n\nIn this connection, we support the efforts of the\nneighbouring countries and others that advocate a\nnegotiated political settlement for the crisis in Burundi on\nthe basis of the country\u2019s constitutional legal order and in\nconsonance with the legitimate interests of the parties. We\nbelieve that if this objective is to be achieved, there must\nbe a global dialogue among the parties concerned.\nWe would like to pay tribute to the former President\nof Tanzania, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, for his efforts to\nreunite our Burundian brothers who have fallen into enmity\naround the negotiating table. We are convinced that good\nwill on the part of the politicians will help our sister nation\nof Burundi overcome its critical difficulties.\nConcerning Liberia, we would like to congratulate the\nmember countries of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) for the significant progress\nmade so far, culminating in the swearing in of\nMs. Ruth Perry as Chairperson of the Liberian Council of\nState and the beginning of the belligerent parties\u2019 process\nof disarmament.\nUnfortunately, we are still concerned over the situation\nof Somalia. We feel that in Somalia, as in the case of other\nconflicts, there is no other way to find peace than through\ndialogue between the parties concerned.\nWe would like to reaffirm our support for the\ncountries in that region, and particularly for the Prime\nMinister of Ethiopia in his efforts to bring the Somali\nfactions together around a negotiating table. We also feel\nthat the United Nations should not and cannot renounce its\nduty and abandon that country to its fate.\nFinally, we cannot fail to restate our position of\nprinciple regarding the issue of Western Sahara \u2014 namely,\nour support for the United Nations and Organization of\nAfrican Unity resolutions in that regard. We are convinced\nthat the problem can be resolved only through a referendum\non the self-determination of that territory.\nWe support a peaceful solution to the conflict, taking\ninto account the interests of the parties, particularly that of\nthe Saharan people, and we offer congratulations on the\nresumption of direct talks between the Kingdom of\nMorocco and POLISARIO.\nI would not wish to conclude my statement without\napprising the Assembly in general terms of the situation\nprevailing in my country during the implementation of the\nLusaka Protocol, aimed at restoring lasting peace and\nreconciliation for all Angolans.\nPrior to doing so, however, I would like to express\nthe sincere appreciation of the Government of Angola to\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General for\nAngola, Ma\u00eetre Alioune Blondin Beye, as well as to the\nrepresentatives of the troika of observer nations \u2014\nPortugal, the Russian Federation and the United States of\nAmerica \u2014 for the unswerving efforts they have made,\nindividually and jointly, for peace and national\nreconciliation in Angola.\nAlthough the peace process has evinced a certain\ndynamism since the Franceville and Libreville meetings\nbetween the President of the Republic,\nHis Excellency Mr. Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, and the\nleader of UNITA, Mr Jonas Savimbi, we have been\nconfronted with certain situations that are rather\nunfavourable for its normal and desirable development.\nAs the Assembly knows, the implementation of the\nLusaka Protocol included a calendar of specific tasks for\nthe Government and for UNITA.\nThe position adopted by the UNITA leadership\nconcerning the honouring of its commitments has,\nunfortunately, given rise to deplorable situations in the\ncourse of the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, in\nspite of the fact that the Government has gone beyond\nmeeting its commitments under the calendar.\nAs a matter of fact, not only did UNITA fail to\nhonour its commitments and fail to comply with the\npertinent Security Council resolutions, but it failed to\ncarry out fundamental commitments in the peace process:\nit failed to confine all its true military forces to quarters;\nit did not surrender its light and heavy mat\u00e9riel; it did not\nbring about the induction of all its general officers into\nthe regular armed forces of Angola, in accordance with\nthe agreement; it continued to create impediments and\ndifficulties in the selection and induction of 26,300 troops\ninto the national army of Angola; and, finally, it\nprevented the free circulation of people and goods, thus\ndelaying the extension of the State administration over the\nentire national territory.\nAs members know too, at its Congress, held from 20\nto 28 August this year, UNITA rejected the offer made to\nits leader by the Government of the position of Vice-\nPresident of the Republic. By so acting, UNITA created\nan additional difficulty for the formation of the\n23\n\n\nGovernment of National Unity and Reconciliation. That\nattitude on the part of the leader of UNITA did not come\nas a surprise to many observers of the Angolan peace\nprocess because it is in keeping with Mr. Savimbi\u2019s\nhabitual lack of coherence. He has always placed his self-\ninterest far ahead of the interests of the Angolan nation.\nConsequently, it is more than evident that UNITA is trying\nto impose strategic delays on the peace process and the\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol, to aggravate the\nsocial and economic crisis and to distort the Protocol and\nother commitments assumed.\nHowever, despite the difficulties encountered in the\nprocess, the Angolan Government is resolute in its intent to\nspare no effort to resolve all the country\u2019s problems\nthrough dialogue and collective commitment. Our\nGovernment, working hand in hand with the democratic\nforces interested in peace and national reconciliation in\nAngola, has decided that, regardless of circumstances, we\nwill put an end to the cycle of strife that is disrupting the\ncountry. We will launch a new era of peace and political\ntolerance, strengthen democratic institutions and save the\nAngolan nation from the economic and social chaos into\nwhich it has been plunged by the stubborn attitude of those\nwho try to block the wind with their bare hands.\nIn this connection, I should like to thank the\ninternational community for its efforts and understanding in\nthe search for peace in Angola. We are aware of the\ntremendous costs involved in the operation of United\nNations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), but\nthis is a very sensitive juncture and the perseverance of the\ninternational community is of the essence, for victory is\ncertain. Only with the victory of peace and democracy in\nAngola can we say that the sacrifice of the international\ncommunity has been worthwhile.\nIn the achievement of those objectives the participation\nof UNITA is essential. We therefore urge the international\ncommunity to continue to exert pressure to compel the\nleader of UNITA to follow a reasonable course, renouncing\nwar once and for all, and to persuade him to occupy his\nposition in Angolan society.\nFor more than 30 years the Angolan people have been\nsubjected to successive wars that have caused and still\ncause indescribable suffering. After the election in\nSeptember 1992, Angola was once again plunged into a war\nthat forced all Government activities to be directed at an\nemergency social policy, the sole objective of which was to\nmitigate the nefarious consequences that afflicted the lives\nand dashed the hopes of Angolans.\nThat conflict created over 2 million displaced\npersons directly affected by the conflict; it drove over half\na million refugees into neighbouring countries and\nmaimed more than 100,000 people. In the economic\nsphere, it destroyed over 70 per cent of the social and\neconomic infrastructure and the agro-industrial base.\nThose are only a few of the many indicators that\nreveal the true dimensions of the catastrophe that has\nbefallen Angolans and that has led to a serious\ndeterioration in the humanitarian situation in the country.\nGiven the tragic situation we described earlier, my\nGovernment is no longer in a position to face this\nchallenge on its own. What is at stake is the survival of\nmillions of human beings.\nI should therefore like to take this opportunity\nsincerely to thank the international community and\nGovernments, as well as governmental and non-\ngovernmental organizations, for the assistance they have\nextended to the Angolan people. I would implore them to\ncontinue to assist the needy population without losing\nsight of assistance for development and self-sufficiency.\nWe peaceful Angolans and our Government will not\nabdicate our responsibilities.\nOnce again, I extend our best wishes to the President\nfor success as he presides over the General Assembly at\nthis session and pledge to him my delegation\u2019s full and\nsincere cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of Italy, I am pleased to\nexpress to you, Sir, my warmest congratulations on your\nelection to the presidency of this session of the General\nAssembly. Your extensive and widely recognized\nknowledge and experience of the activities and functions\nof the United Nations is the best guarantee of your\nsuccess. At the same time, allow me to sincerely thank\nyour predecessor, Professor Diogo Freitas do Amaral of\nPortugal, who so ably led the historic fiftieth session of\nthe General Assembly.\nIn addition, I should like to express our great\nappreciation for the inspiring role and constructive\nleadership of the United Nations provided by Secretary-\nGeneral Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\nItaly shares and fully supports the statement made\nbefore the General Assembly on Tuesday by the Deputy\nPrime Minister and Foreign Minister of Ireland on behalf\nof the European Union. At the special commemorative\nmeeting for the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\nthere was a solemn reaffirmation of the need for the\nUnited Nations to implement significant changes to keep\nstep with the new global realities. Italy believes that the\ntime has come to translate ideas into urgently needed\nreforms. Let me briefly address them.\nThe General Assembly is the most representative\nexpression of the values of our Organization. Therefore,\nwe believe that the General Assembly must increasingly\nreflect the opinions of our peoples and become more\ndemocratic through direct links to the institutional realities\n4\n\n\nof its Member States. The Italian delegation to the General\nAssembly, for example, includes representatives of both the\nSenate and the Chamber of Deputies of our Parliament,\nwhich helps our political forces to have a fuller appreciation\nfor the role and activities of the United Nations. We hope\nthat this practice, which is also followed by certain other\ncountries, becomes more widespread and consolidated.\nThe General Assembly\u2019s subsidiary bodies should be\nsimplified, merging some committees while streamlining the\nagenda. Greater transparency is needed in relations between\nthe General Assembly, the Security Council and the\nSecretariat.\nAt the same time, we believe that the Secretariat\nshould be restructured, so as to organize resources and\nfunctions around two focal points: on the one hand, peace\nand security; and on the other, democracy and development.\nIn this context, Italy proposes that the three economic and\nsocial departments of the United Nations Secretariat should\nbe merged into a single entity under the leadership of a\nDeputy Secretary-General, who would also act as the\nExecutive Secretary of the Economic and Social Council.\nItaly is actively committed to Security Council reform\nand has presented a detailed proposal inspired by the\nfundamental principles of democracy, equitable\ngeographical representation, efficiency and transparency.\nReform should not lead to the establishment of new\nregimes of privilege, which would diminish rather than\nincrease equitable representation on the Council. Last April,\nin his address before the General Assembly, the President\nof the Republic of Italy, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, warned that\nstressing the elitist nature of the Council\n\u201ccould widen the gap and thus reduce the interest of\nthe excluded, demeaning their political commitment in\nthe process and perhaps marginalizing them and\ngiving them the dangerous feeling that they are token\npresences, mere spectators.\u201d (Official Records of the\nGeneral Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings,\n103rd meeting, p. 3-4)\nOur goal instead must be to stimulate a greater involvement\nof all countries, large and small, through a rotation\nmechanism.\nThe Italian proposal would maintain a central role for\nthe General Assembly. In fact, it would be up to the\nGeneral Assembly to decide, on the basis of objective\ncriteria, which countries could rotate more frequently. It\nwould be up to the General Assembly to elect these\ncountries, by a two-thirds majority and by secret ballot, in\na truly democratic way. And it would be up to the\nGeneral Assembly periodically to review the countries in\nquestion.\nThe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\nMembership of the Security Council has found it difficult\nto reach a consensus. Italy considers its proposal a\nbalanced way of reconciling the new international\nrealities, namely the emergence of countries with notable\npolitical and economic capacities \u2014 and I include Italy\namong them \u2014 and the rise in developing countries, a\nfull 132 of which are Member States of the United\nNations today. However, we are willing to discuss and\nadhere to a formula that is not inconsistent with the\nfundamental principles that govern our own proposal.\nA new generation of peace-keeping has begun. From\nits original role as a force of interposition, peace-keeping\nhas gradually taken on the broader tasks of pacification,\nsupport for the process of national reconciliation, and\ntoday the protection of populations threatened by inter-\nethnic conflicts. Italy believes that in confronting these\ntasks every Member State should responsibly consider\nmaking, and be prepared to make, larger and more\nqualified military contingents available to the United\nNations. Italy is capable of doing its part, as demonstrated\nin Mozambique and in Bosnia.\nTo make United Nations actions more effective in\nthis field, Italy proposes the following 10 concrete\nmeasures which would be designed to: involve troop-\ncontributing countries in the decision-making process;\nconduct annual reviews of the mission, mandate, and\nmeans of peace-keeping operations; have readily\ndeployable military forces available as soon as Security\nCouncil decisions are made; create a reliable and unified\ncommand structure for peace-keeping operations; expand\nlogistical support for peace-keeping operations; prioritize\ntraining programmes for peace-keeping personnel;\nimprove the financing of peace-keeping operations; fill\nthe gap between peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-\nbuilding; entrust certain peace-keeping operations to\nregional organizations; and, finally, enhance cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU).\nTo go into these points more at length, first of all\nwe are glad that the Security Council, as suggested by\nItaly and other countries, has made it a regular practice to\n5\n\n\nhold consultations with troop-contributing countries before\nadopting decisions on peace-keeping operations. The next\nstep is a formal mechanism that guarantees the participation\nof troop-contributing countries in the decision-making\nprocess. In this connection, Italy will lend its full support\nto the proposal put forward by the Prime Minister of\nNorway, Mrs. Brundtland, for an annual seminar to focus\non the three M\u2019s of peace-keeping: Mission, Mandate and\nMeans.\nThe United Nations must be ready to deal with\nconflicts where and when they break out, and to this end,\nit must be able to count on readily available military forces,\nas provided for by Article 43 of the Charter of the United\nNations. We would also support the establishment, as\nsuggested by Canada, of a headquarters module for peace-\nkeeping at the United Nations Secretariat, whose\ncomposition should respect the principle of equitable\ngeographical representation.\nItaly intends to promote specific proposals to expand\nlogistical support, on the strength of its experience with the\nUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and the\nImplementation Force (IFOR). Already, we have made\navailable the first United Nations logistic base in Brindisi,\nwhich should be further expanded to ensure efficient\nresource management for peace-keeping operations and we\nsuggest a separate allocation in peace-keeping budgets for\nthe creation of logistic bases.\nThe training of peace-keeping personnel is the duty of\nthe United Nations Staff College in Turin, which was\ncreated on the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative. The College\nis receiving the maximum support of the Italian\nGovernment and will hopefully receive the support of other\nMember States as well. Financing of peace-keeping\noperations could be improved through a peace-keeping\nsurcharge for new, frequently rotating Security Council\nmembers, as Italy has proposed. This would distribute the\nburden of the surcharge to a larger number of countries.\nAnother essential component of peace-keeping is\nhumanitarian assistance during and immediately after a\nconflict. Between the management of a conflict and post-\nconflict peace-building there is a gap. To fill just such a\ngap in Central America, Italy designed and funded the\nDevelopment Progress for Displaced Persons, Refugees and\nReturnees (PRODERE) programme, which contributed\nsubstantially to the process of reconciliation. A model effort\nof the same type is now under way in Mozambique.\nCloser coordination with regional organizations could\nhelp provide the United Nations with the human and\nmaterial resources it needs. Without detracting from the\nUnited Nations central role, certain peace-keeping and\npeace-enforcement operations should be entrusted to\nregional organizations or coalitions. A good example of\nthis is the success of the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) in fulfilling the mandate it was\ngiven by the United Nations in the former Yugoslavia,\nwhere the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope has also played an increasing and important role.\nItaly hopes for growing dialogue between the\nOrganization of African Unity and the United Nations,\nand a strengthening of the peace-keeping capabilities of\nAfrican countries. The OAU must be concretely helped to\nenhance its mechanism for conflict prevention and crisis\nmanagement. In line with Italy\u2019s traditional support for\ndemocratic development, we are planning a broad series\nof initiatives in Africa aimed at supporting parliamentary\nactivities and strengthening judicial structures and\ntraining.\nThe United Nations is a global system, and it\npursues global objectives. Conflict prevention and the\npromotion of peaceful solutions to controversies cannot be\npursued solely at the political and military level. The\nconditions for peace are found, perhaps primarily, in the\neconomic, social and cultural development of peoples.\nPoverty, underdevelopment, and cultural isolation disrupt\nrelations between countries and thus constitute threats to\ninternational peace.\nThrough its funds, programmes, and specialized\nagencies, the United Nations plays a vital role in\npreventing these obstacles from jeopardizing peaceful\ncoexistence. It helps restore the conditions for orderly\nglobal development after disruptions caused by internal\nand international conflicts. Italy appreciates the\nimportance of both prevention and post-conflict\nreconstruction, and is determined to strengthen its\ncollaboration with the United Nations specialized\nagencies.\nWith this in mind Italy has chosen the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO) as one of the main points of reference for the\nreconstruction of the city of Mostar. Collaboration with\nthe cultural agency of the United Nations will also prove\nvaluable in other areas of the former Yugoslavia on\nprojects to reconstruct prestigious landmarks such as the\nSarajevo library and historic buildings in Ragusa/\n6\n\n\nDubrovnik.\nThe reform process also concerns the economic and\nsocial fields of the United Nations. The adoption of\nresolution 50/227 is a significant step forward, especially\nwhere it refers to strengthening the role of the Economic\nand Social Council. Special attention should be paid to the\noperative follow-up to this resolution.\nThe identification of priorities by the United Nations,\nin accordance with changes in international reality, is\nessential to achieving greater efficiency to serve the best\ninterests of the beneficiary countries, as well as those of the\nUnited Nations itself.\nDuring the last five years the United Nations has\nsponsored a series of global conferences to address\nsystematically the key issues facing humanity today. The\nupcoming World Food Summit, which will take place in\nRome from November 13-17 of this year, will close this\nimportant cycle. This summit will provide an opportunity\nto define new strategic objectives for international action in\nthe field of food security in order to overcome structural\nshortages, especially in the nutrition sector, in many regions\nof our planet. In preparation, Italy is promoting a joint\ndevelopment initiative for Angola with the three agricultural\nagencies whose headquarters are in Rome.\nThe process of economic globalization and the\ngrowing interdependence of markets offer enormous\neconomic and social growth possibilities. From this\nperspective, the concept of global partnership provides for\nan equitable sharing of responsibilities. The Ministerial\nMeeting in Singapore is an excellent opportunity to focus\non these issues, consolidating the process of trade\nliberalization sanctioned by the Uruguay Round and\nstrengthening the regulatory role of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO).\nItaly is actively participating in the preparation of the\n1997 special session of the United Nations General\nAssembly dedicated to the environment. While keeping in\nmind the results of the Rio Conference and foreseeable\nfuture scenarios for sustainable development, that session\nshould update the instruments for action and continue to\nstrive for implementation of Agenda 21. In 1996 significant\nachievements have been made in the field of disarmament.\nA major step on the road to nuclear disarmament has of\ncourse been taken with the signing of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. In the field of conventional\nweapons, an important agreement was reached in Florence\nlast June on arms control in the former Yugoslavia. Our\nnext goal should be a cut-off in the production of fissile\nmaterial for military purposes.\nThe Italian Government pledges to renounce once\nand for all the production and export of anti-personnel\nland-mines. We will also initiate the destruction of\nexisting devices and promote further restrictions in the\nhope that such measures will contribute to reaching a\nsolid international understanding and a definitive ban. To\nthis end, we propose the prompt opening of international\nnegotiations at the Conference on Disarmament in\nGeneva.\nThe fundamental role of law in the creation of a new\nworld order must be upheld. National sovereignty has\nnothing to fear from the consolidation of international\nlaw. We believe that the cause of peace can only profit\nfrom the establishment of an international criminal court\non violations of international humanitarian law and crimes\nagainst humanity. Italy is committed to this goal and is\nready to host a diplomatic conference in 1998 to sanction\nthe birth of such a court. Italy is also promoting a\ncampaign for a worldwide moratorium on the application\nof the death penalty.\nThe European Union has constantly emphasized that\nfinancial reform is essential to any modernizing of the\nUnited Nations structure, and we share the ideas\nexpressed on this subject by the Irish presidency. We are\nconvinced that financial reform is a prerequisite to the\nUnited Nations maintaining its crucial function in\ninternational relations. The role that United Nations\nMember States intend to play in pursuing the objectives\nof the Charter cannot be independent of their specific\nresponsibility to honour their financial obligations. We\nfirmly reiterate the validity of the specific proposal for\nfinancial reform presented by the European Union under\nItaly\u2019s presidency during the first half of this year.\nA formidable task awaits us: to adapt our\nOrganization to the needs and the challenges of the\ntwenty-first century. Italy is prepared to spare no effort in\nthe pursuit of our common goals.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure to extend to you,\nSir, on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab\nEmirates, our congratulations on your election as President\nof this session of the General Assembly. Your election is\nindeed an expression of the international community\u2019s faith\nin your competence and vast diplomatic expertise, and of\nthe high esteem in which we hold your friendly country,\nMalaysia. At the same time, allow me to thank sincerely\nyour predecessor, who so ably led the deliberations of the\nprevious session of the General Assembly.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay a\nwarm tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for the positive and important role he has\nplayed in the past few years. My country supports his\nre-election for a second term and appreciates his efforts to\nenhance the role of the Organization in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security.\nThe fifty-first session of the United Nations General\nAssembly is being held amid new international\ncircumstances and developments that have both positively\nand negatively affected the global scene. Despite the\nrelative optimism that has permeated international\nrelations, threats to peace and security and to economic,\nsocial and human development worldwide still remain.\nThe present d\u00e9tente in regional and international relations\ndoes not necessarily mean that the international climate\nhas become more harmonious or homogenous. The\nsecurity and political independence of small States is still\nthreatened by the ambitions of States aspiring to spread\ntheir hegemony and expand at the expense of their\nneighbours.\nThe political situation in the Arabian Gulf region\nduring the past two decades has made us increasingly\nconvinced of the importance of rebuilding confidence\namong the countries of the region. This confidence must\nbe anchored in the principles of full and mutual respect\nfor the sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-\ninterference in the internal affairs of States, and of\nrefraining from the threat or use of force. Every State has\nthe right to choose its political, economic and social\nsystem, to preserve its natural resources and to resort to\npeaceful negotiations as a means of settling disputes\nwithin the context of bilateral, regional and international\ninitiatives and endeavours.\nWe also support the peaceful efforts currently under\nway to complete the demarcation of borders among the\nStates of the region in order to enhance the national\n\n\nsovereignty of each State. This will contribute to the\nachievement of lasting peace, security and stability in the\nregion.\nInspired by our tradition, our history and our\ncommitment to peace, we in the United Arab Emirates\nfirmly believe that the Charter of the United Nations and\nthe principles of international law are the proper means of\nsettling disputes among nations.\nTwenty-five years have passed since the occupation by\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran of our three islands, Greater\nTunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. These are Arab islands,\nboth in their history and in their origin. They are the pillars\nof our national sovereignty, territorial integrity and overall\ninalienable national rights. Since the beginning of the\nconflict, the United Arab Emirates has called on the Iranian\nGovernment to end its occupation of the islands and to\nenter into bilateral negotiations or seek the arbitration of the\nInternational Court of Justice. Referring the case to the\nInternational Court of Justice will ensure that each State has\na chance to submit the relevant legal and historical\ndocuments and evidence to support its claim of sovereignty\nover the three islands.\nDespite our declared peaceful intentions, the mediation\nefforts of some friendly countries and the good offices of\nthe Secretary-General, the Iranian Government rejected our\npeaceful endeavours. It has established and equipped\nfacilities on the three islands whose features are not\nexclusively civilian. It has built an electrical power plant on\nGreater Tunb; and an airport, a refrigeration plant and a\nfish-processing plant on Abu Musa. Moreover, Iranian\nnationals, mostly from the military, have been settled on the\nislands. We view this as a clear act of provocation aimed\nat changing the demographic character of the islands and\nimposing a new fait accompli. Through these acts and by\nignoring the repercussions of such a policy on the peace\nand security of the region and on international navigation,\nIran has consolidated its illegitimate occupation.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has failed to heed the\nrepeated, serious and sincere appeals made by the United\nArab Emirates, the Gulf Co-operation Council, the Arab\nStates of the Gulf, the last Arab Summit meeting, the\nCouncil of the League of Arab States and the States parties\nto the Damascus Declaration to settle the dispute through\npeaceful means. This violates not only our country\u2019s\nnational sovereignty, but also international law and all the\ninternational principles, norms and practices governing\nrelations among States, particularly among neighbouring\nStates.\nWe therefore call on the Government of Iran to\ndismantle all the illegitimately established civilian and\nmilitary facilities on our three islands. We also call upon\nIran to respond to the peace initiatives we have advanced\nand which are supported by sisterly and friendly peace-\nloving countries; to enter into unconditional bilateral\nnegotiations conducive to a peaceful settlement of the\ndispute; or to refer the case to the International Court of\nJustice.\nSecurity, stability and sustainable development are\nurgent needs of societies all over the globe. My country,\nwhich has always supported the inalienable rights of\npeoples to resist occupation and aggression, condemns all\nforms of terrorism and the acts of subversion and\nsabotage facing the international community today. In this\nconnection, we agree with and support all the measures\ntaken by the State of Bahrain to preserve its security, its\nnational sovereignty and its political independence.\nIn this context, we reiterate our full support for the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia in its fight against terrorism in\nall its forms and manifestations, and against all threats to\nits national security. We believe that the member States\nof the Gulf Co-operation Council are bound by the\nthreads of a common destiny defined by the requirements\nof peace and security of the whole region. Terrorism\ndefies all international norms and practices and runs\ncounter to religious and cultural beliefs, which are the\npillars of stability and prosperity for all societies. It must\ntherefore be addressed in an international context.\nThe United Arab Emirates has followed with grave\nconcern the recent developments in Iraq. We reaffirm the\nimportance we attach to preserving Iraq\u2019s national\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. We oppose any\ninterference in its internal affairs and the establishment by\nneighbouring States of safety zones on its territory. In the\nsame context, we support all the measures taken by the\nState of Kuwait to preserve its sovereignty, security and\nterritorial integrity.\nThe escalating human suffering of the Iraqi people\nand the spread of disease and malnutrition call for the\nimmediate and full implementation of Security Council\nresolution 986 (1995). However, the ultimate\nresponsibility for the alleviation of the suffering of the\nIraqi people rests solely with the Government of Iraq.\nThis can be realized only when the Iraqi Government\ncomplies fully with its international obligations under the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. Those obligations\ninclude the release of all Kuwaitis and other nationals\n2\n\n\nimprisoned or detained by Iraq and the return of all Kuwaiti\nproperty still in its possession.\nMy country supported the Agreement on Principles\nconcluded between the Republic of Yemen and Eritrea on\nthe Hanish archipelago. We renew our call to the two\nGovernments to commit to the principle of peaceful\nsettlement through international arbitration so that peace\nand security can prevail in this region. We take this\nopportunity to express our appreciation to the Government\nof France for its mediation efforts.\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomed the peace\nnegotiations in the Middle East, beginning with the Madrid\nConference through the subsequent agreements relative to\nthe question of Palestine. We are disappointed by the\nposition of the Israeli Government, which has not honoured\nthe commitments entered into by its predecessor. The Israeli\nGovernment has refused to withdraw from the city of\nHebron, and has embarked on an expansion of its\nillegitimate settlement activities. More recently, it opened\na tunnel adjacent to Al-Haram al-Sharif, the Noble\nSanctuary, which threatens the structures of the Al-Aqsa\nMosque and alters the demographic character and legal\nstatus of the city of Jerusalem. This is an act of provocation\nthat will arouse the feelings of Arabs and Muslims, and will\nobstruct the achievement of a just, comprehensive and\nlasting peace settlement to the Middle East problem and the\nPalestinian question.\nAt the Security Council meeting held last week, the\ninternational community reaffirmed its solidarity with the\nPalestinian people, its support of the peace process, and its\nopposition to all the measures recently taken by the Israeli\nGovernment. The United Arab Emirates condemns all the\nacts of violence recently committed by the Israeli occupying\nauthorities against the Palestinian people, which resulted in\nfiring at and thus the martyrdom of many Palestinians, in\naddition to the injuries sustained by many more. We call on\nthe Israeli Government to put an end to its barbaric\npractices, which run counter to the most basic norms of\ninternational humanitarian law.\nThe Arab parties are determined to pursue the peace\nprocess as an objective and a strategic option to which there\nis no alternative. This calls for a reciprocal commitment by\nthe Israeli side, without any further delay or procrastination.\nThis commitment must be proven by the actual,\nunconditional implementation of all relevant agreements\nthus far concluded, to enable the Palestinian people to\nexercise their legitimate rights, including their right to self-\ndetermination and to the establishment of their own\nindependent State, with Jerusalem as its capital. It must\nalso include full Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Golan\nto the 4 June 1967 line, and from southern Lebanon and\nthe western Bekaa, to the internationally recognized\nb o r d e r s , p u r s u a n t t o S e c u r i t y C o u n c i l\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978), and\nthe principle of land for peace. These measures will\nguarantee balanced and equitable security for all the\nStates of the region, and realize their peoples\u2019 aspirations\nfor a new era of comprehensive economic and social\ndevelopment.\nWe fully subscribe to the international call for a\nregional and international nuclear-test ban, and for the\nestablishment of international zones free of all weapons\nof mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons. These\nweapons pose a grave danger to our health, our\nenvironment and our natural resources. I recently had the\nhonour to sign, on behalf of the United Arab Emirates,\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, thus\nenhancing its universality. We call upon the international\ncommunity and the relevant international bodies to spare\nno effort to make the Middle East and the Arab Gulf\nregion a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction,\nincluding nuclear weapons. The international community\nmust call on Israel to accede to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and to comply with the\ninternational safeguards regime of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency.\nDespite the efforts and good offices of the League of\nArab States and the United Nations to save Somalia from\nits predicament, the civil war there continues unabated,\nand the deteriorating humanitarian situation is cause for\ngrave concern. We therefore appeal to the rival Somali\nfaction leaders to shoulder their responsibility and bring\nthis tragic bloodshed to an end. They must set aside their\ndifferences and form a national Government representing\nall the factions of the Somali people, a Government that\ncan restore to Somalia its national unity, territorial\nintegrity, security and stability.\nPolitical developments in the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina testify to the importance that the\ninternational community attaches to the Dayton Peace\nAgreement, with a view to restoring normal conditions in\nthe Republic. My country supported that Agreement. We\nconsider it the first constructive step on the road to a just\nand permanent settlement of the Balkan problem. We\nwelcome the results of the recent elections in the\nRepublic of Bosnia Herzegovina. We hope that these\nelections will safeguard the territorial integrity of the\n3\n\n\nRepublic and contribute to the establishment of democratic\ninstitutions. We also hope that they will help restore normal\nrelations among the Bosnian people and pave the way for\nreconstruction, following the war\u2019s devastation. Peace,\nsecurity and stability can then return to this tormented\nregion. We take this opportunity to stress the importance of\nbringing to justice war criminals who have committed\nheinous crimes against humanity and humanitarian\ninternational law in the former Yugoslavia.\nThe tragic events, raging wars and civil strife, and\nuntold human suffering of the peoples of some African\ncountries, are cause for grave concern. In view of the\nhistoric relations that bind our countries together, we\nreiterate our support for the efforts of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity in cooperation with the United Nations to\ncontain the conflicts by peaceful means so that their\npeoples\u2019 aspirations to peace, security, stability and\ndevelopment may be realized.\nThe economic and social gap between the nations of\nthe world is still wide in spite of positive political and\neconomic developments on the regional and international\nscene, the creation of economic blocs, and free trade in the\nworld. This has led to the exacerbation of poverty, illiteracy\nand disease in many developing countries. Those countries\nare already ailing under the heavy burden of debt and debt-\nservicing, and are suffering from the deterioration of living\nstandards and dwindling development assistance from\ndeveloped countries, in addition to trade barriers adversely\naffecting their economies.\nThe world conferences held over the past five years\nachieved important results, and their recommendations have\nbecome important strategies aimed at creating an equitable\nand prosperous international environment. The international\ncommunity, which is still plagued by persistent violence,\norganized crime, drugs and terrorism, must translate these\nrecommendations into a reality that will guarantee equitable\neconomic and social development and the free flow of trade\nbetween the developed and the developing countries.\nWe firmly believe that this Organization still\nrepresents mankind\u2019s conscience in the face of lingering\nworld problems. To enhance its role under the Charter, the\ninternational community needs to provide the necessary\npolitical, financial and moral support to the Organization.\nWe must undertake major structural reforms, enlarge the\nSecurity Council membership in accordance with the\nprinciple of equitable geographic distribution, and improve\nthe functioning of the General Assembly, the Economic and\nSocial Council and the specialized agencies, so that they\ncan respond adequately to current regional and\ninternational developments.\nI would also like to stress the importance of\ncooperation, consultation and coordination between the\nUnited Nations and regional organizations. These\norganizations can assist the United Nations to arrive at a\nbetter understanding of regional problems that can affect\npeace, security and sustainable development.\nIn conclusion, we hope that our aspirations will find\nproper expression in the commitment by the States of the\nworld to the Charter of the United Nations and the\nprinciples of international law. We look forward to the\nrealization of the noble objectives of this Organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to congratulate you, Sir,\non your election and to wish you success in carrying out\nyour duties during the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly. I wish all of us a productive and fruitful session\nof the General Assembly and assure members of the full\ncooperation of the delegation of Latvia in ensuring the\nsuccess of their work.\n\u201cReform\u201d was a much-used word during the previous\nsession of this body. The word \u201ccrisis\u201d may become just as\nprevalent during the fifty-first session. In this connection,\nI should like to recall the words of United States President\nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy:\n\u201cWhen written in Chinese, the word crisis' is\ncomposed of two characters. One represents danger\nand the other represents opportunity.\u201d\nSince joining the United Nations five years ago, Latvia\nhas consistently supported reforms so as to avoid crises.\nOur 50-year absence from the international community\nmakes us especially appreciate the fact that this rostrum is\nthe one place in the world from which all nations can speak\nwith an equal voice about matters of global importance.\nA statement from this rostrum is a means rather than\nan end. It can be but the first of many steps to a level of\nhuman development that Immanuel Kant characterized as\neternal peace. Too often the closest we come to attaining\nthe ideal of a world without wars and the United Nations as\nthe maintainer of international peace and security is the\nestablishment of the mechanisms needed to halt armed\nconflict. In this connection, may I recall that the joint\nEstonian-Latvian-Lithuanian peacekeeping battalion, whose\ntraining period will conclude next year, will be a\ncontribution of the Baltic States to the strengthening of\nthe mechanisms for peacekeeping and peacemaking\nestablished by the United Nations.\nThe current world situation forces us to question\nhow often we have been too late, how often we have been\nfound lacking in wisdom, foresight and effective\ndiplomacy in our attempts to resolve disputes peacefully.\nSomalia, former Yugoslavia, Chechnya, Rwanda \u2014 these\nare not the only areas that have suffered recently. These\nare problems for the entire global community, not only\nthe United Nations. It makes us think how far we are\nfrom the ideal of eternal world peace, which few believe\npossible, but whose realization is one of the fundamental\npurposes of the United Nations. We all agree that peace\nis a fundamental value and that war means catastrophe\nand destruction. Still, we live in a world in which armed\nconflicts constantly arise; where some profit from war;\nand where relationships of dominance, the rules of the\ngame, and differing values do not exclude war as a\nmechanism for pursuing national interests.\nReducing the possibility of local conflicts is an\nimportant aspect of global security. Any local armed\nconflict affects the global society as a whole, especially\nin our rapidly changing and shrinking world, in which the\nnotions of distance, speed and information change rapidly.\nInternational terrorism, the illegal trade in weapons and\nnarcotics, people fleeing their homes and other\nconsequences accompany local conflicts, but do not limit\nthemselves to the conflict zone alone. Political instability\nand racial, religious and ethnic discord, combined with\nlow standards of living, breed armed conflicts. As\npreventive measures, the United Nations must continue to\npromote actively a respect for human rights, tolerance, the\nuniversality of the United Nations, disarmament and the\nimplementation of arms-control agreements, and support\nthe economies of States that may need assistance.\nWe hail the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT), which has opened for signature and ratification\nafter a long and difficult search for compromise. I intend\nto sign the CTBT today. We are convinced that this\nTreaty can move the world closer to peace. Latvia\nconsiders it imperative that work be continued on the\ncontrol of conventional weapons. We support the\nchemical weapons Convention, even though we are\nconcerned that the two largest producers of chemical\nweapons have not yet ratified the Convention.\n5\n\n\nLatvia believes that universal respect for human rights\nshould continue to be a priority of the United Nations and\nits Members. Taking into account the ever-increasing tasks\nof the United Nations human rights system, increased\nallocation of resources devoted to United Nations human\nrights activities is an absolute necessity. Double standards\non human rights are intolerable, and Latvia devotes\nparticular attention to this. The guidelines for the global\nprotection of human rights are the documents adopted at the\nWorld Conference on Human Rights. Countries should\nimplement these guidelines and share with others their\nexperience in doing so.\nIn Latvia these guidelines have been applied to a\nunique demographic situation caused by 50 years of\noccupation. In accordance with a recommendation of the\nWorld Conference on Human Rights, Latvia has established\nan independent institution for the protection of human\nrights: the State Human Rights Office. This office has a\nmandate to hear and investigate complaints from Latvia\u2019s\nresidents, inform members of society about human rights,\nand make recommendations to the Government and\nParliament on legislation affecting human rights. In\nestablishing the State Human Rights Office, Latvia received\ninvaluable assistance from the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and\nthe Centre for Human Rights.\nThe United Nations must continue to protect those\nvalues that engender a respect for human rights, tolerance,\nthe rejection of violence and the promotion of peace. It is\nnot weapons or physical force that protect homes, people\nand countries. Rather, true security depends, inter alia, on\ngood relations with all neighbours and on a strong\neconomy. Latvia is successfully implementing such a\npolicy. Our aim is to achieve rapid economic growth and to\nattract foreign investment in Latvia. Already this year,\nLatvia has one of the lowest rates of inflation in Eastern\nEurope, along with a stable currency and rapidly rising\nindexes of development. We have a well developed port\nsystem, including the world\u2019s second largest potassium-\nsalts-loading harbour and one of Europe\u2019s largest harbours\nfor the transit of petroleum products.\nLatvia is the geographical centre of the Baltic States\nand is a natural economic bridge between East and West.\nOur country belongs to the European family of democratic\nStates, sharing common values and cooperating for their\nprotection. Integration in the European and transatlantic\nstructures is the highest priority for Latvia. We are actively\nworking for the integration of Latvia into the European and\nglobal economic systems, as well as for a close partnership\nin the European continent, on both the governmental and\nnon-governmental levels.\nLatvia is also participating in efforts to improve the\nwork of the United Nations so that the Organization can\nreact more effectively to the challenges of our time. In\nsupport of the restructuring and revitalization of the\nUnited Nations in the economic, social and related fields,\nand in recognition of the desirability of frequent rotation\nof Member States represented on important United\nNations bodies, Latvia has for the first time ever\npresented its candidature for a seat on the Economic and\nSocial Council beginning in 1997.\nA year has passed since the United Nations\ncelebrated its fiftieth anniversary, when much was heard\nabout the urgency of reform of the Organization. Yet\nduring the last year Member States have been unable to\nagree on these long-awaited reforms. If Member States\ncontinue not to make decisions, the United Nations will\nslowly but inevitably lose its ability to pursue its global\ngoals effectively. As part of the reform efforts, it is\nimportant that the United Nations periodically enunciate\nand evaluate priorities to be pursued, in particular in\ntimes when resources are limited but the demand for them\nis growing.\nOne cause of the crisis facing the United Nations is\nthe financial situation. Each Member State's financial\ncontribution to the Organization must reflect its capacity\nto pay. Contributions can be a great burden for\ndeveloping countries and countries with economies in\ntransition that are overassessed. A future system of\ncontributions must be fair, transparent and elastic in order\nthat it may readily adapt to economic changes.\nLatvia would like to repeat its view that new and\ninnovative financing mechanisms are a necessity. It\nsupports the current effort of the Economic and Social\nCouncil to study such mechanisms for the purpose of\nfinancing development that is sustainable. The\nintroduction of new financing mechanisms and other\nfinancial management tools can only improve the\ncurrently weak financial discipline of Member States.\nLatvia supports reforms that would result in the\nreduction of the number of subsidiary bodies of the\nGeneral Assembly and the number of administrative\nstructures in the Secretariat, as well as a full introduction\nof methods of modern management.\n6\n\n\nWith regard to the reform of the Security Council, a\npriority should be to adjust its membership in order to\nachieve equitable geographic representation and to respond\nto the increase in the membership of the United Nations in\nrecent decades. The effectiveness of the work of the\nSecurity Council must be increased further by making its\nworking methods even more transparent and the exchange\nof information with non-members more intense than at\npresent.\nLatvia is a country that is attached to the ideals of\npeace, democracy and human rights. It identifies itself with\nthe efforts of the global society to maintain and realize\nthese ideals. It is an active member of the community of\nnations. This, we are convinced, is the genuine road to\nsecurity and social and economic prosperity for our country\nand for the world.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on behalf\nof my delegation, upon your election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at this session. Your selection is not\nonly a recognition of the contributions of your country,\nMalaysia, in the defence of the ideals of the United Nations\nbut is also a confirmation of your talents as an experienced\ndiplomat.\nAllow me also to express my thanks to your\npredecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for his masterful\nguidance of the historic commemorative session of the\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\nI would like to pay once again a well-deserved tribute\nto our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and\nto reiterate our support for his constant efforts on behalf of\npeace and development.\nMay I also transmit to our Assembly the message of\nhope and the wishes for success of the President of the\nRepublic of Chad, General Idriss Deby.\nThe life of a nation is often stamped by events\nwritten in golden letters in the great book of their history.\n1996 is going to be one of those pivotal years along the\nroad to democracy in Chad. Indeed, at preceding sessions,\nChadian delegations regularly informed our Assembly of\nthe substantial progress achieved in this area. I can affirm\nto you today that the process is ongoing, is getting\nstronger and becoming day by day an irreversible reality.\nI offer as proof the two major elections that took place\npeacefully and quietly.\nFirst, last March, the people of Chad gained a\nConstitution that then gave them the opportunity to elect\nfreely and democratically for the first time in their\nhistory, with direct universal suffrage, a President of the\nRepublic from among 15 candidates. Yes, after two hard-\nfought rounds of voting the people of Chad chose\nPresident Idriss Deby, who was officially inaugurated as\nPresident of the Republic of Chad on 8 August 1996 for\na term of five years.\nNonetheless, the process is still under way. Before\nthe end of the year the people of Chad will be called\nupon to elect their representatives to the future national\nassembly. The parliamentary election will bring to a close\nthe first phase in the establishment of the institutions\ncalled for by the Constitution.\nNumerous international observers were present in\nour country during the elections. They observed that the\nelections took place properly and that the Chadians\nshowed discipline and political maturity. The organization\nof the elections would not have been possible without the\ncontributions of Chad\u2019s traditional friends, most notably,\nFrance, the United Nations system and international and\nnon-governmental organizations. This contribution\nsupplemented the efforts of the Government of Chad\nitself, which, despite its serious economic and financial\nconstraints, assumed a part of the financing of the\noperations. Here we wish to thank all those whose\nmultifaceted support and assistance made it possible to\nachieve these happy results. I take this opportunity to\nagain appeal urgently to the international community to\nsupport Chad in the organization of future elections, in\nparticular the legislative elections scheduled for next\nDecember.\n4\n\n\nIt is often said that there can be no lasting economic\ndevelopment without democracy. The latter, as we all\nknow, is a long, evolving process. Thus, slowly, patiently,\nat its own pace and in the light of its own realities, Chad is\nproviding itself with the democratic institutions that must\nsupport its socio-economic development efforts, which is\nthe highest priority of the programme of action of the\nGovernment of Chad.\nThus, like a host of other countries, Chad has\ndeveloped, in collaboration with the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, a structural adjustment programme. It has also\njust negotiated and concluded with the Paris Club of\nIndustrial Country Creditors a partial deferment and\nrescheduling of its public debt. These actions are designed\nto control Government expenditure and ultimately to reduce\nthe current budget deficit. The main goal is to arrive at a\nsurplus which would allow Chad to build the basic\ninfrastructures which are essential to the promotion and\ndevelopment of economic activities. The Government of\nChad is also re-energizing its private sector, which\ngenerates employment, privatizing State enterprises and\nvigorously reforming tax-collection services and economic\ndevelopment programmes.\nAnother concern of my Government is the constant\nquest for peace and security. As the Assembly knows, war\nhas stalked my country for more than two decades, which\nhas completely undermined its structures. This is why we\nmust work to restore peace and security, which inevitably\ninvolves regaining control of the army. I can affirm to the\nAssembly that efforts have been made and are continuing\nto this end. Thanks to friendly countries and the World\nBank, more than 21,000 soldiers have been demobilized, an\noperation which will continue. However, our demobilization\nefforts will be in vain if this means putting out onto the\nstreet men who know how to handle weapons and are\ncapable of causing unrest and insecurity. This is why a\nprogramme to reintegrate them into society must be\nimplemented immediately. Only then will the reform\nprogramme succeed and ensure that we have a disciplined\narmy, a true melting pot of the nation, at the service of\ndevelopment: this is our ambition.\nThe aftermath of war must be overcome, and at the\ntop of our list of priorities is to de-mine an area equivalent\nto one quarter of our national territory. The mines planted\nduring the occupation of part of our country continue\nindiscriminately to kill and mutilate civilians, women and\nchildren in particular. This is an alarming situation because\nit hinders any development programme in a region which,\nnonetheless, has enormous potential for mining and tourism.\nIt goes without saying that national rehabilitation\ncannot succeed, once again, without the assistance of the\ninternational community.\nAs far as my country is concerned, and despite the\nproblems I have just mentioned, Chad is resolutely\ndetermined to work for sustainable socio-economic\ndevelopment. The people of Chad, in an atmosphere of\npeace and freedom, decided to unite for the sake of their\nown development. To this end, we would like to see\nincreasing external assistance, so designed to help us to\nreach the point where we no longer need such assistance.\nHelp us to develop, so that we do not become too great\na burden on the countries represented here. That is our\nmessage to the developed countries.\nThe international situation is also of concern to us.\nChad is not alone in the world, and what happens in that\nworld, even if it is beyond us and if matters are settled\noutside Chad, concerns us all the same. The rampant\ncrises in various parts of the world raise the question of\nwhat became of the hopes that were raised by the end of\nthe cold war. We in Africa applaud the progress towards\nrestoring peace and security in countries such as\nMozambique, Angola and Liberia. But these achievements\nhave to be consolidated. We can do this if we mobilize\nourselves and shoulder our responsibilities.\nWe deplore the situation of latent war in Somalia\nand the Great Lakes region. Genuine efforts should be\nmade by the international community; the parties involved\nalso need to show political will to end their fratricidal\nconfrontations.\nThe challenge is the same in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, where implementation of the Dayton Peace\nAgreement must be vigorously supported so that a\npermanent peace can be established in that part of the\nworld.\nIn the Middle East, the peace process which began\nwith Israeli and Palestinian reconciliation seems to have\nbeen thrown into question in the light of events in recent\nweeks. We pay tribute to the very recent diplomatic\ninitiatives to try and restore dialogue between the\ndifferent parties, despite the lukewarm results. Chad\nexhorts them to respect their commitments to avoid a new\nflare-up in the region.\nMy country fully endorses the numerous efforts\nmade with regard to disarmament. Thus we welcomed\nwith satisfaction the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone\n5\n\n\nTreaty signed in Cairo, the non-aggression pact in Central\nAfrica signed in Yaound\u00e9 and the adoption here in New\nYork of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\nwhich Chad signed this very morning.\nSimilarly, faced with the horror caused by mines,\nthose deadly devices, Chad welcomes the initiatives taken\nto eliminate them. Consequently, we are prepared to\nsupport any measure to that end.\nThe 1990s will have been devoted to attempts to find\nglobal solutions to the serious economic, social and\nenvironmental problems facing part of humankind. Chad, as\na Sahelian country, welcomes the entry into force of the\nConvention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\nparticularly in Africa and hopes to see rapid implementation\nof its provisions.\nWe also hope that the forthcoming World Food\nSummit will meet expectations in terms of food security\nand water management, issues which give rise to often\ndeadly conflict. Moreover, we should meet the new\nchallenges facing the world: drugs, organized crime,\npandemics, terrorism and religious intolerance. Increased\ninternational cooperation seems essential if we are to\neliminate these scourges which Governments cannot deal\nwith individually.\nHere, I would like to congratulate the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund for its actions on behalf of children, in\nparticular its vaccination programmes, including the\nprogramme to eradicate poliomyelitis before the year 2000.\nWe also encourage the World Health Organization to step\nup its efforts to contain and eliminate the modern\npandemic, AIDS.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of our Organization provided\nan opportunity for the international community to think\nabout the future, reform and how to re-energize the United\nNations.\nBut, like all human activities, only by making all this\na reality will our Organization be able to achieve the ideals\nof peace, security and well-being laid down in the Charter\nand to which our peoples aspire.\nI cannot conclude without joining with many\npreceding speakers in paying tribute to the immense work\ndone over the last four years by our Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. His action on all fronts, and the\navailability, willingness and courage of the Secretary-\nGeneral have enabled our Organization to foresee and\nresolve many conflicts. In that connection, I want to make\nit very clear that our country, Chad, will support the\nSecretary-General without reservation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of\nthe people and the Government of Papua New Guinea, I\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to preside\nover the General Assembly at its fifty-first session. The\nwarm relations that have developed between our two\nnations make it a particular pleasure to welcome you to\nyour high office and to wish you well in carrying out\nyour duties. I would also like to record our sincere\nappreciation for the wise leadership with which your\npredecessor guided our deliberations during the historic\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly.\nThe rapid approach of the year 2000 raises the\nquestion whether \u2014 and how \u2014 we are going to try to\nmake the turn of the century a turning point for the\nUnited Nations. Despite the many thought-provoking\nspeeches made for the fiftieth anniversary, I regret to say\nthat signs of fundamental and far-reaching changes\nrequired remain elusive. Yet we live at a time when the\nonly constant factor is change. The preamble to its\nCharter makes it quite clear that the United Nations itself\nwas \u2014 and is \u2014 intended to be an agent of change. If\nour Organization is to remain relevant to the challenges\nahead, then it, and we the Members, must adapt and keep\non adapting, as the world continues to change.\nInvented to raise humanity\u2019s sights beyond the\nhorizon of destruction caused by world war, the United\nNations must be continuously reinvented in order to play\nan effective role in a rapidly changing world. The United\nNations has in fact been successful at one kind of change:\nadding to our agenda responsibilities and activities in\nareas such as peacekeeping, peacemaking, human rights\nand sustainable development. It has, however, been very\nmuch less successful in rationalizing its operations and\nadministrative support.\nHumanity needs a much more focused, trim and vital\nUnited Nations. Without internal reform, the risk of\noverload is only too real \u2014 and, arguably, overload is\nalready here. Even more importantly, we, the Members of\nthe United Nations, have to do more, much more, to\nadapt key institutions to the changed and still-changing\ncircumstances of a post-colonial, post-cold-war world.\nAlmost everyone agrees what the main issues and\noptions are. Yet as far as its permanent membership goes,\nthe Security Council in particular remains, much as it has\nalways been, the product of decisions made before most\nMember States became independent. Some of the\nstrongest critics of the cost and alleged inefficiencies\nof the United Nations come from States that are among\nthe slowest in paying their membership dues. While\nthey criticize weaknesses in the Organization\u2019s\nperformance, they are often among the most eager\n4\n\n\nadvocates of giving it new assignments. Their\nactions \u2014 and inaction \u2014 suggest that they confuse\ncutbacks in the resources available to the United Nations\nwith real reform.\nLike other members of the Non-Aligned Movement,\nPapua New Guinea is firmly committed to reforming the\nSecurity Council. While we recognize that those whom\nexisting arrangements most favour are well placed to delay\nor block change, we firmly believe that the Council\u2019s\ncomposition should be altered. It must take better account\nof the geographical distribution and sovereign equality of\nMember States. Concerned that it seems to be taking longer\nto reform than it originally took to form the United Nations,\nPapua New Guinea\u2019s voice and vote are emphatically for\nchange. We believe that the time for action is now.\nPapua New Guinea has embarked on an ambitious\nprogramme of domestic reforms, including both\nconstitutional and economic-policy changes. Having\nlegislated a new system of provincial and local-level\ngovernments in order to improve the delivery of services to\nour people, we are actively engaged in implementation.\nTwenty-one years after giving ourselves a \u201chome-grown\u201d\nConstitution, we are now engaged in a comprehensive\nprocess of reform that is equally \u201chome-grown\u201d.\nMy Government is just as determined to bring about\ncomprehensive structural adjustment. Following decisions\nto devalue and float our national currency, the kina, we are\nnow reducing the size of the public sector. We are making\nthe official interface with the private sector more\nbusiness-friendly and encouraging commercial enterprise.\nWhile international agencies and foreign aid donors provide\nvaluable support, the impulse, direction and pace of reform\nare emphatically Papua New Guinea\u2019s own. Being a\nmember of the Government that led Papua New Guinea to\nits independence, I cannot allow our national sovereignty \u2014\nor our Government\u2019s ability to respond to our people\u2019s\nneeds \u2014 to be compromised now.\nExperience of the difficulties of reform at home has\nreinforced my Government\u2019s commitment to reforming the\nUnited Nations. The principles remain the same. We\nstrongly support efforts to ensure that the world has a truly\neffective, flexible and responsive Organization through\nwhich to cooperate in meeting the challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century.\nThe United Nations is founded on the idea that\nsecurity involves much more than military defence against\nthreats of armed attack. Conscious of the threats and\nlimitations on self-defence that we face together with\nother small island developing countries, Papua New\nGuinea has always regarded collective security as an\nimportant key to national security. Diplomacy is the\nmeans by which we seek to cooperate with all other\nStates committed to peace.\nAs the current Chairman of the Melanesian\nSpearhead Group (MSG), I am pleased to report that we\nwelcomed Fiji as a new member at our Summit in June.\nWe also adopted a document \u2014 \u201cMelanesia Beyond\n2000\u201d \u2014 which outlines our objectives and strategy for\nthe MSG\u2019s second decade.\nWe have emphasized our commitment to cooperation\non a wide basis and have also agreed to a proposal on\nweapons control. The South Pacific Forum is developing\nthe idea on a region-wide basis. Following the extreme\noutrage that the South Pacific felt when France resumed\nits testing programme in French Polynesia last year, I can\nnow report that the programme has ceased. The remaining\nnuclear Powers with interests in our region \u2014 France, the\nUnited Kingdom and the United States of America \u2014\nhave signed the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty\n(Treaty of Rarotonga). France has been readmitted as a\npost-Forum dialogue partner.\nAs much as we welcome the developments during\nthe past 12 months, Papua New Guinea believes that\nmore is required before our region can be described as\ngenuinely nuclear-free. Outstanding needs include a\nbroader treaty, systematic monitoring of former test-sites,\ncleaning up, compensation and the provision of alternative\nsources of income for the people of French Polynesia.\nThe Treaty of Rarotonga is complemented by the\nMSG\u2019s Lakatoro Declaration on Denuclearization in\nOceania. Subregional and regional efforts are again\ncomplemented by similar arrangements negotiated during\nthe past year in South-East Asia and Africa, as well as by\nthe much older arrangements that apply to Antarctica and\nLatin America. Papua New Guinea welcomes the\nBrazilian proposal to link these arrangements into a\ncomprehensive nuclear-weapon-free zone covering the\nentire southern hemisphere. Having supported the recent\npassage of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\nwe would now like to see it extended to outlawing\nsimulations, limiting the development and acquisition of\nnew nuclear weapons and, ultimately, bringing about\ncomplete disarmament.\n5\n\n\nThe South Pacific Forum has expressed support for the\nearly conclusion of negotiations over a legal regime\ncovering civil liability for nuclear damage.\nCommitted to furthering cooperation against threats to\nour region, the South Pacific Forum is working on an\narrangement through which member States can respond to\nlegitimate requests for assistance from one another\u2019s\ndisciplined services, including police. The same\narrangement could also be used for consultations intended\nto help prevent, manage and settle disputes. We continue to\nbroaden, deepen and diversify other areas of security\ncooperation, including law enforcement.\nConsistent with agreements reached at the regional\nlevel, Papua New Guinea has adopted a comprehensive\ncode of logging practice designed to promote the\nsustainable use and in-country processing of a rich\nrenewable natural resource.\nWe are gravely concerned at the threat that climate\nchange poses to the very survival of low-lying atolls. Entire\ncountries in our region face the risk of extinction. Papua\nNew Guinea joins with other developing countries in calling\non the advanced industrialized countries to look beyond\ntheir immediate self-interest and adopt specific targets for\nreducing greenhouse emissions, an issue which generates\nconsiderable emotion among us.\nTogether with other coastal States in the region, we\nlook to distant-water fishing nations for cooperation in\ngiving effect to the United Nations Agreement on straddling\nfish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks so that it does\nnot weaken existing regional arrangements.\nIn the wider Asia-Pacific region, Papua New Guinea\ncalls for a reduction of avoidable sources of stress,\nuncertainty and risk on the Korean Peninsula, both for the\nsake of the countries directly involved and because of their\npotentially adverse effects on other countries.\nConcerned about events earlier in the year, I repeat\nlast year\u2019s call for the United Nations to do its best to ease\nthe tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.\nImportant regional organizations in the Asia-Pacific have\nfound ways of following the principle within the region.\nThe European Parliament has adopted a resolution\nrecommending that the United Nations identify options for\nTaiwan to take part in the activities of bodies answerable to\nthe General Assembly. The United Nations has an\nobligation to assist in maintaining a secure environment in\nwhich economic growth and other forms of development\ncan continue for the benefit of the peoples of the region\nas well as their partners around the world. It is therefore\ntime to address the question of Taiwanese participation in\ninstitutions and processes set up to further the universal\nobjectives of the United Nations Charter.\nRespect for the national sovereignty of Member\nStates is basic to the United Nations Charter. Small island\ndeveloping countries tend to be especially vulnerable to\na wide range of possible threats. Their development, and\neven their very survival, often depend on international\ncooperation and law.\nHaving achieved national independence under United\nNations supervision, Papua New Guinea is firmly\ncommitted to the United Nations Special Committee on\nthe Situation With Regard to the Implementation of the\nDeclaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial\nCountries and Peoples. Despite criticism from certain\nquarters, we were therefore pleased to welcome and host\nthe Special Committee\u2019s regional seminar held in Port\nMoresby in June. Together with all other members of the\nMelanesian Spearhead Group and the South Pacific\nForum, we remain firmly committed to the orderly\ndecolonization of New Caledonia, with special safeguards\nfor the indigenous Kanaks. We will not accept illegitimate\nattempts to delay or derail complete implementation of\nthe Matignon Agreements. Having reviewed the French\nGovernment\u2019s record elsewhere in the region, we ask\nourselves whether French Polynesia, as well as Walis and\nFutuna, should be included in the United Nations list of\nNon-Self-Governing Territories. The international\ncommunity has a duty to see that France meets its\nresponsibilities to the people of our region and a prime\nresponsibility must be the right of self-determination.\nOn Bougainville, my Government is firmly\ncommitted to doing all that we can to resolve the crisis\nthat has racked the Bougainville Province in my country\nsince 1989. I therefore negotiated a cease-fire, arranged\na regional peacekeeping force and agreed to peace talks\nin October 1994, only to find that the militant leaders\nwould not honour the agreements reached. Even so, my\nGovernment has been prepared to talk to those who will\ntalk to us. We have established the Bougainville\nTransitional Government and continue to provide\nprotection for people forced to flee from their homes by\nthe criminal actions of an armed and militant minority.\nWe continue to restore services and to encourage\nreconciliation, but the mounting toll of destruction, injury\nand loss of life caused by the militants gave the National\n6\n\n\nGovernment no alternative but to lift the ceasefire on 21\nMarch this year.\nEven now, rival gangs of armed criminals continue to\nthreaten the lives of innocent people, trying to destroy what\nthe people, provincial leaders and the national Government\nare doing and reconstructing. They undermine all efforts to\nmaintain the rule of law. In a particularly barbaric attack on\n8 September this year, 12 members of our security forces\nwere killed at the Kangu Care Centre in South\nBougainville.\nDespite the worst efforts of the Bougainville\nRevolutionary Army and its sympathizers abroad, my\nGovernment is standing firm. We will not give them the\nsatisfaction of departing from our basic objective of\nrestoring peace and rebuilding all they have destroyed.\nWe appreciate the understanding displayed by the\nUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights when it\nconsidered the Bougainville situation earlier this year. It has\nalways been a complex domestic issue. In keeping with the\nmutual respect for national sovereignty that is basic to\ninternational law, Papua New Guinea calls on all other\nStates to refrain from statements and actions that send\nmisleading signals to those who violate our laws; to\ncooperate in preventing smuggling and other illegal\nviolations of our borders; and generally to prevent outsiders\nfrom interfering illegally in Papua New Guinea\u2019s internal\naffairs. In so doing, we add the reminder that it is not the\nforeign meddlers who will suffer most from the effects of\nthe crisis \u2014 it will be the people of Papua New Guinea,\nincluding the overwhelming majority of Bougainvilleans,\nwho consider themselves to be part of our nation and\nentitled to the same rights as all other Papua New\nGuineans.\nConscious of the violations that have occurred on all\nsides and of the need to avoid any repetition, my\nGovernment is in the process of trying to strengthen\nexisting arrangements by establishing a national commission\non human rights.\nMy Government has embarked on an ambitious\nprogramme of structural adjustment, because we \u2014 and not\nsome outside body \u2014 think that we should in order to\nensure that development can be sustained for future\ngenerations. While we accept external advice and appreciate\nexternal assistance, we have not yielded to, and will not\ngive in to, external pressure. It is crucial that the official\nconduct of such bodies not raise basic questions about\nrelations between these institutions and the sovereignty of\nthe member States that they are supposed to serve.\nNational and collective self-reliance are both means\nof achieving and integral to the objective of sustainable\ndevelopment. They are critical to maintaining and\nstrengthening the security and sovereignty of States.\nNational self-reliance is among Papua New Guinea\u2019s\nconstitutional goals and directive principles. Collective\nself-reliance through South Pacific cooperation is among\nthe commitments contained in my Government\u2019s Pacific\nPlan and implemented through our current national\nbudget.\nMy Government\u2019s proposal that Papua New Guinea\nshould enter into a form of permanent association with\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) is\nintended to further the process by which we cooperate\nwith neighbouring countries to promote collective\nself-reliance. We appreciate the positive interest that\nASEAN members have expressed in the idea and we\nstrongly support closer cooperation between ASEAN and\nthe South Pacific Forum.\nAs the only Pacific island country directly involved\nin the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council\n(APEC), but by no means the only such country likely to\nbe affected by the process, Papua New Guinea has\nproposed that APEC set up a scheme to help build\ncapacity among the 13 small island developing countries\nin the region so that they are not left or pushed behind.\nThe proposal that we are now developing in greater\ndetail is emphatically not intended to be yet another\nopen-ended aid programme under a different name.\nRather, it is intended to help small island countries\nmanage their way through the transition to the\nachievement of APEC\u2019s vision of open-ended regional\nfree trade by the year 2020.\nAs an active participant in institutions established\nunder the Lom\u00e9 Convention, Papua New Guinea would\nlike to encourage other member States to give early\nconsideration to the kinds of changes that would facilitate\ndevelopment processes and objectives consistent with\nWorld Trade Organization rules.\nConscious of the aid fatigue now spreading through\nmany advanced industrial countries, we urge Governments\nand people of goodwill to recognize the time and effort\nthat development requires. With a few very honourable\nexceptions, donor countries have not reached \u2014 and in\n7\n\n\nmany cases have fallen far behind \u2014 aid targets to which\nthey agreed a generation ago.\nThus, not only has aid been reduced, but recipients are\neven more locked and tied to donors\u2019 own preferences. The\neffect that the failure to honour commitments can have on\nnational forward planning can be very severe. It underlines\nthe need for a reduced reliance on aid and for the\ndevelopment of a greater degree of self-reliance.\nIn view of the vital role that the business sector can\nplay in mobilizing capital for investment and trade, we\nwelcome schemes designed to assist in the development of\nthe private sector. We especially welcome the contributions\nmade to such schemes by the advanced industrial countries.\nWe cannot achieve all our reforms without the support\nof world institutions. That is accepted. However, those\ninstitutions themselves need to operate with greater\nflexibility and to be more sensitive to the particular needs\nof Governments to preserve democracy, the environment\nand their people\u2019s national identity and culture.\nMy Government takes a global view of Papua New\nGuinea\u2019s foreign relations and of issues on the United\nNations agenda. We encourage official agencies, business\nand non-governmental organizations both to \u201cLook North\u201d\nand to \u201cWork the Pacific\u201d for mutual benefit with close\nneighbours. Conscious that we must not overlook\nlongstanding friends, we give high priority to reinforcing\ncore relationships. Our overall objective is to continue\nreform at home in order to meet the challenges of global\nchange.\nWe will continue to support wider efforts at reform,\nincluding those directed at and through the United Nations,\nin order to meet the challenges of global change and\nembrace the imperatives of reform in readiness for the\ntwenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to begin by congratulating the President on his\nelection to preside over the Assembly this session. We are\nconvinced that he will guide our work successfully. We\nwould also like to take this opportunity to thank\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for his work.\nIn 1990, when Mrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro\nbecame President of Nicaragua, the country was in a state\nof war. Negotiating the demobilization of more than\n20,000 people who had taken up arms and reducing an\narmy of over 90,000 soldiers were key tasks in ending a\ncivil war that had lasted almost 10 years. This\n19\n\n\ncomplicated pacification process was just the beginning of\na process of peace, reconciliation, democracy and\ndevelopment in Nicaragua aimed at bringing the country\ninto line with the new situation in the region and the\nglobalization of international relations.\nAs part of this process, we began to modernize the\nState, curbed hyper-inflation, liberalized the pricing system\nand did away with the State monopoly in the areas of\nforeign trade and finance, where we have managed to\nprivatize almost all the companies that used to belong to the\nState.\nAs the State apparatus was reduced, we began to\ndecentralize government and transfer responsibilities to\nmunicipal and community levels and to sectors in which the\nprivate sector could clearly be much more effective.\nWe have carried out the process of peace and\nreconciliation that was essential for democratic national\nconsolidation. We have stabilized the economy and reduced\nthe external debt, although, unfortunately, it is still a great\nburden.\nOne of the main concerns of the Government of\nPresident Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has been to ensure\nthat the human rights of the entire population of Nicaragua\nare respected. To this end, we have adopted legislative and\nadministrative provisions that have rid Nicaraguan jails of\nmurder, torture and impunity.\nWe have set up new institutions that encourage\neducation, trade and banking. We have introduced a new,\nmuch more effective, social security system. We have\nallocated more of our budget to primary and technical\neducation, and we can be proud of the unlimited freedom\nof the press in Nicaragua today. We have also managed to\nestablish civilian control over the military, which will be\nanother important bequest to the new Government.\nToday our country enjoys the greatest degree of\npolitical freedom in its history. Considerable progress has\nbeen made in institutionalizing democracy, and the\nresources that in the past we Nicaraguans used for war are\nnow once again being used for education, health and the\nbuilding of housing and roads \u2014 in other words, for the\ncomprehensive development of Nicaragua.\nDemocracy in Nicaragua was born in 1990, with the\nelection of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in the\nonly truly free election ever enjoyed by the Nicaraguan\npopulation in its history. At that difficult time, we\nNicaraguans accepted the challenge of sowing the seeds\nof a new culture of peace. The United Nations played a\nvery important role in this process of achieving\ndemocracy and opening up a new era for Nicaragua. In\nthe same spirit, the United Nations is now cooperating\nwith us and providing guidance for the elections later this\nyear.\nSince 1990 major changes have occurred at the\nworld level. Many countries have rid themselves of\noppression and dictatorship. The Iron Curtain has been\ntorn down, as have the walls of ideological intolerance.\nThe foundations of apartheid have crumbled, and in the\nMiddle East a peace process is unfolding, filling us with\nhope, although it is not without problems. Major\nsacrifices have been made by peoples under totalitarian\nregimes so as to win the right to live in peace and\nfreedom in a more secure world \u2014 a fairer, more\npeaceful, tolerant and democratic one.\nHowever, we see that new crises and armed conflicts\nhave arisen in other regions of the world. Because of its\ninternational character, the United Nations is duty-bound\nto face up to the challenges of security required by the\ncurrent situation; our Organization\u2019s global agenda allows\nit to operate more dynamically. The United Nations must\nconfront issues such as the eradication of poverty,\nenvironmental degradation, terrorism, the use and\ntrafficking of drugs, violence suffered by women and the\npromotion of democratic values and progress in social\ndevelopment. Nicaragua is convinced that peace and\ndemocracy are closely related to development, and that\nwithout economic development it is extremely difficult to\nachieve sustainable democracy.\nIn the Secretary-General\u2019s \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d\nwe have a summary of the important changes that have\noccurred in recent years. He sets forth the difficult\nconditions of hunger and poverty among other things, still\nexisting in developing countries. He also recognizes that\nthe burden of debt and barriers to international trade are\nstill a danger to world stability. All this makes the\ndevelopment of the new concept of international security\nmore difficult \u2014 as discussed right here in the United\nNations. The Secretary-General\u2019s \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d\nis a mechanism to help us bring about true,\ncomprehensive peace.\nLet us recall, as was stated today by the Prime\nMinister of Norway, that peace is no longer only\nsomething that States must seek from one another. We\nmust seek peace within each State as well.\n20\n\n\nThe sensitive mission of the United Nations at this\nnew stage of its development can be illustrated by its\ndynamic role in Central America, a region that in 1992 was\ndeclared by this very General Assembly to be an area of\npeace, freedom, democracy and development.\nNo one doubts that the United Nations has begun a\nmajor process of profound transformation and renewal,\ntaking place precisely 50 years after its establishment and\nreflecting the current international situation. With this\nrenewal we hope for greater democratization of our world\nOrganization, particularly in the Security Council. We also\nhope for the admission of new Members to the\nOrganization, such as the Republic of China on Taiwan,\nwhich meets the requirements set forth in the Charter to be\na Member State, but whose right to be a Member is still\ndenied it. Likewise, we are expecting the United Nations to\ncontribute to developing countries, particularly through\nprogrammes of technical cooperation and cooperation for\ndevelopment.\nDuring these last few years of transition, while we\nhave been establishing and consolidating peace and\ndemocracy in Nicaragua, world disarmament has\naccelerated. Budgets for armaments have been reduced in\nmany countries, and we, the Governments of Central\nAmerica, have adopted some serious initiatives as regards\nthe production, use and transfer of anti-personnel mines.\nWe have also declared Central America to be a region\ncompletely free of those devices.\nAreas that were once battlegrounds, including\nNicaragua, are now seeing demining operations with good\nprospects. At the same time, several nuclear-weapon States\nhave initiated moratoriums on testing, thus greatly\ndiminishing the possibility of a devastating nuclear war.\nWe have also seen an increase in the number of\nnuclear-weapon-free zones. The signing of the Pelindaba\nTreaty establishes a zone of this kind in Africa; and with\nthe establishment of other nuclear-weapon-free zones in\nSouth-East Asia we will be strengthening the potential for\na more secure world. It is important to recall that very\nrecently we adopted by an overwhelming majority, right\nhere at United Nations Headquarters, the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nWe are seriously concerned that much of the recent\npolitical progress achieved throughout the world is not\nnecessarily in tune with progress in the economic sphere.\nDeveloping countries continue to face serious problems\nsuch as extreme poverty and unemployment. Access to new\ninternational markets continues to be limited for our\nproducts. The burden of debt is unbearable, and the\nconstant inequalities in international financial systems\ncontinue to affect our countries adversely. Therefore, we\nmust urgently establish much fairer and more equitable\ninternational economic relations.\nWe are also concerned that during this same period\nof global, regional and national transition, new forms of\nintolerance, lack of understanding and violation of human\nrights have breached the peace in certain areas of the\nworld. Such is the case in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nSomalia and Rwanda, where events have profoundly\ndisturbed the human conscience.\nIn this same regard, Nicaragua is troubled by recent\nevents in Burundi, where in spite of the efforts of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the\ninternational community, the situation remains delicate.\nOn the other hand, the efforts made towards reaching\npeace in Chechnya hearten us.\nWe are concerned at the continuation of practices\nand their pernicious effects. We believe that their\nperpetrators should be brought to justice without\nexception. We condemn attacks such as that upon\nPresident Mubarak of Egypt and the recent one in\nDharan, Saudi Arabia, in which hundreds of innocent\npeople were wounded. We feel great solidarity with the\nvictims and their families.\nNicaragua is concerned at the growth in the\nproduction, consumption and traffic in drugs, and in the\ngrowing relationship between terrorism and weapons\ntrafficking, which, like drug trafficking, continues to pose\na major threat to future generations.\nFor these reasons, I would like to state that\nNicaragua was pleased to hear the proposal made by the\nPresident of Colombia regarding the need to develop a\nglobal agenda for drugs. We believe that the United\nNations should think hard about that important initiative.\nOn the eve of the twenty-first century, the\ninternational community as a whole should seek out ways\nand means to overcome all of these situations. We should\nmake our best efforts in that regard. Nicaragua is ready to\nsupport the international community in these initiatives.\nIn July 1994, the second International Conference of\nNew and Restored Democracies was held in Managua,\nNicaragua; its main objective was to study in a frank and\n21\n\n\nobjective manner the weaknesses, prospects and challenges\nof new democracies. On this occasion, on behalf of my\ncountry and in our capacity of interim secretariat of the\nConference, I would like to urge that the third conference\nof new democracies, which will be held next year in\nBucharest, Romania, receive the international community\u2019s\nspecial attention.\nIn this ongoing quest for peace and for the\nstrengthening of democracy, we in Central America are\nputting into practice a new model of regional security. The\noutstanding features of this new model have been embodied\nin the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central\nAmerica, which is a national and regional strategy to foster\na change in personal and social attitudes to ensure the\nestablishment of a model of sustainable development in the\npolitical, economic, social, cultural and environmental\nfields.\nWe Central Americans have already ratified a\nframework treaty for democratic security which deals with\nrespect for and the promotion and protection of human\nrights. Its provisions ensure the security of the Central\nAmerican States and their inhabitants through the\nestablishment of conditions which will allow them their\npersonal, family and social development in peace, freedom\nand democracy. These are initiatives which could be studied\nin other regions with the aim of strengthening national\nprocesses within the context of new circumstances and with\nthe objective of moving towards a new international order\nwhich will be more secure, to which we all aspire.\nOnly months away from the end of President Violeta\nBarrios de Chamorro\u2019s term of office and less than one\nmonth from the elections in which her successor will be\nchosen, we are very satisfied with the work carried out\nduring this period. World and regional events have had, and\nwill continue to have, their impact within countries. In the\ncase of Nicaragua, this impact has been highly positive. By\nthe end of its term, our Government will have left\nNicaragua completely different from the Nicaragua we\nfound in 1990.\nWe are certain that whoever is elected President in the\ncoming elections will have the necessary vision to establish,\nas it has done in the past, a Government of benefit to all\nNicaraguans. Thus, we believe that extensive democratic\nconsolidation should also continue in order to continue on\nthe path of peace, harmony and progress.\nOn behalf of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,\nI would like to ask the international community and the\nUnited Nations to continue supporting Nicaragua, for the\ngood of democracy, for the good of our country, and,\nabove all, for the good of the international community.\nI take this opportunity on behalf of the people and\nGovernment of Nicaragua and on my own behalf to thank\nthe States, the Governments, the international\norganizations and non-governmental organizations which,\nin one way or another, have lent our country their\ncooperation and solidarity. Without this solidarity we\nNicaraguans would never have been able to achieve the\ndemocracy we have today, nor would we have been able\nto lay the foundation for economic development. To all of\nthem and to all of you, members of the Assembly, thank\nyou very much.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to express my\nsincere congratulations, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency, and my best wishes for success in the fifty-first\nsession of the General Assembly.\nI wish also to thank your predecessor, Mr. Diogo\nFreitas do Amaral, for his leadership and his personal\ncontribution to the positive achievements of last year\u2019s\nsession.\nLast year we commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe United Nations. That was a good opportunity not only\nfor historical reflection and drawing lessons from the past,\nbut also for setting out new priorities and tasks for the\nyears to come. It is obvious that the United Nations, if it is\nto meet expectations, has to adapt itself to meet new\nchallenges. Slovakia supports all efforts that will contribute\nto the enhancement of democracy, transparency and\nefficiency in the work of the United Nations.\nThe need for the reform of the United Nations is also\nconfirmed by its current difficult financial situation. This\nstate of affairs can be resolved only if all Member States\nmeet their financial obligations in a timely manner and\npay their arrears, and if a new formula for determining a\nmore adequate scale of assessments based on a country\u2019s\ncapacity to pay is adopted. In this context, Slovakia\nappreciates the European Union proposal for the financial\nreform of the United Nations and welcomes an open and\npragmatic discussion in this regard.\nLet me stress that Slovakia, which has paid its\ncontributions to the United Nations regular budget in full\nand on time, is also ready to bear its fair share of\nresponsibilities in financing United Nations peace-keeping\noperations. Now, more than three years after our\nadmission to United Nations membership, it is high time\nSlovakia was fairly allocated to an appropriate group for\nthe financing of United Nations peace-keeping. Bearing\nin mind the available economic data and comparing them\nwith those of several other countries of the Central\nEuropean region, we are fully convinced that Slovakia\nshould be allocated to Group C, and we see no\ncompelling reason for further postponing this decision. Of\ncourse, such a decision would be without prejudice to a\ncomprehensive review process of the method to be\napplied for the apportionment of the expenses of United\nNations peace-keeping operations. But the contributions\nof any Member State for 1993-1997 should be assessed\nonly on the basis of the scheme applicable in that period.\nIn the context of United Nations institutional reform,\ngreat attention is focused on the Security Council.\nSlovakia supports Security Council reform and is of the\nopinion that the expansion of its membership should\n\n\nreflect the principle of equitable geographical\nrepresentation. The membership of the Group of Eastern\nEuropean States has recently more than doubled, and this\nfact should be duly taken into account in the Security\nCouncil reform process. Countries able to bear global\nresponsibility should be granted the status they deserve in\nthe Security Council. On the other hand, expansion of the\nmembership should hamper neither the efficiency nor the\ndecision-making process of the Security Council, so the\nincrease should be a rather limited one.\nSeveral inspiring proposals have been submitted to the\nUnited Nations. Slovakia is of the opinion that we should\nlook for the positive elements contained in those proposals\nand make maximum efforts aimed at reaching a generally\nacceptable solution. Practice has shown that an increased\nrole for small and medium-sized countries in the Security\nCouncil can contribute favourably to the effective\nimplementation of its decisions, thus improving the\nauthority and the democratic character of that body.\nSlovakia actively supports the United Nations efforts\nto maintain and strengthen international peace and security.\nAfter three years of difficult negotiations, the Slovak\nRepublic has finally become a full-fledged member of the\nConference on Disarmament, thus filling the vacancy\ncaused by the dissolution of the former Czechoslovakia.\nSlovakia, as a country using nuclear power solely for\npeaceful purposes, unequivocally supports all steps which\nprevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and create\nconditions for their eventual elimination. Therefore, we\nwelcomed last year\u2019s decision of the fifth Review\nConference to extend indefinitely the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This September we voted\nfor the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty. Last Monday I had the honour to sign it on behalf\nof the Slovak Republic. We hope that it will soon enter into\nforce and become law in international relations, thus\nmaking the world safer.\nThe world community is also paying close attention to\nanother important disarmament agreement \u2014 namely, the\nChemical Weapons Convention. Slovakia has already\nratified this important instrument and supports a speedy\nresumption of the ratification process so that it can enter\ninto force.\nWe consider the problem posed by anti-personnel\nlandmines a serious one. We therefore welcome initiatives\naimed at a ban on the use, stockpiling, production and\ntransfer of this kind of weapon. For our part, we have\nalready unilaterally declared a moratorium on the export\nof these devices, which cause casualties mostly among the\ninnocent civilian population.\nPeace-keeping operations continue to be a major part\nof United Nations activities. Slovakia sees their further\ndevelopment through the enhancement of elements of\npreventive diplomacy, with a significant strengthening of\ntheir humanitarian dimension and a broader incorporation\nof civilian components at all stages. Practical evidence of\nSlovakia\u2019s efforts to implement the basic United Nations\ngoals is our participation in the United Nations\nTransitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja\nand Western Sirmium (UNTAES) and the United Nations\nAngola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III).\nSlovakia, as a troop-contributing country,\nunderstands the significance of appropriate protection for\nUnited Nations personnel. Therefore, we have already\nratified the Convention on the Safety of United Nations\nand Associated Personnel. The brave men and women in\nblue helmets deserve stronger protection. We call upon all\nother States which have not yet become parties to the\nConvention to ratify it as soon as possible.\nThe European continent was the theatre of two world\nwars in the past. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to\npay great attention to the issues of security and peace in\nthis part of the world. Underestimating the gravity of the\nsituation caused an immense human tragedy for millions\nof innocent people in the territory of the former\nYugoslavia. The Dayton Agreements, and above all their\nsuccessful implementation, represent a turning point\ntowards a peaceful settlement of this traumatic conflict,\nnot only for its direct participants but also in a global\ncontext. The international community also plays an\nirreplaceable role in this process through United Nations\nmechanisms. Slovakia is ready to get fully involved in the\nreconstruction of the destroyed economies of the countries\nof the region. We welcome Security Council resolution\n1074 (1996), adopted just two days ago.\nMaintaining peace and security in other parts of the\nworld is of no lesser importance. Preserving the\ncontinuity of the peace process in the Middle East is an\nimportant part of that. We must not allow the peace\nprocess to end and the results achieved so far to be\ndestroyed.\nWe observe with concern the growth of instability\nand the spread of conflicts on the African continent.\nSlovakia supports all efforts by the United Nations, the\n2\n\n\nOrganization of African Unity and other organizations\ninvolved in the search for peaceful solutions for eliminating\ncrises and violence.\nSlovakia supports the efforts of the Secretary-General\nto achieve a durable solution to the question of Cyprus that\nwill guarantee respect for the sovereignty, independence,\nterritorial integrity and unity of the country, in compliance\nwith the relevant United Nations resolutions. My country is\nprepared to continue its mission of good offices by\norganizing meetings of the political party leaders of both\nCypriot communities.\nAs far as humanitarian assistance is concerned, we\nemphasize the need for the efficient mutual cooperation of\nall involved entities, together with a strengthening of the\ncoordinating role of the Department of Humanitarian\nAffairs. Early warning as one element of preventive\ndiplomacy and the rapid reaction of the international\ncommunity in response to an emerging crisis situation are\nfactors which significantly affect overall results. The role of\nthe Department of Humanitarian Affairs in the\nreconstruction of territories suffering from military\nconflicts, including in demining, is important.\nInternational conflicts and internal strife are not the\nonly threats to international security and the stability of\nStates. Increasingly, acts of terrorism and organized\ntransnational criminal activities undermine democratic\nsocieties and become their joint enemies. We strongly\nsupport international cooperation aimed at their suppression\nand elimination. We will study with interest several timely\ninitiatives put forward during this General Assembly\nsession, such as the initiatives of Poland, the United\nKingdom and the United States. We are convinced that\ngranting observer status to INTERPOL in the General\nAssembly will have a positive impact on the activities of\nboth organizations in this field and will enable closer\ncooperation.\nHuman rights will undoubtedly continue to be high on\nthe United Nations agenda. Full respect for human rights is\na prerequisite for freedom, justice, stability and peace. We\ncommend the efforts to increase the efficiency of the\nUnited Nations human rights programmes, the work of the\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and his policy goal\nof transforming the Centre for Human Rights into an\noverall coordinator of human rights policy and action within\nthe United Nations system.\nIn less than four years of statehood, Slovakia has\nestablished a system of democratic institutions. All\ncommitments under the relevant human rights instruments\nhave been incorporated into its legislation. Our country\nrespects the rule of law and guarantees all citizens within\nits jurisdiction respect for human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms, including for the individual rights of persons\nbelonging to national or ethnic minorities.\nWe have established an inter-ministerial coordinating\ncommittee for women\u2019s issues as an advisory body to the\nSlovak Government. It is designed to initiate and monitor\nthe implementation of the conclusions and\nrecommendations of the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen.\nFamily issues are very closely interlinked with the\nrights of women and the rights of the child. In today\u2019s\nworld, the family requires better protection and\npromotion. A strong family is a basis for a sound society.\nAn international centre for family studies has been\nestablished in the Slovak capital. We are interested in\nsigning a memorandum of understanding between the\nGovernment of the Slovak Republic and the United\nNations on the promotion of family issues through the\nBratislava International Centre for Family Studies and the\nUnited Nations.\nSustainable economic and social development is a\nsine qua non for full enjoyment of human rights and the\ndecent life of mankind on all parts of the globe. We\nwelcome the new, integrated and comprehensive focus of\nthe United Nations on these issues, as reflected in the\nseries of United Nations conferences and summits held\nduring the term of office of the current Secretary-General.\nHe deserves his share of credit for their success. Now and\nin the years to come, we have to concentrate on the\nimplementation and review of the recommendations,\nconclusions and plans of actions adopted in Rio, Vienna,\nCairo, Copenhagen, Beijing and Istanbul. We consider the\nconvening of a special session of the General Assembly\nin 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 a\ntimely course of action. As a new member of the\nCommission on Sustainable Development we will pay\nspecial attention to these activities.\nThe Economic and Social Council should play a key\nrole in fostering international activities for sustainable\neconomic and social development; its coordinating role is\nneeded. We support efforts to enhance the efficiency of\nthe Economic and Social Council and to streamline its\nprocedures. Its sessions should be more focused on\ntopical issues. The relationship with its functional\ncommittees requires further reflection and improvements.\n3\n\n\nUnnecessary duplication in the work of the General\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council should be\navoided. The consideration of economic issues in the\nSecond Committee and social ones in the Third Committee\nseems nowadays an increasingly artificial separation. As\nthese issues are interlinked, it would only benefit us to find\na proper remedy for this artificial separation. This may\nrequire a new redistribution of responsibilities among the\nMain Committees.\nA close interconnection between environmental issues\nand economic development is reflected in the process of\neconomic transformation in Slovakia. Economic\ndevelopment in Slovakia has reached a new level, and the\nfoundations for the transition to a market economy are now\nfirmly laid. This can be seen in the positive economic\nresults achieved in 1995, when Slovakia ranked second\namong the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, with a\nreal annual gross domestic product growth of 7.4 per cent.\nThe Slovak economy is closely linked with the\ndevelopment of regional and world economies. As a\nfounding country of the World Trade Organization,\nSlovakia is actively participating in the ongoing integration\nprocess and the formation of a new trade system on the\nregional and multilateral levels. In this context, the\ncooperation of the Central European Free Trade Agreement\ncountries may be an example worth following in the\nintegration of countries into the multilateral trade system\nand global economy. We see the Central European Free\nTrade Agreement not only as a vehicle to promote trade\nbetween its partners, but also as a step on the road to full\nintegration into the European Union in the future, which is\none of our foreign-policy priorities, together with\nmembership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO) and in the Organization for Economic Cooperation\nand Development.\nWe welcome the positive results of the ninth session\nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), which stressed the need for the\nimprovement of cooperation with the WTO and the Bretton\nWoods institutions. The reform of its intergovernmental\nstructure, the focus on a smaller number of priorities with\na view to integrating developing countries into the\ninternational trade system, should lead to a renewal of the\nstatus of UNCTAD in the global economy.\nThe forthcoming Ministerial Meeting of the WTO in\nSingapore will be a good opportunity to further strengthen\nthe Organization\u2019s regulatory role. Slovakia also places\nparticular importance on cooperation with other United\nNations agencies. We are interested in actively\ncontributing to the improvement of their functioning.\nI am convinced that the United Nations will prove\nits viability in the future, as it has so far, and confirm its\nunique role in the community of nations. The Slovak\nRepublic is prepared to do its utmost for this goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation joins others in warmly\ncongratulating Ambassador Razali Ismail on his election to\nthe presidency of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly. His election is indeed, and in fact, a tribute\nboth to him and to his great country, Malaysia. I would\nassure him of my delegation\u2019s full cooperation during his\ntenure of office.\nIt also gives me great pleasure to extend the\nprofound gratitude of my delegation to the outgoing\nPresident of the historic fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, who\npresided over the session with such great skill, dexterity\nand expertise.\nLasting peace and security on our planet are the very\ncornerstones of progress and prosperity in our nation\nStates. They are the cornerstones of accelerated\ndevelopment, to which we all, developing and least\ndeveloped countries, aspire.\nMankind has fervently sought to live in peace and\nsecurity throughout the ages, but lasting peace and\nsecurity in our world have been very elusive, particularly\nduring this century. In the early part of this century, we\nbecame embroiled in the First World War. We all thought\nthat that was the war to end all wars, and then came the\nSecond World War, two decades later. It was the worst\ndestructive war of our times, and it left many challenges\nto peace and security in its wake.\nThe end of the war saw our world bipolarized and\nbusy with the pursuit of spheres of influence by the two\nsuper-Powers, which culminated in a new era, the cold-\nwar era. Prospects for peace and security in our world\nfaded as the super-Powers and other major Powers began\na race for the production and stockpiling of new weapons\nof war and mass destruction.\nThe world entered a new phase, the nuclear age,\nwhen several Powers began to develop, test and produce\nnuclear weapons. The testing of those weapons to make\nthem even more powerful took place in many parts of the\nworld, including my country\u2019s own region in the South\nPacific. In such a milieu, peace and security became a\nconstant prayer but a distant hope, as many of us in the\nnon-nuclear world were filled with foreboding that our\nworld was on the brink of nuclear extinction.\nIn such a horrific scenario, common sense began to\nprevail, and that common sense, buoyed by the initiatives\nof this important Organization, the United Nations, led to\nthe conclusion of several important but limited treaties\nand to the Conference on Disarmament. Those initiatives\n12\n\n\nwere ultimately crowned with success when, on 10\nSeptember 1996, in an extended fiftieth session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly, the vast majority of the\nworld\u2019s nations adopted the text of a Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the CTBT.\nIn the context of the South Pacific region, with the\nadoption of the CTBT, the signature by the United States\nof America, the United Kingdom and France of the\nProtocols to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty \u2014\nthe Treaty of Rarotonga \u2014 and the ratification by France\nof the Protocols, my country and the countries of the region\ncan breathe a sigh of relief at the cessation of the assault on\nour environment. Now our Governments can focus on the\neconomic and social utilization of our natural resources to\nimprove and increase the standard of living of our peoples\nwithout having to worry as much as we have in the past\nabout the effects nuclear testing was having on the health\nof our people and the environment of the region. To further\nenhance this positive and welcome development, we urge\nthe United States and the United Kingdom to ratify the\nProtocols to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty.\nMy country hails the adoption of the CTBT as one of\nthe greatest achievements of the international community\nthis century. It represents an imposing foundation for the\nestablishment of lasting peace and security in our world.\nThe CTBT may not be the paragon of virtue most of\nus probably expected it to be. It is, nevertheless, a bold and\nconstructive initiative that is meaningful and at the same\ntime a reassurance of our survival of the nuclear menace.\nAll of us must take the responsibility of assuring the\nsuccess of the Treaty. My country calls on all nations of the\nworld, in the interest of lasting peace and security on our\nplanet and in the interest of all mankind, to sign and ratify\nthe CTBT. Fiji signed the CTBT the day it was opened for\nsignature. My Government has already decided to ratify it.\nIn the final analysis, we do not see the adoption of the\nCTBT as the final nail in the coffin of nuclear weapons. To\nachieve our ultimate and pre-eminent aim and our desire for\nlasting peace and security in our world, my country would\nlike to see the CTBT as merely the first step towards an\nend to the production of all nuclear weapons, an end to the\nstockpiling of all nuclear weapons, the ultimate destruction\nof all nuclear weapons, the establishment of a nuclear-\nweapon-free world and general disarmament as a whole.\nToday, while we rejoice with a degree of relief at the\nadoption and signing of the CTBT, it is at the same time\nalso incumbent upon us not to relax our vigilance with\nregard to the moves and proposals in certain quarters to\nimport and dump nuclear waste and other forms of\nhazardous waste in our region. I refer specifically to\nreported plans afoot by certain unscrupulous nuclear-\nwaste dealers to use the Palmyra Islands and certain other\nsites in the Pacific as permanent disposal facilities for\nnuclear waste.\nMy country wishes to make it clear to all concerned\nthat we in the Pacific region will not sit idly by and allow\nany further reckless and mindless destruction of our\nenvironment and detriment to the health of our people\nthrough any form of nuclear contamination.\nThe stark reality of international affairs in our world\ntoday is that total nuclear disarmament and general\ndisarmament, or even accelerated movement towards\nthose goals, will not end tensions and conflicts and threats\nto peace. Even when weapons were made of stone,\ntensions, threats to peace and conflicts existed. And when\nwe look at the events that are happening at present in a\nnumber of countries around us, my country recognizes,\nand I am sure we all do, that we must create in our\ninternational life a system of preventive diplomacy that\ncan respond promptly, positively, peacefully and\neffectively to potential conflicts and threats of genocide,\nand de-escalate internal tensions and threats to internal\nand regional peace. My country wishes to recall its\nrecommendation to the fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly that earnest and urgent action should be taken\nto set up a special United Nations department or unit to\npursue preventive diplomacy in conflict prevention and\nconflict resolution. The department, in collaboration with\ncompetent countries and authorities, should have the\ncapacity to receive, collate, analyse and interpret\nintelligence information and reports with a view to early\ndetection of potential conflicts and early reaction to\ncontain, minimize and resolve such conflicts in\ncollaboration with relevant Member States. We should\ntake every step within our power to prevent fires rather\nthan having to put them out, to save lives rather than\nhaving to condemn the loss of lives.\nAccordingly, my country welcomes the offer made\nby Norway in the General Assembly to establish a fund\nfor preventive action at the United Nations and that\ncountry\u2019s pledge to provide some financial contribution to\nthe fund annually.\nIn our efforts to promote, establish and maintain\npeace and security in our world, it is incumbent upon us\n13\n\n\nto recognize and realize that security has several\ndimensions, not the least of which is economic security.\nSluggish economic development and limited\ndevelopment growth have affected developing countries and\nin particular, small island States, threatening national\nregional stability in one way or another. My country\ntherefore calls on the international community, first, to\nincrease official development assistance and to improve the\nquality of such assistance to developing countries; secondly,\nto cooperate in the creation of a more equitable\ninternational economic environment and thereby help to\npromote sustained economic growth and sustainable\ndevelopment, and at the same time, help to eradicate\npoverty; thirdly, to dismantle trade barriers and restrictions\nto market access; fourthly, to improve the access of\ndeveloping countries to capital from international financial\ninstitutions and commercial sources; and lastly, to facilitate\nand assist the flow of investment capital and appropriate\ntechnologies to developing countries.\nWe have noted with concern that donor countries have\nfailed to comply with the internationally agreed targets of\nofficial development assistance and commitments for new\nand additional resources. There is urgent need for a\nsubstantial expansion of official development assistance and\nfor qualitative improvements in official development\nassistance by donor countries through a reduced cost of\nrepayment. In fact, my country has noted with deep regret\nthat while some developed countries have been making\nefforts to meet the official development assistance level,\nsuch assistance from some rich countries has been declining\nnoticeably, and the decline has been taking place in the\npost-cold-war era, when it was to be expected that such\ncountries were in a better position to increase the flow of\nofficial development assistance as a result of greater\nstability in the world and reduced tensions between former\nantagonists. In fact, in the case of a few traditional donors,\naid has almost completely dried up. In some cases, aid is\nbeing systematically reduced. It appears that our region is\nno longer a strategic area for competition by the former\ncold-war antagonists to gain our favour.\nMy country is concerned to see the recent trend in\nsome countries to seek to impose alien norms on countries\nwith a unique, traditional and customary nature of society,\nespecially indigenous societies. On the other hand, with\nrespect to Japan and some South-East Asian countries such\nas Malaysia, development assistance is provided with no\nintention of interfering in their internal affairs.\nInternational cooperation for development lies at the\nvery heart of improving the living conditions of the great\nmajority of people in our world who live in developing\nand least developed countries. My country fully supports\nan Agenda for Development, which is aimed at restoring\nthe imperative of development as a central concern. Such\nan agenda should contain specific, concrete and pragmatic\nproposals that could be translated into action programmes\nand implemented on the basis of global priorities.\nThe Agreement amending the fourth Lom\u00e9\nConvention between the countries of Africa, the\nCaribbean and the Pacific and the European Community,\nsigned in Mauritius on 4 November 1995, includes a\nSecond Financial Protocol that ensures that the European\nDevelopment Fund will be available for development\nprojects in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries up to\nthe end of February 2000. This commitment by the\nEuropean Union is a direct endorsement of a multilateral\naccord and a North-South development instrument that\nhas worked and that has been widely acclaimed\nthroughout the world. Many critics are predicting the end\nof Lom\u00e9 by the year 2000. However, within the\nCommunity itself, and within the 70 African, Caribbean\nand Pacific States, the idea of a successor agreement to\nLom\u00e9 IV is a fait accompli. That in itself is a firm and\nunambiguous recognition of the dire need for such an\ninstrument beyond the year 2000.\nIt is therefore our \u2014 and indeed everyone\u2019s \u2014\nresponsibility to protect and defend the principles and\nphilosophy behind an accord such as the Lom\u00e9\nConvention. Those who are carried along by the\nliberalization of the so-called winds of change that are\nsweeping through the continents must realize that parts of\nour international community will still require preferential\narrangements in the interest of economic and political\nparity and of equity, peace and stability in the world.\nIt is sad to note that the developed countries have so\nfar failed to fulfil their commitments to provide new and\nadditional financial resources and technology transfer to\nthe developing countries on favourable terms. The\nimplementation of such commitments is most necessary\nfor international economic cooperation, as is meaningful\nand effective follow-up to major conferences.\nMy country calls for the prompt and full\nimplementation of the commitments and recommendations\nof the United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment (UNCED), which are more relevant today\nthan ever before. We believe that under UNCED\n14\n\n\ndeveloping countries should have the right to benefit fully\nfrom the utilization of their natural resources if they are to\nachieve sustained economic growth and maintain\nsustainable development.\nWe wish to highlight the continuing urgent need to\npromote and facilitate industrialization as an instrument to\nfacilitate rapid economic and social development in\ndeveloping countries, which will contribute to the\nelimination of poverty and the generation of productive\nemployment. The strengthening of the industrial bases of\ndeveloping and least developed countries should become an\ninternational imperative.\nMy country calls on the international community to\nensure an open, rule-based, equitable, secure, non-\ndiscriminatory, transparent and predictable multilateral\ntrading system with the aim of achieving the complete\nintegration of the developing countries into the world\neconomy and the new international trading system.\nWe call upon Member States to implement fully the\ncommitments agreed to in the Final Act adopted by the\nWorld Trade Conference, which confers special and\ndifferential treatment on developing countries. We believe\nthat the carefully balanced package of rights and obligations\nwith respect to the World Trade Organization should be\ncarefully preserved and that the essential priority should be\nthe implementation and fulfilment of such rights and\nobligations and the adoption of measures to mitigate\nadverse consequences on the developing countries.\nThe present unfair trading system is stagnating the\neconomies of small island States when the international\ncommunity is committed to protecting them. Fiji has\nderegulated its economy and its trade system, but we are\ndeterred in our efforts to gain access to the markets of\nsome developed countries, which still retain regulatory\nbarriers of one kind or other.\nMy country therefore warmly welcomes the statement\nby the British Foreign Minister in this Assembly that the\ndeveloped world must demolish the barriers it still\nmaintains against imports from the developing world and\nthe concomitant commitment to bring a vision of global\nfree trade to reality by the year 2020.\nIt is sad to note that the debt crisis persists as one of\nthe main constraints to development in developing\ncountries. We wish to stress the urgent need for the\ninternational community, particularly donor countries and\ninternational financial institutions, to adopt an effective,\ncomprehensive and equitable development-oriented and\ndurable solution to the debt problem of developing\ncountries.\nMy country strongly supports the World Food\nSummit to be held at Rome next month. It is the first\ntime that world leaders will meet to debate and renew a\ncommitment to eradicate hunger and malnutrition and to\naddress the issues of food security for all peoples through\nthe adoption of policies and actions at the national,\nsubregional, regional and international levels.\nAs we pursue initiatives on several fronts to promote\nand facilitate lasting peace and security in our world, we\nhave to be mindful of areas of tension that exist\nconcurrently.\nThe Washington Middle East peace summit has\ncome and gone, but at least it succeeded in bringing\ntogether the leader of Israel and the Palestinian leader in\ndialogue and discussion. We urge the parties to pursue in\na meaningful way the initiative set in motion by the\nWashington summit. We also urge continued restraint by\nall. Killing and lamentations may have become an\nestablished way of life in the region, but peace and\npeaceful coexistence are the only civilized way towards\nprogress and prosperity for all. We call upon the parties\nto undertake genuine and constructive action to negotiate,\nachieve and maintain a just and lasting peace in the\nMiddle East.\nThe Dayton accords succeeded in bringing a halt to\narmed hostilities in war-torn Bosnia. General elections\nhave been held, but the situation remains fragile and the\nconclusion is inescapable that the international\npeacekeeping presence in Bosnia should remain for some\ntime to come to consolidate the gains that have been\nachieved so far.\nRecent events in Cyprus have reminded us that the\ntense situation in that country persists, and my country\ncontinues to urge all parties to accelerate the pace of the\nnegotiations in the interest of finding a constructive, just\nand lasting solution as early as possible.\nRecent events in the Straits of Taiwan have\nhighlighted the tension that exists in that region of the\nworld, a region which is otherwise currently witnessing a\nmost dynamic economic growth. Both the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China and Taiwan, which are also active\nparticipants in post-forum dialogue with the island\ncountries of the South Pacific Forum, contribute\n15\n\n\nsignificantly to the development of the South Pacific region.\nMy country welcomes the spirit of cooperation between\nTaiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China and encourages\nthe continuation of such dialogue and cooperation.\nThe genocide in Rwanda and Burundi imposes an\nobligation on our community of nations to pursue every\npossible initiative to prevent tragedies of such magnitude\nand to avoid a recurrence whenever and wherever they\noccur, and not on a selective basis or to serve the self-\ninterest of one or another major Power. The conclusion is\ninescapable that such problems should not be left entirely\nto regional organizations to resolve, since they may have\nneither the capacity nor the resources to deal effectively\nwith the situation.\nMy county condemns international terrorism and will\nfully support all international efforts and measures to\neliminate international terrorism. We will also support\ninitiatives to negotiate an international agreement to ban the\nuse, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel\nmines.\nWe fully support international efforts in crime\nprevention and criminal justice and are fully appreciative of\nthe preparatory work being done on the establishment of an\ninternational criminal court.\nMy country would like to reemphasize its strong view\nthat the question of the protection and security of small\nStates should remain a central concern of the United\nNations. For as long as drug traffickers, international arms\ndealers, money launderers and international white-collar\ncriminals continue their criminal activities, and as long as\nmercenaries and terrorists exist, small States will remain\nvulnerable to acts of aggression from without as well as\nfrom within. Small States especially look to the provisions\nof the United Nations Charter for the respect and\npreservation of their sovereignty.\nMy country continues to urge all parties to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change to\nmove speedily towards the conclusion of an effective\nprotocol that would ultimately bring about improvements in\nthe global climate system. My country is one of the many\nthat is vulnerable to rising sea levels, hurricanes and other\nphenomena associated with disastrous climate changes. Our\nphysical survival could be affected if immediate action is\nnot taken to address the problem of climate changes in our\nworld. The meeting of the South Pacific Forum held in the\nMarshall Islands from 3 to 5 September this year\nhighlighted the Forum\u2019s concern that climate change has\nbecome a crucial issue within the region. It called \u2014 and\nwe share that call \u2014 for urgent action, particularly in\nview of the second assessment report of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which stated\nthat the balance of scientific evidence suggested a\ndiscernible human influence on the global climate. The\nForum welcomed the outcome of the second session of\nthe Conference of the Parties to the Framework\nConvention on Climate Change and called for acceleration\nof negotiations on the text of a legally binding protocol or\nanother legal instrument to be completed in time for\nadoption at the third session of the Conference of Parties\nin order to achieve significant progress towards the goal\nof lower greenhouse-gas emissions.\nThe South Pacific Forum also called upon all\ncountries to support the activities of the Ad Hoc Group\non the Berlin Mandate and reaffirmed its support for the\ninclusion of the draft protocol presented by the Alliance\nof Small Island States for consideration in the negotiating\nprocess.\nMy country warmly welcomes the recent\nestablishment of the International Seabed Authority and\nthe election of the judges of the International Tribunal for\nthe Law of the Sea. These new developments, together\nwith the successful completion last year of the United\nNations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\nMigratory Fish Stocks, will maintain the momentum in\nthe implementation of the Law of the Sea Convention. In\nparticular, we support the promotion of the regime for the\nsustainable utilization of the living resources of the sea.\nIt is our sincere hope that the International Seabed\nAuthority will administer the resources of the sea for the\nbenefit of mankind. My country calls on the international\ncommunity and the United Nations, in accordance with\nthe decision of the General Assembly taken in July 1994\nto provide adequate funding and adequate technical\nsupport to the International Seabed Authority so that it\ncan competently discharge in a most effective and\nefficient manner the responsibilities we gave it under the\nConvention. My delegation is pleased to be a sponsor of\na draft resolution seeking the granting of observer status\nin the United Nations for the International Seabed\nAuthority.\nThe United Nations has done a remarkable and\nexcellent job in carrying out its mandates during the 51\nyears of its existence. It has played a significant,\ndiscernible and indispensable role in human affairs, from\nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts and peacekeeping to\n16\n\n\neconomic development and social progress, from food and\nagriculture to employment and labour standards, from\nhelping the children of our world to fostering human rights\nand justice. The international community is deeply indebted\nto the United Nations, which should continue to be a forum\nfor multilateral cooperation and not an instrument that\nmajor Powers may use to serve their own national self-\ninterests. My country acknowledges with profound gratitude\nthe assistance and cooperation it has been receiving from\nthe United Nations in its national and regional development\nefforts. Fiji continues to pledge its commitment to the\nUnited Nations and to what it stands for.\nIt is appropriate to observe, however, that in order to\nrespond to the many demands of this complex world in\nwhich we all live, the United Nations has had to expand.\nOver a period of years, it has become very heavy, thereby\ngreatly increasing the cost of its operation. The unhealthy\nstate of United Nations finances does not derive, however,\nsolely from the Organization\u2019s enhanced and expanding\nstructure. It has also been exacerbated by the non-payment\nof dues and assessments. We call on all Member States that\nhave not paid their dues or assessments and are in arrears\nto pay them promptly, fully and without conditions.\nMy country appreciates the steps taken this year by the\nUnited Nations administration to improve management, to\nmake services more efficient and more effective and to cut\ncosts. Notwithstanding the action that has been taken, my\ncountry believes that more can and should be done to make\nthe Organization leaner and more streamlined and at the\nsame time to reduce costs further. The various organs,\nagencies and departments of the United Nations need to be\nrationalized in line with the modalities of today\u2019s world,\nand structural changes and more personnel reforms must be\ninstituted to make it more responsive to the constant\ndemands of a continuously changing international\ncommunity.\nMy country believes that the scale of assessments for\nthe apportionment of expenses should be reassessed to\nmake it more equitable and less burdensome for small\nisland States.\nMy country believes that the time has come for the\nreform of the Security Council. We submit, as we did last\nyear, that the organs of the United Nations should reflect\nchanges in the global political landscape as well as the\nprinciples of geographic representation and equity. The\nSecurity Council should, in our view, be enlarged to\naccommodate the existing global political landscape.\nSince peace and security underpin the very\nfoundation of this Organization, my country fully supports\nthe international peacekeeping missions of the United\nNations. We are committed to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and, despite the fact that\nwe are a small, developing island State with a small\npopulation, we have actively participated in the vast\nmajority of United Nations peacekeeping missions. Fijian\nsoldiers are serving in the Middle East with both the\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the\nMultinational Force and Observers, as well as in Iraq and\nKuwait. They have served in Afghanistan, Somalia and in\nRwanda. Our policemen, too, have served in Angola,\nCambodia, Namibia and Iraq, and are currently serving in\nEastern Slavonia and in Croatia. Several of our men have\nlost their lives in the service of the international\ncommunity and in the pursuit of peace and security in our\nworld.\nPeacekeeping is the responsibility of all Member\nStates, whether they contribute troops and personnel or\nnot. We therefore urge all countries concerned to expedite\nthe settlement of the assessments for peacekeeping due to\nthe United Nations. And in turn, we urge the United\nNations expeditiously and fully to settle the amounts or\narrears outstanding to Member countries for their\nparticipation in peacekeeping operations.\nAs I stated previously, international security has\nmany dimensions. The security of the world\u2019s indigenous\npeoples is one such dimension. The history of the world\u2019s\nindigenous peoples is replete with wholesale slaughter,\ngenocide and, in some cases, total annihilation during the\nera of exploration, discovery and colonization.\nThe Prime Minister of Fiji, the Honourable Sitiveni\nRabuka, told the United Nations last year that it:\n\u201cmust guarantee that external values and forces do\nnot continue to coerce political concessions,\neconomic reforms and social changes not desired by\nindigenous peoples themselves\u201d. (Official Records of\nthe General Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary\nMeetings, 40th meeting, p. 49)\nAt the opening of the regional workshop on the draft\nUnited Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous\npeoples held in Fiji last month, the Prime Minister of Fiji\ndeclared that:\n17\n\n\n\u201cIn our Pacific home, we have been sole proprietors\nin most places for no less than three thousand years;\nin most other places, for much longer.\u201d\nOur Prime Minister stated that it must be legally\naccepted that:\n\u201cWe are the first settlers, first dwellers or proprietors\nof our land. Secondly, we are a collective group that\nwas imposed upon by uninvited external forces who\ndisrupted the normal march of our history. As victims\nof what continues to be described as imperialism and\ncolonialism, we cannot, in our quest for freedom,\nallow the vestiges of foreign domination to encroach\nupon us, either through internal machinations or\nexternal collusion.\u201d\nThe Fiji workshop agreed in principle that, wherever\npossible, efforts to strengthen the text of the current draft\ndeclaration should be encouraged. The unanimous view of\nthe workshop was that efforts by States to undermine the\nexisting language of the draft should be actively resisted by\nindigenous peoples. The workshop further resolved that\nPacific indigenous peoples should seek to promote greater\nsupport for the draft declaration within the United Nations\nsystem so that the overall objective of achieving an\neffective and meaningful declaration on indigenous peoples\nis reached.\nMy country, which has had a multiracial population\nfor the last 150 years, warmly welcomes the observance of\nthe International Decade of the World\u2019s Indigenous People.\nWe strongly urge, during the International Decade, the\nadoption of the declaration on the rights of indigenous\npeoples. My country believes that the declaration should not\nbe the alpha and the omega of indigenous rights, but should\nbe merely a first step towards the negotiation, under the\nauspices of the United Nations, of a comprehensive legal\nconvention on the rights of indigenous peoples.\nTension and fears among the indigenous people in Fiji\nled to the military overthrow of the Government in 1987\nand the promulgation of a new Constitution in 1990 by an\ninterim Government. That Constitution provided indigenous\nFijians majority representation in Parliament. That\nConstitution was reviewed by a three-member commission\nheaded by Sir Paul Reeves of New Zealand. After over 12\nmonths of review, the commission recently submitted its\nreport and recommendations to the Government. The\nGovernment has duly submitted the report to Parliament\nand a Select Committee, comprising representatives of all\nthe political parties in Parliament, has been appointed to\nconsider the Commission\u2019s report and recommendations.\nLasting peace and security in our world has been an\nillusion for the greater part of this century. With the new\nglobal changes, with our recent adoption of the CTBT,\nwith rising optimism regarding the Conference on\nDisarmament, with what can be perceived as a genuine\ndesire for peace, and with more meaningful international\ncollaboration in the areas of economic cooperation and\ndevelopment, there is some hope for achieving lasting\npeace and security in our world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPermit me at the outset to\ncongratulate you, Ambassador Razali, on your election to\nthe presidency of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly. Your election is a fitting tribute to your\ndistinguished career in diplomacy, an expression of\nconfidence in your abilities and a reflection of the high\nregard in which you and your country, Malaysia, are held\nby the international community. You have our confidence,\nand I can assure you of Tanzania\u2019s full support and\ncooperation as you guide the deliberations of this session.\nI commend also your predecessor, Mr. Freitas do Amaral\nof Portugal, who very ably presided over the historic fiftieth\nsession of the Assembly.\nMy appreciation goes also to the Secretary-General,\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a\ndistinguished son of Africa, who for the past five years\nhas worked tirelessly to enhance the image of the\nOrganization as well as its ability to meet the challenges\nof the rapidly evolving international environment. He has\nprovided dedicated leadership at a particularly difficult\ntime in the history of the United Nations, enduring often\nunwarranted personal criticism even as he was operating\nin a situation of diminishing resources on the one hand,\nand escalating, often conflicting, expectations on the other\nhand.\nMy predecessor in office stood at this rostrum\nexactly two years ago and, in bidding farewell to the\nUnited Nations, spoke of the political transition then\nunder way in my country and of preparations for the first\nmulti-party elections in Tanzania in over 30 years. He\nunderlined his intention to bequeath to the people of\nTanzania a functioning democracy leveraged upon a\nshared national culture of political accommodation and\ntolerance. Today, I am proud to be here as a product of\nthat process of transition, to reaffirm our commitment and\nabiding faith in the United Nations in its endeavour to\npromote international peace and security as well as\neconomic and social development throughout the world.\nThe United Nations has, since its inception,\nexpanded its role in the international system\ntremendously, becoming a major player in national\ndevelopment and international cooperation. The various\nsummits that it has organized in recent years, coupled\n\n\nwith its numerous activities covering the entire spectrum of\npolitical, social and economic spheres, in all corners of the\nworld, is testimony to the critical role of the United Nations\nin resolving the national and international problems facing\nmankind.\nThe United Nations has helped maintain international\npeace and security at very critical times. It has overseen the\ndelivery of peoples and nations from the shackles of\ncolonialism and institutionalized racism to independence.\nAs a result of these efforts, membership has increased\nalmost fourfold. The ideals of freedom and justice and\nhuman rights are understood by most of the world, even if\nthey may not always be observed. The United Nations has\nbuilt a common global culture of shared values, and it has\nalso helped in promoting development, building social and\neconomic infrastructures and much more.\nToday, the United Nations stands at a crossroads. New\nchallenges, not least those brought about by a rapidly\nchanging international environment, keep demanding its\nundivided attention. The challenge before us, as we stand\non the threshold of the new millennium, is to invigorate and\nreinforce this Organization, drawing upon the collective\nresources and knowledge of our world and acting in\npartnership.\nLikewise, the ideal we all share for participatory\ndemocracy in each Member country needs to find\nexpression on the international plane as well. In the course\nof the last few years, we have agonized over the process of\nreform within this Organization. We all want an efficient\nand revitalized United Nations \u2014 one that is more attuned\nto the realities we live with and capable of meeting the new\nchallenges we face. We must reform its methods of work\nand bring greater institutional and policy coherence into the\nOrganization. Adjustment and realignment are necessary\nprocesses for the renewal and continued relevance of this\nOrganization. Tanzania salutes all those individuals,\ninstitutions and Governments that have contributed to this\nprocess of review.\nIt is our hope, however, that any reform will preserve\nand enhance the basic principles underlying the United\nNations. We want reform \u2014 but only the kind of reform\nthat will ultimately strengthen the hand of our Organization\nin promoting its ideals. We want greater transparency in the\nwork of our institutions, and the reinforcement of the\nprinciples of sovereign equality of States and justice. We\nneed democratization of our institutions, and greater balance\nin representation on the Security Council between the\ndeveloped North and the developing South.\nWe cannot, however, expect the United Nations to\nbe, and do, all this and more without giving it the means\nwith which to work. Meeting our financial obligations to\nthe Organization must, therefore, complement our\ndemands upon the Organization and serve to demonstrate\nour commitment to the ideals it seeks to promote.\nJust as we have the right to applaud the\nachievements of the United Nations, we must also have\nthe courage to concede that it has yet to make a dent in\nthe scourge of abject poverty that afflicts the greater part\nof its membership. This is where we must now direct its\nattention and resources. The 1995 World Summit for\nSocial Development in Copenhagen was a good starting\npoint, and we must implement the letter and spirit of the\ncommitments made there. Unless the issue of poverty is\naddressed comprehensively, we cannot achieve\nmeaningful and enduring peace. We must restore the\ndevelopment agenda to the heart of the philosophy and\nwork of the United Nations.\nThe world is largely considered peaceful because\nthere has not been a third world war. Yet, for those who\nare menaced by regional conflicts, for the victims of\noppression and injustice, and for those who subsist in\nunremitting poverty amid a world of plenty, their world\nis at war. Taken together, these people account for the\nlargest part of the world population, and the United\nNations must give them the attention they deserve today.\nOur United Nations cannot speak of a peaceful world\nwhen the future of our children \u2014 and their right to grow\nup as children \u2014 is undermined by conflict and poverty,\nand when urban squalor is breeding anarchy in local\ncommunities. Peace must be pursued in a comprehensive\nmanner, taking account of these equal, if not greater,\nthreats to peace within societies and among countries.\nOur collective shame at poverty amid riches must\nfind expression in our joint action to promote\ndevelopment. Today, the developing world is bombarded\nby many development initiatives. We are urged to work\nharder, to liberalize our economies, to cut Government\nspending, to institute sound macroeconomic policies, to\npromote the private sector and a host of other measures.\nInvariably, our countries have done so, quite often at\ngreat social expense, the magnitude of which developed\ncountries would not countenance in their own economies.\nWe have done so in the knowledge that ultimately it\nis we who must take the bull by the horns. Indeed, we\naccept that we must be more competitive in the market\nplace and bring greater efficiency to Government. We\n2\n\n\nneed to use our resources more rationally; we need to fight\nwaste and corruption in Government; we need to streamline\nour bureaucratic processes, liberalize our economies and\nopen our markets to international commerce. That is why\nmost of us are signatories to the establishment of the new\nworld trade regime under the auspices of the World Trade\nOrganization. Yet our capacity to access, and benefit from,\nthe global markets \u2014 the markets of the developed\nworld \u2014 is constrained by our underdevelopment, the\nprotectionist policies of the industrialized countries, and the\never-deteriorating terms of trade.\nUnregulated market forces will not help the very\nweak, poor and vulnerable countries, whose special\ncircumstances and needs must be attended to. For us, that\nis the priority agenda for the World Trade Organization, not\nthe introduction of new issues before we perfect the system\nwe have now. The Ruggiero plan to extend tariff-free\naccess in the markets of industrialized countries to products\nfrom developing countries is welcome and deserves wide\nsupport.\nWe now need a mutually beneficial creative\npartnership between the developed North and the\ndeveloping South. Sustainable economic recovery and\ngrowth in the South is beneficial to the North as well. Only\na prosperous South will be a more meaningful player in\nglobal commerce. We shall then be able to buy more from\nthe North, thus freeing the conscience of the developed\nworld from the unending obligation to extend charity, and\ncontrol illegal immigration. This creative partnership must\nalso recognize the interdependent nature of our world and\nhow ultimately we affect each other. To help the South\nrecover is not an act of simple charity but of building the\nfoundations for a more secure and stable world. We made\na call for action at the ninth United Nations Conference on\nTrade and Development (UNCTAD IX) at Midrand in\nSouth Africa earlier this year. We must reiterate that call\ntoday.\nTanzania, like the rest of the developing countries, is\ndetermined to face its responsibilities for economic and\nhuman development. We cannot, however, make\nmeaningful progress when the millstone of external debt\ncontinues to hang around our necks, stifling recovery and\ngrowth. The question of the unbearable external debt must\nbe addressed urgently if our creative partnership against\nglobal poverty is to bear fruit.\nMany proposals for debt relief have been discussed\nover time. We recognize and appreciate these initiatives,\nincluding the recent proposals for extraordinary debt relief\nmeasures for a selected group of severely indebted\ncountries. The fact remains, however, that no\ncomprehensive action is imminent save for limited\nmeasures taken unilaterally, on a case-by-case basis.\nUrgent, coordinated and comprehensive action remains\nnecessary to alleviate this debt burden, including the\ncancellation of the debts of least developed countries,\nwhose servicing obligations gobble up their entire\nearnings. Only then can we hope for an economic\nturnaround for them. It is the duality of debt cancellation\nand access to markets that will enable countries like\nTanzania to benefit in a liberalized world market place,\nand hasten the pace of social and economic development.\nAnother heavy burden for developing countries,\nespecially those without fossil fuel sources of energy, is\nthe cost input of energy for development. In this\nconnection, I wish to hail the World Solar Summit, held\non 16 and 17 September 1996 in Harare, which helped to\nfocus world political attention on the urgent and\nimperative need to provide reliable, sustainable and clean\nsources of energy to all the people of the world, including\nto the 400 million homes and the 2.4 billion people in the\ndeveloping world who currently have no access to\nelectricity. We all know that, without electricity, no rapid\ndevelopment of those communities will be forthcoming.\nThe Harare Summit agreed on a framework for a\n10-year solar energy programme. We must all give it the\npolitical support it needs and deserves if it is to be\neffective. At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro,\nwe all agreed that failure to develop sustainable and clean\nsources of energy would result in problems for all of us,\nrich and poor alike. Deforestation in Africa, Latin\nAmerica and Asia will affect the countries involved and\nnot involved alike. As long as 92.8 per cent of the energy\nrequirements in Tanzania are met from wood fuel, there\nis no way that the Government can protect the natural\nforests unless alternative sources of energy are available\nat affordable rates. It is in the interest of all humanity and\nof future generations to facilitate the development of\nalternative, affordable, sustainable and clean sources of\nenergy for everyone.\nTanzania is concerned at the lack of progress in the\nimplementation of the United Nations peace plan for\nWestern Sahara. The international community cannot and\nmust not retreat from this unfinished business. We must\nreaffirm the inalienable right of the Sahraoui people to\nself-determination and independence and, to that end,\nsupport the holding of a free and fair referendum. We\nurge the two sides, the Kingdom of Morocco and the\n3\n\n\nFrente Polisario, to initiate direct talks, which would create\na climate of confidence and permit the resumption of the\nimplementation of the settlement plan.\nWe wish to keep our hopes alive with regard to the\nsituation in the Middle East and earnestly call for faster and\nstrict implementation of the peace accords. The Israeli\nGovernment has a particular responsibility in this respect.\nWe reached a time when we thought that our dreams for\nthe peaceful coexistence of the Palestinian people and the\nIsraeli people were on the verge of coming true. We\ncommend all those who have been instrumental in\npromoting the peace process. We urge greater restraint on\nall sides, which must accept that the secure way to\nsustainable peace and security is through negotiation.\nI shall now turn to the Burundi crisis. We see our role\nin Burundi as one not of benevolence, but of duty \u2014 duty\nto help our brothers and sisters there to step back from the\nbrink of mutual destruction to the middle ground of\ndialogue, political accommodation and national\nreconciliation. We began our efforts within the Organization\nof African Unity and gradually turned over the task of\nbringing the political forces in sustained dialogue to former\nPresident, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, within the framework\nof the Mwanza talks. Not only was the military coup of 25\nJuly 1996 an illegal and unconstitutional act; it also\nundermined the efforts in the region to promote dialogue\nand restore peace to that most tormented country. The coup\nis unacceptable to all regional leaders and we demand a\nreturn to legitimacy and a negotiated political settlement\nthat will guarantee democracy and the security of\nminorities.\nIn order to speed up the process of compliance, the\nregion has imposed economic sanctions on Burundi. Those\nsanctions will remain in place until all the conditions set at\nArusha are met by the military rulers in Bujumbura. These\nare not unreasonable conditions. They are the restoration of\nthe National Assembly, which is a democratic institution of\nlegality that derived its mandate from the Burundian people;\nremoving the ban on political parties in the country; and the\nresumption of unconditional political negotiations with all\nthe parties to the conflict. We have, at the same time, made\nit clear to the Burundi people that the sanctions are meant\nonly to secure the compliance of their military rulers with\nthese conditions, and nothing more. Once this has been\ndone, Tanzania, the region and, indeed, the international\ncommunity have all reiterated that they are prepared to\nresume their assistance and cooperation in the process of\nrestoring peace and rebuilding that country. We can all\npledge our help, but the challenge of making peace is one\nthat only the Burundian people and those who claim\nleadership of that country can shoulder. The onus of\nbringing peace to their county rests squarely upon their\nshoulders. The key to a sustainable solution is in their\nown hands. We can only help.\nAt the same time we, the neighbours and the rest of\nthe international community, have an inescapable\nresponsibility to save the Burundian people from self-\ndestruction. We cannot stand by and watch the\nperpetuation of killings, the steady degeneration of the\nsecurity situation and the catastrophe they portend for the\ncountry and the subregion.\nAs we seek to help the Burundian people retrace the\npath of dialogue, we remain preoccupied by the fragility\nof the political situation in the Great Lakes region as a\nwhole. While Rwanda is steadily progressing along the\npath of recovery, the wounds of war and genocide have\nyet to heal. That country needs the solidarity and support\nof the international community.\nOne of the serious consequences of conflict in the\nregion has been the massive human displacement, and\nrefugees now constitute a tremendous burden for the\nneighbouring countries. Tanzania is currently hosting over\n1 million refugees from Rwanda and Burundi. The\nimplications of their presence in such large numbers\nwithin limited localities have been tremendous in terms of\nthe destruction of the environment, increased insecurity\nand criminality, and the social and economic burden they\nhave imposed upon the host communities. The traditional\nhospitality of Tanzanians towards refugees is wearing\nvery thin indeed.\nWe appreciate the work of the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees and other\nhumanitarian agencies in offering protection and succour\nto the refugees. What they have done is very useful, but\nit is not enough to offset the burden that these refugees\nplace upon our communities. We call upon the\ninternational community, in the name of human solidarity,\nto redouble its assistance to meet the urgent needs of\nthese refugees, while at the same time addressing the\nlong-term effects attendant on hosting them. Above all,\nwe must help both Rwanda and Burundi to address the\nroot causes of these human displacements. The ultimate\ngoal must be the voluntary repatriation of the refugees to\ntheir home countries. To us, the creation of an\nenvironment that will facilitate such a process of\nrepatriation is now a priority.\n4\n\n\nWhether in Liberia, Somalia or elsewhere in the\nworld, we see the need for courage and statesmanship to\ndefeat the temptations of political unilateralism and promote\ndialogue and greater human solidarity. The courage to rise\nabove deep-seated prejudices and fears \u2014 the courage to\ndepart from traditional rigidity that has made conflict\nendemic in some parts of the world \u2014 is the key that will\nopen up a new era of dialogue, political accommodation\nand national concord. We have seen how such courage and\nstatesmanship can reverse long-standing hostilities and build\non the realism of our shared destiny as human beings. The\nMiddle East, Bosnia and Herzegovina, South Africa and\nAngola are cases in point. Difficulties remain, but we have\ncrossed the Rubicon and, with determination, we can\nmaintain a steady pace towards peace in these and other\nareas around the world. The United Nations played a key\nrole in this task. It will have to play an even greater role in\nconsolidating the progress towards peace.\nThe end of the cold war did not, unfortunately, usher\nin the spring of collective peace and the blossoming of the\nflowers of international cooperation. The world is still\ndivided \u2014 even if not on ideological lines \u2014 between\nthose who are armed and those who are unarmed. Vast\nnuclear arsenals remain and their technological\nimprovement continues unabated. The hopes for collective\npeace run the risk of being thwarted by the unilateralism of\nthose who are armed with the most deadly weapons. My\ncountry is concerned about the vertical proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction and the unremitting desire of\nthose who have them to rationalize their possession. This\nundermines peace.\nSince the coming into force two years ago of the 1982\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, we have\nwitnessed the establishment of the various institutions\nenvisaged in the Convention. We are pleased that, at long\nlast, there is positive movement towards ensuring the\nregularized use of the oceans and their resources to the\nbenefit of all people the world over. The Government of\nTanzania attaches great importance to ensuring that the\nmake-up of the International Seabed Authority in its\nformative years is so structured as to facilitate the carrying\nout of its responsibilities in the manner envisaged in the\nConvention and implementation Agreement of 1994.\nThe establishment of the International Tribunal on the\nLaw of the Sea has added a fillip to the Convention, and\nthe election of its judges last August was another milestone\nin the work of the United Nations. In this connection, we\nexpress our appreciation to the States Parties to the\nConvention on the Law of the Sea for electing a Tanzanian,\nThe Honourable Joseph S. Warioba, as one of the judges\nof the Tribunal. We congratulate all members of the\nTribunal on being entrusted with such an historic mission.\nThe founding of the United Nations was inspired by\nthe human solidarity which the world sought to promote\nfive decades ago. It is that solidarity which our nations\ngathered here last year to commemorate. What holds our\nnations together, despite their diversity, is the common\nbond and solidarity we feel for each other as human\nbeings.\nToday, more than ever before, we need that\nsolidarity in order to deal with the myriad problems we\nall face together: the problems of poverty and\nunderdevelopment, peace and security, justice and human\nrights, disarmament and the environment, international\nterrorism and drug trafficking and many others. All\nrequire joint and coordinated international action. Those\nmore powerful amongst us can try to solve these\nproblems unilaterally, but in order for their efforts to bear\nfruit, they too need the cooperation of everyone. That is\nwhy I invite this Assembly to embark on a mission to\nrediscover human solidarity and to build structures for\nglobal partnership, the better world which the founding\nfathers of this Organization set out to establish 51 years\nago.\nAs an African leader, I wish to end my speech by\ncommending and supporting the United Nations\nSecretary-General for the United Nations System-wide\nSpecial Initiative on Africa he launched on 15 March of\nthis year, which seeks to provide coordinated action\nacross the entire United Nations system over a 10-year\nperiod to address the unique development needs of the\nAfrican continent. It is my hope that coming in the wake\nof the Copenhagen Social Summit, it will benefit from\nthat Summit\u2019s commitments and create the kind of impact\nthat has long been missing in previous summit\ndeclarations and plans of action.\nAfrica is a continent with an ancient and rich\nhistory. It is richly endowed with human and natural\nresources. I have great hopes for Africa and, being part of\nits new leadership, I pledge to work with anyone who\nshares my conviction that Africa is positioned for political\nand economic renewal, reform and reconstruction for\ndevelopment. Together, we can realize the dream of a\nmore peaceful, a more developed and a more respected\ncontinent. Together, we can realize the dream of a world\ncloser than ever to the ideals set out in the United Nations\nCharter over 50 years ago.\n5\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a pleasure and an\nhonour for me to address this Assembly. From this lofty\nrostrum, the nations of the world speak to one another as\nmembers of one global community, irrespective of size\nand differences. The United Nations is today the best\nhope for a better future for humankind. What we do here\nmust therefore contribute positively and effectively\ntowards the achievement of the noble purposes and\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of our Organization.\nPermit me, Sir, on behalf of the delegation of\nUganda, to express how pleased we are at your election\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\nsession. Your well-deserved election is a great honour to\nyour country, Malaysia, with which Uganda enjoys very\ncordial bilateral relations. I wish to pledge our full\nsupport to you, Sir, and to affirm our confidence in your\nability to guide our deliberations to a successful\nconclusion. Allow me also to pay a special tribute to your\npredecessor, Ambassador Diogo Freitas do Amaral of\nPortugal, for the able manner in which he presided over\nthe work of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\nI salute our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, for his commitment and dedication to the global\nmission of the United Nations during the past five years.\nThe United Nations continues to be confronted with\nthe challenge of redressing the development disparities\nthat exist among nations, particularly between the few\nrich countries and the majority of impoverished ones. For\n9\n\n\nthe latter, these disparities are manifest in widespread\npoverty and the degradation of their ecosystems. They are\nalso a major cause of the spiral of violence and internal\nconflicts, with their attendant suffering and destruction.\nIn an increasingly interdependent world, these\nproblems have regional as well as global consequences. It\nwould therefore be wishful thinking to treat them as if they\nwere a concern of only the affected countries and regions.\nThey must be addressed through global approaches and\nstrategies that ensure lasting solutions.\nWe note that present advances in transport,\ncommunications and information technology have resulted\nin the increasing globalization of the world economy. Both\nliberalization and globalization offer opportunities as well\nas challenges within and among nations. These twin\nphenomena have, in addition, deepened the marginalization\nof some regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This\nprocess could breed further polarization within countries,\nwith very destructive and destabilizing consequences. We\nwish to underscore the continuing relevance of\nmultilateralism and international cooperation as\nprerequisites for equitable global growth and development\nand for addressing the negative consequences of\nglobalization.\nThe increasing trend towards unfair trading practices\nand conflicts in international trade is a matter of serious\nconcern for us. We are witnessing situations in which\ndeveloping countries are pushed to open up their markets,\nostensibly to advance free trade and competition, while at\nthe same time developed countries practice managed trade\nand limit access to some export products from developing\ncountries. This contradiction is unhealthy for the world\neconomy.\nThe establishment of the World Trade Organization\n(WTO) in 1994 as an entity to act as a custodian and\nguarantor of a rules-based multilateral trading system is a\npositive development. We therefore welcome the convening\nof the first Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade\nOrganization in Singapore in December 1996. The Meeting\nshould, in our opinion, give a clear policy direction to the\nWTO for the next two years on measures to redress\nimbalances existing in the present multilateral trading\nsystem, which are to the disadvantage of many developing\ncountries, particularly the least developed ones.\nThe Meeting should therefore give high priority to\nundertaking a comprehensive review of the implementation\nof the Uruguay Round agreements, with a view to\nadopting specific and concrete measures to obviate\nadverse effects to the least developed countries and net\nfood-importing developing countries arising from the\nimplementation of the agreements; reverse the\nmarginalization of the least developed countries; and\nstrengthen their capacity to compete in the global\neconomy. These measures must include long-term\nfinancial and technical support, the transfer of technology\nas critical elements for the effective implementation of the\nUruguay agreements and in the improvement of the trade\nperformance of developing countries.\nWith regard to the proposal that the Meeting address\nissues outside the WTO built-in agenda, we would prefer\nto benefit first from the analytical advice of the United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development on the\npolicy implications of such issues to international trade\nbefore they are taken up by the WTO. In our view, the\nMeeting should focus on issues relating to the full\nimplementation of agreed commitments, such as the\nprovision of financial, technical and technological support\nto developing countries, as well as those aimed at\nstemming and reversing the distortive factors to trade.\nThe increasing role of transnational corporations in\nthe international trade in goods and services and in the\nflow of private capital has inordinately enhanced their\ncontrol over resources and the transfer of technology and\nknow-how in developing countries. In some cases, this\ncontrol is beyond the capacity of many developing\ncountries to check. As the influence of these corporations\ngrows with globalization, there is an urgent need to\nelaborate and adopt an effective and legally-binding\ninternational code of conduct to regulate the activities and\ninfluence of transnational corporations.\nWe are committed to subregional and regional\ncooperation and integration. Within the East African\nsubregion, we have participated actively in the revival of\nEast African cooperation, in the strengthening of the\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, and in\nintensifying efforts to make operational the Abuja Treaty\nestablishing the African Economic Community. It is our\nbelief that enhanced subregional and regional cooperation\nand integration are critical to complement South-South\ncooperation and international cooperation for\ndevelopment. It is also a means of enhancing\n10\n\n\ncompetitiveness and thereby improving our performance in\nthe world economy. In efforts to further strengthen\ncooperation in East Africa, we propose the establishment of\na cooperation arrangement between the East African\nCommunity and the United Nations. We appeal to the\ninternational community to support these efforts.\nThe magnitude of debt and its servicing obligations\ncontinues to impose a serious obstacle to our development\nefforts. As of March 1996, for example, Uganda\u2019s total\nexternal indebtedness stood at $3.2 billion \u2014 which\nrepresented 67.5 per cent of its gross domestic product \u2014\nof which 75 per cent was owed to multilateral financial\ninstitutions. Debt-servicing was $141 million, or 27 per cent\nof export earnings. Projected debt-servicing for the 1996-\n1997 fiscal year is $184 million, or 35.8 per cent of export\nearnings. This precarious situation is compounded by the\ncurrent rigorous debt-repayment enforcement regime\npursued by creditor multilateral financial institutions.\nUganda is committed to fulfilling its debt obligations\nwithin the means available to it. In this regard, a\nmultilateral debt fund has been established to offset the debt\nowed to the International Development Association, the\nInternational Monetary Fund and the African Development\nBank\u2019s African Development Fund. We are grateful to all\nbilateral donors who have continued to support and make\ndirect contributions to the fund. We also appeal to other\ndonors to join in this worthy endeavour in order to augment\nthe resources of the fund, which are still very low.\nTo complement these efforts, we make a special\nappeal to the international community, and particularly to\nthe multilateral financial institutions, to adopt concrete\nmeasures to effect a drastic reduction of external\nindebtedness of least developed countries and other severely\nindebted developing countries. In this regard, we commend\nas a first step the debt relief initiatives currently in place,\nsuch as the Naples Terms. In our view, however, these\nmeasures remain grossly inadequate to have any meaningful\nimpact. There is therefore a need to augment them with\nadditional measures that substantially reduce all types of\ndebts, including those which entail debt write-offs or\nconverting part or all of our debt into grants.\nWe note with appreciation the recent measures by the\nBretton Woods institutions to put in place measures for debt\nrelief. We urge the dominant shareholders to support these\nmeasures.\nAfrican countries, including Uganda, continue to be\nadversely affected by record-low levels of export\ncommodity earnings. The situation is aggravated by tariff\nand non-tariff barriers imposed by our trading partners on\nour semi-processed and processed export products and by\ndeclining terms of trade due to increased prices of\nimported manufactured goods and services. We urge the\nadoption of concrete support measures to improve our\nexport earnings. This could include assistance in the areas\nof horizontal and vertical diversification of our\neconomies, as well as capacity-building.\nToday is World Habitat Day. It is a day for the\ninternational community to reflect on and reaffirm its\ncommitment to the plight of the one billion people in all\nparts of the world who lack adequate shelter and basic\nservices, such as safe water supplies and sanitation\nfacilities. It is also a day to dedicate ourselves to the\nobjective of finding lasting solutions to the problems of\nhomelessness and other social ills associated with rapid\nurbanization.\nThe maintenance of international peace and security\nremains a formidable challenge for the United Nations.\nEfforts in this regard continue to be undermined by\nconflicts and tensions arising from inadequate political\nleadership that cannot correctly handle ethnic, religious\nand social differences in those affected areas. These have\nundermined the rule of law, peace and security, and have\ncontributed to untold suffering in many of the affected\ncountries.\nIn Africa, civil strife and internal conflicts, with their\nattendant consequences, are afflicting several countries to\nvarying degrees. For instance, we are gravely concerned\nby the suffering imposed on the people of northern\nUganda by renegade groups. These terrorist acts must be\nstopped forthwith for the sake of peace and security in\nour subregion.\nThe conflict in Burundi is a serious threat to the\npeace and security of that country as well as to the\nsubregion. Uganda appeals to all the parties concerned to\naccept the mediation efforts of former President Julius\nNyerere, which are aimed at achieving a peaceful political\nsolution to the conflict through compromise and\naccommodation in the context of the Arusha initiative and\npeace process.\nIn this regard, Uganda urges all the parties\nconcerned to resume, as a matter of urgency,\n11\n\n\nunconditional political negotiations in order to establish\npeace and security for all Burundians. We are committed to\nworking closely with other countries in the subregion to\nfind a lasting political solution to the problems of Burundi\nthrough dialogue and national reconciliation.\nThe steps taken by the Government of Rwanda\ntowards the restoration of normalcy and achieving national\nreconciliation are steps in the right direction. These steps\nshould be encouraged and supported, as they provide a\nbasis for restoring mutual confidence and trust, which are\ncritical for a peaceful return and reintegration of Rwandese\nrefugees from neighbouring countries.\nWe are concerned about the chaotic situation in\nSomalia and call for the reinvigoration of the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU) peace efforts.\nCommon sense must prevail among the warring\nfactions in Liberia so that the people of that unhappy\ncountry may be given a chance to enjoy peace, security and\nnational reconciliation. We welcome the efforts of the\nEconomic Community of West African States in this\nconnection.\nWith regard to Angola, we note that the\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol is under way. We\nencourage both parties to stay the course.\nThe efforts of the OAU and the Yamoussoukrou\nmediation efforts of President B\u00e9di\u00e9 of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to\nseek a peaceful solution to the conflict in Sierra Leone\nshould be encouraged.\nUganda supports the just struggle of the Sahraoui\npeople for self-determination. To this end, we urge the\nspeedy resolution of the conflict in Western Sahara, in\naccordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security\nCouncil and the General Assembly.\nUganda supports the efforts of the United Nations and\nthe appropriate regional organizations to diffuse conflicts\nthrough preventive diplomacy, as well as through the\nmechanisms of peacekeeping and peacemaking, including\ndialogue and confidence-building. In this regard, we\nreaffirm our support for the OAU Mechanism for Conflict\nPrevention, Management and Resolution, as well as for its\nCentral Organ. The Mechanism and the Central Organ\nshould be supported and provided with the necessary\nresources to enable them to operate effectively.\nThe idea of encouraging African Member States to\nput in place contingent arrangements for deployment in\nsituations requiring peacekeeping or military observer\nmissions in Africa has merit and deserves support. At the\nsame time, humanitarian programmes with built-in\nmechanisms that address the continuum from emergency\nrelief to rehabilitation, recovery and long-term\ndevelopment are essential to restoring lasting peace.\nWe welcome the adoption of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. However, we urge the nuclear-\nweapon States to seize this opportunity to commit\nthemselves to adopting concrete time- frames for the total\nelimination of all nuclear weapons, as well as to stopping\nthe qualitative development and refinement of nuclear\narsenals, including through computer simulation.\nMost African countries have embraced and are\nvigorously pursuing far-reaching political and economic\nreforms. In Uganda, we have implemented fundamental\neconomic reforms consistent with our development\npriorities and strategies and the structural adjustment\nprogrammes of the Bretton Woods institutions. We have\nliberalized trade and created the necessary conditions for\nencouraging and promoting both domestic and foreign\ndirect investment. We have improved our economic\nmanagement systems, with strong emphasis on fiscal and\nmonetary discipline. We have endeavoured to integrate\nand implement the outcome of the major international\nconferences into our national development plans and\npriorities.\nHowever, in order to nurture these positive\ndevelopments and improve the well-being of our citizens,\nwe need concerted cooperation and support from the\ninternational community by ensuring, among others, a\nfavourable external economic environment.\nI am glad to state that Uganda is a nation restored\nboth politically and economically. Allow me to outline\nbriefly the measures that have been taken and which are\nresponsible for peace, security and the other positive\nchanges that prevail in Uganda today. These positive\nchanges are the result of a policy of reconciliation. For\nus, reconciliation itself is a means to an end, the end\nbeing national unity.\nIn pursuance of this objective, we instituted from the\nvery beginning the principle of a broad-based Government\nwhich accommodated all shades of political opinion and\nideologies. The pillar of the democratization process is\n12\n\n\nthe nationwide political participation in decision-making at\nall levels, which has empowered people to take charge of\ntheir own governance.\nUganda remains committed to the protection and\npromotion of human rights. A Human Rights Commission\nhas been established to oversee the observance of human\nrights in Uganda. The Commission is complemented by a\nnational human rights unit in the Ministry of Justice and\nsimilar units will be established in the near future at the\ndistrict level. We have ensured that the promotion of human\nrights includes a component to redress the inequality of\nopportunities through affirmative action in favour of\ndisadvantaged groups such as women, youths and the\ndisabled.\nIn this regard, the 1995 Constitution of Uganda\nprovides for special representation in Parliament for these\ngroups. We appreciate the support extended to us so far in\nthis area and welcome further technical and financial\nsupport, especially towards the review and finalization of\nappropriate legislation and the strengthening of relevant\nhuman rights entities at various levels.\nLast year, a new Constitution was promulgated after\nmore than a year of intense debate by a Constituent\nAssembly of directly-elected members. On 9 May 1996, the\nfirst-ever free and fair presidential elections were held,\nfollowed by parliamentary elections on 27 June 1996.\nToday, Uganda has its first-ever directly-elected President\nsince independence in 1962.\nIn Uganda, we share the view that decentralization is\na necessary condition for good governance and\nempowerment because democracy cannot thrive unless\nspace is given for civil society to operate. In pursuance of\nthis, political decentralization is not only enshrined in the\nConstitution, but is already being implemented. Such a\ntransfer of power to the districts and other lower tiers has\nremoved the remoteness of government and ensured a\nspeedier delivery of goods and services to the people.\nYears of war and economic mismanagement have left\nUganda with a shattered economy. The present\nadministration has continued to make steady progress in\nrestoring the economy under the framework of the\nEconomic Reform Programme. Inflation has been\nsuccessfully controlled since June 1992 at the level of 5.6\nper cent, on average. At the same time, Uganda has enjoyed\na high average rate of economic growth of 8.1 per cent due\nto macroeconomic stability and strict monetary policies.\nIn order to attract investments, an Investment Code\nwas instituted to ensure a friendly and conducive\ninvestment environment. The Uganda Investment\nAuthority was established as a one-stop centre for\ninformation.\nUganda commends various initiatives taken by the\nUnited Nations to eradicate poverty. Special mention\nshould be made of the World Social Summit, the United\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\nthe 1990s and the United Nations System-wide Special\nInitiative for Africa. We commend this spirit of\ninternational partnership aimed at addressing persistent\npoverty in our region. For its part, the Government of\nUganda has embarked on the long road of addressing the\nproblem by ensuring that the fruits of economic growth\nreach the masses of the population. Among the strategies\nin place is an Action Plan for the Eradication of Poverty\nwith a Poverty Task Force as its implementing agency. In\nthe short and medium terms, the Action Plan focuses on\nincreasing household income, primary education and road\ninfrastructure. The political and economic achievements\nregistered so far prove that a serious, visionary and\ncommitted Government can lead donor conditionalities\nrather than be led by them.\nWe have just concluded the mid-term review of the\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s. For the\nsatisfactory outcome of the meeting, we wish to thank\nmost profoundly the Government of Japan and all\ndelegations which participated actively in this exercise.\nOne of the fundamental conclusions of the review is that\na lot remains to be done to consolidate the modest\npolitical and socio-economic progress that has been\nachieved in some parts of the African continent. This will\nrequire the mobilization of substantial new and additional\nresources and, in particular, the provision of a conducive\nexternal economic environment. The review also\ndemonstrated that a partnership based on shared\nresponsibility and mutuality of interest is possible and\ninevitable.\nThe United Nations remains a custodian of many\ncherished ideals, such as the primacy of democratic\ngovernance. The United Nations was born out of a\nyearning for a democratic multilateral system capable of\naddressing problems brought about by hideous tensions\n13\n\n\nand conflicts throughout the world, with a view to making\nplanet Earth a more secure, just and friendly place for\npresent and future generations. We all agree on the need to\nstrengthen the United Nations so that it can carry out its\nglobal mandate effectively. We should therefore provide it\nwith adequate resources. This commitment, invariably, calls\nupon each Member State to meet its financial obligations to\nthe organization in full, on time and without conditions.\nWithin the context of strengthening the Organization,\nmeasures should be adopted to achieve its democratization\nat all levels. Since there is a worldwide trend towards\ndemocratization, this Organization cannot remain unaffected\nby these winds of change. Uganda therefore supports\nproposals to restructure the Security Council in order to\nbring transparency to its working methods, democracy to its\ndecision-making procedures and equity to reflect the\nincreased membership of the United Nations.\nThe United Nations remains, in our view, the\nappropriate central forum for addressing global problems\nconfronting the international community. It must be\nstrengthened, revitalized and democratized. This is the\nchallenge that we the peoples of the United Nations must\naddress as a matter of priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is with great\npleasure that I convey to you, Mr. President, my\ncongratulations on your election to guide the work of this\nsession of the General Assembly. At the same time I extend\ncongratulations to the country that you represent with such\ndistinction. Your outstanding qualities guarantee a\ncompetent presidency, which will certainly contribute to the\nsuccess of our work.\nI should also like to express my special appreciation\nfor the enlightened and committed leadership of your\npredecessor, Mr. Freitas do Amaral, who, in the course of\nthe historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly, made\nan undeniable contribution to the continued progress of the\nUnited Nations.\nI also take this opportunity to express the highest\nappreciation of my delegation for the vision, initiative and\ndetermination that have characterized the work of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his\npursuit of the noble objectives of our Organization. It is\nwith pleasure that I reiterate here the support of my\ncountry for his re-election.\nCape Verde, being a small developing country that\nis particularly affected by drought and desertification, and\nwithout any means of defence, has every reason to place\na great deal of hope in the success of the United Nations,\nparticularly with respect to the fulfilment of the principles\nand the goals of its Charter, such as the promotion of\npeace and security, social and economic development, the\nprotection and defence of the environment, human rights\nand international law.\nBut small countries are not the only ones looking to\nthe United Nations with hope. In today\u2019s world, when\ninterdependencies are increasing and globalization is\nspreading to a growing number of sectors of humankind\u2019s\nactivity, the existence and the work of our Organization\nis becoming more and more indispensable to all nations\nof the globe.\nGovernments are, in fact, more clearly aware of the\nneed for international forums in which, through\naccommodation, they can reach consensus and decide on\nglobal policies, strategies and actions that, increasingly,\nare in the interests of the whole planet.\nHowever, no institution apart from the United\nNations has the vocation or the capacity to respond to\nthose needs, since, to a large extent, it is the architect of\nthe international stage on which we are players today.\n\n\nUnder the auspices of the United Nations many results\nhave been achieved in the search for solutions to the\nproblems that afflict humankind. Spectacular progress has\nallowed human beings to take giant steps in science and\ntechnology. Nevertheless, there are still huge challenges to\novercome, so that the ideals of the founders of the United\nNations may triumph all over the face of the Earth.\nIn reality, for many people peace is still a dream, and\npromises of the distribution of the dividends from the end\nof the cold war have become an illusion. Malnutrition,\ndisease, illiteracy \u2014 the eternal partners of\nunderdevelopment \u2014 still overpower nations, preventing\nthem from developing to their full potential to the benefit\nof their populations. Similarly, in many countries human\nrights are flagrantly violated, women are marginalized, and\nchildren fall victim to maltreatment and exploitation. In\nother countries, ethnic groups are subject to persecution and\nsystematic \u201ccleansing\u201d.\nAt the same time, situations of tension, such as arms\nand drug trafficking, the internationalization of organized\ncrime and an upsurge in terrorism, are becoming\ngeneralized.\nBut it is necessary to bear in mind that such\nphenomena, both because of their origin and impact, can be\nfought efficiently only if there is a firm, unequivocal\ncommitment by all States to improve international\ncooperation and better utilize resources within the\nframework of the United Nations.\nCape Verde, due to its proximity to the Sahara desert,\nis particularly affected by ecological problems, since, like\nother countries of the Sahel, it faces continuous\nenvironmental degradation, which threatens the very\nsurvival of its population.\nIt is therefore natural for us to welcome with joy the\nadoption and entry into force of the United Nations\nConvention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\nParticularly in Africa, in particular its Regional\nImplementation Annex for Africa. The particular attention\npaid to Africa is clearly justified. This continent is, without\nthe shadow of a doubt, the most affected by drought and\nthe most threatened by the advance of desertification. The\necological balance of the African continent, one fourth of\nthe area of the planet, is crucial to stabilize the environment\nas a whole.\nFor that reason, the efforts that need to be made to\nprevent the desert from spreading must be shared by the\nentire international community.\nCape Verde is therefore committed, together with\nother countries, to establishing an international mechanism\nwith the aim of facilitating the implementation and\nfinancing of the projects and programmes of the\naforementioned Convention. We stress the praiseworthy\naction, at the subregional level, of the Permanent Inter-\nState Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel in\ncoordinating efforts to fight drought and desertification.\nI should also like to underline the significant efforts\nmade in this area at the national level in Cape Verde. The\nreforestation programme launched in the first years of my\ncountry\u2019s independence continues with the same vigour\n20 years later, and the results achieved are encouraging.\nSince the programme was launched, the area covered has\ngone from 7,413 to nearly 181,275 acres. I must also\nhighlight the major support given by Cape Verde\u2019s\ndevelopment partners, without which it would not be\npossible to maintain the reforestation programme at its\ncurrent pace, which is satisfactory to all.\nIn spite of the success of this programme and of the\nefforts made, my country is still affected by the\ndevastating consequences of drought. In fact, due to the\nlack of rainfall in July and the insufficient rain last\nAugust and September, Cape Verde faces a year of crop\nfailure, which, once again, has given rise to anxiety and\ndistress among Cape Verde\u2019s farmers.\nTherefore, my Government will be forced, once\nagain, to make an unexpected effort to address the\nconsequences of such a situation, which, of course, will\nhave a negative impact on the development process.\nWe therefore urge international solidarity with the\npeople and Government of Cape Verde to help our\ncountry overcome the current farming crisis and ensure\nemployment in the rural areas.\nThe world is seeing the gap widen between\nindustrialized countries and developing countries.\nEconomic globalization and the development of\ninformation and communications technology highlight\nexisting differences. Restrictive immigration policies,\nwhich are associated with the spread of racism and\nxenophobia, are gathering speed day by day, which is\ndisturbing to us.\n2\n\n\nMeanwhile, developing countries and, in particular, the\nleast developed, face the consequences of accelerated\npopulation growth, which has direct repercussions on\nunemployment.\nThe pursuit of full employment should be the top\npriority of social and economic policies aimed at bringing\nabout development in order to provide all \u2014 men and\nwomen \u2014 with the chance to ensure that their means of\nsubsistence are secure and long-lasting. Unfortunately, the\ninternational community is still reluctant to assume its\nresponsibilities in such matters.\nA heavy burden thus falls upon the developing\ncountries \u2014 the task of recovering from the delays\nresulting from an economic order that has not been, and\nstill is not, in their favour.\nThis burden is even heavier in view of the inexorable\ntrend towards the reduction of financial flows to the least\ndeveloped countries, both in official development assistance\nand foreign direct investment.\nIn this regard, the Agenda for Development, aimed at\nsupporting those countries in their efforts for recovery,\nshould make urgent demands with regard to international\ncooperation for development. It should, at the same time,\nreaffirm the right to development as a main concern of the\ninternational community. The Agenda for Development\ncannot be seen as a mere enunciation of principles, but\nshould be taken as a true charter of social and economic\ngoals, with the United Nations playing a key role in its\npromotion and materialization.\nIn order to prepare the United Nations for the\nchallenges facing humankind as we approach the end of the\ncentury, we are committed to improving of the Organization\nby promoting and undertaking reforms with the aim of\nstrengthening it and empowering it so that it is better able\nto fulfil the objectives of its Charter. There have been long\nand complex negotiations on the reform and restructuring\nof the United Nations system. This exercise has been\ncharacterized by its particular intensity and richness, aimed\nat adapting the institutions of our Organization to the new\nchallenges that face humankind as we approach the end of\nthe century.\nBut we are close to the time when decisions of the\nutmost importance to the future of the United Nations will\nhave to be taken. They will have to correspond, with due\nbalance, to the concerns of large and small countries. What\nwill certainly not be acceptable is a situation in which\nreforms end up maintaining the differences that already\nexist today. We support the idea that reforms should\nreflect the deep changes that have taken place in the 50\nyears since the creation of the United Nations. There must\nbe fair representation for all regions of the world in the\ndecision-making bodies of the United Nations, particularly\nin the Security Council. In this regard, we recognize the\nneed for Africa to be duly represented, namely with\nAfrican countries as permanent members of the Council.\nWe have all witnessed the successes, however\nrelative, of the difficult talks on nuclear disarmament, in\nparticular the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and the very\nrecent adoption by the General Assembly of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which I had the\nhonour and pleasure to sign on behalf of my country on\n2 October 1996. We believe that these two documents\nprovide a historic opportunity and a powerful impetus for\nthe creation of conditions that will allow us to look with\nhope to the possibility, one day, of a world free of all\nnuclear weapons and of the nightmare of their use. The\nprocess of nuclear disarmament should, from now on,\ngain greater attention and follow-up.\nThe signature in Cairo, on 11 April, of the Pelindaba\nTreaty, which is the conclusion of joint efforts made by\nthe Organization of African Unity and the United Nations,\nmarked the solemn pledge of the Governments and\npeoples of Africa to assume their share of the task of\nridding the continent and the planet of nuclear weapons,\nin the same way as did the Governments of Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean in 1967, and those of the\nSouth Pacific in 1985.\nCape Verde, which has consistently supported all\nefforts aimed at banning weapons of mass destruction,\ncannot but congratulate itself on the strengthening of\ninternational stability and security.\nExpectations were therefore raised in respect of the\nplanned fourth special session of the General Assembly\ndevoted to disarmament. We note that its mandate will be\ndefined in the course of this session. We hope the special\nsession will become a landmark in the creation of an\natmosphere of relief and trust that will help us to reach\nthe goal of eliminating weapons of mass destruction and\nreducing conventional armaments.\nA combination of historical, political, economic and\nclimatic factors, among others, have given Africa the\nlowest level of development of any continent over the\n3\n\n\npast three decades. Social and economic indicators are still\nnegative, as are Africa\u2019s prospects for the future.\nApproximately 50 per cent of the population of our\ncontinent lives in a state of absolute poverty and that\npercentage will surely increase if quick and efficient\nsolutions are not found to resolve this crisis. At the same\ntime, as cause and consequence of this appalling scenario,\nwe have witnessed a succession of bloody conflicts,\nbringing even greater poverty, disease and the degradation\nor even destruction of the environment.\nFor this reason, so many important resources and\ncapabilities that are essential to assessing and resolving the\ncomplex issues of development are being wasted and, very\noften, forever lost on the battlefields.\nBut it is not only the countries directly involved in\nsuch conflicts that suffer the consequences. The tension\nbrought about by the presence of armed groups across the\nborders of other States, the tragedy of refugees and\ndisplaced persons seeking shelter in neighbouring countries\nand very often the consequent destruction of the\nenvironment, the spread of disease, the degeneration of\nmoral values, the horror of suffering and behaviours far\nremoved from human values are all situations not confined\nto the territorial limits of the States where conflicts occur.\nIt is therefore with deep sorrow that we witness the\nnever-ending armed conflicts on our continent, despite the\nefforts of both the African and the international\ncommunities to put an end to them. Even when the parties\ninvolved seem to have reached an agreement for the re-\nestablishment of peace, there are unjustified reversals that\njeopardize the entire process.\nAn example of this is the conflict that still exists in\nAngola, a country with which Cape Verde has deep ties not\nonly of history and culture, but also of solidarity. We\nsupport the efforts of the Angolan Government and the\ninternational community to undertake all tasks aimed at\nbringing about a lasting peace, social stability and the\nnormal functioning of institutions at the national level,\nwithout which the Angolan people will be unable to enjoy\nthe tranquillity they rightfully deserve and the wealth they\ncould and should benefit from, given the huge potential of\ntheir country.\nThe need for joint action to end the nightmare of war\nin several regions of the African continent is becoming\nmore and more urgent. The creation of the OAU\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\nResolution was a far-sighted decision giving our continent\nthe autonomous ability to help resolve situations of\nviolence and tension.\nNevertheless, it is important to stress that, in keeping\nwith the principles that are at the foundation of that\nMechanism, its main aim is anticipation and prevention of\nconflicts. Peacekeeping and security in the world remain\nthe primary responsibility of the United Nations Security\nCouncil, though there may be a justification in some\nsituations for the involvement of the OAU in specific\npeacekeeping and observer missions.\nAddressing the causes of the conflicts, however,\nremains the most important issue. These causes are to be\nfound essentially in the conditions of underdevelopment\nthat persist in most of our countries. Such conditions\nnurture the seeds of violence and intolerance, are at the\nroot of armed conflicts and block the establishment of\nstructures to ensure democratic participation and its\nresulting human rights benefits. Key elements for the\nattainment of peace in Africa are therefore the promotion\nof lasting development, investment in human resources\nand ensuring that current processes of democratization are\nsuccessful and widespread. It is imperative that such\nprocesses be duly supported so that they can consolidate\nand improve the living conditions of the population and\nstand up to possible coups de force or other such threats.\nThe promotion and use of dialogue must be employed to\nresolve situations of civil strife and armed conflict.\nIn the light of the dimension and scale of the\nproblem of development in Africa and questions of\nsecurity, we agree with the argument that Africa is\ncurrently the major challenge facing the United Nations.\nDevelopment, security and peace are major concerns in\nthe minds of the leaders of the continent and of all others\ninterested in the future of Africa. These goals are\ninterrelated and cannot be achieved separately.\nOf all the factors limiting the achievement of such\nobjectives, the reduction of poverty is undoubtedly the\none that must first be overcome through a strategy of\nsustainable development. Without this, the remaining\neconomic and social goals cannot be achieved. The\npersistence of poverty is a constant threat not only to\neconomic development, but also to the political and social\nstability of States and to the preservation of the\nenvironment.\nAnother fact to bear in mind is that solutions for the\nproblems of development in Africa should be designed\nand managed on our own continent, thus making\n4\n\n\nresponsibility for Africa dependent on the development of\nthe countries thereof. In this context, Africa is currently\ndeeply committed to the search for internal and lasting\nsolutions to its problems, which in no way suggests a\nrejection of the technological and financial resources and\ncontributions that we believe the international community\nshould continue to make available so that we can overcome\nthe major difficulties we still face.\nAfrican countries are fully aware that they must take\ntheir destiny into their own hands and have been trying to\nimplement measures that reflect their seriousness and hence\nworthiness to receive support in order to produce the\nexpected results.\nSeveral African countries have been undertaking\ninstitutional reforms with the aim of opening up their\nmarkets, reducing the role of the State in the economy and\nstrengthening the private sector in order to make it credible\nand able to generate employment. Such reforms, combined\nwith democracy and the development of civil society, tend\nto promote social and economic stability, thereby\nmarshalling internal resources and encouraging foreign\ninvestment.\nIn this context, we must stress the importance of\ninitiatives to promote greater foreign private investment, a\nsource of employment and added value which is\nfundamental to ensuring the continuous and stable growth\nof African economies.\nAnother important initiative in which Africa is\nengaged is the African Economic Community, which\nreceived a decisive boost in May 1994 when the Abuja\nTreaty entered into force. As a first step in its\nimplementation, the African countries are engaged in\nstrengthening the regional integration of their economies\nthrough regional economic communities.\nLast year, the Organization of African Unity adopted\nthe Cairo Plan of Action to give new impetus to the\neconomic and social development of Africa. Its\nobjectives \u2014 responsible management, food security,\ndevelopment of human resources, the proper and effective\nuse of natural resources, cooperation and economic regional\nintegration \u2014 are ambitious but feasible. They depend upon\nthe political will of Governments and their ability to\nmarshal the internal means and external support to achieve\nthese objectives. Mention should be made in this regard to\nthe principles set out in the important decisions adopted or\nbeing prepared by the United Nations: the United Nations\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\nand the Agenda for Development.\nThe Cairo Plan of Action also recalls the need for\nthe adoption of measures limiting the negative impact of\nthe Uruguay Round agreements on the development of\nAfrica in general and of the least developed countries in\nparticular, and urges creditors to be prepared to assist in\nfinding ways to reduce the debt burden, particularly as\nregards the current levels of debt servicing.\nThe recent mid-term review of the United Nations\nNew Agenda was an opportunity for the international\ncommunity to renew its commitment to measures aimed\nat adding new impetus to implementation, particularly as\nregards external debt, the diversification of African\neconomies, greater access to markets and the transfer of\ntechnology. Africa sincerely hopes that that commitment,\nfreely entered into by its partners, will be promptly\nfulfilled.\nAlthough the current situation tends to raise very\nserious concerns, it is nonetheless possible to find\nencouraging signs pointing to positive developments in\nthe situation on the African continent from the point of\nview of economic growth and the consolidation of\ndemocracy. And these are more than mere signs; some\nexamples of clear successes already visible in Africa in\nrecent years show that it is not heading exclusively\ntowards chaos and destruction. It is necessary to find\nappropriate policies to manage these positive signs,\npolicies which we must be courageous enough to\nimplement. We are certain such actions will achieve\nresults.\nAlthough the signs are positive, they still do not\nreflect an irreversible trend. The burden of dependency\nresulting from past policies is still too heavy for Africa to\nreverse the situation on its own. Now more than ever, the\ninternational community, specialized agencies and the\nindustrialized countries that are friends of Africa are\ncalled upon to strengthen financial and technical\nassistance to the continent so that underdevelopment can\nbe definitively overcome.\nIn this regard, we congratulate certain countries on\ntheir willingness to maintain their levels of cooperation\nwith Africa. Cape Verde is also pleased to note the efforts\nand generosity of certain partners, including some from\nthe South, on behalf of the development of our country.\n5\n\n\nCape Verde does not expect to be solely a beneficiary\nof the actions and initiatives of the United Nations. Despite\nits limitations and the fragility of its economy, my country\nwishes to contribute to the search for solutions to problems\ndemanding our attention and to participate in those actions\nin which our presence is necessary.\nDespite its brief history as an independent country,\nCape Verde has several times had an opportunity to play a\npositive role in processes involving other countries, either\ncontributing to the dialogue and understanding between the\nparties involved or through participation in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations.\nIt is the understanding of the Government of Cape\nVerde that, despite the structural difficulties it faces, it is\nduty-bound to contribute to the creation of a peaceful\ninternational environment and a partnership of solidarity\nthat will allow all the nations of the world to benefit from\nmankind\u2019s scientific and technical achievements and to\nimprove social management in order to guarantee each\ncitizen internationally recognized basic rights associated\nwith the values of freedom, democracy, development and\nwell-being.\nIn this regard, we must recall here the suffering of the\npeople of East Timor, deprived of the right to exercise self-\ndetermination and subjugated to a foreign military\noccupation for over 20 years. We note with admiration the\nresilience of the courageous Maub\u00e8re people, who have lost\nso many of their sons to the cause of freedom. In this\nforum, where so much has been done to support the right\nof colonial peoples to decide their own destinies, we join\nour voice to those demanding the restitution of legality in\nthat territory and that the Timorese people be given the full\nexercise of their rights, including the right to self-\ndetermination.\nIn this same context, we cannot remain indifferent to\nthe recent events in the Middle East. They show clearly that\nthere is no alternative to the peace process and that\ndialogue, tolerance and common sense must prevail over\nforce, violence and intolerance, failing which the region\ncould well be plunged anew into chaos and destruction,\nthus delaying once again the hope of its peoples to live in\npeace and security.\nThe eyes and hopes of mankind are turned to the\nUnited Nations. We are convinced that our Organization\nwill emerge from this session with renewed strength and\nwith new actions and initiatives that will enable us to look\nconfidently to the challenges that the dawn of the third\nmillennium holds for all Governments and peoples of the\nworld.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis session is being held amid a very sensitive and\ndelicate international situation which is generally\ncharacterized by political and socio-economic concerns.\nThis is particularly evident all over the developing world,\nwhich is overpopulated and simultaneously overburdened\nwith problems of backwardness and the challenges of\ndevelopment. The hopes that were raised with the end of\nthe cold war, heralding the advent of a new era in which\ncooperation and d\u00e9tente would prevail, soon were shattered\nin the midst of these problems and these concerns. We are\ncurrently facing conflicting phenomena, where elements of\ncomplementarity and integration coincide with tendencies\ntowards division and disunity. The technology and\ncommunications revolution runs parallel to the eruption of\nnational conflicts and ethnic animosities. Ambitions of\nleadership overlap practices of hegemony. This has created\na serious conceptual confusion which the international\norder, in its current form, cannot address in an effective or\ndeterring manner. Indeed, this order, due to its obvious\ndouble standards, might have contributed to the\nintensification of the era\u2019s negative aspects at the expense\nof its positive aspects and gains.\nCertainly, the logic of evolution and the rules of\ntransformation indicate that the stages of change carry\nwithin them a potential risk as well as elements of rivalry,\nunless an objective and conducive environment exists,\naccompanied by a forward-looking vision and a set of\nhighly advanced values that are crystallized through\ncoordinated and concerted efforts. This is precisely what\ndid not happen. The dichotomy between the North and the\nSouth is widening. The lack of common understanding\namong world cultures and civilizations is still present.\nThis has caused discord in world thinking and created\nmutual suspicions that not only pose an overwhelming\nthreat, jeopardizing the march of political progress and\nthe activities of economic development as well as the\nfabric of social development, but also have raised\nquestions as to whether the benefits of science and\ntechnology lead to world security and stability, or quite\nthe opposite.\nIn connection with contemporary international\npolitics, it is really most alarming that attempts are being\nmade to marginalize the United Nations at a time when\nthe world is in need of further understanding, better\ncoordination and accelerated interdependence. It would\nhave been more logical to call for the strengthening of\nthis Organization, so that it could perform its role in\nachieving these objectives in a truly democratic manner,\nwith the participation of all the countries of the world\nwith their diverse cultures, societies, sizes, orientations\nand achievements. This is particularly true since the\nUnited Nations Charter, in our view \u2014 a view shared by\nmany others \u2014 still represents a major instrument\ngoverning international life, and since any international\norder, be it old or new, must be based on a solid\nfoundation that respects rights, determines obligations and\nopens the door to an era of interaction among societies on\nthe basis of acceptance and understanding, not imposition\nor oppression.\nWe are definitely aware that the challenges of\ntomorrow are different from those of yesterday. We are\nalso aware that the United Nations, in its current culture,\nmay not be able, one way or another, to deal with future\nchallenges. However, this must be a subject for discussion\nto build consensus among us, not a matter to be\ndetermined by a few or to be decided unilaterally.\nFor these reasons, it is imperative to strive\ncollectively to build a common political will to strengthen\nthe United Nations, to enhance its effectiveness and to\nrestore its credibility in order to maintain world stability\nand security.\nThe annals of this Organization abound with\nhistorical achievements and it continues to make progress\nin dealing with the problems of our world. An in-depth\nreading of the Secretary-General\u2019s reports on political,\n17\n\n\neconomic and social situations in the world reassures us of\nthis role and we urge that it be upheld, because it addresses\nthe present and explores the prospects for the future\nthrough global understanding.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s role in developing a rational\nbasis for worldwide development activities has succeeded\nin focusing attention on the issues of our times through a\nseries of conferences held over the past five years on the\nenvironment, human rights, population, social development,\nwomen and human settlements. These represent important\nreference points for global action based on international\nconsensus in dealing with problems that were once marginal\nbut are today substantial. We call on the Secretary-General\nto pursue this approach, which allows the United Nations\nto stand out in a distinctive and positive way in a world of\ngrowing negativity.\nA strengthened role, reform and enhanced efficiency\nare our common objectives for the United Nations. The\nhistoric Declaration issued last year by the Heads of State\nand Government on the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations constitutes a cornerstone for the future work of the\nOrganization. The Declaration contained a clear conceptual\nframework for global action on the basis of the priorities\nupon which we all agreed: peace based on the principles\nand provisions of the Charter and supported by an effective\nregime of collective security; development in all its aspects\nin the social and economic fields; sovereign equality among\nStates and respect for peoples\u2019 rights; and justice in\naddressing the various issues on the international agenda.\nEgypt deems it necessary to translate these noble principles\ninto clear programmes of action that take into consideration\nthe interests of all without discrimination.\nWhen we met here last year to celebrate the United\nNations fiftieth anniversary, we were dismayed by the\nevents in the Great Lakes region in Africa, where\nhorrendous massacres had left a painful humanitarian\nlegacy. We were disturbed by the events in Bosnia, where\nUnited Nations \u201csafe areas\u201d had been overrun and innocent\npeople had lost their lives in despicable ethnic strife.\nHowever, we were optimistic at that time about\ndevelopments in the Middle East. The Interim Agreement\nhad been signed between President Yasser Arafat and the\nlate Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin, and described\nas an important step on the path to finding a solution to the\nquestion of Palestine. Has the situation changed or evolved\nfor the better?\nLet us look into last year\u2019s developments in that\nregion. In recent months, the Middle East has undergone a\ncrisis that has almost stifled the peace process, a crisis\nresulting from the reluctance of the Israeli Government to\nact in keeping with the agreed fundamentals of peace.\nThis position has threatened a return to the language,\nconcepts, policies and even practices that were on the eve\nof extinction in the region. Thus, action on all peace\ntracks was deadlocked and the peace process stagnated.\nThis prompted Egypt, which initiated that process and\nbelieves in a just and balanced Arab-Israeli peace, to\nintensify efforts to rectify the situation and consolidate the\nfundamentals of this process, first among which is the\n\u201cland for peace\u201d principle.\nIn this context, I would like to put forward the Arab\nposition as contained in the final communiqu\u00e9 of the\nsummit held in Cairo last June. The attending Arab\nleaders unanimously expressed their keen interest in the\ncontinuation of the process of making a just and\ncomprehensive peace an Arab strategic option under\ninternational legality. This Arab position requires a\ncorresponding commitment, seriously and unequivocally\nundertaken by Israel, to abide by the principles agreed\nupon at the Madrid Conference, particularly the \u201cland for\npeace\u201d principle and the assurances provided to the\nparties. The Arab leaders stressed that any breach by\nIsrael of these principles or of the bases in which the\npeace process is anchored; any reneging on the\ncommitments, undertakings or agreements made in the\nframework of this process; or any procrastination in their\nimplementation would set back the peace process, with all\nthe risks and repercussions involved. This could replunge\nthe region into an atmosphere of tension and would force\nall Arab countries to reconsider the steps taken vis-\u00e0-vis\nIsrael within the framework of the peace process. In such\na case, the Israeli Government alone would assume full\nresponsibility.\nThe Arab leaders emphasized that there would be no\nrecognition or acceptance of any situation resulting from\nIsraeli settlement activity in the occupied Arab territories,\nsince the settlements are considered an illegal measure\nthat entails no rights and establishes no obligations. The\nestablishment of settlements and the bringing in of settlers\nviolate international law and the Madrid framework and\nimpede the peace process, which requires Israel to halt all\nsettlement activities in the occupied territories. The Arab\nleaders also emphasized that a just and comprehensive\npeace in the Middle East can be achieved only through a\nresolution of the questions of Al-Quds and the Palestinian\nrefugees on the basis of their rights of return and to\ncompensation, in accordance with international legality\nand United Nations resolutions.\n18\n\n\nA short while ago, the new Israeli Prime Minister met\nwith the Palestinian President. Undoubtedly, their meeting\nrepresents progress towards their mutual recognition as\npartners on an equal footing in the Palestinian-Israeli peace\nprocess. In theory, the peace process should proceed to\nimplement the commitments made under the Oslo Accords\nin accordance with the agreed timetable, but that has not\nyet happened.\nWe are interested not in handshakes or wide smiles for\nphoto opportunities, but rather in substantive developments.\nThus, what is required and what we should all strive for is\nthe implementation of commitments, serious negotiation and\ntime well spent. We call upon the entire world to follow up\nthe matter with us with full vigilance and to allow neither\nretrogression nor the manipulation of very sensitive and\nserious matters, namely, the establishment of a permanent\ncontractual peace between Palestine and Israel that fulfils\nthe national aspirations of the Palestinian people and\nculminates in their exercise of their right to self-\ndetermination under international supervision and the\nestablishment of a Palestinian State. This peace must also\nachieve security for Israel and all parties on an equal\nfooting.\nIsrael is called upon to desist from its settlement\npolicy, including the expansion of settlements, and to end\nits policies of closing territories and besieging the\nPalestinian people. It is called upon to honour its\ncommitments, redeploy its troops outside Hebron and\nresume without further delay the final status negotiations.\nIsrael is also called upon to put an end to its practices in\nAl-Quds, a city where any rights that could be claimed by\nIsrael are outweighed by Arab rights, which are more\nancient, legitimate and authentic than any Israeli claim to\nthe city.\nOn the Syrian track, I can say in all honesty and with\nfull confidence that Syria is ready to resume the\nnegotiations suspended last February at Israel\u2019s request. The\nnegotiations should resume at the point at which they\nstopped, which is fair, and in accordance with the Madrid\nframework and the principle of \u201cland for peace\u201c, which is\nright.\nFrom this rostrum, Egypt calls for the resumption of\nthese negotiations. Israel must refrain from pursuing\npolicies and formulations that may be interpreted as\nsquandering years of negotiations and that constitute a\nregression from principles that have become an integral part\nof the rules for peaceful work in the region and are backed\nby international legality and supported by broad\ninternational consensus.\nOn the Lebanese track, we call for the\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978)\nand Israel\u2019s full withdrawal from Lebanon, to which\nIsraeli officials have repeatedly stated they have no\nterritorial claim.\nPeace in the Middle East will not be comprehensive\nor lasting until a strict regime for regional security is\nestablished, based on arrangements that provide equal\nsecurity for all parties with minimum levels of armament.\nThe region must be totally free from all weapons of\nmass destruction \u2014 nuclear, chemical and biological \u2014\nand their delivery systems. Peace and security cannot\nsurvive in the presence of any instability in the balance of\npower or serious discrepancy in the rights and obligations\nof the countries of the region.\nFurthermore, we are closely watching the huge\nIsraeli arsenal, which includes weapons of mass\ndestruction, missiles and anti-missile weapons. We\nwonder about the rationale behind it. We believe that it\nhas, indeed, led to a reaction by a number of countries in\nthe region to this serious escalation, at a time when we\nare all talking of peace. Given this fact \u2014 or, rather, to\navoid its consequences \u2014 Egypt proposes the initiation of\neffective negotiations to establish a zone free from all\nweapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.\nPresident Hosni Mubarak has been making such a\nproposal since April 1990.\nEgypt calls upon the permanent members of the\nSecurity Council and the depositary States of the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),\nwhich sponsored and adopted the resolution on the\nMiddle East during the Review and Extension Conference\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, to take specific steps to establish a\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East in\naccordance with the Egyptian initiative, which has\nenjoyed the consensus of all the States concerned since\n1980.\nWhile Egypt stresses the fact that arms control and\nregional security constitute one of the pillars of peace and\nstability in the Middle East, it also believes that economic\nand regional cooperation under a just peace constitutes\nanother such pillar. Regional cooperation is inseparable\nfrom the establishment of peace: peace is its essence and\n19\n\n\nits framework. Two sessions of the Middle East-North\nAfrica Economic Summit have been held, in Casablanca\nand in Amman, the capital of Jordan. Both were held in an\natmosphere of optimism that the peace process would\nsucceed. Indeed, there have been some successes, such as\nthe signing of the interim agreement between Israel and\nPalestine, and the holding of direct negotiations between\nSyria and Israel. They took place against the background of\na receding settlement policy and continuous discussion\nabout peace and its objectives. However, today we see the\nexact opposite. This state of affairs threatens peace, its\nframework and all that is associated with it, including\nregional cooperation, which can prosper only in an\natmosphere of peace and hope for the future. We therefore\ncall upon Israel to return to the fundamental framework of\npeace in accordance with the agreements concluded, the\nterms of reference established and the principles approved.\nWhile Egypt is in favour of holding the third\nEconomic Summit as scheduled \u2014 like others, we have a\ngreat deal to contribute in the fields of economic reform,\ninvestment and development \u2014 we call upon the sponsors\nof the peace process, especially the United States, to strive\nto create the conditions that could lead to the successful\nconvening of the Summit. That can be achieved only by\nmaking serious endeavours on all peace tracks, in terms of\nboth negotiation and implementation. We are making this\ndeclaration before the entire international community, so\nthat every party will discharge its responsibilities and\nhonour its commitments. If they do not, the balance will be\ndisturbed and the issue will become meaningless.\nPeace in the Middle East is contingent upon justice,\nbalance and honesty in negotiating and addressing the needs\nof peoples. From this stems the open Egyptian diplomacy\nthat regards the current situation as a matter of utmost\nseriousness. We once again reiterate that Egypt rejects any\nmeasure that results in an unbalanced peace that satisfies\nthe interests of one party at the expense of another. The\npeace that we aspire to is a balanced Arab-Israeli peace that\nreciprocates right for right, security for security, and\ncommitment for commitment.\nA just and comprehensive peace is the cornerstone of\nstability in the Middle East. Despite the unpropitious\nattitude of the new Israeli Government to the peace process,\nright alone will eventually prevail. Peace will impose itself,\npropelled by the desire of the peoples of the region,\nincluding the people of Israel, to live in genuine peace,\ncooperation and stability.\nEgypt, whose people contributed to laying the\nfoundations of human civilization, has for centuries\naccepted and continues to accept the imperatives of\ngeography and history, which give Egypt special\nresponsibilities for the affairs of our region and beyond.\nEgypt takes the initiative for peace, seeks prosperity,\nprompts enlightenment and is steadfastly involved in\nadvancing the march of progress.\nEgypt therefore empathizes with the agony of the\nregion and the repercussions of developments there.\nWhile peace in the Middle East is at a crucial stage, the\nGulf region, which is part of the Middle East, is also\nundergoing a number of unfavourable developments. The\nstability of the Gulf region is, for more than one reason,\nlinked to the ultimate interests of Egypt and its security.\nIn particular, it is an area endowed with a potential and\nwith characteristics that make its stability and security a\nmatter of significance to all Powers concerned with\ninternational peace and security.\nThe result of our review of the succession of events\nin this area leads us to several conclusions. First, strict\ncompliance with Security Council resolutions on Iraq,\nwithout fail or divergences, is the only way to guarantee\nthe end of the crisis that erupted in August 1990.\nSecondly, the use of force cannot restore rights or rectify\nwrongs. Thus, the rights of the Iraqi people, the\nmaintenance of its unity and respect for the rights and\nwell-being of Iraqis, whether Arabs or Kurds, will remain\nthe major concern of all of us. We are equally concerned\nwith safeguarding the rights of the people of Kuwait and\nthe return of detainees and property.\nThirdly, the memorandum of understanding on the\noil-for-food resolution, which was reached after arduous\nnegotiations, must be put into effect without any further\ndelay to alleviate the suffering of our brothers, the Iraqi\npeople.\nFourthly, compromising territorial integrity and the\nunity of Iraq is not only a breach of international law but\nwill open the door to major repercussions undermining\nregional stability and threatening the interests of\nneighbouring countries.\nFifthly, the withdrawal of Iran from the three islands\nof the United Arab Emirates \u2014 Abu Musa, Tunb as\nSughra and Tunb al Kubra \u2014 is a sine qua non condition\nfor defusing another hotbed of tension. The Arab call to\nIran to settle amicably any territorial claims to those\nislands is still valid.\n20\n\n\nSixthly, the policy of intervention and the attempts to\nmanipulate ethnic and religious minorities to destabilize\nother neighbouring countries cannot help to establish\nstability in the Gulf region or the wider region of the\nMiddle East, or help ensure the interests of any of the\nparties concerned, in addition to its being a flagrant\nviolation of the rules of international conduct.\nBefore leaving the issue of the Middle East, I would\nlike to refer to the dispute between Libya and some\nWestern countries, a dispute to which we attach particular\nimportance because of its repercussions for the region as\nwell as the damage and suffering it inflicts on our brothers,\nthe people of Libya, on the economies of the neighbouring\ncountries and on the stability of the region in general. In\nview of our keen interest in averting an escalation of the\nproblem and in expediting the attainment of an early\nsettlement, we support the efforts and initiatives made by\nthe League of Arab States, the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) and the Non-Aligned Movement, and call for\na positive response to those efforts and initiatives.\nMoving from the Middle East to Africa, we find\nstories of success and of failure \u2014 pictures both bleak and\nbright. While our sister country Rwanda has restored its\nstability and launched its reconstruction and development,\nits neighbour, our sister Burundi, is an example of the real\nturmoil which is affecting the entire Great Lakes region.\nLast year we expressed our extreme dismay at the situation\nin this important region; today we reiterate this, and stress\nthe need for the Security Council to discharge its\nresponsibilities to avert the recurrence of Rwanda\u2019s tragedy\nin Burundi.\nThere is, however, a positive element that we hope\nwill not be lost in the disappointment over the deteriorating\nsituation in Africa: the efforts of the OAU, which have\nstarted to take shape within an institutional framework that\nwe hope will be successful. This was embodied in the\nestablishment of the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\nManagement and Resolution, which will play a role in\nresolving the problems of the continent. The countries and\nthe leaders of the Great Lakes region, particularly former\nPresident Nyerere, have played a laudable collective role in\nreconciliation, dealing with the question of refugees and the\nrampant ethnic rivalries in the region. Serious efforts were\nalso made by the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) to settle the Liberian problem,\nparticularly by Nigeria, which has made continuing efforts\nduring its current chairmanship of that subregional group.\nWe commend the efforts made by Ghana during its\nchairmanship of ECOWAS over the past two years. We call\non the international community, and the United Nations\nin particular, to support all of these efforts and to provide\nthe necessary means for their success.\nThis applies also to the numerous efforts made to\nachieve national reconciliation in Somalia, the\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol in Angola and the\nsettlement plan in Western Sahara. We hope that the\nparties concerned will benefit from these historic\nopportunities, so that stability will prevail in Africa and\nso that international support for these efforts will\ncontinue, particularly in terms of post-conflict\nrehabilitation and socio-economic reconstruction.\nIn this context, I should like to draw attention to the\ngravity of the continued deterioration of the socio-\neconomic situation in the African continent, which\nincludes two-thirds of the world\u2019s least-developed\ncountries; one-third of its population is facing starvation.\nDespite this fact, the countries of the continent are\ntenaciously striving towards economic reform, structural\nadjustment, strengthening regional cooperation among\nthemselves and dealing with the social situation in the\ncontinent in accordance with the Declaration issued in\nCairo in March 1995.\nThese efforts are still faltering as a result of\ndiminishing international support and a lack of necessary\nfinancial resources. Thus we support the United Nations\nSystem-Wide Special Initiative for Africa presented last\nMarch by the Secretary-General based upon\ncomprehensive mobilization of resources and full\nparticipation of international institutions. Hence, we call\nupon donor countries and upon the international\ncommunity to take the necessary measures to deal with\nthe critical economic situation in Africa, particularly the\nexternal debt problem, by providing the necessary\nresources and creating an environment that will enable the\ncontinent to join the march of development and to be able\nto address its socio-economic problems, which represent\none of the root causes of political tension and instability\nthere.\nThe critical economic situation in Africa leads us to\nvoice some of the concerns of Egypt and the developing\ncountries vis-\u00e0-vis the world\u2019s economy. Suffice it here to\nmake a reference to the importance of the faithful\nimplementation of the Uruguay Round agreements and the\nnecessity to address the negative impact on the net food\nimporting countries. We look forward to the success of\nthe first ministerial conference of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO), to be held in Singapore. We would\n21\n\n\nlike to highlight the importance of focusing on the\nimplementation of the Uruguay Round agreements without\nattempting to raise new issues such as those pertaining to\ninvestment and the linkage between international trade, on\nthe one hand, and labour and environment, on the other.\nAny proposed additional issues should be subject to in-\ndepth study. We reiterate the leading and important role of\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD) in this regard prior to bringing such issues to\nthe WTO for consideration.\nTurning to Bosnia, there is hope of implementing the\nDayton agreement to put an end to the appalling tragedy\ncaused by \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and racist narrow-mindedness.\nThe agreement will be implemented under international\nprotection, represented by the Implementation Force\n(IFOR), to which Egypt and numerous other countries\ncontribute. Despite all the circumstances associated with the\nelection process, its results are still a source of optimism in\nthe possible victory of the forces of moderation so that\nBosnia can become a multi-ethnic State where Serbs,\nMuslims and Croats live together in peace.\nEgypt welcomes the election of President Izetbejovic\nas President of the tripartite Presidential Council. In this\nrespect we would like to stress a number of points which\nwe think can guarantee the stability of the situation and\nensure full compliance with the provisions of the Dayton\nagreement. First, it is important to consolidate the territorial\nintegrity of Bosnia, to reject vehemently and strictly any\nattempts at partition and to respect the democratic process\nand the results of elections. Secondly, it is necessary to\nassist the State of Bosnia in completing the necessary\ncomponents of building its national army and to provide it\nwith the equipment it needs to deter any external threat or\nface a new collapse of the internal situation after IFOR\nwithdraws. Thirdly, it is necessary to provide the economic\nsupport Bosnia needs to rebuild and rehabilitate the country,\nsince this will represent support for the foundations of\ncoexistence and peace among its three ethnic groups.\nFourthly, it is essential to punish the war criminals.\nOtherwise, talking about human rights in the world will be\nfutile and will be considered as an entrenchment of double\nstandards.\nThe phenomenon of terrorism has become exacerbated\nand now knows no boundaries. We must all implement the\nDeclaration on Measures to Eliminate International\nTerrorism, which was adopted at the forty-ninth session.\nTerrorists must find no refuge in any civilized country. We\nmust all cooperate in uprooting all sources of terrorism. We\nmust construct a well-defined legal system that ensures the\npursuit of those who are responsible for terrorism, and\ntheir prosecution and extradition to stand trial for the\ncrimes they have perpetrated, crimes that terrorize\npeaceful people and threaten international stability. We\nmust define clear criteria and rules that guarantee that the\nright of political asylum will not be extended to the\nundeserving, so that that right will not become a licence\nencouraging terrorists and protecting them from\nprosecution and punishment.\nTerrorism is an international phenomenon that is not\nlinked to a particular geographic region or to a particular\ncivilization, culture or religion. We have witnessed the\nevidence, ranging from the Far East to the Middle East,\nto Europe, and to America. Terrorism has even come\nclose to this very building. The entire international\ncommunity must harness the necessary resources to\nconfront this vicious aggressive phenomenon, to eradicate\nits sources and to isolate whoever provides it with\nassistance and encouragement. In this respect, I call on\nthe United Nations and the civilized peoples of the world\nto respond swiftly to the call of President Hosni Mubarak\nto hold an international conference to deal with the\ncriminal phenomenon of terrorism and, as a contribution\nto peace and stability in the world at large \u2014 to mobilize\njoint international efforts to combat it.\nI began my statement with our perception of the role\nof this Organization. I conclude it by paying tribute and\nexpressing my appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr.\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, whose expertise and insight have\ncontributed, during his current tenure, to the identification\nof problems and challenges facing the international\ncommunity and this Organization. He has drawn up the\nagenda on items under consideration as well as\napproaches for dealing with them. The implementation of\nthis agenda is contingent upon the will and the interest of\nthe Member States.\nAs it reiterates its confidence in the Secretary-\nGeneral, a confidence shared by members of two of the\nmost prominent regional organizations \u2014 the Arab\nLeague and the Organization of African Unity \u2014 Egypt\nattaches high priority to seeing him preside over the\nUnited Nations Secretariat for a second term, during\nwhich he will have the chance to lead the Secretariat and\nto take part in implementing the programmes he devised,\nthe reform process he designed and the solutions he\ninitiated to the problems facing the Organization,\nproblems that surface in an international arena witnessing\nthe birth of a new order whose features are not yet\ndefined, problems that occur as the United Nations passes\n22\n\n\nthrough a historic juncture, on the threshold of a new\ncentury and a new millennium.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me particular\npleasure to address the General Assembly at a session of\nover which Malaysia has been elected to preside. Our two\ncountries are good friends, and Ambassador Razali is\npersonally known to and respected by us all. New Zealand\nlooks forward to a productive session under his leadership.\nIn just two weeks New Zealanders face a general\nelection. There are many subjects over which the various\npolitical parties differ, but one thing remains quite clear: the\nsupport of New Zealanders for the United Nations and the\nrule of international law embodied in it.\nFor New Zealand, as for many other countries\nrepresented here today \u2014 and especially smaller\ncountries \u2014 the primary purpose of the United Nations\nremains to provide for a system of collective security. It\nbrings the nations of the world together in a grand coalition\nto keep the peace, to help eliminate weapons of mass\ndestruction, to uphold human rights, to encourage good\ngovernance, to protect the environment and to promote\neconomic and social development, including by\nsupporting the role of women.\nTogether, these activities, along with national and\nregional initiatives, provide the underpinnings of the\nsystem of collective security that we want to leave for our\nchildren.\nFor New Zealanders, our confidence in the United\nNations was reaffirmed when, two weeks ago, the General\nAssembly adopted the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty. It gave me much satisfaction to sign the Treaty\nearlier today on behalf of the Government and the people\nof New Zealand. Agreement on a test ban has been a\nNew Zealand objective for more than three decades and\none we promoted in this Assembly, together with\nAustralia and Mexico. It reflects deeply held convictions\non the part of all New Zealanders.\nNew Zealand has argued, and will continue to argue,\nfor a world without nuclear weapons. Our belief that\nthese weapons of mass destruction can and should be\neliminated has been reinforced by the experiences of our\nregion as a testing ground for nuclear weapons. I am glad\nto say it is an era now happily behind us.\nFor New Zealand, the Treaty represents first of all\nan end to nuclear testing in our region and worldwide.\nBut even more, it puts real obstacles in the way of any\nState seeking to refine or develop a nuclear arsenal. We\n\n\nhave taken a significant step on the way to eliminating\nnuclear weapons entirely. Now, however, we must look\nahead.\nThe International Court of Justice, in its recent\nAdvisory Opinion on the legality of the use or threat of use\nof nuclear weapons, set out our obligation in this regard:\nthe obligation to pursue in good faith and to bring to a\nconclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament.\nNew Zealand believes that in 1997 all States, including\nnuclear-weapon States, should pursue negotiations on a\nphased programme of nuclear disarmament, with the\nultimate goals of the complete elimination of nuclear\nweapons and a treaty on general and complete disarmament\nunder strict and effective international control.\nWe are better placed to make our contribution to such\nnegotiations because of the recent decision of the\nConference on Disarmament to admit New Zealand and 22\nother countries as full members. As a reflection of the\nimportance we attach to its ongoing work, my Government\nhas now decided to appoint a full-time Disarmament\nAmbassador to the Conference in Geneva.\nFurther steps towards a nuclear-free world are\nrecommended in the report of the Canberra Commission on\nthe Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, released last month.\nWe hope that report will energize discussions at the\nnational level, particularly in the nuclear-weapon States.\nThe aspirations of many States to be free of nuclear\nweapons have found expression in the establishment of\nwhat are now four nuclear-weapon-free zones. Taken\ntogether, the four relevant treaties have the potential to\ncover some 114 nations and 1.7 billion people. My\nGovernment has given considerable thought to ways in\nwhich cooperation between nuclear-weapon-free zones can\nbe advanced. We are working with other Governments on\na draft resolution to be submitted to the Assembly at this\nsession, and New Zealand hopes it will receive wide\nsupport.\nThe disarmament arena is only one where the United\nNations must continue to address serious challenges to our\ncollective security. When my Government took office in\nOctober 1990, the international community faced the\nchallenge presented by Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait. In the\nheart of Europe, Yugoslavia was on the path to political\ndisintegration. Few of us imagined then, however, the\nnightmare of Bosnia, the genocide to come in Rwanda or\nthe mass starvation and anarchy in Somalia. In response,\nduring our term on the Security Council in 1993 and 1994,\na record 75,000 United Nations peacekeepers were\ndeployed around the world, and Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait\nwas robustly countered by coalition action authorized by\nthe Security Council. New Zealand was part of that\ncoalition and is part of the current efforts to ensure that\nIraq complies with subsequent Council decisions. Recent\nevents show that we still need to be vigilant. Iraq must\nrecognize that there are limits to what the international\ncommunity will tolerate.\nNew Zealanders also serve in the former Yugoslavia\nwhere, while the implementation of the Dayton accords\nlies primarily with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO), the United Nations continues to play an\nimportant role. Similarly, our personnel serve in Angola\nand the Middle East.\nNew Zealanders are staunch supporters of the United\nNations role in international peacekeeping, despite the fact\nthat the overall record through the first half of this decade\nhas been mixed. There were successes, such as Cambodia,\nMozambique and El Salvador, and there were the\ndisappointments and bitter frustrations of Bosnia, Somalia\nand Rwanda. I hesitate to call those operations failures.\nTo me, that would be to overlook the positive things they\nachieved in extremely difficult circumstances and the\ncontributions made by so many dedicated and able people.\nThose operations will be failures only if we fail to learn\nfrom them. I think we have learned.\nWe have learned that, first, the United Nations must\nbe given the resources required to do the job. Secondly,\nthe Organization must be careful about mixing\nenforcement tasks with peacekeeping, unless our\npeacekeepers are appropriately configured from the outset\nfor the higher level of threat.\nThirdly, the Security Council should be wary of\nadopting resolutions to which the Organization cannot\ngive effect. This creates a very corrosive credibility\nproblem.\nMy Government also considers that the United\nNations must continue its efforts to develop a capacity to\nrespond more rapidly. We commend the proposal to\nestablish a rapidly deployable operational headquarters\nteam and, indeed, have offered to contribute a highly\nexperienced officer to it.\nDemining remains an important focus for New\nZealand. Mines pose an unacceptable threat to\npeacekeeping operations and are a longer-term\n2\n\n\nhumanitarian and development challenge. The United\nNations must make every effort to ensure that the necessary\nresources are available for demining activities.\nWe have more than doubled our annual instalment to\nthe United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in\nMine Clearance. This is in addition to our continuing\ncontribution of expertise in demining in Cambodia,\nMozambique and Angola, as well as here at United Nations\nHeadquarters.\nFinally, we do not think the United Nations can write\nitself out of the script when operations involving a potential\nenforcement dimension are contemplated. If it did so, it\ncould quickly become irrelevant. The threats to international\npeace and security in the future are likely to be every bit as\ndifficult as those of the recent past. The United Nations will\nneed to be able to respond effectively, not simply as a\nrubber stamp for great-Power actions.\nThe tragic events of recent days in the West Bank and\nGaza show that peace there remains elusive. New Zealand\ncalls upon all parties to desist from actions that might derail\nthe Middle East peace process. Painstaking efforts have\ngone into that process, and it offers a real hope for a long-\nterm solution to the problems that have bedeviled that\nregion. It must be supported and not jeopardized.\nHuman rights are the foundation of freedom and\njustice, and the achievement of universal respect for human\nrights is an essential prerequisite for international peace and\nsecurity.\nIn New Zealand we work hard to ensure that our own\nhouse is in order. We are committed to ensuring that the\nrights elaborated in the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, the Covenants and other core human rights\ninstruments are a living reality for all New Zealanders, and\nwe are prepared to speak out when we see human rights\nbeing violated in other parts of the world. At its heart, our\ninternational human rights policy is geared to finding\ntangible ways of protecting and promoting human rights\nand good government.\nIn the Asia-Pacific region we are pleased by the\nprogress the United Nations is making in nurturing human\nrights frameworks. We are also encouraged by the new\nlevels of cooperation and interaction being achieved by the\nhuman rights commissions of the region.\nNew Zealand also sees a need to support individual\ncountries, international and regional organizations and non-\ngovernmental organizations in their work to improve\nhuman rights and the quality of governance. To this end\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs has today announced the\nestablishment of an international good-government\nprogramme. This new programme will markedly expand\nour ability to support good government and human rights\ncapacity-building activities. It will work in tandem with\nthe existing Commonwealth Good Government Fund.\nConsistent with United Nations principles, New\nZealand has also participated actively in the Action Group\nof Commonwealth Ministers for the promotion of\nprinciples of good governance established at the\nCommonwealth Heads of Government meeting at Harare\nin 1991 and reaffirmed at its Auckland meeting in 1995.\nFor my own part, I have been privileged to represent New\nZealand at several of the Action Group\u2019s meetings and\nduring its recent mission to Gambia.\nSuch programmes, with the interlinked goals of\nsocial progress and economic development, do not come\ncheaply. The money spent on United Nations relief and\ndevelopment greatly surpasses that spent on peacekeeping,\nand so it should.\nAt the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 it\nwas recognized that substantial new and additional\nfunding would be required for sustainable development\nand the implementation of Agenda 21, the programme of\naction that will take us into the next century.\nI am pleased to be able to say that by next year New\nZealand will have increased its official development\nassistance by almost one third since Rio. There will be a\n24 per cent increase in our funding for United Nations\ndevelopment agencies this year.\n1997 will see the five-year review of Agenda 21. At\nthe special session of the General Assembly next June,\none important task will be to assess the effectiveness of\nthe bodies and institutions that have been established to\nadvance the aims set out in Agenda 21. The issues are\nmany, and all are important. But we need to focus efforts\nand produce real results.\nIn this regard, the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment should have a strengthened role. It should\nbe the forum in which States can work to streamline the\nenvironment-and-sustainable- development agenda.\nAll these challenges facing this unique Organization,\nand our regard for it, highlight of course the urgent need\n3\n\n\nfor reform. In particular, the Security Council must be\nmade more representative of the Organization\u2019s membership\nas it is today, not as it was 50 years ago. Its decision-\nmaking procedures must be brought up to date.\nFinding a sustainable basis for the financing of the\nOrganization remains long overdue. New Zealand has\ndedicated itself to reform of both the Secretariat and the\nintergovernmental machinery, not least through our\nvigorous commitment to the work of the Open-ended High-\nlevel Working Group on the Strengthening of the United\nNations System. The report of that group provides a\nblueprint for action during this session. We also support the\nEfficiency Board, and have made available to it the services\nof a New Zealand expert in public-service restructuring.\nWe believe that New Zealand\u2019s record, not only as a\nprompt contributor of assessments, but also as a country\nthat has demonstrated its commitment to financial reform,\nplaces it in a good position to make an effective\ncontribution to the work of the Advisory Committee on\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions, in which we are\nseeking membership at this year\u2019s session of the General\nAssembly.\nThe drive for reform of the United Nations system to\nmake it an effective instrument of the international\ncommunity for the next 50 years means no part of it can\nremain immune from scrutiny.\nA good deal of attention has been focused on the\nSecurity Council, the General Assembly and the Secretariat.\nWe believe there is also scope for increasing the\neffectiveness of the International Court of Justice. It is 50\nyears since the ICJ was established as the principal United\nNations judicial organ. To mark this important milestone in\nthe international rule of law, we should now finally\nschedule a conference to adopt the statute for the\ninternational criminal court. The creation of a permanent\ncourt that will bring justice to victims of genocide, crimes\nagainst humanity, war crimes and other serious international\ncrimes is surely a priority for us all.\nI am grateful to have had this opportunity to reaffirm\nNew Zealand\u2019s commitment to this Organization, and to\nmultilateralism, as the means for building a better world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff At\nthe outset, allow me to congratulate Ambassador Razali on\nhis election as President of this session of the General\nAssembly and to wish him success in his noble task of\nenhancing and strengthening the role of the United Nations.\nI would also like to express our thanks and appreciation to\nthe former President of the General Assembly,\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for his efforts during his\npresidency.\nHalf a century has elapsed since the birth of the\nUnited Nations. Mankind wanted the United Nations to be\na bastion of justice, peace and human rights. It is meant to\nbe an authority where problems are solved and truth upheld,\nwhere mankind can find an organization to defend its rights\nwhen they are usurped and stand by its side when it is\nthreatened. In founding the United Nations, mankind\nwanted to put an end to wars and usher in an era of peace,\nof respect for the principle of State sovereignty and of\nsafeguarding peoples\u2019 independence and their right to self-\ndetermination and to the fulfilment of their aspirations.\nWith the telecommunications revolution and the fall of\npolitical, economic, demographic, cultural and security\nboundaries and barriers, States and their peoples need an\neffective machinery for consultation and constructive\ndialogue. The scientific and technological revolution has\nincreased our need for a greater synergy to face the\ncomplex problems of our time and to bridge the gap\nbetween the countries and nations of the world so as to\nenable them to implement jointly subregional and\ninterregional projects that none can do alone.\nThe world population explosion and the concomitant\necological degradation have made the environment\nincapable of meeting rising demand. Competition for\nnatural resources and for the protection of vital interests\nhave risen sharply.\nThe increased number and growing sophistication of\nlethal nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons of\nmass destruction and the further development of their\nintercontinental delivery systems heightens the threat of\nannihilation for many countries and peoples, especially\nwhen some of the countries which possess them lack even\nminimal credibility.\nSome societies are overwhelmed by the degree of\nsophistication of the media, by its role and by the speed\nwith which political, economic, social, cultural and\nscientific news flows through it. These societies may not\nbe ready to assimilate and absorb this flow of\ninformation, so they react by isolating themselves, by\nwithdrawing into seclusion, or by hiding behind the veil\nof tradition to protect their identity. This manifests itself\nin the extremism and fundamentalism these societies use\nto shield themselves from what is often perceived as a\nthreat to their identity.\nThese and other problems and challenges require\ninvigorating the United Nations machinery and renewing\nconfidence in its credibility, justice and efficiency, to free\nits decisions from hegemony, eliminate its imbalances and\nbring consistency to the standards it uses for the\nimplementation of its resolutions. We must do this if we\nwant the United Nations to remain a valuable global\nauthority and the alternative to destructive and violent\nconfrontation.\nThe world has witnessed a succession of local and\nregional crises. Lebanon, which has suffered immensely,\nplagued by the wars of others on its soil, follows with\nconcern the developments in different parts of the world.\nThe crisis over the sovereignty of the United Arab\nEmirates on the Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu\nMusa islands has not yet been settled. We hope referring\nthe case to the International Court of Justice will result in\na settlement reaffirming the United Arab Emirates claim\nof sovereignty.\nWe also support arbitration of the case of the\nGreater and Lesser Hanish islands between Yemen and\nEritrea; both parties have agreed to such arbitration.\nSupport for the unity, security and stability of\nLiberia and Angola remains a primary objective to put an\nend to the suffering of their peoples.\nLebanon likewise supports the Republic of Cyprus\nin its efforts to build unity and sovereignty over all its\nterritory to put an end to the suffering of its people and\nto the effects of the problem on the Government of\nCyprus with respect to the reunification of the island.\nLebanon has been following with grave concern the\nrecent deterioration of the situation in Iraq and the\nsuffering of the Iraqi people, who still lack food and other\nbasic needs. We do not believe that the recent events\n16\n\n\nrepresent the best way to address the Iraqi problem. We call\nrather for the implementation of Security Council\nresolution 986 (1995), and for a commitment to the unity\nand sovereignty of Iraq, which would guarantee the\ninviolability of the geopolitical map of the Middle East. If\na breach were to be opened in Iraq, the consequences\nwould definitely extend to other extremely sensitive\nregions, which would further complicate the situation. Our\nsupport of the sovereignty of the State of Kuwait over all\nits territory prompts us to appeal for a permanent guarantee\nof its sovereignty and security so that we can turn the page\non this bitter chapter of history once and for all.\nThe credibility enjoyed by international law is based\non its ability to find just and complete solutions to\nimportant questions. This is the mission of the United\nNations and it therefore should be spared from having to\nintervene in less important crises.\nThe credibility of the United Nations is still called into\nquestion and this, in turn, undermines the role of the\nOrganization in the field of the non-proliferation of nuclear\nweapons. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) has been extended despite the reservations\nexpressed by some States, including Lebanon, on the\ncircumstances of its extension, including Israel\u2019s refusal to\nbecome a party to it. Israel is allowed to maintain a\nformidable nuclear arsenal in one of the most sensitive and\nvolatile regions of the world without any safeguards or\ncontrols; this poses a threat to all the peoples of the region.\nThe cessation of nuclear testing has been presented as an\nalternative to the NPT. Despite the many promises made\nprior to the extension of the NPT that Israel would\nultimately accede to it, this has yet to happen. Using double\nstandards in dealing with States can only create imbalances,\nwhich in turn increases the number of exceptions to the\nrule. The effectiveness of the Organization depends on the\nequal treatment of all States, and the United Nations\nremains the means to implement such policies.\nIn this context, Lebanon enthusiastically supports\nenhancing the functioning and management of the\nOrganization in all areas, particularly with regard to the\nscope of representation of the world\u2019s peoples and the\ncountries in the Security Council. Recent changes and new\nrequirements demand more realistic geographic and\nnumerical representation in that body. We need to eliminate\nthe perception of hegemony that some have developed\nabout the role and decision-making power of the Council,\nwhich they seem to believe has been seized by certain\nmajor Powers. Lebanon believes that all proposals in this\nregard must be carefully studied, particularly those that are\ncompatible with the approach I have outlined and that\nenjoy broad support among States. I am thinking in\nparticular of the proposals of the non-aligned countries\nand of Italy.\nIn recent years, and despite the many difficult\ncircumstances that have accompanied his years in office,\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has\nmade commendable efforts to further global peace,\nsecurity and stability. He has worked to solve problems\nof social and economic development as well as those of\nhealth in many parts of the world. Furthermore, he has\nundertaken numerous reforms within the Organization.\nHis term has been distinguished by dynamism towards the\nachievement of the Organization\u2019s primary goals. Despite\nthe obstacles, his accomplishments are many and the\nworld bears witness to them. This continued course, as\nseen in a renewed mandate, would be a basic guarantee\nof the stability of United Nations policies. Lebanon\nbelieves that the renewal of the Secretary-General\u2019s\nmandate would make it possible to complete many\nprojects and measures undertaken during his first term.\nWe therefore call upon States to support his bid for a\nrenewed, strengthened mandate.\nWe would have very much liked our participation in\nthis session, several years following the Madrid\nconference, to be an occasion for gratitude for the\nrestoration of peace in the Middle East. We had hoped to\nexpress our gratitude to the countries, peoples and\norganizations which have tried to bring about this peace.\nFive years have passed since the Madrid peace\nconference, not counting the preparatory year. At the\ntime, we welcomed the initiative and believed in the\nsponsorship and the subject matter of the conference. The\nsponsors were two influential Powers, and the substance\nwas geared towards the achievement of a comprehensive,\njust and lasting peace on the basis of the implementation\nof Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973),\nand with regard to Lebanon, Security Council resolution\n425 (1978), as well as the principle of land for peace. We\naccepted the invitation and thought that the others who\naccepted it had also agreed to its substance, and that the\nonly pending issues would be implementation, scheduling\nand mechanisms.\nBut years have passed, and instead of moving\nforward towards implementation, Israel has reneged on its\ncommitments and has tried to move away from what was\nalready done. As soon as the new Israeli Government was\nin power, it adopted its manifesto: \u201cThe four No\u2019s\u201d \u2014 no\nto the withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan; no to\n17\n\n\nthe withdrawal from the occupied West Bank; no to the\nsettlement of the question of Jerusalem; and no to\nrecognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people\nin a State of their own.\nTo the contrary, the principle of land for peace has\nbeen replaced by the principle of peace for security,\nmeaning refraining from waging a new war. Instead of\nfulfilling commitments, formulas must be changed. Instead\nof Madrid, there is the unknown. Instead of putting an end\nto settlements, settlements are being expanded. A tunnel is\nnow being built under the Al-Aqsa Mosque, in a clear act\nof provocation to the people\u2019s sensitivities.\nWe were asked to shake hands, to offer recognition\nand to normalize relations without knowing what will\nhappen to our rights. We, the victims of aggression, are\nasked to give security guarantees to the aggressor. Those\nwho do not possess weapons are asked to give assurances\nto those who have one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the\nworld and who could not be convinced to accede to the\nNPT when other countries have been forced to accept its\nindefinite extension.\nSince the new Israeli Government came to power, it\nhas backed away from the peace process, although\noccasional misleading steps are made. The new Government\nof Israel has resorted to a meaningless media campaign to\ndisguise its rejection of peace. We first heard the \u201cLebanon\nfirst\u201d slogan, but this too was void of any meaning except\nas an attempt at isolation and to serve the purposes of the\nmedia campaign. We then heard of the meeting between the\nPalestinian and Israeli presidents. Once again, the occasion\nwas exploited, but meaning remained absent.\nIt has become clear that the objective of the Israeli\nGovernment was to numb world public opinion and undo\nwhat was agreed upon at the peace conference and the\nensuing negotiations. It is perfectly clear that Israel does\nnot have a policy for peace. It only has a policy of\nchanging formulas, a policy of threats and challenges, a\npolicy that Israel can use to further its expansionist and\nsettlement schemes.\nJust as the world was on the verge of believing that\npeace had become possible in the Middle East region, here\nwe are facing the unknown, facing the worst.\nSome States in the region wanted to precipitate the\nearlier optimism by moving to normalize relations. Now\nthey bear the burden of Israeli logic. Now the peoples of\nthe region have been thrust back into an era of inevitable\nconfrontation, violence, and resistance. No sooner had the\ndevelopment plans of the Middle East region been put\ninto place and the world was showing interest in a future\nof peace than mistrust and pessimism returned to prevail.\nNo sooner had the historic opportunity for the realization\nof a great dream begun to crystallize than this opportunity\nstarted to fade, leaving the peoples of the region with\nonly one alternative \u2014 to confront occupation, arbitrary\nrule and obstinacy \u2014 since all international peace efforts\nare failing. Today\u2019s violence in Palestine and in southern\nLebanon is a direct result of the negative positions of the\nIsraeli Government. It presages dire consequences should\nthe peace process collapse.\nSince the Madrid Conference, the United States has\ntried, through two successive presidencies, to push the\npeace process forward towards settlement. In order to do\nso, the United States requested that the peace process be\ntaken out of the context of the United Nations and the\nSecurity Council and be confined to the mechanisms\ndefined at Madrid. The United States sought to reassure\nIsrael by all military, material and economic means\navailable, even to the detriment of the Arabs, with the\nidea of reviving the confidence of the Israelis. Then the\nUnited States imposed concepts to increase guarantees\ngiven to Israel to consolidate the peace process, which\nwere provisionally accepted, despite the fact that they\nwere unsound. Today, these efforts are threatened by the\nparty that benefited from them in the first place.\nToday, the President of the United States will try to\nbring together the parties concerned, pursuing his\nresponsibility to salvage the peace. Israel will continue\nto manoeuvre, and will exploit the occasion provided by\nUnited States presidential elections to undermine the steps\nthat were already in place. They will foil the efforts of\nthe United States, which we supported even though these\ncalled for a continued and somewhat iniquitous tolerance\nof Israel, despite the fact that Israel\u2019s excesses had always\nbeen covered by assurances for the sake of peace.\nWe must return to the foundations of peace as\nannounced at Madrid, resume the negotiations from where\nthey were interrupted and realize that the opportunity for\npeace which had started to crystallize still presents a\nhistoric opportunity. It must be recognized that what was\nachieved at Madrid is the only foundation acceptable to\nthe people of the region. If peace is ever to be salvaged\nin the Middle East, this is the only way to achieve it.\nLebanon has for many years suffered the aftermath\nand consequences of the Middle East crisis and has paid\n18\n\n\na heavy toll. Today, through domestic political measures,\nsecurity, development and economic achievements, Lebanon\nis once again proving that it can confront difficulties and\nface challenges. Lebanon is showing that its national unity,\nthe restoration of full sovereignty over its territory and\nrespect for its independence are inevitably more solidly\ninherent in its existence than some might believe.\nIn the future, if peace is safeguarded, Lebanon will\nprove that its history is larger than its geographical borders\nand that its role by far exceeds its size. When Lebanon\nregains its sovereignty over all of its territories now under\nIsraeli occupation, when the United Nations has restored its\ncredibility by implementing Security Council\nresolution 425 (1978) on an equal footing with resolutions\nrelating to other parts of the world, when Lebanese citizens\nare released from Israeli detention camps where they are\nimprisoned with only minimal human rights, then and only\nthen will the bleeding stop and the wound heal.\nThe Middle East is tired of being an active volcano\nthreatening world peace. We have for too long been robbed\nof peace to the detriment of the entire world. Opportunities\nwill not forever remain for those seeking peace. The peace\nwhich we sought and for which we have long appealed is\nthreatened today. The failure of our endeavours to achieve\npeace will close the door to any new attempt in the\nforeseeable future. If reviving peace is a difficult job, the\nramifications of failure will be even more difficult for the\nwhole world.\nThe days when problems were confined to national\nboundaries are well over, and so are the days when\nboundaries were walls keeping crises contained. We hope\nthat peace is still possible. But it must be a just peace, not\na despoiling one; a real peace, not a theatrical one; an\nequitable peace not an iniquitous one. It must be a peace\nthat calms rather than one that fans the anger of peoples.\nMay God forever guide the steps of those who seek\nand work for peace, and inspire those who still oppose it."

My country is\nsuccessfully concluding a stage in its structural reforms and\nhas achieved macroeconomic stabilization. We have\nmanaged to halt the decline in production and this year we\nexpect an increase in production of 3 to 4 per cent. The\nannual rate of inflation is not expected to exceed 26 per\ncent. We are finalizing the legal basis for a market\neconomy and for building new institutions. The goal now\nis to join the World Trade Organization.\nRegional cooperation is gaining in strength. In the\ncontext of the Central Asian Union, the Economic\nCooperation Organization and the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States, we are creating conditions conducive\nto the free movement of goods, capital, services and\nlabour. Entirely new areas are now linked by\ntransportation lines, and the groundwork is being laid for\nlong-term, comprehensive efforts to ensure the sustainable\ndevelopment of the Central Asian region.\nWe, the newly independent States, are rapidly\nbecoming involved in the globalization process of the\nworld economy; we are deriving clear benefits from this\nas well as significant damage and losses. Alongside the\nliberalization of trade and the opening of State borders,\nour fragile economies are being affected by transnational\norganized crime, including drug trafficking. Drug dealers\nare corrupting State institutions and are eroding the basis\nof our young statehood.\nDrug trafficking and arms trade are flourishing in\nconflict areas. It is evident that powerful international\ncriminal forces, which are reaping profits from this, are\ninterested in the continuation and exacerbation of conflicts\nin Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Drugs have a destructive\neffect on weak and powerful countries alike. Local\ncapacities and international assistance from donor\ncountries to fight drug trafficking pale in comparison to\nthe scale and geo-economic destructive effect of the drug\ntrade.\nFive Central Asian countries were the second group,\nfollowing Eastern European nations, to sign a\nmemorandum of understanding with the United Nations\nInternational Drug Control Programme. We continue to\nfight this evil through regional cooperation. A subregional\nprogramme for Central Asia provides an opportunity to\ndevelop projects that provide legitimate alternatives to\npeople engaged in the cultivation and transport of illegal\ncrops. My country welcomes consideration of this issue\nat a special session of the General Assembly to be held in\n1998, and is convinced that the world community will\ntriple its support to programmes to stop the flow of drugs\nto the countries of the North.\nSustainable development formed the basis of the\nnational human development strategy prepared on the\ninitiative of the President of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan,\nMr. Askar Akayev. During the past decade, from Vienna\nto Istanbul, the international community, under the aegis\nof the United Nations, has defined goals, tasks and\npriorities for world social development. Kyrgyzstan\n10\n\n\nintends creatively and fully to implement the decisions\ntaken. We look forward with great interest to the\ndiscussions on Agenda 21 that are due to take place at the\nspecial session of the General Assembly to be convened in\n1997.\nCountries with economies in transition are going\nthrough a difficult period of economic rehabilitation. The\nproblems of attracting direct foreign investment are\nparticularly acute. We are inspired by the experience of the\ncountries of Central and Eastern Europe that have\nsuccessfully managed the transition to a market economy.\nMany of them have joined the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development, and established national\nexport and import banks and State insurance facilities for\nprivate enterprises abroad. Today it is becoming\nincreasingly clear that timely and adequate assistance and\ncredits from the international community, combined with\nenormous efforts by the countries themselves, are enabling\ncountries in transition to emerge rapidly from their crises\nand thus join the group of development donors. The effect\nof such a multi-layered approach to resolving common\ndevelopment problems is clear, and there is no doubt that\nseveral post-Soviet independent countries could shortly be\nin the vanguard of this progress.\nFor a long time much has been said about the need for\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton\nWoods institutions in strengthening peace and resolving\neconomic development problems. In recent years a huge\nnumber of regional alliances have come into being in\nresponse to contemporary challenges, and they are actively\ncooperating with one another. Today, it would be difficult\nto overestimate the importance of their role in resolving\ninter-ethnic disputes and conflicts and developing trade,\ntransport, communications and sociocultural relationships in\nthese regions. The United Nations could systematize and\nsummarize the successful work of these unions and\nalliances, which are like blood vessels in the way they link\nthe United Nations system with the World Bank, regional\nbanks and the International Monetary Fund, offering an\neffective regional approach to dealing with the entire range\nof complex issues on today\u2019s world agenda.\nGeo-economic regions such as the Fergana valley are\nfacing a great number of acute problems, including\nunemployment, environmental deterioration, poverty,\ninequality of women and all types of crime. They can, and\nshould, be a focal point for the attention and effort of all\ncountries concerned in Central Asia, for the United Nations\nsystem, and for donor countries. Consistent and vigorous\nefforts to resolve the urgent development problems of this\ndensely populated valley will also act as necessary\npreventive actions to strengthen security, stability and\npeace between the States of the region.\nMy country wholly supports the efforts of the United\nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope and the Commonwealth of Independent States, to\nbring about a peaceful settlement in the inter-Tajik\nconflict. We commend the contributions made by Russia\nand Iran, and welcome the mediating role of\nTurkmenistan, which has opened a goodwill office for\nconducting the inter-Tajik talks.\nEvery conflict has a recognizable identity. It is time\nfor the United Nations to synthesize and develop the legal\nbasis, procedures, and methods of work for each party\ninvolved, whether they are representatives of international\norganizations, the parties to the conflict or various\nworking groups. The United Nations should have regular\nconsultations with the countries in the region and with the\nregional alliances.\nBecause of the protracted nature of the crisis, which\nhas caused enormous suffering to innocent civilians, and\ngiven the widespread consequences of the hostilities for\nneighbouring countries, we believe that a solution to the\ninter-Tajik conflict should be the basis for the long-term\nsustainable development of that country and for the whole\nof Central Asia.\nThe exodus of refugees from Tajikistan is\ncontinuing. This is a painful subject for the people of\nTajikistan, and we feel for them in their suffering. The\nratification by Kyrgyzstan this year of the 1951\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees of and its\n1967 Protocol was not merely a demonstration of our\nrespect for human rights but reflected our willingness to\nshare the international community\u2019s burden of\nresponsibility for providing assistance to people who are\nforced to leave their homes to seek protection for\nthemselves and their children. The conference on the\nproblem of refugees and displaced persons in the\nCommonwealth of Independent States, which was\norganized by the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees in Geneva in May 1996,\ndemonstrated the international community\u2019s full support\nfor refugees from Tajikistan.\nThe humanitarian situation remains critical,\nparticularly in mountainous areas, which are very hard to\nreach, and especially now, with winter approaching. We\nare convinced that not only the United Nations and its\n\n\n\nspecialized agencies but the World Bank, the International\nMonetary Fund, the European Union and the Organization\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development will work\ntogether successfully to promote a peaceful settlement of\nthe conflict and alleviate the hardship and pain of the long-\nsuffering Tajik people.\nWith regard to recent events in Afghanistan, we\nbelieve that a comprehensive political settlement must be\nfound to the Afghan conflict, that territorial integrity cannot\nbe ensured and that non-interference in the internal affairs\nof this sovereign country must be respected. We call on the\nSecurity Council to work for national reconciliation among\nthe warring factions and to seek an end to the long,\ndebilitating war that has destabilized the Asian continent as\na whole.\nHalf a century of experience of world political\ndevelopment under the aegis of the United Nations leads us\nto conclude that there should be more non-conflict,\nsustainably developing nuclear-weapon-free zones. This\nwould guarantee peace and security. The long-awaited hour\nhas come: the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has\nbeen signed by an overwhelming majority of States\nMembers of the United Nations. When I signed the Treaty\non behalf of my people, as the representative of a country\nthat until recently had been squeezed from both sides by\ntwo of the world\u2019s largest nuclear-weapon-testing areas, I\nexperienced a special feeling of satisfaction and hope for\nthe future of my country and for the whole world.\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nare major milestones on the road to a future nuclear-\nweapon-free world. We are resolved to make Central Asia\na nuclear-weapon-free zone. Support and appropriate\nguarantees from the nuclear States would constitute an\nimportant prerequisite for that achievement.\nThe Kyrgyz Republic is in favour of reforming the\nUnited Nations. The permanent membership of the Security\nCouncil should be enlarged to include Germany, Japan and\nrepresentatives of Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nEquitable geographical representation would also mean an\nincrease the number of non-permanent members of the\nCouncil. The nature of the interaction between the Security\nCouncil and the General Assembly should also change, and\nbecome more transparent.\nSince becoming Members of the United Nations less\nthan five years ago, the newly independent States have\nbecome full-fledged members of the United Nations family.\nWe, like others, were pleased about the establishment of\npeace in Haiti and Bosnia, and paid tribute to the many\npeople who lost their lives, in whatever part of the world.\nWith regard to regional alliances, we are developing our\nrelations equally with West and East, South and North.\nThree countries of our group \u2014 Kyrgyzstan, Kazakstan\nand Uzbekistan \u2014 are creating a Central Asian\npeacekeeping battalion to act as a future reserve force of\nBlue Helmets. On a basis of mutual respect, Russia,\nKazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan this year concluded\na treaty on confidence-building measures in the military\nsphere on the border with the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nWe are determined to learn every step of the way. We,\ntogether with the other Member States, are on the road to\nthe twenty-first century. By combining our efforts we\nshall be worthy to meet its new challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of my country and on\nmy own behalf, I extend to you, Sir, our warmest\ncongratulations on your unanimous election as President of\nthe fifty-first session of the Assembly. Your election is\nindeed a deserving tribute to you personally and to your\ngreat country, Malaysia, which, over the years, has been\nunflagging in its commitment to the principles and ideals of\nthis Organization \u2014 the attainment of international peace\nand justice. I am confident that your rich diplomatic\nexperience, coupled with your fine human qualities, will\nenable you to guide the deliberations of this session of the\nAssembly to a successful conclusion. Permit me, Sir, to\nalso take this opportunity to extend my delegation\u2019s\ngratitude to your predecessor for having so ably steered the\nAssembly\u2019s fiftieth session up to this momentous occasion.\nI should like at this point to convey our appreciation\nand gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for the dedicated and able manner in which\nhe has guided the work of the Organization. In this regard,\nwe reaffirm our support for the Organization of African\nUnity\u2019s (OAU) declaration on the Secretary-General\u2019s re-\nelection. Permit me, Mr. Secretary-General, to convey,\nthrough you, to the entire staff of the United Nations our\nadmiration for their loyalty and commitment to the\nOrganization.\nI bring also the greetings and good will of the\npeople of Sierra Leone. They have requested me to\nconvey our sincere gratitude to the international\ncommunity for its support in restoring democracy to our\ncountry in March this year. I stand here today as a\ntestimony to the right of that people, who in March of\nthis year elected their Government and chose their\ndestiny. As their leader, I am determined to live up to\ntheir high aspirations and expectations. Allow me on this\noccasion also to pay tribute to our gallant citizens, many\nof whom lost their lives in the process of restoring\ndemocracy and constitutional rule to our country.\nDespite this great achievement, my country is still\nhaunted and tormented by the spectre of ongoing civil\nconflict in our country. The rebel war inflicted severe\npain and suffering on my people, who had never before\nimagined that such a terrible thing could happen to us.\nThousands of innocent civilians \u2014 men, women and\nchildren \u2014 lost their lives; others were traumatized, as\nwell as physically or psychologically crippled for life; still\nothers continue to languish as refugees or displaced\npersons in inhospitable camps.\nThe Revolutionary United Front (RUF) has no\npolitical agenda and no respect for the democratic\nprocess. It consistently ignored an invitation to participate\nin the recent internationally supervised elections in spite\nof numerous appeals and offers of assistance by the\nUnited Nations and other intergovernmental organizations.\nInstead, it set out to disrupt those elections by unleashing\nviolence against the electorates, killing many and\nmaiming many more. Thanks to our determination to\nrestore democracy in our country, this RUF attempt\nfailed, as did its effort to collude with the military junta\nand share power in defiance of the democratic process.\nThe RUF draws its support from abducted villagers\nand rural schoolchildren, including girls aged seven and\nolder, and maintains their \u201cloyalty\u201d with the use of drugs\nand terror.\nThis notwithstanding, my Government entered into\npeace negotiations in the spirit of reconciliation, and I am\npleased to report that the talks have advanced\nconsiderably. In March 1996, just after my assumption of\noffice, a ceasefire was agreed upon. In spite of some\nincidents, it is still generally holding.\nOn behalf of the people and Government of the\nRepublic of Sierra Leone, I should like to take this\nopportunity to express my sincere thanks to the Secretary-\n4\n\n\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the continuing\nsupport he has afforded us to in promoting the cause of\ndemocratization and the restoration of peace in my country\nand, in particular, for his assignment of a Special Envoy,\nwhose constructive and enduring role has helped to advance\nthe peace process. I should also like to express gratitude to\nPresident Henri Konan-B\u00e9di\u00e9 and the Government and\npeople of the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire for the selfless and\npainstaking efforts they have deployed in hosting and\nmediating the talks between the Government of Sierra\nLeone and the RUF.\nAfter protracted and painstaking negotiations that\ninvolved extensive Government concessions, including a\ngeneral amnesty for all RUF members; an undertaking to\nhelp set up a trust fund for the RUF to assist it in\ntransforming itself into a political party; the offer of jobs to\nthe RUF leader and his followers, including their absorption\ninto the army, the police and other government institutions,\nthe RUF leader finally indicated his readiness to sign a\npeace agreement drafted by the host Government, C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire.\nHowever, the RUF leader now seems to be unwilling\nto honour his commitment to sign the agreement,\nmanufacturing various excuses to justify his prevarication.\nWe are concerned that continued intransigence and\nprevarication by the RUF could precipitate a full-scale\nresumption of hostilities, given the increasing level of\ndistrust between the two sides. It is therefore time for the\ninternational community to act to forestall this potential\ncatastrophe by demanding that the RUF sign the peace\nagreement without further delay. Failing this, the imposition\nof sanctions against it should be considered, including the\ndenial of access to the facilities and territories of third\ncountries, and the prospect of its arraignment before a war\ncrimes tribunal for the serious crimes being perpetrated\nagainst innocent civilians.\nWhile we persevere in our efforts to bring this conflict\nto a peaceful end, I owe it to our people to emphasize the\nneed for the continued support of the international\ncommunity to help us in the task of rehabilitation and\nreconstruction. We are encouraged by the outcome of the\nrecent round-table conference on Sierra Leone held in\nGeneva under the auspices of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP). We take this\nopportunity to express our sincere thanks to those countries\nthat have pledged generously to assist in our post-conflict\nrehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. We, for our part,\nare determined to rebuild our country with all the energy\nand resources we can muster from within our borders. We\nhave already embarked on this process, and we are\ndetermined to see it through, no matter what sacrifice is\nnecessary.\nTwo decades ago, the prevailing perception in this\nbody was that the end of the cold war would dramatically\nreduce the incidence of regional conflicts and thus\nenhance international peace and security. Today, however,\nthose conflicts appear to have been replaced by civil wars\nand ethnic strife, which now pose the greatest challenge\nto the peacekeeping and peacemaking capacities of the\nUnited Nations.\nWe have witnessed mass horrors in Rwanda and\nBurundi, and intense internal strife in Somalia, Liberia\nand, to a lesser extent, in my own country. Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Chechnya and the occupied Palestinian\nterritories all have continued to engage the attention of\nthe international community. We call upon the leaders and\nactors in those conflicts to renounce violence and to\nembark on sincere and serious negotiations with a view to\nfinding peaceful solutions. Agreements reached should be\nhonoured and respected. The innocent, who are all too\noften the victims of such conflicts, cry out for peaceful\nresolution.\nAs regards the question of the peaceful resolution of\nconflicts, of particular concern to my country is the\nsituation in Liberia. Consensus has once again emerged\nfrom the political dialogue between the various factions,\ngiving rise to renewed hopes of a durable peace for that\ndevastated country and its people. Full implementation of\nthe conditions embodied in the new implementation plan\nof the Abuja Agreement, concluded at the recent\nEconomic Community of West African States Committee\nof Nine summit held in Abuja, Federal Republic of\nNigeria, would provide real hope for Liberia. We remain\nconfident that this time around, those responsible for the\nLiberians\u2019 pain and suffering will find the courage and\npatriotism to spare their fellow citizens further violence\nand bloodshed. Enough is enough. The defenceless people\nof Liberia, especially innocent children, men and women,\nhave a right to freedom from violence; they have a right\nto life.\nThe situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa is\nalso cause for serious concern. As we watch the cautious\nreturn of Rwandan refugees, we hope and pray that the\nwounds inflicted by ethnic strife will heal on the platform\nof national reconciliation. The ongoing crisis in Burundi\nalso poses a challenge to the international community. In\n5\n\n\nthe light of my own country\u2019s recent history, we cannot\ncondone the seizure of power by the military from a\nconstitutionally elected Government. We call on all\nconcerned not to relent in their search for a long-term\nsolution to the horrendous crisis. Looking at the broader\npicture of tackling such difficulties, we hope that others\nwill support the efforts of the Organization of African\nUnity to strengthen its Mechanism for the prevention and\nresolution of conflicts.\nClosely linked to the issue of peace is that of the\nprotection of human rights. We reaffirm our faith in justice\nand in the dignity and worth of the human person. That is\nwhy Sierra Leone fully supports the work of the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\nWe commend the work of the Preparatory Committee for\nits current efforts aimed at preparing the text of a statute\nfor an international criminal court, which will have an\nimportant role in the area of massive human rights\nviolations, which, notwithstanding the sad lessons of\nhistory, continue today in several parts of the world.\nWhile political, regional and ethnic conflicts, civil\nwars and the menace of armaments \u2014 both nuclear and\nconventional \u2014 are a major concern, Sierra Leone believes\nthat the greatest threat to international peace and security\ntoday lies in poverty and in economic and social\ndeprivation. The nature and complexity of the economic\nand social problems that beset Africa are all too familiar to\nus. The majority of African countries, including Sierra\nLeone, continue to face a myriad of economic and\nstructural challenges. Africa has the largest number of least\ndeveloped countries and the lowest average per capita\nincome in the developing world. In fact, Africa\u2019s overall\nliving standards and socio-economic conditions have\ndeteriorated considerably since the beginning of this decade.\nMost African countries have encountered numerous\ndifficulties over the years in their effort to mobilize and\ndeploy financial and human resources for economic\ndevelopment. The levels of investment have not been\nencouraging; nor have the levels of agricultural and mineral\noutputs, due in large part to drought, economic\ndisincentives, political manipulation and an unfavourable\ninternational environment. In many cases, aided and abetted\nby ruthless arms merchants, many of us continue to engage\nin senseless fratricidal conflicts and the wanton destruction\nof the development infrastructure.\nWe are also obliged to note that budgetary constraints\nfaced by various developed countries, clarification of\nforeign aid objectives, revised conditions governing the\ngranting of assistance, and the heightened competition\namong various regions for aid packages constitute a\nserious challenge for developing countries such as mine.\nThe ubiquitous debt burden and the debt- servicing levels\nin no way help the situation, as they continue to be a\nmajor stumbling block on the path of African economic\nrecovery and sustainable growth. Overseas development\nassistance and resource flows have dwindled to a level\nthat gives us cause for concern. The downward trend in\nexport commodity prices and the agricultural policies of\nsome of the industrialized nations have had a negative\nimpact on Africa\u2019s trade in these commodities, the main\nsource of income for socio-economic development. In this\nconnection, the debt burden that continues to hang over us\nhas conspired to frustrate our efforts at economic recovery\nand development.\nSierra Leone strongly believes that the urgent\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s, adopted by the\nAssembly on 18 December 1991, is the best hope yet for\nsetting Africa on the road to positive sustainable\neconomic development. We appreciate the fact that the\nbasic tenets of the New Agenda are grounded on the\nprinciples of shared responsibility and global partnership\nbetween Africa and the rest of the international\ncommunity.\nVirtually all Member States of the first and second\nworlds represented in the Assembly have experienced, at\none time or another, the same or similar problems in their\nstruggle for national unity and economic prosperity; we\nread about them in the cold pages of history.\nUnfortunately for us Africans, our economic and other\nproblems \u2014 teething problems, if I may say so \u2014 are\ntransmitted live, instantly, by satellite to television sets\nacross the globe.\nLooking at current economic, social and political\nconditions on our continent, including the atrocities meted\nout to our own kith and kin, one is inclined to lose hope\nin the ability of Africa to achieve sustainable\ndevelopment.\nBut the thrust of my message today is simple: I\nappeal to the international community not to abandon\nAfrica. Even though we may be on our knees in anguish,\nI firmly believe that there is hope for Africa, that Africa\nand its people have the ability and capacity to overcome\nnatural and self-inflicted constraints and to achieve\npolitical stability as well as reasonable economic\nprosperity. We have recently witnessed many changes on\nthe continent that lend credence to Africa\u2019s genuine\n6\n\n\ncommitment to the New Agenda for Africa and to other\nplans for economic and political stability. Hence, there is\nstill hope for Africa. My presence here is symbolic of that\nhope. In spite of a rebel war that still hangs over my\ncountry, and in spite of attempts to frustrate the will of the\npeople to choose their destiny freely and in a democratic\nmanner, Sierra Leoneans opted for democracy. We are\ndetermined to achieve genuine peace as well as the\nobjectives we have set for ourselves, which are\ncommensurate with the enormous sacrifices our people have\nmade.\nI am confident, therefore, that the political dialogue to\nensure the advent of good governance, which has begun in\nearnest in most countries throughout the continent, will\ncontinue. Given the proper chance to grow, our new and\nemerging democracies will gradually bear fruit, and our\ndistressed nations will once again be guided by lofty\ndemocratic ideals in an environment of peace, security and\nstability. African democracy will eventually be the order of\nthe day. For these gains to be fully realized, it is therefore\nimperative that the international community continue to\nplay a catalytic role in Africa\u2019s development.\nIn virtually every policy statement, every address and\nevery current discussion about the United Nations there is\nsome reference to reform in our Organization. We are\nencouraged by the work of various intergovernmental\nbodies to develop constructive ideas for reform. However,\nreform should not be seen only in terms of the so-called\nbloated bureaucracy of the Secretariat, to be used as a\nscapegoat for not meeting our obligations towards the\nOrganization.\nIn the view of the Government of Sierra Leone, we\nneed a systemic reform; a reform of the political decision-\nmaking process in the Organization; a reform of some of\nthe archaic methods and practices in the institutions that\ncompose the United Nations system. Let us begin by\ntransforming, indeed transferring, the principles and\nconcepts of democratic governance, empowerment, power-\nsharing, decentralization and pluralism that we espouse for\nnation States to the international community at large. In this\nregard, Africa should be entitled to play its role in the\nSecurity Council, the primary decision-making organ of this\nOrganization, particularly in relation to international peace\nand stability.\nIn pursuit of this objective, we would like to recall\nand support the position expressed by the Non-Aligned\nMovement, that is, if there is no agreement on other\ncategories of membership, expansion should take place, for\nthe time being, only in the non-permanent category. I\nshould like to note in this regard that the proposal of\nItaly, among others, deserves careful consideration, as it\naims at increasing the participation of all Member States\nin the Council, in particular medium-sized and small\ncountries, and it would improve its representative and\ndemocratic character.\nFor our part, we affirm our faith in the United\nNations, which, in spite of its defects, remains the\ngreatest hope for the maintenance of international peace\nand security, and for the promotion of the economic and\nsocial advancement of all peoples in our interdependent\nworld.\nWho needs the United Nations? First, it is an\nimportant institution. Furthermore, it is an effective\ninternational mechanism when used properly. Some of us\nrepresented in the Assembly may need it more than\nothers, but we all do, in one way or another.\nLet us therefore rededicate ourselves to its principles\nand objectives, and, in the words of the Charter, make it\nat least\n\u201ca centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in\nthe attainment of these common ends\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, I would like to express to the President my\nsincere and warm congratulations upon his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\nsession. My delegation is convinced that his skills, his\nperfect mastery of international issues and his unstinting\nefforts will bring the work of our session to a satisfactory\nconclusion. In the same context, I would like to assure\nhim of my delegation\u2019s readiness to cooperate with him\nin the discharge of his lofty mission.\nIt is also a pleasure for me to commend the\nremarkable work done by his predecessor, Mr. Diogo\nFreitas do Amaral, who stamped the fiftieth session with\nthe seal of his effectiveness and dedication. I pay tribute\nto him on behalf of my delegation.\nI would also like to congratulate Secretary-General\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali for the noteworthy way in which\nhe has devoted his energies to the achievement of the\nobjectives of our Organization and to enhancing day by\nday its credibility. He has all the respect of the Togolese\ndelegation.\nThe economic, political and social context of this\nsession hardly seems to differ from that of previous years:\nthe ongoing conflicts continue to take many victims.\nMoreover, terrorism continues to have a great impact on\nthe world, and the burden of debt, with all its\nimplications, holds in check the development of many\ncountries, particularly those of Africa. All these\nphenomena cast a shadow over the international landscape\nand prompt concerns regarding the genuine advent of\npeace, security and prosperity, to which all of humanity\nlegitimately aspires.\nIt is in this context that Togo has endeavoured to\nconsolidate the basis of a state of law and to confront the\nimperatives of sustainable human development to ensure\nthe social well-being of its people.\nTogo has begun the process of democratizing\nnational political life, and the process has had a normal\nand encouraging development, particularly in the last\nthree years. The calm, orderly and transparent holding of\npartial legislative elections on 4 and 18 August 1996\nillustrates the resolve of the Togolese people, with the\nimpetus of the Head of State, Mr. Gnassingbe Eyadema,\n16\n\n\nto move forward along the road to democracy, peace and\npolitical stability, which guarantee social and economic\ndevelopment.\nHaving learned the lessons of a difficult democratic\ntransition, which ripped the social fabric and cast into doubt\nthe achievements of its development process, the population\nof Togo is more aware than ever before of the need to\npreserve and strengthen its unity. By doing so it will be\nable to effectively meet present and future challenges,\nensure its prosperity and make its modest contribution to\nthe building of a better world. The President of the\nRepublic and the Government of Togo intend to continue\nto work tirelessly in this direction, in concert with other\nmembers of the international community. They are satisfied\nto note today that the people of Togo, through the hardships\nthat they have endured, have acquired a clear awareness of\nself-responsibility. Thus, having supported the efforts of\ntheir leaders for several months, they more and more firmly\nreject political formulas and organization approaches\ndesigned in other climes that have proved unsuitable in the\ncontext of their history and culture. In the view of many\nobservers, the Togolese people, through the countless\nmanifestations of its political will, is cultivating the\nauthentic African democracy that we all desire.\nLast year the United Nations commemorated the\nfiftieth anniversary of its founding. On that occasion, the\nGeneral Assembly observed in its Declaration:\n\u201cThe determination, enshrined in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations, to save succeeding generations from\nthe scourge of war' is as vital today as it was fifty\nyears ago.\u201d (resolution 50/6, first para.)\nThe many ethnic or religious armed conflicts that still scar\nthe international landscape confirm this view of the General\nAssembly and demonstrate the magnitude of the task still\nfacing the Organization.\nAfrica remains one of the world\u2019s regions of tension,\nand our continent has been sorely tested by cruel conflicts\npersisting in a number of States. The Government of Togo\ndeplores the fact that conflicts such as those in Liberia,\nSierra Leone, Somalia, Burundi and Angola have not yet\nbeen definitively resolved. The huge numbers of victims,\nrefugees, displaced persons and the massive destruction\ncaused by these conflicts should be enough to convince the\nparties concerned of the need to put an end to their\ndisputes, which could tire the patience and perseverance of\nthe international community in its efforts.\nConcerned over the deteriorating situation in these\ncountries, the Togolese Government urges the various\nactors to seek a peaceful solution to their disputes,\nthrough dialogue and cooperation, so that their peoples\ncan at last find the peace and stability necessary for their\ndevelopment.\nWith respect more specifically to Liberia, my\ndelegation welcomes the bold measures taken by the\nCommittee of Nine of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) at its meeting in Abuja last\nAugust, aimed at successfully concluding the peace\nprocess begun many years ago. These measures,\naccompanied by sanctions, attest to the determination of\nthe ECOWAS countries to do their utmost to find a\ndefinitive and lasting solution to this fratricidal and\nseemingly endless conflict.\nAt this new stage of the process, it is important for\nour Liberian brothers to recognize the tremendous efforts\nmade by the ECOWAS States, the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and the United Nations, and to\nshow good will in order to facilitate the effective\nimplementation of the Abuja Agreement of 19 August\n1995, which provides the means to end this conflict and\nto return to peace and to constitutional normalcy.\nWith respect to the dispute over the Bakassi\npeninsula, my country would like to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General\u2019s efforts towards a peaceful settlement.\nThese efforts, which recently took the form of the\ndispatch of a good-offices mission to Cameroon, Nigeria,\nBakassi and Togo, may help strengthen the interim\nmeasures aimed at reducing tensions, while waiting for a\njudgement to be handed down by the International Court\nof Justice.\nTogo is determined to work towards resolving all\nconflicts by peaceful means and to safeguard peace and\nsecurity on the African continent. Thus my country and\nits President are prepared to contribute to the restoration\nof peace on the peninsula and to the normalization of\nrelations between the two countries. In the same spirit, the\nGovernment of Togo hopes that the good will shown by\nthe two parties during the visit of the Secretary-General\u2019s\ngood-offices mission will continue to prevail, so that the\ndesired goal may be achieved as soon as possible.\nThe persistence of these conflicts, which deeply\nundermine our continent\u2019s development efforts, compels\nme to recall the proposal made at the thirtieth session of\nthe OAU conference of Heads of State and Government\n17\n\n\nby President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo aimed at\nestablishing an inter-African force charged with keeping the\npeace wherever it is threatened or breached.\nWe welcome the various initiatives undertaken to that\nend to make this idea a reality, so that Africa, with the\nsupport of the international community, might better\nmanage conflict situations, which divert the efforts of the\nAfrican peoples from the priorities of economic and social\ndevelopment.\nAlong the same lines, given the numerous conflicts the\nOAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\nResolution will have to face and in light of the illicit\ntrafficking in small arms and light weapons, it is important\nto strengthen the activities of the United Nations Regional\nCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, headquartered\nin Togo. To that end, it would be appropriate if the Centre,\nestablished pursuant to resolution 40/151 G of 16 December\n1985 by the General Assembly at the request of OAU\nHeads of State and Government, could benefit from\nadequate and appropriate resources so that it could fully\ndischarge its duties. In that context, I should like to\nreaffirm that the Government of Togo, which attaches great\nimportance to this Centre, will do its utmost to honour its\ncommitments as the host country.\nThe 1991 Madrid Peace Conference on the Middle\nEast and the Washington agreements of 13 September 1993,\ninter alia, have sparked hopes regarding a negotiated\nsettlement of the question of Palestine and the conflict in\nthe Middle East as a whole. The evacuation of certain\noccupied territories of Palestine, the establishment of the\nPalestinian Authority, the repeal of anti-Israel provisions\nfrom the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) charter,\nand the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, are positive\noccurrences that bear witness to the progress achieved in\nthe context of the Middle East peace process. Togo\nwelcomes this progress.\nHowever, the difficulties that have confronted this\nprocess in the last few days, jeopardizing its normal\ndevelopment, are a source of grave concern for my\ndelegation. The delegation of Togo is particularly concerned\nat the tragic events that took place last week in Jerusalem,\nwhich claimed many Palestinian and Israeli victims.\nTogo, which endorses Security Council resolution\n1073 (1996), adopted on 28 September 1996, calls for\ngreater energy in the continuation of the process until it\nachieves concrete results. It urges the evacuation of all\noccupied Arab territories, the existence of Israel within\nsecure and internationally recognized borders, and the\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian state. At any\nrate, it is important to achieve a just and comprehensive\npeace benefiting all countries of the region, in accordance\nwith the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.\nWith respect to the war in the former Yugoslavia, I\nshould like on behalf of the Togolese Government to\nheartily congratulate the architects of the Dayton\nAgreement, signed in Paris on 14 December 1995, and to\nexpress our appreciation at the acceptable development of\nthe situation in the light of the implementation of that\nAgreement. We would like to encourage the main actors\nin that conflict to continue to seek a negotiated settlement\naimed at a definitive return to peace and stability in that\npart of Europe.\nAside from hotbeds of tension, we must note that\nterrorism, which we condemn, is, because of its\npernicious objectives and criminal acts, one of the gravest\nthreats today to international peace and security. We\nwelcome the holding of the Summit for Peacemakers in\nSharm el-Sheikh and the recent meeting of the Ministers\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Group of 7 major industrialized\ncountries and of the Russian Federation in Paris. The\nGovernment of Togo welcomes the various measures\nadvocated at these two meetings in order to energetically\nthwart the activities of transnational criminal\norganizations and their agents.\nWith respect to the safeguarding of peace through\ndisarmament, Togo reiterates its firm commitment to\ngeneral and complete disarmament, and supports\nunreservedly the efforts of the international community to\nachieve that objective. In this connection, my delegation\nconsiders that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT), opened for signature by States on 24\nSeptember 1996, and which I have just signed on behalf\nof the Government of Togo, will undoubtedly contribute,\nif it is accepted and applied by all, to a reduction of the\nnuclear threat. This would allow the international\ncommunity to make headway towards the definitive\nelimination of nuclear weapons, which is one of the most\nardent wishes of humanity.\nAs the Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth\nAnniversary of the United Nations states:\n\u201cA dynamic, vigorous, free and equitable\ninternational economic environment is essential\nto the well-being of humankind and to\n18\n\n\ninternational peace, security and stability.\u201d\n(resolution 50/6, para. 2)\nThis unanimous recognition of the positive effects that\na sound international economic climate can have on world\nstability is absolutely accurate. The growing indifference of\na large part of the international community to the search for\nappropriate solutions to the current economic crisis is\nbecoming increasingly disturbing. Indeed, while in the\nindustrialized countries the overall socio-economic situation\nis experiencing positive developments and while the\ndisparities in their economic performances are decreasing,\nwe note with regret that the developing countries,\nparticularly in those of Africa, still languish under the debt\nburden and have great difficulty in extricating themselves\nfrom the situation they have been in for several years.\nAs has been repeatedly pointed out, the solution to the\neconomic problems of the developing countries requires\nradical and innovative solutions, inter alia, the cancellation\nor appreciable reduction of their debts and the\nimplementation of bold measures aimed at promoting their\nprogress.\nMy delegation welcomes the efforts made so far by\ncreditors to resolve the debt problem. It appreciates the\nresolve expressed by the seven major industrialized\ncountries at the G-7 Lyons Summit to take additional action\nto reduce the debt burden of the poorest countries vis-\u00e0-vis\nmultilateral institutions and bilateral creditors that are not\nmembers of the Paris Club. It welcomes in particular the\nrecent decision of the Ministers for Finance of the seven\nmajor industrialized countries, at their meeting in\nWashington, to alleviate the debt burden of the poorest\ncountries, up to a limit of 80 per cent.\nAside from the question of debt, my delegation is also\nconcerned with other problems of development. Aware that\nthey are primarily responsible for promoting their own\ndevelopment through sound and consistent economic and\nsocial policies, the developing countries involved in\nstructural adjustment programmes have made enormous\nsacrifices, which, unfortunately, have not yet achieved the\ndesired results. Thus most of these countries face serious\nsocial problems, including endemic disease, hunger,\nunemployment, a high number of unemployed graduates,\nstrident claims by its citizens and poverty.\nTo confront and resolve these various ills in a lasting\nmanner, the international community must show greater\nsolidarity and mobilize, together with these countries, to\nrender them the necessary assistance. Moreover, in order\nfor it to take off economically, Africa must stop being\nviewed as just a reservoir of raw materials.\nAt this time of globalization of the economy and the\nliberalization of markets, it is imperative that African\nStates become competitive in international trade. To this\nend, they must meet the challenges of industrial\ndevelopment through sustained technical and financial\ncooperation with the industrialized countries. Moreover,\nit is important that Africa not become dependent on the\nexploitation of raw materials, whose prices are constantly\ndeteriorating. The pace of its industrialization must be\nencouraged to accelerate through international cooperation\nbased on partnership and the support of developed\ncountries, development-related bodies and the relevant\nmultilateral financial institutions.\nIn that connection, the Government of Togo, which\ncreated and continues to strengthen conditions that favour\nforeign investment in its free zone, inter alia, would like\nto express its gratitude to both its public and private\npartners and to the industrial development institutions\nthat, through their investments and various forms of\nassistance, have supported its initiatives in this domain.\nThe World Food Summit will be held in Rome next\nNovember. The Government of Togo hopes that the work\nof the Summit will meet with success and that the\nrecommendations that will be adopted there will help to\nimprove the food and agricultural situation so that the\nneeds of peoples in this sphere can be met.\nTogo welcomes the United Nations System-wide\nSpecial Initiative on Africa, launched on 15 March 1996\nby the Secretary-General. We see in this initiative a\nconfirmation of the commitment of the Secretary-General\nand the United Nations system to give concrete reality to\nthe objectives of the San Francisco Charter in order,\ninter alia, to support development in Africa.\nAt a time when the economic and social situation of\nAfrica is constantly deteriorating, it is important to duly\nappreciate this Special Initiative promoting a partnership\nbetween political and economic institutions and African\nGovernments. One of the Initiative\u2019s good points is that\nit deals substantively with problems and focuses primarily\non action towards peace, political stability and\ndevelopment on the continent. However, in order for it to\nachieve its objectives, the international community must\nbecome effectively involved in its implementation by\nmaking a decisive contribution to the mobilization of the\nnecessary financial resources, so that it does not become\n19\n\n\nsimply just another initiative for Africa. My Government\nwill devote the necessary attention to it in order to turn the\nsituation to best account.\nIn today\u2019s world, where nations are confronted with\nthe paradox of fragmentation and globalization, the United\nNations, more than ever before, has a key role to play.\nThus, in connection with the severe lack of resources that\nhas brought the United Nations to the brink of bankruptcy,\nmy Government is among those which believes that no\nreform of the Organization can succeed if the Organization\nhas to fight for its own survival. It is therefore urgent that\ndrastic measures be taken to ensure a stable financial base\nfor the Organization and to put a definitive end to this\npayments crisis, which has paralysed it. The principal States\nin arrears should show the political will to help resolve the\ncrisis.\nIn the view of my delegation, improved effectiveness\nof the United Nations is a must; but it is also important to\npromote its democratization. We believe, therefore, that the\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\nSecurity Council is proceeding in the right direction. Given\nthe present configuration of the United Nations, and as\nnoted by the Working Group, it is necessary to contemplate\nan equitable and responsible increase in the number of\npermanent and non-permanent members of the Council and\nto strengthen its links with the main organs of the United\nNations and with the Member States, so as to enhance\ntransparency.\nFor many decades, thanks to the sustained efforts of\nthe United Nations, multilateralism has clearly been the\nmost appropriate framework for resolving problems relating\nto international peace and security and to development.\nThe balance sheet drawn up last year, on the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Organization, was encouraging despite\ncertain shortcomings. Nevertheless, much remains to be\ndone. Greater efforts are required on the part of Member\nStates, as well as greater resources, so that a reformed and\nrevitalized United Nations, better adapted to current\nrealities, can respond effectively to the expectations of\nhumanity as a whole.\nIn the discharge of the lofty mission assigned to the\nOrganization, Togo, for its part, will associate itself without\nreservation to any initiative aimed at safeguarding\ninternational peace and security and promoting justice,\nhuman rights and progress for the benefit of all nations.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I begin by extending to\nMr. Razali the warmest congratulations of the delegation of\nthe Union of Myanmar on his most deserving election as\nPresident of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly.\nHis election to that important office is no doubt a reflection\nof the high esteem in which his country, Malaysia, is held\nby the international community for its active role in world\naffairs, and of his wealth of personal experience and\ndiplomatic skills. We are confident that under his\nleadership our deliberations will be fruitful. On a personal\nnote, I should like to say how deeply honoured I was to\nhave accompanied the Head of State Senior General Than\nShwe on his state visit to Malaysia last month. The visit\nwas a success. We were much impressed by the warm\nreception accorded us and by the outstanding\nachievements of the leadership in bringing peace and\nprosperity to the people of Malaysia.\nI wish also to express our appreciation to\nMr. Razali\u2019s predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Diogo\nFreitas do Amaral, for his invaluable contribution to the\nwork of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\nThe United Nations today is at a crossroads. On the\none hand, there is hope for a new era in international\nrelations as post- cold-war trends compel nations towards\never-growing interdependence and the globalization of the\nworld economy. On the other hand, issues that have been\ndormant for decades have emerged, drawing the world\ninto a pattern of conflict, ethnic strife and violence. In\nthis time of global transformation the United Nations has\nan important role to play. It must actively work to guide\nthe world through the transitional period to a new,\npeaceful, secure and stable era based on respect for the\nCharter.\nIn this United Nations Decade of International Law\nit would be most appropriate to rededicate ourselves to\nachieving a world in which principles of sovereignty,\nterritorial integrity, independence, sovereign equality and\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States are\nrespected. Myanmar truly believes that we can overcome\nthe political, economic and social challenges we face and\navoid confrontation and chaos only if we seize the\nopportunity to extend and strengthen the Organization and\npromote a multilateral system based on the primacy of\ninternational law and freedom of choice and equality of\nall States.\nDisarmament, sustainable development, enhancement\nof the environment and suppression of narcotic drugs are\npriority issues that affect the security and well-being of\npeoples throughout the world. Concern continues to\nmount over the lack of adequate progress in these areas.\nThe proliferation of arms, particularly of weapons of mass\ndestruction, remains the greatest potential threat to\nmankind\u2019s survival. All States, large and small, nuclear\nand non-nuclear, have a vital interest in ensuring the\nsuccess of negotiations on disarmament. The primary\nresponsibility for removing the threat of a nuclear\n16\n\n\nholocaust, however, rests with the nuclear-weapon States.\nIt is essential that the nuclear-weapon States show the\npolitical will to accommodate the concerns of non-nuclear-\nweapon States to achieve a mutually acceptable basis for\nuniversal disarmament.\nMyanmar continues to regard a comprehensive test-ban\ntreaty as an essential step towards nuclear disarmament.\nThe adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT) by the General Assembly on 10 September\n1996 is a welcome development. It will contribute\nsignificantly to the process of nuclear disarmament and to\nour efforts to achieve the goal of general and complete\ndisarmament.\nMyanmar has always supported the establishment of\nnuclear-free zones. In our own region we have, together\nwith our neighbours, signed and ratified the South East\nAsia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone Treaty. Peace and security\nin the world need to be built upon economic development.\nWithout development there can be no lasting peace. It must\nbe realized, however, that economic progress in developing\ncountries depends as much on a fair and equitable\ninternational economic environment as it does on domestic\nreforms to effectively confront the challenge of poverty and\neconomic malaise. In this regard, we share the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s view that development should be recognized as\nthe foremost and most far-reaching task of our time. At the\nsame time, we are deeply concerned that the process of\nglobalization of the world economy has yielded many more\nlosers than winners. The situation was most eloquently\ndescribed by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement,\nPresident Samper Pizano of Colombia, in his address to the\nMeeting of the Ministerial Committee on Methodology held\nearlier this year in Cartagena:\n\u201cThe cake of progress continues to be handed out in\nlarge slices for a few, and in crumbs for the rest.\u201d\nIndeed it is distressing to note the dangerous tendency\nof certain States to link trade and commerce with other\nissues. We find unacceptable the threat or use of economic\nsanctions and the extraterritorial application of domestic law\nto influence policies in developing countries. The use of\neconomic sanctions as a tool of policy is indefensible. It is\na flagrant breach of the United Nations Charter.\nNarcotic drugs are a growing menace to the\ninternational community. Aware of the problem, Myanmar\nis carrying out narcotics suppression as a national cause.\nFrom the outset the Myanmar Government realized that the\ndrug problem can be tackled only through a multisectoral\napproach and has laid down national strategies to combat\nthe menace. The nationwide drug-abuse control\nprogramme covers many activities: crop substitution and\nlivestock distribution for farmers in the border areas\nwhere opium is grown; treatment and rehabilitation of\ndrug addicts; preventive education; and law enforcement.\nThe areas where poppies are grown are underdeveloped\nregions where the national races depend on the cultivation\nof opium as their principal means of livelihood. Hence,\nthe Government has set up an entire ministry devoted to\nthe development of border areas. The development of\nthese areas will no doubt ensure the success of the\neradication campaign.\nIn parallel with the national effort, the Government\nhas sought closer cooperation with the United Nations\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) and\nneighbouring countries, and is actively participating in the\ninternational campaign against the production and\ntrafficking of illicit drugs. Our efforts are meeting with\nsuccess, as one armed group after another has returned to\nthe fold to join hands with the Government in\ndevelopment endeavours. An encouraging event this year\nwas the unconditional surrender of the Mong Tai Army of\nnearly 20,000 men, led by U Khun Sa. We are confident\nthat this unprecedented achievement will result in a\ndrastic reduction of the opium supply.\nI should like to firmly reiterate Myanmar\u2019s\ncommitment to the total eradication of poppy plantations\nin our country. The sheer magnitude of the problem\nrequires new ways and means to address the problem.\nThere must be additional efforts to curb demand, just as\nwe work to deter production and trafficking. We would\nwelcome increased support for our national programmes\nor for development projects administered by UNDCP.\nEnvironment issues are among the most widely\ndiscussed topics of our times. Environment and\ndevelopment top the international agenda as human\nimpact on the environment has increased dramatically and\nmankind faces challenges unprecedented in scope and\nseverity. The tremendous growth in population, coupled\nwith industrial development in every region of the world,\nhas taxed the carrying capacity of the Earth. The struggle\neven to support the present population at today\u2019s\nstandards of living will cause environmental degradation\non an unprecedented scale. However, in the last few years\nseeds of hope have been sown, as there is growing\nawareness in the world that the causes and consequences\nof environmental degradation transcend boundaries and\nthat our future world must be one of partnership.\n17\n\n\nMyanmar is aware that different elements of\necological systems are linked. It is only through an\nintegrated approach at the national, regional and global\nlevels that we can achieve sustainable development. For this\nreason we have been endeavouring to contribute to the\nprotection and promotion of the environment at every level.\nIn developing countries like Myanmar, forests,\nfarmlands, fisheries and freshwater constitute the foundation\nof development. In Myanmar we are fortunate that these\nresources are abundant and are not under stress. This is\nlargely the result of the traditional culture that pervades\ndaily life. Planting trees, creating gardens and parks,\nbuilding bridges, digging wells, and providing rest houses\nand monasteries are considered meritorious deeds. The\npeople of Myanmar love and respect nature and seek to live\nin harmony with the environment. The history of Myanmar\nis replete with accounts of environmental conservation\ncarried out by Myanmar monarchs. The ancient kings had\nthe vision to protect teak forests by royal decree and to\nensure systematic management of forest resources.\nIn the three years following the World Conference on\nHuman Rights, increasing emphasis has been placed on the\npromotion and protection of human rights. While we can\nwelcome the spirit in which the question of human rights is\nconsidered, we are seriously concerned by the growing\ntendency of certain Western countries to politicize the\nquestion of human rights and to use it as a tool to interfere\nin the domestic affairs of States. We firmly believe that the\ninternational community should take a more holistic\napproach to the question of human rights and not be\npreoccupied with individual rights and freedoms.\nAny government, institution or individual seeking to\npromote human rights should bear in mind the significance\nof national and regional peculiarities as well as historical,\ncultural and religious backgrounds and the stage of\neconomic development. In Myanmar and other developing\ncountries, poverty remains an effective obstacle to the full\nenjoyment of those rights. For this reason we are\nredoubling our efforts to ensure our peoples\u2019 right to\ndevelopment so that they can be delivered from the clutches\nof poverty.\nThe allegations that wholesale repressive measures are\nbeing carried out in Myanmar have never been borne out.\nOn the contrary, the peace and stability that now reign in\nthe country have allowed it to achieve significant progress.\nContinued economic reform will positively affect the living\nstandards of all citizens. At present there is potential in\nMyanmar for unprecedented peace and development and for\nit to join the ranks of the fast-growing economies in its\nregion. The international community can do no better than\nto help Myanmar by playing a constructive role.\nIn recent years a few countries, such as Myanmar,\nhave been singled out by certain countries for punitive\naction. Central to any assessment of the proper course of\npolicy towards any country is an understanding of the\nconditions that prevail there. In the case of Myanmar, first\nand foremost, it should be noted that it is undergoing\nimportant reforms. Regrettably, no credit has been given\nto the Myanmar Government for bringing about political\nstability and economic progress in a short period of eight\nyears.\nThe Government has initiated economic reforms\naimed at transforming the centrally planned economy into\na market-oriented one. Private investment and domestic\nentrepreneurial activity have been encouraged, and the\neconomy has been opened to direct foreign investment.\nPrivate-sector participation in both domestic and foreign\ntrade has been promoted. The economic reforms are\nbearing fruit and have led to sustained growth. In the past\nfour years the economy recorded an average growth rate\nof 8.2 per cent, resulting in increased employment\nopportunities and significantly rising living standards in\nthe country, primarily in urban areas, where private\nenterprises are flourishing, and in fertile rural areas,\nwhere farmers have better incentive to grow and market\ntheir produce.\nForeign investments in Myanmar today totals $4.3\nbillion and is expected to grow in the coming years. That\nthe pace of economic activity has quickened is reflected\nnot only within the country but abroad, where a growing\nnumber of Myanmar representatives are taking part in\ninternational and regional forums, including sports,\nbusiness and intellectual meetings.\nWe in Myanmar are aware that the best hope for a\nbrighter future lies in our national races joining together\nto ensure the stability of the State, community peace and\ntranquillity. To this end a national convention is being\nheld to adopt guidelines for a new State constitution, in\naccordance with which a peaceful, modern and developed\nnation will be built.\nIt should be appreciated that Myanmar is a union\ncomposed of 135 national races from which 16 armed\ngroups have evolved, some dating back to 1948, the year\nof our independence. It should also be noted that, despite\nthe magnitude of the task, the Myanmar Government has\n18\n\n\nsucceeded in bringing back to the fold 15 out of the 16\narmed groups and has established a separate Ministry for\nProgress of Border Areas and National Races and\nDevelopment Affairs. Insurgency, which hindered\ndevelopment for decades, is now virtually over, and all the\nenergy of the defence forces and the people is being\ndevoted to nation-building. One fact that is often\noverlooked is the pervasive influence of traditional culture\nin Myanmar, as a result of which leniency has been shown\nto offenders. Although a number of death sentences were\nhanded down by civil and military courts following the\n1988 unrest in the country, none has been carried out.\nOne factor that demonstrates our confidence in the\npositive changes taking place in Myanmar is our readiness\nto open our doors to tourists. This year has been designated\n\u201cVisit Myanmar Year\u201d, and we are expecting hundreds of\nthousands of visitors despite the negative campaign\nlaunched by critics. Those who call for a travel boycott to\nMyanmar should remember that tourism benefits a wide\nrange of people, the visitors as well as the hosts. Big hotels\nand travel agencies, as well as the family-run stalls that sell\neverything from hand-crafted jewellery to lacquer-ware and\nwood carvings, stand to make a living. Why not encourage\ntourists to come to Myanmar and see for themselves the\nvast transformations taking place?\nToday, as we stand on the threshold of a new\nmillennium, we have before us both opportunities and\nchallenges. At this time of important change and\ntransformation, the United Nations and its Member States\nmust strive to ensure that all nations can live in peace and\nharmony. To this end, we will need a man of exceptional\nskills and wisdom at the helm of the Organization in the\nyears ahead. We should continue to seek the best man for\nthe job, bearing in mind the personal skills and integrity\nthat the important post demands. The choice of the\nSecretary-General of the Organization assumes an even\ngreater importance at this time, when we see increasing\nresort to the threat or use of force in a manner inconsistent\nwith the purposes and principles of the Organization.\nIn conclusion, I should like to renew Myanmar\u2019s\npledge to work with all nations to strengthen the\nOrganization and to achieve universal peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI join my colleague,\nMinister Dick Spring of Ireland, who spoke on behalf of\nthe European Union, in congratulating you, Sir, on your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly. As a\nrepresentative with a long and distinguished career in\nUnited Nations affairs, you are especially qualified to guide\nour work in the coming year.\nAs the present century draws to a close, we need to\nask ourselves what shape the United Nations is in. Is it\nready to face the world that lies ahead? Is it ready to meet\nthe needs of generations that are still to be born? The\nrealities confronting us today may still be the realities of\ntomorrow, and they are formidable. We are witnessing\nincreasing poverty, a growing rift between rich and poor,\nmigration, population pressure, dwindling food stocks,\nhazards to public health and the environment, drugs,\nterrorism, internal conflicts and wholesale violations of\nhuman rights: a daunting litany.\nIn the face of these realities, to argue in favour of\nreform of this Organization would be stating the obvious.\nOf course we need reform. Clearly, the United Nations,\nover the years, has turned into an institutional jungle\nwhere outsiders do not venture, an organization which for\nthat reason alone has lost much of its credibility and\nwhich is badly in need of revitalization. We have to\nreform. There is no alternative.\nWe need reforms to get back what we have lost; that\nis, not power, but authority. Power is wielded on many\ndifferent levels, and by some States more than by others.\nThere is not very much the United Nations can do to\ninfluence Member States to make use of their power, and\nthe power of the United Nations itself is rather limited.\nBut what the United Nations was given a lot of 51 years\nago, was authority: moral authority as well as legal\nauthority, the kind of authority that comes with speaking\non behalf of the world community, with voicing the\npublic conscience and transcending vested interests.\nIndeed, if this Organization is to approach the future from\na position of strength and of confidence, and if we expect\nthe nations of the world to rally behind the flag of the\nUnited Nations, its authority needs to be intact. In fact, it\nneeds to be growing.\nWell, is it growing? Here a sobering note is due. At\nthis critical juncture in its history, the United Nations is\nseeing its authority, the one commodity it can never have\ntoo much of, compromised and weakened; this is also the\none commodity it cannot afford to have too little of. I\nwould wish to highlight some of the manifestations of\nhow the authority of the United Nations is on the wane\nand offer some prospects for shoring it up again.\nFirst, multilateralism, as such, is under pressure.\nMany States no longer regard multilateral cooperation as\na separate goal of their foreign policy, but instead as one\nof many policy instruments which they can choose to\napply or not to apply in accordance with their national\ninterests. Alterative sources of international leadership\nhave sprung up, and ad hoc coalitions are formed as the\nneed arises. The United Nations is regarded more and\nmore as a vehicle for safeguarding a nation\u2019s particular\ninterests, even in the short term, rather than as the\npreferred avenue for solving pressing world-wide\nproblems. This shopping-mall attitude towards the United\nNations is in stark contrast with the lofty principles the\nfounding fathers signed their names to.\n16\n\n\nGradual loss of authority is also caused by\ndisappointment and frustration. The United Nations was\nonce established as an ideal form of international\ncooperation. Particularly after the end of the cold war,\nexpectations rose as never before. For decades, the world\nhad been dominated and the United Nations paralysed by\ntwo power blocs at loggerheads. The United Nations could\nnow finally begin to play the role originally laid out for it.\nUnfortunately, this did not happen. Success stories\nsuch as the United Nations involvement in Namibia, in El\nSalvador and Mozambique were overshadowed by\ndisappointment over the outcome of Missions Impossible\nsuch as Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia. That the Member\nStates themselves had decided to send the United Nations\non those missions could not stem the erosion of authority\nthat came with them.\nFrustration has mounted over effectiveness and\nefficiency, two qualities that have eluded the United\nNations for a long time. It would be facile to blame the\nlack of them on the Secretariat alone. The grinding manner\nin which the intergovernmental machinery of this\nOrganization works is a major factor as well.\nCriticism abounds. The track record of the United\nNations is in many ways impressive, to be sure, and even\nmore so when we look at the broad spectrum of the entire\nUnited Nations system. Its achievements in the fields of\ninternational law, human rights, development, the\npopulation crisis, health care, the position of women, labour\nconditions and disarmament are just random examples. In\nreality, the list is long. Yet somehow United Nations-\nbashing has become the craze these days and even a tool of\ncampaign rhetoric, or else it serves to distract attention\nfrom internal problems. Nevertheless, the United Nations\nmoral authority is sapped by the real and the imagined and\nby criticism justified or unjustified.\nThen there is the financial situation. From the early\ndays, payment or non-payment of contributions has been\nindicative of the United Nations approval rating. The level\nof arrears we are now facing is, however, without\nprecedent. Sadly, it is in large part a reflection of declining\nconfidence and belief in the Organization\u2019s potential. The\npresent financial turmoil is not primarily the cause of the\nUnited Nations predicament, but rather a consequence of it,\na symptom. Of course, empty coffers will lead to less\noutput eventually. Less output would undermine authority\neven further. Less authority in turn leads to fewer\npayments, which again would exacerbate the financial\ncrisis. And so we may see the United Nations caught in a\ndownward spiral. The current payment habits of some\nMember States amount to a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nWorse, they betray the very principles on which the\nUnited Nations was founded. The absence of full, prompt\nand unconditional payments will further erode the United\nNations authority, the same authority those very States\nhelped to bestow on the Organization 50 years ago.\nIf there is one policy area in which the United\nNations has lost much of its authority and stands to loose\neven more, it is peace and security. Take Burundi. Today,\nthe humanitarian and political situation there is alarming.\nWe are witnessing a creeping genocide. Terror prevails.\nIn the past few months alone, thousands of innocent men,\nwomen and children have lost their lives. An explosion of\ngenocide is still a real threat. We cannot allow the\noccurrence of another disaster such as that which took\nplace in Rwanda in 1994. In that year, we claimed that\nwe could hardly have seen it coming. In the case of\nBurundi, there will be no such excuse. The writing is\nclearly on the wall. If we fail once again and a second\ngenocide does take place, the United Nations will suffer\nits most dramatic loss of authority ever.\nWhat can we do to enhance the effectiveness of the\nUnited Nations and hence to help it regain the authority\nit needs in order to fulfil its mandate? How can we\nreverse the downward spiral?\nIf the United Nations is to be effective, the various\ninstruments at the disposal of the international community\nhave to be used in an integrated manner. This holds true\nparticularly in the area of peace and security. In this area,\npolitical, military, socio-economic, electoral and\nhumanitarian assistance, as well as reconstruction and\ndevelopment, will have to be applied in harmony. Hence,\nan integrated approach is the only way effectively to\nprevent and combat conflicts. The United Nations needs\nto be on the ground when it matters and where it matters.\nThis is the lesson that can be drawn from recent crises in\nAfrica \u2014 such as in Rwanda and Somalia \u2014 where the\ninternational response to tragic violence became\nineffective through lack of coherence.\nPreventive diplomacy, on the one hand, and post-\nconflict peace-building, on the other, require increased\nattention. More than ever, the United Nations should\nfocus on the prevention of conflicts and, when conflicts\ndo occur nevertheless, on defusing them at an early stage.\nWhen I addressed this Assembly two years ago, I\ndrew attention to the United Nations capability, or rather\n17\n\n\nthe lack of it, to respond adequately and in a timely manner\nto acute situations of conflict. Some progress has been\nmade since then \u2014 progress in the form of modest\nintermediate steps that would in the longer run lead to a\nUnited Nations better equipped to maintain peace and\nsecurity. Today, there is a growing number of countries that\ntake part in the United Nations standby-arrangements\nsystem and in the efforts of a group of nations to establish\na United Nations high-readiness brigade under this system.\nThe transparency of the Security Council\u2019s decision-making\nconcerning peace-operations has improved. A rapidly\ndeployable headquarters will soon be added to the United\nNations peace-keeping capacity.\nThe future of conflict prevention is linked to the\nUnited Nations power to combat yet another threat to its\nauthority: impunity. Does the world community actually\nhave sufficient means to bring to justice those guilty of war\ncrimes or crimes against humanity? As the cases of Burundi\nand Liberia sadly illustrate, the prospect of impunity\nprovides an open invitation to commit crimes without fear\nof retribution and stands in the way of future reconciliation\nand reconstruction. The Tribunals on the former Yugoslavia\nand on Rwanda represent the single most important\nendeavour of the international community since Nuremberg\nto adjudicate war crimes and crimes against humanity. We\ncannot let it fail. Yet the Yugoslavia Tribunal will face a\nserious problem so long as it cannot gain custody of more\nof the many people it has indicted. Soon, the present\ncircumstances will erode its authority and, indeed, that of\nthe United Nations as a whole.\nMy country feels that the establishment of ad hoc\nTribunals once again underlines the need for the speedy\ncreation of a permanent international criminal court. Once\nthis Court has been established, it will become even more\nimperative that those accused of such crimes actually be\nbrought to trial. The United Nations should enhance its\ncapacity to ensure the apprehension, extradition and trial of\nthose so accused.\nIf there is one area of the United Nations where moral\nand legal authority play crucial roles, it is that of human\nrights. Here, the record of the Organization is impressive,\nbut still more can and should be done and new challenges\nlie in store.\nIncreased attention for human rights will increase the\nmoral authority of the United Nations. In this regard, its\nauthority should rest firmly on the Universal Declaration,\nadopted by this Organization in 1948\n\u201cas a common standard of achievement for all\npeoples and all nations\u201d (resolution 217 A (III),\neighth preambular para.) \u2014\nin other words, a universal framework. Forty-five years\nlater, in Vienna, the universality of human rights was\nonce again expounded by the United Nations membership\nas we know it today.\nYet, universality of human rights is under pressure.\nEver since Vienna, the discussion of what is called\ncultural particularities seems to have chipped away at it.\nSome Governments claim that their nation\u2019s human-rights\nperformance cannot be held up to the same standards as\nother nations\u2019 due to differences in their historical,\ncultural and religious backgrounds.\nLet us make no mistake. There are differences in the\nway people look at human rights in the various regions of\nthe world and the ongoing dialogue in the United Nations\nwould be ill-served if we chose to deny that there were\nany differences at all. True, religious and ethical values,\ncultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions should\nbe borne in mind at all times and, by themselves, are\neven protected by the Universal Declaration. But their\nlink to human rights as such and to the concept of\nuniversality is a very particular one. The international\ncommunity has expressed it nowhere more accurately than\nin the Platform for Action adopted in Beijing one year\nago. As we agreed in Beijing, rather than detracting from\nthe ambit of universality, cultural differences should\ncontribute to the full enjoyment of human rights. The\nStates Members of this Organization agreed in Vienna\nthat, regardless of their political, economic and cultural\nsystems, it is their duty to promote and protect all human\nrights and fundamental freedoms.\nIncreased emphasis calls for more financial\nresources. A larger part of the United Nations budget\nshould be devoted to human rights. This, in turn, will\nenhance the moral authority of the Organization in the\neyes of the multitudes who are still deprived of their\nhuman rights today. Letting the programme wither away\nwill produce the opposite effect.\nThe General Assembly, being the only plenary organ\nof the United Nations, is the most conspicuous.\nCredibility and authority are very much tied to the\nAssembly\u2019s performance. Sadly, this body sees many of\n18\n\n\nits resolutions ignored. We should vigorously seek to infuse\nnew vitality into the Assembly\u2019s proceedings and in the\nrelevance of its achievements.\nTwo weeks ago, the Assembly effectively lived up to\nits responsibility by adopting the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty by an overwhelming majority. The\nadoption of the Treaty by this world body lends authority\nto the new norm outlawing nuclear testing. My country\nfeels privileged that it was called upon to preside over the\nnegotiations. Adoption of the Treaty contributes to the\nultimate elimination of all nuclear weapons, a goal to which\nmy country remains fully committed. We aim for a\npropitious entry into force. But even in the absence of entry\ninto force, the authority of the United Nations will make it\nmore difficult for any State to act against the Treaty.\nIncreased attention should be given to those activities\nof the United Nations which are not of a strictly political\nnature or concerned with security, namely, the socio-\neconomic aspects and the strengthening of those parts of\nthe United Nations system dealing with such matters as\npoverty, population, food security, urbanization, equality of\nwomen and the environment. These areas are crucial for the\nfuture of the world and for the quality of life on this planet.\nThese are also areas where the Organization is especially\nqualified to identify and debate the problems and where it\nhas set up an impressive array of operational activities. A\nseries of world conferences in recent years has helped to\nupgrade the authority of the United Nations system. They\nhave set an agenda for the United Nations and the Member\nStates to follow during the coming decades. The World\nFood Summit in November should do the same. The\nSummit faces the awesome problem of a world that may\nhave to feed 10 billion people by the time the United\nNations is 100 years old.\nThere is, of course, a risk that expectations have been\nraised too high once more and that disappointment will lead\nonce more to loss of authority. The United Nations and its\nMember States have to make sure this does not happen.\nThe United Nations will play a major role in the fields of\nadvocacy, coordination and monitoring. Although the\nUnited Nations itself contributes to implementation through\nits field operations, the Member States bear the primary\nresponsibility for full implementation at the national level.\nTogether, they can succeed in ensuring that the world\ncommunity reaches the goals it has set for itself.\nThe authority of the United Nations is at stake. It will\nnot disappear in a clap of thunder. It will die with a\nwhimper. It stands to fade away gradually, without at any\ntime making alarm bells ring, and with it, the\nOrganization may well slide into the margins of the world\nscene. The United Nations needs a new sense of direction\nand purpose to become, once again, a beacon for mankind\nas intended by the authors of the Charter. That requires a\nsustained effort of all Members of this Organization.\nThere is little time left. Let us use it well.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like to extend\nwarm congratulations to Mr. Razali on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly. As a close neighbour\nof Malaysia, Australia will confidently rely on his\nexperience and sound judgement as he presides over this\nimportant session of the Assembly.\nI feel greatly honoured to be leading for the first\ntime the Australian delegation to a session of the General\nAssembly.\nA year ago, when the Assembly adopted the\nDeclaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary\nof the United Nations, it made an important promise: to\ngive to the twenty-first century a United Nations that\nwould serve effectively the peoples in whose name it was\nestablished. We must keep that promise, but to do so we\n8\n\n\nwill need a clear view of contemporary circumstances and\nof those which we can see unfolding into the twenty-first\ncentury.\nThe landscape that was revealed at the end of the cold\nwar, just a little over five years ago, has many new\nfeatures, some of which are still not clear. What is clear,\nhowever, is that we face new challenges and that we have\nnew opportunities that few of us would have imagined five\nyears ago.\nThe most compelling of these opportunities is to take\nfuture steps in nuclear-arms control and disarmament. The\npossibility of taking such steps is surely a principal\noutcome of the end of the cold war. This was firmly\nunderlined last Tuesday when, in a single day, 67 countries\nsigned the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. That\nnumber, only a week later, is now nearly 100. But beyond\nthis achievement lies another major opportunity, which is\nto turn our national and international attention to enhancing\nhuman security in all its aspects.\nOur dynamic times have presented us with new\nproblems. Such problems include the major non-military\nthreats to security: the clandestine arms trade, the narcotics\ntrade, HIV/AIDS, the need to stabilize the rate of growth of\nthe world\u2019s population and major threats to the\nenvironment.\nThe elemental characteristics of such non-military\nthreats to security are that they cannot be defeated by\nweapons. They cross state boundaries and they can affect\nwhole populations. These characteristics lead to one central\nconclusion, that is, action on these problems must be the\nsubject of international cooperation.\nMultilateral cooperation can, does and must take many\nforms. But the role of the United Nations is unique because\nof its universality and because of the rules we find in the\nCharter of the United Nations.\nIt is for these reasons \u2014 the nature of the\nopportunities we have before us, the problems we face and\nthe unique role and capability of the United Nations \u2014 that\nwe must keep last year\u2019s promise of a United Nations fit\nfor the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nAustralia\u2019s particular commitment to the United\nNations is founded on the belief, articulated as far back as\nthe 1950s by the then Foreign Minister, Richard Casey, that\nthe United Nations represents the practical effort of the\nGovernments and peoples of the world to attain the high\ngoals to which they are pledged through the United\nNations Charter: international peace and security and the\neconomic and social advancement of all peoples.\nAustralia has contributed readily to achieving those\ngoals. Whether by paying its financial contributions in full\nand on time, by providing personnel to peacekeeping\noperations or through its contributions to development\nprogrammes, Australia has been determined to see the\nUnited Nations succeed. I commit Australia today to\ncontinuing such involvement in the work of the United\nNations.\nAt present, a window of opportunity in arms control\nand disarmament is open to us. If we do not take it soon,\nit will close. Large and sophisticated nuclear and\nconventional arsenals continue to exist. In a number of\nregions, suspicions remain close to the surface. The risks\nof the spread of weapons of mass destruction have, in\ncertain respects, increased.\nIn Australia\u2019s view, two tasks are fundamental: first,\nbuilding and strengthening international institutions and\ninstruments; and secondly, developing new thinking in\narms control and disarmament so as to push the\ninternational agenda forward in constructive and realistic\nways.\nTo achieve progress with institutions and\ninstruments, Members of the United Nations need to work\ntogether on at least six priorities. These priorities for\ninternational cooperation are to make the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its enhanced\nreview process operate more effectively; to strengthen the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency safeguards; to\nachieve an early start for the Organization for the\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons; to reach early\nagreement on effective verification machinery for the\nBiological Weapons Convention; to pursue the goal of a\nglobal ban on anti-personnel landmines in conjunction\nwith a global approach to the problem of demining; and\nto achieve a ban on the production of fissile materials for\nnuclear weapons.\nAs we pursue these priorities in the multilateral\nsystem, we should keep firmly in mind that progress in\nregional security, particularly in regions of weapons-\nproliferation concern, will make a crucial contribution.\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is of\ncourse the immediate priority. Its adoption by the General\nAssembly and its opening for signature on 24 September\n9\n\n\nwere major milestones for the international community. The\nTreaty is a product of our times. It flows from a long and\ncommonly held global concern. Its death was something the\ninternational community simply could not allow.\nAustralia was therefore prepared to take the lead in\nbringing the Treaty to the General Assembly. The\noverwhelming support for the resolution demonstrated the\nstrength of international feeling against nuclear testing. This\nTreaty was wanted and needed, but it has also helped\nchange the international climate. We can now reasonably\nhope and expect that nuclear testing will not be part of the\nfuture to be faced by succeeding generations. In a world\nwith a mixed history on controlling the development and\nspread of destructive weaponry, that is something of which\nwe can all be proud.\nThe Treaty must become universal. We urge all those\ncountries that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the\nTreaty as soon as possible so that it can be fully\nimplemented as quickly as possible. There is no merit in\nthe argument that says that, because there is more to be\ndone in nuclear-arms control and disarmament, we should\nin some way scorn or reject a Treaty that bans all nuclear\nexplosions forever. This ban has intrinsic value. We must\nnow keep up the positive momentum generated by the\nadoption of the Treaty.\nThis brings me to the second task: developing new\nideas. Because building institutions and strengthening\ninternational instruments will not be enough, the\ninternational community must also develop imaginative new\nways of guiding the world into the next century.\nThe Australian Government established the Canberra\nCommission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons to\naddress the questions of whether a nuclear-weapon-free\nworld is feasible and, if so, the measures which could be\ntaken to attain that objective. I am delighted to confirm that\nthe Commission has more than met Australia\u2019s\nexpectations. Its report will make a major contribution to\ninternational thinking and discussion on nuclear\ndisarmament. The Australian Government will take it\nforward by circulating it today in this Hall, will present it\nto the Secretary-General tomorrow and introduce it to the\nConference on Disarmament in January.\nThe Canberra Commission report recommends a\npolitical commitment by the nuclear-weapon States to the\nelimination of nuclear weapons. That is the first and central\nrequirement. The report then sets out six immediate steps:\ntaking nuclear forces off alert; removal of warheads from\ndelivery vehicles; ending the deployment of non-strategic\nnuclear weapons; ending nuclear testing; initiating\nnegotiations further to reduce United States and Russian\nnuclear arsenals; and an agreement among the nuclear-\nweapon States on reciprocal no-first-use undertakings and\nof a non-use undertaking by them in relation to the\nnon-nuclear-weapon States.\nThe Commission also recommends three reinforcing\nsteps: action to prevent further horizontal proliferation;\ndeveloping verification arrangements for a nuclear-\nweapon-free world; and the cessation of the production of\nfissile material for nuclear-explosive purposes. The\nCommission placed particular emphasis on the importance\nof effective verification in the achievement and\nmaintenance of a nuclear-weapons-free world.\nHaving at last, after 33 years, met the challenge of\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the\ninternational community must now push on with further\npractical and realistic measures on nuclear-arms control\nand disarmament.\nAs already indicated, one such measure is the\nnegotiation of a convention under which it would be\nagreed that there will be no further manufacturing of\nweapons-grade fissile material. This convention should be\nsought now.\nAny discussion of arms control and disarmament in\ntoday\u2019s world that failed to address the question of\nlandmines would be sadly incomplete. These hideous and\ndiabolically inexpensive weapons must be banned.\nAustralia will support efforts that will be made at this\nsession of the Assembly to take the next step towards the\nnegotiation of an international convention to that effect.\nBut in the meantime, there are in excess of 100\nmillion of these maiming weapons distributed in the soil\nof too many countries. Demining must proceed at a far\nfaster rate than has been the case in the past. There have\nbeen technological barriers to increasing that rate and\nAustralia has therefore proposed that a technology\nworking group be established among interested and\ncapable countries with the purpose of designing the\nequipment required for demining on a far larger and\nquicker scale.\nIf there is any doubt about the need for this action,\nI would place on record here that, if the current rate of\ndemining in Cambodia were to be maintained, that\ncountry, which has struggled so hard to repair itself,\n10\n\n\nwould not be free of these mines for a further 130 years.\nThis must be unacceptable to all. That is why the\nAustralian Government recently committed $12 million to\npractical demining initiatives in the war-ravaged fields\nwithin our own region.\nSecurity Council reform is another vitally important\nitem on the peace-and-security agenda. The three key issues\nto be tackled are expansion, transparency and the\neffectiveness of sanctions regimes.\nThere is now a general acceptance that the Security\nCouncil must be expanded and modernized if it is to\nmanage international peace and security more effectively.\nAlthough Australia wants to avoid making the Council too\nunwieldy, there can be little doubt that its membership\nneeds to reflect better current geopolitical and economic\ncircumstances. Expanding the membership is an important\nelement in achieving this and Australia believes that an\nexpansion up to a total Council membership of 25 States\nwould be reasonable.\nThis brings me to the more contentious point of\npermanent as against non-permanent membership. Australia\nhas made clear that it supports the claims of Japan and\nGermany to permanent membership. This is the very least\nthe United Nations can do to acknowledge their major-\nPower status and the financial contribution they are making\nto the Organization.\nAustralia also advocates permanent seats on the\nCouncil for underrepresented regions. As to how that is to\nbe achieved, we remain flexible. Whether those seats are\nfilled by a single member or rotate among leading Member\nStates agreed on by regional groupings needs to be\ndiscussed further, primarily by those regions concerned. We\nalso see scope for an increase in the number of\nnon-permanent members of the Council, again in the\ninterests of ensuring greater balance in representation.\nI turn now to the need for greater transparency in\nSecurity Council processes. Consultative mechanisms have\nimproved in recent times, notably between the Secretariat\nand troop-contributing countries, but more needs to be\ndone. Australia is committed to trying to improve the way\nin which the Security Council interacts with non-members\nso that the Council\u2019s activities become more responsive to\nthe United Nations as a whole.\nMore needs to be done, too, to build the Council\u2019s\nrelationship with regional organizations. Good progress has\nbeen recorded to date, but United Nations and regional\norganizations should meet regularly in order to develop\nfurther the appropriate division of responsibilities.\nThe Council also has an important role to play in\npreventing the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction and enhancing the effectiveness of the\nnon-proliferation regime.\nAustralia wants to see improvements in the\neffectiveness of United Nations sanctions because we\nrecognize that the Security Council\u2019s use of collective\nsanctions continues to be an important and, at times,\ncontentious enforcement measure. The effectiveness of\nsanctions regimes could be improved in three ways:\nclearer drafting of Security Council resolutions; providing\nspecific objectives and realistic time-frames; and through\nrelevant sanctions committees providing clear\ninterpretative guidance on implementation. These are\nchanges that are essential for the Security Council\u2019s\ndynamism. We need to press ahead with them to ensure\nthat the Council reflects modern-day circumstances and\nrealities.\nOur contemporary circumstances have opened up\nnew needs and prospects for peacekeeping and preventive\ndiplomacy. Initial post-cold-war hopes about the\ncapabilities of the Security Council have been tempered.\nIt has become clear that many conflicts are intractable.\nExperience has taught us that it is difficult to reach\nagreement on suitable approaches and to find enough\nresources, particularly in the area of peacekeeping.\nThe Security Council must be realistic in the\nimplementation of its Charter responsibilities. It must\nresist pressure to embark on missions before it has\ncompleted adequate preparations, developed a focused\nsense of the mission\u2019s goals and agreed on a clearly\narticulated mandate.\nAt this very moment, the United Nations is\nconfronted with major challenges in such diverse\nsituations as those in Cyprus, Burundi and Liberia.\nAustralia has been contributing personnel to the United\nNations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, for example, for\nover 20 years and has been saddened by the recent\nincidents of violence there. The time has come to resolve\nthat situation, which requires the assistance of all parties.\nOne very important area of reform for United\nNations peacekeeping is to establish an enhanced rapid-\nreaction capability. There have been many proposals on\nthis issue, but the Australian Government believes that the\n11\n\n\nCanadian study, Towards a Rapid Reaction Capability for\nthe United Nations, contains some commendable\nrecommendations, including the development of a\ndeployable, operational-level headquarters to strengthen\nplanning for operations.\nAustralia welcomes recent moves by the Department\nof Peacekeeping Operations to begin implementing\nmeasures aimed at improving United Nations rapid-reaction\ncapability, but in taking these measures forward, the United\nNations should consult adequately with all Member States.\nAustralia is also keen to see the United Nations\ndevelop the preventive-diplomacy agenda and it welcomes\nthe greater resources the Secretariat now devotes to such\nactivity. The Security Council, the General Assembly and\nthe good offices of the Secretary-General, as well as\nregional arrangements and agencies, have important roles to\nplay in preventive diplomacy. Australia supports greater use\nof Chapter VI of the Charter on the pacific settlement of\ndisputes. Article 33 is particularly important. The Security\nCouncil can use it to undertake a leadership role by calling\non disputing parties to seek a solution using negotiation,\nmediation and other peaceful means.\nAs I indicated at the beginning of this statement, one\nof the chief results of the end of the cold war must surely\nbe an increase in our ability to turn away from military\nconcerns and to give a greater degree of attention to threats\nto the security of individuals, as distinct from those threats\nto the security of States that have dominated our thinking\nin the past, important and basic though they have been and\nremain.\nIn today\u2019s world and in the world we see unfolding\ninto the twenty-first century, the security of far too many\npeople is threatened in ways no less immediate than the\nthreat of the gun. I have in mind narcotics, HIV/AIDS and\nmajor threats to the environment. These threats cannot be\ndealt with effectively by States acting alone. Sometimes\nthey require new international law, but more specifically\nthey require political will to defeat them and to foster\ncooperation among nations to ensure maximum\neffectiveness of action.\nThe United Nations is the ideal environment in which\nto develop such cooperation. It is here that the world is\nrepresented. We have here a tradition of debate, of\ndiscussion, of identification of problems and of consensus.\nWe have the ability to make law when it is necessary.\nAbove all, we have pledged ourselves to defending and\nproviding a decent standard of living to the peoples we\nrepresent.\nThere is also a regional role and, in that context,\nAustralia was pleased to have promoted the concept of a\nregional HIV/AIDS ministers\u2019 meeting at the Post-\nMinisterial Conference of this year\u2019s session of the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations.\nAs we move towards the twenty-first century, it will\nbe crucial to the execution of that responsibility to ensure\nthat we have a healthy United Nations that is devoted to\ninternational cooperation aimed at defeating the major\nnon-military threats to the security of the human family.\nThese threats are tragically evident to us today. They will\nonly become larger if we do not agree, now, to begin\ncooperative action to defeat them. History will surely\njudge our generation harshly if, having identified the\nproblems of human security, we fail for lack of will to\naddress their solutions.\nAnother great requirement of our times is the\neconomic needs of people and the promotion of\ndevelopment. Much has been done through the United\nNations and its agencies to advance the development\ncause. They have been pivotal to the emergence of a\nmultilateral approach in which institutions with special\ncompetencies such as the specialized agencies, the\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank,\ntogether with policy deliberative bodies such as the\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social Council,\nhave complementary roles to play.\nDevelopment is about more than just economic\ngrowth, however. There is also the need for internal\nstability, sound environmental management, a vigorous\ncivil society and a lively democracy. The United Nations\nis uniquely placed to build consensus on how to advance\nthese various elements of the development agenda.\nIn this context, Australia welcomes the constructive\noutcomes achieved at the ninth session of the United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD) held in Midrand, South Africa, earlier this\nyear. The decisions taken there should help developing\ncountries benefit from the opportunities of economic\nglobalization.\nWe also underline the importance of encouraging\ninvestment and technology transfers and providing trade\nopportunities to stimulate economic development. Such\n1\n\n\ndevelopment is the only enduring foundation for\nindependence and economic and social well-being.\nIt is in Africa that these development challenges are\nmost stark. Rich in promise yet wearied by emergencies,\nAfrica stands today at a decisive juncture in its history.\nAfrican leaders seized the moment with the\nOrganization of African Unity\u2019s 1995 Cairo Agenda for\nAction, in which they called for immediate action to\nimplement the development strategies for which an\ninternational consensus now exists. The United Nations\nresponded this year with the launch of a 10-year,\n$25 billion United Nations System-wide Special Initiative\nfor Africa.\nThe Australian Government welcomes the Special\nInitiative as a concrete demonstration of the international\ncommunity\u2019s concern with Africa. The international\ncommunity cannot allow disease, poverty, war and\nunderdevelopment to become entrenched in the 53\nnations \u2014 almost one-third of United Nations Member\nStates \u2014 that make up the African continent.\nThe world must continue to seek ways to break the\npoverty cycle in Africa so that its potential for economic\ndevelopment is realized. Sustainable economic development\nis essential to overcome poverty, disease and conflict.\nThe United Nations system needs to give greater focus\nand impetus to the development effort in Africa.\nI now turn to the issue of human rights. Human rights\nare important in international relations for two main\nreasons: first, political instability and major conflict can\nresult where human rights are breached or are under threat;\nand secondly, the freedom and dignity of individuals is, in\nitself, of fundamental value to the world community.\nThe Australian Government aims for practical\noutcomes that will improve the lives of individual men,\nwomen and children. We recognize the importance of\ndialogue and cooperation, based on mutual respect. In\naddition to public and private diplomacy, Australia\u2019s\napproach to the improvement of human rights also\nencompasses development cooperation.\nAustralia strongly supports the development of strong\nand independent national human rights institutions. For\nexample, Australia provided financial support for a\nworkshop of Asia-Pacific national human rights institutions,\nwhich agreed to establish an informal forum to work for the\nstrengthening and further development of such institutions\nin the region. Australia has also provided financial\nsupport to the United Nations for the creation of a\nposition of special adviser to the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights on national human\nrights institutions.\nFinally, it is important to address the issue of reform\nof the United Nations. Much work still needs to be done\nto bring about greater efficiency and effectiveness in the\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies.\nWhile Australia applauds the dedication and hard\nwork of the General Assembly Working Groups that were\nset up in 1995, Member States must not lose sight of the\nfact that to achieve real change, the Groups have to come\nup with realistic and achievable recommendations. Those\nrecommendations must in turn lead to practical and\nmeasurable outcomes.\nIt is important that the work of the groups be\nfocused and that their momentum be restored so that early\nand positive outcomes can be achieved. We must all\ncommit ourselves to this end and to bringing about\nstructured change within the United Nations.\nIt is also crucial that the financial situation of the\nUnited Nations be repaired. Australia believes that all\nMembers should pay their contributions in full and on\ntime. We therefore welcome recent moves by some\ncountries to pay their arrears.\nIt is time to establish a revised scale of assessed\ncontributions that more fairly reflects what Governments\ncan pay. The current minimum payment is too high for\nmany small-economy countries, and Australia would like\nto see it reduced or even removed.\nThese are the reforms that Australia believes are\nnecessary to equip the United Nations for its role in the\ntwenty-first century.\nIt is in this overall context that Australia is deeply\ncommitted to contributing to the United Nations goal of\nmaintaining international peace and security in an active\nway. Serving a term as a non-permanent member of the\nSecurity Council during 1997-1998 would enable\nAustralia to make a substantive contribution to that goal\nand to work for a more effective, modernized and\ntransparent Council. That is why we have asked for the\nsupport of Member States at the elections to be held a\nfew weeks from now.\n13\n\n\nLet me conclude by summing up what I have said\ntoday. The United Nations is unique and needed, but it\nmust pursue, and work on the basis of, a relevant Agenda.\nThis is the central point. The United Nations must be put\nto work on the agenda of the twenty-first century.\nMuch work needs to be done to tackle the key\nchallenges that face the United Nations. Only a sustained,\ncooperative effort among all Member States will bring\nsuccess. Australia will make that effort.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is an honour for me, on behalf of\nParaguay, its people and its Government, to wish the\nPresident of the General Assembly, Ambassador Razali\nIsmail, every success in his endeavours. We wish also to\nemphasize the excellent work accomplished by President\nDiogo Freitas do Amaral, who tirelessly led the proceedings\nof the past session.\nFor Paraguay, the United Nations is a form that has\nguaranteed the free debate of ideas and the participation of\nall without discrimination or exclusion. For a long time, the\nUnited Nations has been the mandatory beacon of our\nnations when their essential rights were threatened. For\nParaguayans, the fundamental rights of men and women,\none of the pillars of the United Nations, are today vital \u2014\nand not just rhetoric \u2014 in the search for world peace,\nfreedom and security, which only democratic civilian\nGovernments can guarantee.\nThe new historical reality we face \u2014 knowing\nimmediately what happens elsewhere in the world and\nwithin or countries \u2014 means that we all must share a\ngreater responsibility and solidarity. The globalization of\ntoday\u2019s world is such that a problem besetting one nation\nis not an isolated matter, but rather one that must be\nconsidered by all.\nThis is why we will have to rethink the age-old\nquestion of what path all men and women should take.\nWhile we belong to diverse ideologies and cultures, we\nmust nevertheless secure equality, rights and freedoms.\nOur contributions and suggestions for strengthening\nthe Organization and adapting it to the new realities of\ntoday\u2019s world therefore are made in the spirit of\ncooperation. This is why we request that the reforms to\nbe adopted in the framework of the United Nations be\naimed at reducing its fragmentation in order to make it a\nmore functionally integrated structure. Such reform will\nmake possible more fluid communication and much more\nefficient coordination. This is why we insist on reform to\neliminate unnecessary costs through the consolidation of\nthe programmes aimed at the harmonious development of\nour peoples, and to rationalize and optimize existing\nresources in order to avoid the duplication of human or\neconomic efforts.\nThe Government of Paraguay, aware of its\ninternational commitments, has made enormous efforts to\nfulfil its financial obligations to the United Nations. In\nthis regard, we send out an appeal for payments of\nassessed contributions to be made within established\ndeadlines in order to ensure the operation of the\nOrganization. The principle of equity so requires this.\nWe must also state that Paraguay\u2019s position on the\nreform of the United Nations is clear with respect to the\nGeneral Assembly. We consider this body not only a\nmodel of democratic decision-making, but also \u2014 given\nits high degree of universality and free exchange of\nideas \u2014 the most important organ of the system. We\nsupport the expansion of the Security Council, which\nrequires a larger number of permanent and non-permanent\nmembers on the basis of equitable geographic distribution.\nIn this connection, we support the view that Latin\nAmerica should be represented among the permanent\nmembers, in addition to countries such as Germany and\nJapan. Paraguay maintains that the exercise of the veto\nshould evolve towards innovative mechanisms that would\nbe used more objectively.\nProgrammes that make sustainable economic\ndevelopment possible constitute another aspect the system\nmust take into account. Our country is promoting a social\n13\n\n\nmarket economy, free and respectful of private initiative,\nbut without disregarding the share of responsibility borne\nby the Government. We therefore view with satisfaction the\nleading role of the United Nations in the field of sustainable\nhuman development. In this connection, we wish to\nunderscore the binding conventions on the environment, the\ncommitment made by 118 Heads of State and Government\nto put an end to poverty, unemployment and social\nmarginalization, the important results achieved at Habitat II\nand the Midrand Declaration of the ninth session of the\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\nWe particularly endorse paragraph 17 of that\nDeclaration, which states that\n\u201cThe lack of territorial access to the sea,\naggravated by remoteness and isolation from world\nmarkets, imposes serious constraints on the overall\nsocio-economic development efforts of the land-locked\ndeveloping countries.\u201d (TD/377, para. 17)\nAs such, those countries require sufficient international\ncooperation to maintain and improve their transportation\nand commercial-exchange infrastructure.\nHaving signed the aforementioned conventions and\nhaving participated in the aforementioned conference, the\nParaguayan national Government adopted concrete measures\nto implement the provisions of the plans of action that\nemerged from those meetings. Thus, following the mandate\nof the World Summit for Social Development, a secretariat\nfor social action was established at the ministerial level,\nreporting to the presidency of the Republic. Its fundamental\npurpose will be to prepare public policy on social projects\nand to coordinate the actions of the Government and civil\nsociety in order to improve our people's standard of living.\nWe have also prepared a strategic plan to improve\neducation, in conjunction with the educational reform\ncurrently being implemented by the national Government.\nWe have also devised a map of basic needs \u2014 which is\nalso known as poverty mapping. We have carried out a\nhousehold survey covering not only urban, but also rural\nareas. We are at the moment preparing a system of social\nindicators and social expenditures.\nFurthermore, a year after the holding of the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women, the public and private\nsectors at large have been made keenly aware of its\nPlatform for Action, thus fortifying policies relating to\ngender.\nI wish to express my Government's deep gratitude to\nthe United Nations system, and particularly to its\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has\nconstantly and tirelessly helped us work towards the well-\nbeing of the people of Paraguay.\nWe are aware that our age is marked by unusual\ncharacteristics. Contemporary history defines us\ndifferently. Concepts have changed. Today we speak more\npositively and effectively about integration, cooperation\nand complementarity. The time of sterile confrontation is\nbehind us. This is a time of solidarity and of reciprocal\nand diverse cooperation; constructive and creative\ninterdependence is the key to our daily coexistence.\nToday's world needs not only a new economic order,\nbut also a new international cultural order. Science,\nknowledge and technology must be our universal heritage.\nAn awareness of solidarity is the way for which human\nbeings to understand themselves and others. We should\nsee that without this understanding of others we are\ninsufficient, incomplete and lacking in humanity. Genuine\ncomprehensive development requires the cooperation of\nall the men and women who inhabit this world. Only in\nthat way will development as a human right, with the\nblessing of the Organization and with our strong support,\nfind its full meaning and its place in history. Either we\nremedy our circumstances or we sink in them.\nHowever, the disappearance of the rivalries of a\nbipolar world has, unfortunately, not meant the end of\nconflict. Throughout this year, we have seen ethnic and\nnationalistic confrontations that have given rise to\noverwhelming human crises that have cut down innocent\nlives, destroyed property and \u2014 still more seriously \u2014\nbrought about the loss of the value of coexistence. In this\nstate of affairs, Paraguay hopes that the military\nconfrontations that spill the blood of nations and violate\nthe right to live will very soon come to an end. We\nencourage the consolidation of the peace process in the\nformer Yugoslavia and the resumption of the peace\nprocess in the Middle East in order to find a just and\nlasting solution in that region.\nOur country also hopes that efforts will continue\ntowards the resolution of conflicts in Rwanda and\nBurundi in order to bring about peace and stability in the\nGreat Lakes region. Paraguay views with satisfaction the\nachievements made in Angola, and we hope that the\nOrganization of African Unity will continue to play an\nimportant role in the prevention and settlement of\nconflicts in Africa.\n14\n\n\nParaguay notes with great satisfaction the results\nachieved by the United Nations through its peace-keeping\nMissions in Haiti, its observers in Nicaragua and\nEl Salvador and its verification Mission in Guatemala,\nwhich has achieved major success recently. Paraguay is in\nfavour of continuing increasingly to promote the\nmechanisms of preventive diplomacy and, above all, of\npeace-keeping. Similarly, the Republic of Paraguay\nwelcomes the spirit of reconciliation manifested by the\nGovernment of the Republic of China. We hope that a\ndialogue will be established to resolve the situation with the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China.\nNow more than ever before, stability and peace are the\nchallenge. It is imperative to build a multipolar world to\nguarantee the equitable development of nations and peoples.\nEquity should be the cornerstone of universal harmony. In\nthis spirit, we trust that our Organization\u2019s actions for\ndisarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons will\nprove effective and will strengthen our battle against all\nthreats to peace and world security. Faithful to this purpose,\nParaguay co-sponsored the resolution on the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which was adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly last 10 September. We encourage all\nMember States of this great Organization to sign the Treaty,\nas I did a few days ago as Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nParaguay. We urge that the Treaty be promptly ratified so\nthat it may enter into force.\nAlmost 50 years ago, on 10 December 1948, the\nGeneral Assembly adopted and proclaimed the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Thus did mankind achieve\none of its most precious goals: a Declaration of rights for\nwhich peoples and nations, individuals and societies, had\nalways fought. In Paraguay today, we firmly believe that\nwe have learned the hard lesson of living in peace,\ndemocracy and pluralism. The era of oppression and of a\nlack of basic freedoms, economic backwardness and\ncultural isolation is past. It is part of a sad history that we\nwill remember only so as not to repeat it. The democracy\nwe are building today, with the active participation of our\ncitizens and the solidarity of the international community,\nis part of an irreversible process.\nOf course, barely four months ago, a small group,\nnostalgic for authoritarianism, tried to turn back the clock.\nBut thanks to the prompt support of friendly nations and to\nthe spontaneous and courageous action of young people\nwho took to the streets to defend the democratic process,\nwe were able to abort a military adventure that could have\ncaused irreparable damage to our country. Fortunately, our\ncountry is today moving straight towards a strengthening of\nall its freedoms and towards democratic stability in its\npolitical system.\nWe are greatly pleased that Paraguay was able to\novercome its institutional crisis with the weapons of\ndemocracy. The threat of force against our institutions\nwas combated with our democratic beliefs. The\nGovernment averted the danger without resorting to any\nmeasures in violation of the Constitution or our laws.\nEven at the most difficult times, we maintained freedom\nof the press. No citizen was imprisoned and no\nemergency laws were decreed. Our victory was based on\nour belief in political pluralism and the right of dissent.\nThus, the calm and decisive action of the President of the\nRepublic of Paraguay, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, restored the\nautonomy of civilian rule. We stopped being a democracy\nunder the protection of military power and became a\ncivilian democracy, free from interference or pressure\nfrom outside forces.\nHaving made this historic, political step, the\nGovernment and the people of Paraguay are deeply\ngrateful to the Member States of this Organization for\ntheir support during that delicate crisis. In particular, we\nare grateful to the Security Council for its clear and\nunflinching support of Paraguayan democracy. This\nsupport further strengthened our faith in the United\nNations efforts to maintain democratic political\ninstitutions, freedom, peace and international security.\nParaguay's foreign policy is based primarily on\nregional economic integration, at the centre of which is\nthe Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR). We\nare convinced that the Latin American integration process\nis the key to our country\u2019s integration into the world\neconomy and to the consolidation of our democracy.\nFollowing this policy, we have undertaken many activities\nwith a view to expanding the links between our internal\nmarket and international economic processes.\nAnother important element has been the frontal\nattack on international organized crime. The task is not\neasy. For years political and economic corruption were\nthe modus operandi of the dictatorship. None the less, the\nGovernment of Paraguay is committed to fighting the\nscourge of drug trafficking and money-laundering. We\nencourage the public, national and foreign alike, to report\nirregularities worthy of investigation, inspection or review\nso as to eliminate the sources of corruption. With its new\nattitude of political transparency, the Government has sent\na draft bill to the National Congress which defines and\naims to suppress the crime of money-laundering,\n15\n\n\nincluding the laundering of profits from the illicit sale of\nnarcotics, psychotropic substances and dangerous drugs. A\nnational drug-control plan is also being drawn up.\nFifty years after the establishment of the International\nCourt of Justice in The Hague, my country \u2014 fulfilling the\npromise President Wasmosy made last year to the General\nAssembly \u2014 yesterday deposited with the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations the instruments of acceptance\nof the jurisdiction of the Court. This decision is one further\ncommitment on my country\u2019s part to the universal society\nin which we believe. As Minister for Foreign Affairs of my\nnation, I will always remember having been the vessel of\nthis historic decision. We also reiterate, as a land-locked\ncountry, the importance of the Convention and the reforms\nto the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We express our\nfaith in the principle of the universal heritage of mankind\nthrough our presence as a member of the council of the\nInternational Seabed Authority.\nHere at the beginning of the fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations, as Minister for\nForeign Affairs I would like to take the liberty of making\na declaration of faith. Too young to have known the\nfounding, the first achievements, the main crises, the\nchanges and the development of the institutions of the\nUnited Nations, I belong to a generation destined to play a\nrole in the twenty-first century.\nWhen I was born, the human rights covenants had\nalready been written, the environment was already a\nconcern for all peoples, and the universal diplomatic\nconventions and legal system of treaties were already in\nplace. Such is our world at the end of the century. Thus, in\nsupporting reform, Paraguay believes that it is necessary to\nmention through me that there is one thing that we will not\nbe able to change: our purposes and goals, which we must\npreserve for future generations.\nWe will reaffirm time and time again the equality of\nnations, large and small, and the importance of creating\nconditions for the rule of international law. Here in the\nGeneral Assembly, the soul of the United Nations,\nrepresenting a young nation which has yet enjoyed 200\nyears of independence and speaking before age-old peoples\nand cultures, I reaffirm mankind\u2019s utopia: a common belief\nrenewed that we can affirm this forever to be our home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nGovernment and people of Thailand, I should like to extend\nmy warmest congratulations to Your Excellency upon your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-first session, which marks the beginning of the next\nhalf-century for the United Nations. I am confident that,\nwith your leadership and guidance, this session will mark\na successful beginning for the work of the United Nations\nin the next 50 years and in the new century.\nFrom what we have seen so far, you are already off to\na good start. By insisting on beginning our meetings on\ntime over the past three weeks and not succumbing to the\ntraditional half-hour delay before starting the meetings, you\nhave, in effect, prevented the wastage of both time and\nmoney for the United Nations and its Member States. This\nact is truly an admirable display of leadership. My\ndelegation looks forward to seeing more such constructive\ninitiatives in the future.\nAs a close neighbour of Malaysia and a fellow\nmember of the Association of South-East Asian Nations,\nThailand is particularly pleased to see you in this important\noffice. You can count on my delegation\u2019s fullest\ncooperation in all your endeavours at this session.\nMy delegation also wishes to take this opportunity to\nexpress its sincere appreciation to Mr. Diogo Freitas\ndo Amaral of Portugal, the President of the historic fiftieth\nsession of the General Assembly, for his most\ncommendable efforts in making the fiftieth session and\nthe fiftieth anniversary year of the United Nations truly\nmonumental and fruitful.\nMy delegation is especially grateful to Mr. Freitas\ndo Amaral for his role in facilitating the work of the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s working groups on the reform of the\nUnited Nations, particularly the Open-ended Working\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security Council\nand other matters related to the Security Council. Under\nhis stewardship, that Working Group was able to adopt,\nfor the first time, a substantive and comprehensive report\nwhich was acceptable to all.\nAs we enter the next half-century of the United\nNations and the closing years of the twentieth century, it\nis becoming increasingly clear that we, our children and\ngrandchildren will soon be living in a new era that is very\ndifferent from today\u2019s. The last decades of this century\nhave set the stage for a major shift in global paradigms\nthat will forever change the way in which we live and\nwork.\nIn recent years, events such as the population\nexplosion, the ebbing of the ideological tide and the\ntechnological and communications revolution have\nbrought to the fore such issues as the management of\nfood and resources, preservation of the environment, the\nneed to improve income distribution, education and health\ncare, and the promotion of civil rights and equalities,\ndemocracy and good governance.\nIn the United Nations and elsewhere, there is a clear\nindication that the prominence of such issues will\ncontinue into the next century and beyond. If we are to be\nable to address these issues, deal with them in an efficient\nmanner, go through the transition and adjust ourselves to\nthe paradigm shift, we need a concerted and\ncomprehensive approach. This approach should be\nproactive rather than reactive and should be able to\nprovide a new course of action for future generations.\nThe development and implementation of such an\napproach require leadership at the global level. As the\nonly international body that deals with a vast array of\nglobal issues on a daily basis, the United Nations is in a\nunique position to provide that leadership.\nThailand is convinced that, in order to be able to\nassume a leadership role, it is imperative that the United\n3\n\n\nNations first be reformed and revitalized at all three\nlevels \u2014 intergovernmental, organizational and managerial.\nIt is for these reasons that Thailand attaches great\nimportance to the work of the General Assembly\u2019s five\nworking groups on United Nations reform. Thailand\nbelieves that, if given the necessary political will and\ncooperation from Member States, each of these working\ngroups will soon be able to make specific recommendations\nto the General Assembly that would serve as salient\nelements of a single comprehensive reform package.\nIt is unfortunate, however, that, in spite of the fact that\nmost of these working groups have been in existence for\ntwo to three years, a compromise on crucial issues is\nnowhere in sight. Furthermore, should this trend continue,\nit is unlikely that we will see any substantial achievement\nfrom these working groups in the near future.\nThis desolate scenario is certainly detrimental to the\nfuture of the United Nations, especially when we are\nmerely a few steps away from the next century. It is the\nbelief of my delegation that, if we are to make any progress\nin the work of the working groups, the time is now. The\nmore we hesitate and bicker, the less chance there will be\nof any meaningful reform of the United Nations.\nDue to the lack of progress in the work of some of the\nworking groups, some Member States have begun to\nsuggest that deadlines be imposed on their work. Thailand\ndoes not believe that such deadlines are necessary. In fact,\nThailand believes that, within a year or two, if no serious\ncompromise is to be found, the momentum for reform\nefforts will simply wither away. At that point, we will no\nlonger have to worry about deadlines or the efficiency and\neffectiveness of the United Nations in managing itself and\nin dealing with twenty-first-century issues. Without the\nnecessary reforms, the fate of the United Nations is sealed.\nMy delegation therefore wishes to call upon all fellow\nMember States to redouble their efforts, in the spirit of\ncooperation and compromise and for the benefit of the\ngreater whole, to help facilitate the work of the working\ngroups in the hope that, in the very near future, they will be\nable to come up with practical recommendations to the\nGeneral Assembly and that, eventually, a comprehensive\nreform package can be formulated. What is indispensable\nfor the twenty-first century is a more capable, more\nrepresentative, more accountable and better managed United\nNations.\nYear after year, we speak about the need to reform the\nUnited Nations. Year after year, we come back to the same\nproblem: the willingness or, to be more precise, the lack of\nwillingness of Member States to see the United Nations\nbecome what they themselves said the United Nations\nshould become. The United Nations cannot be reformed\nsimply by lip-service. No meaningful reform of the\nUnited Nations can take place without the political,\nmaterial and financial support of its Members. The failure\nof Member States to meet their financial obligations to\nthe United Nations, in particular, not only undermines the\nUnited Nations ability to reform but, more importantly, in\nactuality is the root cause of some of the United Nations\ncurrent inefficiencies. It is for this reason that my\ndelegation finds it politically and legally unacceptable for\nMember States intentionally to withhold their assessed\ncontributions to the United Nations on any grounds\nwhatsoever.\nWhen my delegation speaks about United Nations\nleadership, we are referring specifically to two sources of\nleadership. The first is the General Assembly, as it is the\nmost universal and, undeniably, the most important organ\nof the United Nations. The other is the Secretary-General\nas the chief administrative officer of the Organization.\nAs far as the General Assembly is concerned, my\ndelegation believes that it is essential that the\npre-eminence of the General Assembly vis-\u00e0-vis other\nprincipal organs of the United Nations continue to be\nemphasized. This pre-eminence should be not only in\nwords, but also in reality. The General Assembly must be\nthe ultimate decision-making body on all important\nquestions, as specified in the Charter, and not simply a\nrubber stamp for decisions or agreements concocted\nelsewhere. The General Assembly must truly be the voice\nof and moral compass for the international community.\nAs for the Secretary-General, my delegation is of the\nview that the twenty-first century demands that the chief\nexecutive officer of the United Nations be someone with\nexemplary courage and vision. That person must have the\ncourage to take bold initiatives, to stand up for what he\nor she believes is right as well as to promote and defend\nthe interest of the greater whole. He or she must have the\nvision and the managerial adeptness to turn the United\nNations into one of the most efficient and purposeful\ninternational institutions of our time. Due to the\nincreasingly demanding responsibilities of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Thailand is inclined to support the idea that the\nposts of Deputy Secretary-General be created and that\nthese deputies be empowered to act on behalf of the\nSecretary-General in certain areas of his or her\noverwhelming responsibilities. Moreover, in order to be\nable to perform his or her functions with full efficiency\n4\n\n\nand without the interference of undue external pressures, a\nUnited Nations Secretary-General should serve only one\nterm in office, be it of five or seven years.\nThrough close coordination and cooperation between\nthe General Assembly and the Secretary-General, a\ncomprehensive approach for the future can be developed\nand implemented with efficiency. The development and\nimplementation of this new approach should be guided by\nthe main purposes of the United Nations, namely, the\nmaintenance of international peace and security and the\npromotion of global economic and social development.\nThese dual responsibilities are the raisons d\u2019\u00e9tre of the\nUnited Nations. They have come to symbolize the efforts\ntowards global cooperation and my delegation believes that\ntheir goals should continue to be pursued with vigour and\nthe fullest cooperation from United Nations Member States.\nIn this connection, my delegation wishes to commend\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General, for his\ninitiatives on \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d and \u201cAn Agenda for\nDevelopment\u201d. By having the foresight to come up with\nthese very important documents in the early years of this\ndecade, the Secretary-General has provided us with\nblueprints for the future upon which we can plan and\nvisualize a new direction for a new United Nations.\nAs I pointed out earlier, there is a clear trend that the\nmain issues that will confront us in the future are those of\neconomic and social development. The key concepts for the\ntwenty-first century are sustainable economic growth and\nsustainable human and social development. For this reason,\nmy delegation believes that now is the time for greater\nattention to be given to these issues. This belief does not\nstem from the fact that Thailand herself is a developing\ncountry, but rather from the realization that a solid\neconomic and social foundation is an indispensable\nprerequisite for sustainable peace and prosperity.\nAt the international level in particular, functional\ncooperation in these areas could create a network of\ninterdependence based on goodwill and mutual interests,\nwhich could help eliminate conflicts and misunderstandings.\nIt is with this belief that Thailand has consistently been a\nstrong advocate of United Nations activities in the field of\neconomic and social development, as well as humanitarian\nactivities, and has been an active participant in the efforts\nto reform the mechanisms of the United Nations in these\nareas. A good example of Thailand\u2019s commitment to the\nUnited Nations development effort is her agreement to host\nthe tenth session of the United Nations Conference on\nTrade and Development (UNCTAD) in the year 2000. In\nthe meantime, we are pleased that the five major\ninternational summits organized by the United Nations,\nranging from the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de\nJaneiro in 1992 to Habitat II in Istanbul earlier this year,\nhave proved to be useful in enabling Member States to\nfocus on the various aspects of development and to\ncultivate a common vision and a comprehensive strategy\nfor cooperation among themselves. We hope that the\noutcome of such conferences will help convince Member\nStates of the need to render all necessary assistance and\ncooperation to the United Nations for its efforts in these\nareas.\nBut while we believe that international cooperation\ncould stimulate and promote development, we also believe\nthat development efforts should, first and foremost, begin\nat home. As a developing country, Thailand has always\nattached high importance to both economic growth and\nsocial development and has aspired to achieve an\nequilibrium between the two. This is evident in all of\nThailand\u2019s national development plans. Currently Thailand\nis entering its eighth five-year national economic and\nsocial development plan. We are particularly proud of this\nplan, since, for the first time, the main focus is on human\ndevelopment: it is a human-centred national development\nplan. It is not by chance that the focus of this plan\ncoincides with recent efforts of the United Nations and\nwith the United Nations development strategy spelt out in\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d\n(A/48/935). In fact, the plan has been drawn up so as to\ncomplement and respond to development efforts at all\nlevels: local, national, regional and global.\nAs a country of 60 million people, Thailand sees that\nhuman and social development are the keys to national\ndevelopment, since without any doubt a nation\u2019s most\nprecious resource is its citizens. For this reason, through\nthe years the Thai Government, often under the direct\nroyal guidance of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej,\nhas been implementing hundreds of royal national\ndevelopment projects, ranging from environmental\nprotection to education, from agriculture to public health\ncare. Some of these projects, such as narcotic suppression\nthrough the introduction of crop substitution, are\ninternationally recognized and are being implemented in\nclose cooperation with the United Nations and other\ninternational agencies. As this is the year that the Thai\nnation celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of His Majesty\u2019s\nascension to the throne, we are more determined than\never to continue on this path and to rededicate ourselves\nto advancing the cause which is so close to the heart of\n5\n\n\nour beloved monarch. Therefore, in the years ahead\nThailand will continue to work hard and to cooperate\nclosely with the international community in order to realize\nthe goals of sustainable economic, human and social\ndevelopment.\nAn important instrument through which States can\nrealize their economic and social development goals is\ninternational trade. It is therefore essential that all States be\ntreated with fairness and be given the same opportunities in\nthe international marketplace. This is the basic principle\nbehind the establishment of the World Trade Organization.\nHowever, what we see now is a disturbing tendency on the\npart of some States to use non-trade issues, such as human\nrights and labour standards, as leverage in trade\nnegotiations. Even more alarmingly, we are seeing an effort\nby some to exercise extraterritorial powers through\ndomestic legislation, impinging upon the freedom of other\nStates to pursue independent foreign policies and trading\npractices.\nMy delegation cannot emphasize strongly enough the\nimportance of keeping trade separate from other issues.\nTrade must remain free and open and not be held hostage\nto dissolute motives. Non-trade issues must not be brought\nin to be used as a smokescreen disguising neo-protectionist\npolicies and practices. To allow such a phenomenon to\ncontinue would only undo the gains that we have made\nover the past half century.\nAs mentioned above, Thailand believes in the time-\nproven notion that the benefits of functional cooperation in\nthe field of economic and social development could have a\npositive spillover effect on efforts for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. However, this does not\nmean that Thailand is idly waiting for such an effect to\nmaterialize. On the contrary, as in the past, Thailand has\ncontinued to be active in the field of international peace and\nsecurity and follows with vigilance the political and security\ndevelopments in various parts of the world. We are keeping\na watchful eye on, among other things, the peace process in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, the fragile peace efforts in the\nMiddle East and the unfolding situations in such diverse\nplaces as Angola, Haiti and Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and\nWestern Sirmium.\nIn particular, as a member of the Special Committee\non Peacekeeping Operations and the coordinator of the\nNon-Aligned Movement for this issue, Thailand is very\nmuch in support of the idea that the United Nations overall\npolicy on peacekeeping should be re-examined. We believe\nthat there should be clear guidelines and principles with\nregard to the scope, depth, objectives and mandates of\nUnited Nations peacekeeping activities in order to ensure\nthat United Nations involvement in conflict situations will\nbe practical, meaningful and cost-effective.\nAt a time when the United Nations is facing a\nfinancial crisis, Thailand also supports the notion that\nthere should be clear time-frames for United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. Of the existing 16 United\nNations peacekeeping operations, two date back to the\n1940s, one to the 1960s and two to the 1970s. These five\npeacekeeping operations, which have been running for\ndecades, have thus far cost the United Nations and its\nMember States almost $240 million and, more\nimportantly, the lives of 461 peacekeepers. Looking at\nthese figures, one cannot but wonder whether it is the\nUnited Nations that is not keeping the peace, or the\nparties involved that are not willing to have peace.\nWhatever the answer is, the international community is\npaying a high price for these operations, without any end\nin sight.\nAs international and internal conflicts rage on, the\narmaments business continues to prosper. My delegation\nis gratified that the Disarmament Commission, at its 1996\nsession, was able to adopt the guidelines for international\narms transfers. Despite their lack of legal force, the\nguidelines are an important step towards eliminating\nillegal armaments, especially small arms, which in our\nlifetime have caused too many losses and too much\nsuffering to peoples in all corners of the world.\nMy delegation believes that, parallel to this effort to\nregulate the flow of arms, there should also be methods\nof bringing to justice the perpetrators of crimes and\nviolence against humanity. It is in this belief that my\ndelegation welcomes the Economic and Social Council\u2019s\nUnited Nations Declaration on crime and public security\nas well as the efforts to establish an international criminal\ncourt. Even though these mechanisms will not make our\nlives more secure, they nevertheless give us hope that\nfrom now on there will be punishment to suit the crime.\n6\n\n\nAs far as human destruction is concerned, nothing is\nmore terrifying than the threat of a nuclear holocaust. For\nthis reason, my delegation is pleased that the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) has now\nbeen adopted by the General Assembly and is currently\nopen for signature by interested States. Once in its\noperational phase, the Treaty will be an important\ncomplement to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),\nwhich was extended indefinitely in 1995.\nHowever, neither the CTBT nor the NPT are adequate\nguarantees against the threat of a nuclear holocaust. My\ndelegation believes that the only practical way to safeguard\nthe world against a nuclear catastrophe is to eliminate all\nnuclear weapons. This can be done on a step-by-step basis\nwithin a definite time-frame. As a starter, in the spirit of\nthe advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice\nearlier this year, we could deny the legality of the use or\nthe threat of use of nuclear weapons. Eventually, we can\nmake the total elimination of all nuclear weapons and their\ndelivery systems, as well as of other weapons of mass\ndestruction, a top priority for the twenty-first century.\nLast year, our Heads of State and Government\ngathered here to pay tribute to the United Nations for its 50\nyears of service to humankind and to renew their pledge to\ncontinue to work with the United Nations to realize the\nhopes and dreams of the framers of the United Nations\nCharter. Through the Declaration adopted on that occasion,\nour leaders also promised to\n\u201cgive to the twenty-first century a United Nations\nequipped, financed and structured to serve effectively\nthe peoples in whose name it was established\u201d.\n(resolution 50/6, fifth preambular paragraph)\nToday, I am here to reaffirm that pledge and to\npropose further that the United Nations assume the\nleadership role that would help guide us into the next\ncentury. In providing this leadership, the United Nations\nneed not depart from what it has been doing for the past 50\nyears. The United Nations should continue to do what it\ndoes best in areas such as the maintenance of international\npeace and security; economic, human and social\ndevelopment; humanitarian emergencies; promotion of\ndemocracy and human rights; environmental protection; and\ntechnical cooperation. The only differences are that in\nfuture the United Nations will have to do these things much\nbetter and in a more effective and efficient manner. And,\nmore importantly, the Organization will have to project a\nclearer sense of purpose and direction, which will help\nMember States and their peoples formulate a universal and\ncomprehensive approach to cope with the emerging\nparadigms of the twenty-first century.\nWe are about to cross the threshold into a new and\nchallenging era. Through the leadership of the United\nNations, we can turn the challenges into rewards and\nopportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, allow me to\nextend my heartfelt congratulations to the President on his\nelection to the high office from which he will guide the\nwork of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly. I\nam confident that his diplomatic experience and\ncommitment to the noble principles of the Charter will\nimpress upon this session new commitment, determination\nand vigour. I would also like to express our gratitude to\nhis predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal,\nfor the skilful manner in which he presided over the work\nof the fiftieth session.\nAfter having been the focus of the international\ncommunity\u2019s attention for a long time, due to its being\nexposed to aggression and to its being part of the most\nserious regional crisis since the Second World War,\nCroatia has now entered a new era of its history as a free,\nsovereign and fully independent State. Croatia is now in\na position to deal with and resolve almost all its external\nand internal affairs with its own resources, and through\nclose cooperation with the international community as an\nequal partner.\nIt gives me great pleasure, therefore, to be able to\nlead the Croatian delegation at the fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly with the strong conviction that the time\nof war is finally behind us and that in the region of south-\neast Europe, Croatia is no longer a part of a larger crisis,\nbut rather an active and decisive agent of introducing the\nfinal solution to the crisis and the emerging international\norder. In this connection, our external and internal\npolicies are becoming increasingly peace-oriented and\ndevelopment-focused.\nSo far Croatia has been successful in dealing with\nthe question of its statehood and the right of small nations\nto full self-determination, as well as in defending these\nrights within the framework of and through the United\nNations. We are enormously grateful to this noble\ninstitution and its associated agencies, and especially to\nthose Member States whose sons and daughters are\nexposed to risk, in some cases giving their lives, in a\nnoble endeavour to assist us in ending the horrific war of\naggression against our country and in the wider region.\nCroatia has played host to one of the largest, most\nexpensive and complex peacekeeping operations in the\nhistory of the United Nations. Croatia\u2019s Government and\npeople, the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons\nand refugees in particular, have on many occasions been\ncritical of the ineffectiveness and ambiguity of\npeacekeeping mandates. Today, however, the war has\nended, and we are finally coming to terms with all of the\npolitical, economic and procedural constraints which the\ninternational community had to overcome in order to\n23\n\n\nproperly react to the aggression, the calamity of war and\nthe diplomatic uncertainty resulting from the breakup of the\ncommunist federation of Yugoslavia and the security\nvacuum resulting from the closure of the cold-war era.\nCroatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina indeed paid a\nhigh price for their struggle to ensure their survival,\nalongside the progressive efforts of the international\ncommunity to develop a new concept of the United Nations\nand other international mechanisms for the peaceful\nresolution of conflicts. However, we believe that our\nexperience has given a very positive impetus to the intrinsic\nneed to reform the general concept of peacekeeping\noperations, the work of the Security Council and the\nchanges in the regional, political and security systems in\nEurope as well.\nEven though the mandate of the joint peacekeeping\nforces in Croatia has not yet ended \u2014 5,000 peacekeepers\nare still working in the Croatian Danubian area \u2014 I wish\nto convey to the Assembly the optimism of my Government\nfor the successful completion of the mandate of the United\nNations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia,\nBaranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) there. This\noperation just may become the most successful\npeacekeeping operation in recent history, and perhaps\nrightfully so, given our own and international frustrations\nwith the unsuccessful attempt at peacekeeping and\npeacemaking in the region so far.\nThe successful completion of the UNTAES operation\nis becoming ever more likely given the recent signing of an\nagreement on normalization of relations between the\nRepublic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\nand the establishment of a new balance in the region, the\nsame balance that helped the international community forge\nthe Dayton Peace Agreement.\nWe are grateful to all Member States that supported\nour appeals and calls in the General Assembly for universal\nrespect of international law \u2014 as reflected, for instance, in\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/43, which created the\npolitical conditions and legal framework for the peaceful\nreintegration of Eastern Slavonia. We are also grateful to\nMember States whose diplomats and soldiers are more\ndirectly involved in the successful implementation of the\nUNTAES mandate.\nThanks in part to General Assembly support for the\nuniversal principles enshrined in the Charter and in part to\nthe intervention of United Nations peacekeeping forces, the\ncountries which emerged following the dissolution of the\nformer Yugoslavia are now increasingly heading towards\nthe objective of peacefully resolving mutual problems on\na bilateral basis and through regular multilateral contacts,\nthereby lessening the need for international involvement\nand mediation. Those problems include the succession to\nthe former State; regional security arrangements and arms\ncontrol; the search for missing persons; reciprocal\nminority rights; and the reestablishment of bilateral\neconomic, cultural and other forms of cooperation. The\nsuccessful expansion of bilateral neighbourly relations\nbased on internationally accepted principles cannot be\nreplaced by the imposition of superfluous and ambitious\nregional associations.\nTaking account of this new reality, in which Croatia\nand the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are prepared to\nresolve all their outstanding problems on a bilateral basis\nas two equal and sovereign States, the need for the\ncontinued presence of peacekeeping forces in Croatia has\ncome to an end.\nAny further extension of the UNTAES mandate in\nCroatia can only encourage delays in its implementation\nand place at risk the most critical aspect of the mandate:\nthe return of 80,000 Croatian and non-Serb refugees and\ndisplaced persons to the region. The continued lack of\ntangible progress in this area could induce internal and\nexternal instability; this is a matter which my Government\nand the international community should seek to avoid at\nall costs. For this reason, the clear stance of my\nGovernment is that the peaceful integration of the region\nunder the present UNTAES mandate should be completed\non schedule.\nWith the signature of the normalization agreement\nbetween Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\nthe small United Nations Mission of Observers in\nPrevlaka, Croatia, will also become obsolete in the\nforeseeable future. Croatia and the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia have agreed that the issue of Prevlaka is to be\ndealt with and fully resolved as a security matter, in\naccordance with the United Nations Charter and the\npolicy of good-neighbourliness. Therefore, there shall be\nno further raising of the question of territorial adjustments\nbetween Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\non the Prevlaka peninsula, the five-century-old boundary\nline between Croatia and Montenegro. However, there is\na need to establish a security regime there through\npeaceful negotiations with a view to the mutual benefit of\ncross-border economic cooperation.\n24\n\n\nOn the basis of the new reality, Croatia\u2019s foreign and\ninternal policy priorities will now aim at compatibility with\nand timely integration into European regional organizations.\nAt the same time, we remain cognizant of our\nresponsibilities in respect of the peaceful and successful\nstabilization of neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, in\nwhich Croats are one of the three constituent peoples. The\nprocess of the internal stabilization of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina will take years and, in this regard, Croatia is\nfully open to cooperation and collaboration with the\ninternational community. The community\u2019s presence and\nassistance there has been significantly less costly to it\nthanks to Croatia\u2019s resources and contributions. Following\nthe initial reconstruction assistance for Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, an economically viable Croatian State can\nmake the greatest contribution to the viability of the\nBosnian Federation and to Bosnia and Herzegovina as a\nwhole.\nCroatia is prepared to recognize the results of every\ndemocratic political process between the three constituent\nnations and the two entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and\nwill continue to give its full support to the successful\nimplementation of the Federation Agreements.\nCroatia, fully supportive of a properly balanced\nFederation as defined at Dayton \u2014 the 1\u20142\u20143 formula:\none State, two entities, three constituent peoples \u2014 seeks\nnot only to ensure the survival of the Bosnian Croats as a\nconstituent people in all respects, but also to avoid any\nsituation that could lead to a threatening instability in the\nregion as a whole. In that sense, any attempts to change the\nconstitutional definition of the Federation or to achieve the\nsame results through institutional or power-sharing\narrangements are unacceptable to the Republic of Croatia as\na party to the relevant Agreements. The same applies to any\nattempts to change the present entities settlement through an\nover-centralization of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Any\nterritorial adjustment at the expense of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina or its two entities shall be viewed as highly\ndetrimental to the stability of the region in general and\nconsidered a threat to Croatia\u2019s security.\nAs Croatia continues to move to reestablish its\nEuropean way of life, while at the same time bringing its\nyoung democracy and its governance into conformity with\nthe new European democratic reality, constructive criticism\nof its actions and attitudes will continue to be taken in good\nfaith. By now, we have accepted the fact that, owing to the\nneeds of the multilateral crisis-management process in the\nregion, the standards set for Croatia in many areas of\ndemocratic development are much higher than for other\ncountries in transition. Croatia\u2019s extraordinary openness\nto the innumerable institutions that monitor developments\non our soil, especially in the field of human rights, attests\nto the transparency of our policy and to our deep\ncommitment to democratic values, tolerance and\nindividual rights.\nIn renewing our expressions of gratitude to the\nUnited Nations for its contribution to the successful\nresolution of an act of aggression against a Member State,\nwe should like to express the readiness of our country,\nwhich now has a wealth of experience in peace-mediation\nefforts behind it, to contribute actively to similar United\nNations efforts outside our region. We should now like to\nbecome active in the other regular activities of the United\nNations and regional mechanisms, to which we offer our\nexperience and experts, to further the common interests\nand ideals of the Charter of the United Nations.\nCroatia is actively following the reform process of\nthe United Nations system, and actively participates in\nsome aspects of reform. We fully recognize the need to\nreorganize the system and adapt it to the changing\ninternational system. New objectives are already clearly\ndefined in the socio-economic sphere, and the area of\nhuman rights in particular. The United Nations is faced\nwith new realities and problems centred around its goal of\npromoting the rights of the individual while preserving\nthe identity of groups and nations and respecting the\nsovereignty of Member States.\nWe are following with particular interest the process\nof resolving the financial crisis of the United Nations. As\na small State that has experienced exceptional financial\nneeds and shortfalls over the past five years, Croatia\nsupports efforts to find a more equitable scale of\nassessment for Member States that are experiencing\nextraordinary situations and whose capacity to pay has,\naccordingly, changed significantly.\nCroatia has already spoken in favour of reforming\nand strengthening the United Nations system, and\nespecially the Security Council. Our position takes into\naccount new realities in which economic powers such as\nGermany and Japan, but also individual regions and\nStates \u2014 and their views \u2014 must be more justly\nrepresented. Therefore, Croatia firmly supports the\nexpansion of the Council to 25 members in both\ncategories of membership. Greater transparency in the\nwork of the Council is also essential, and should be\nachieved through the adoption of new rules of procedure.\nThe Organization will also be strengthened by the present\n25\n\n\ndiscussions on changes in general procedures, that will,\ninter alia, reduce and rationalize the costs of overlapping\nactivities of various United Nations institutions. We\nespecially support efforts to rationalize and restructure the\nsocio-economic sector of the United Nations so that it can\ncontinue to achieve its rightly ambitious goals around the\nworld.\nIn its post-war foreign policy and economic activities,\nCroatia will firstly associate with countries on its continent,\nbut will also strive towards diversification of its relations.\nCroatia wishes actively to contribute to the promotion of\nthe common interests of small and, especially, new States.\nWe are pleased to note that apart from the trend\ntowards institutionalizing regional development and\nfunctional cooperation, we are entering an era in which\nStates are increasing their level of cooperation, through\nmultilateral diplomacy, on basic development questions,\nsuch as: the environment; developing the laws of the sea;\nenforcing international humanitarian law; protecting human\nand minority rights; protecting the rights of women and\nchildren; promoting disarmament and non-proliferation;\nand sharing knowledge and resources to help the\ndevelopment of the Third World. We are, therefore,\npassing over old ideologies, religious or regional\naffiliation and loyalties. One area in which Croatia will be\nespecially active is the establishment of the international\ncriminal court. We will be one of the sponsors of a draft\nresolution calling for the timely establishment of this\ninstitution.\nThe world we live in is entering a stage of national\nindividualization but also of ever-closer functional\ncooperation between States in creating a stable and\ninterdependent new order. Croatia, as a young State that\nstill harbours painfully fresh memories of its struggle for\nits identity, freedom and right to economic development,\nsincerely wishes to contribute to the establishment of this\nnew order by actively helping to find solutions to other\ncrisis points, development problems, and disproportions in\ncontemporary societies around the world."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Government of Gabon, it is an honour and\na pleasure for me to address this eminent gathering.\nLike previous speakers, I wish to recall that this\nmeeting is being held just one year after the\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations. On that occasion, the balance sheet of our\nactivities was examined many times. Fortunately, we are all\nagreed that we must seek together to find solutions to the\nmajor problems of the world, thereby preventing the\noutbreak of conflicts by establishing effective tools for\nnegotiation and cooperation.\nFor all of us who participate and who believe in it, the\nUnited Nations is a valuable tool in the service of a\ncommon ideal. This has been reflected in some positive\nachievements achieved through pragmatism. The essential\nlesson to draw from our assessments is that, while it has\nnot yet been able to meet all the challenges before it, the\nUnited Nations has nonetheless remained worthy of our\nhopes.\nThat is why delegations from nearly all nations\nannually take the opportunity offered by the regular session\nof the General Assembly to review the major concerns of\nthe moment and to devise new goals.\nBut before touching on that subject, I wish to convey\nto Mr. Razali the sincere and warm congratulations of the\ndelegation of Gabon on his brilliant election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session.\nIt is a tribute to his country, Malaysia, and a recognition of\nhis great personal qualities. He has our best wishes for\nsuccess as he guides our proceedings.\nI would also like to express our thanks and affection\nto his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, Minister\nof Foreign Affairs of Portugal, for the manner in which he\ncarried out his term of office at the fiftieth session.\nTo Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, I\nreaffirm here the support of the Government of Gabon for\nall his work on the tasks of our Organization and for the\ncompetence and authority he has demonstrated in carrying\nout his mandate, which have coincided with the formulation\nof United Nations reform measures. He is a worthy son of\nAfrica who has done honour to our Organization. As all\nmember States of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\nstated at the July 1996 Summit in Yaound\u00e9, Gabon hopes\nthat he will continue his work.\nBuilding lasting and orderly peace based on the\nsincere and active cooperation of sovereign nations is one\nof the major missions of the United Nations. In our\ninterdependent yet fragmented and multipolar world, the\nUnited Nations must play a more assertive role,\nparticularly in the emergence of a new political and\neconomic international order. It must help us to redress\nthe general imbalance that has gripped the world since the\nend of the 1980s.\nThe sovereign equality of all States is among the\nmain principles of our community of nations.\nAccordingly, we must cultivate flexible and dynamic\nthought that transcends relations of power and allows our\nOrganization to achieve its goal of universality. This is\nthe approach one must follow with regard to United\nNations reform. Many countries have made contributions\nand many initiatives have been taken, as can be seen in\nthe reports of the working groups established for that\npurpose. Gabon is gratified.\nOn the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\nEl Hadj Omar Bongo, President of the Gabonese\nRepublic, stated:\n\u201cThe Security Council ... should be reformed in\norder to embrace the present dimensions of our\nOrganization\u201d. (Official Records of the General\nAssembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 36th\nmeeting, p. 15)\nRestructuring the United Nations, we believe, should\nalso include sweeping reform of its various subsidiary\nbodies, with a view to avoiding duplication in its\nfunctioning and programmes.\nTo sum up Gabon\u2019s position, we would like to say\nthree things. First, it seems desirable and possible that the\npermanent membership of the Security Council could be\nincreased without that body\u2019s becoming unwieldy.\nSecondly, and on this assumption, Africa should at least\nhave one permanent seat. Thirdly, that permanent seat\nshould be rotated among all African countries according\nto modalities to be defined later.\nThe complexity of this reform and its many political,\neconomic and financial implications should not prevent us\nfrom laying out the configuration of international relations\nin the twenty-first century. Since a considerable number\nof Security Council decisions affect Africa, that region\nmust not remain unrepresented on the Council, a body of\nparamount importance for the maintenance of\n22\n\n\ninternational peace and security. In the context of reform,\nGabon subscribes to the objectives of rationalization and the\nclustering of activities whenever this enhances the\neffectiveness of the work of the United Nations.\nWe must attach priority importance to the\nestablishment of a reformed international system that can\npreserve the world from murderous conflicts that disrupt the\neconomies of the warring countries \u2014 a system that can\nfight underdevelopment, preserve the environment and wage\na worldwide combat against pandemics such as AIDS and\nmalaria \u2014 in other words, an international system that can\nbreak down the barriers to harmony and development in a\nrichly diverse world. It is certainly a daunting task, but only\nthrough these efforts and under these conditions can our\nOrganization secure lasting peace in the world.\nAlso high on the agenda is the resolution of problems\nrelating to development and to social progress in a climate\nof peace, with full respect for fundamental human rights.\nThroughout the years differences of opinion have arisen\nwith respect to these issues \u2014 particularly on how to\nresolve them. But given their decisive importance for our\nfuture and that of the United Nations, the international\ncommunity must mobilize to act on them.\nMore generally speaking, the time has come for us to\nwork together to restore to the United Nations its political\ndynamism and the means it still lacks. Clearly, then, we\nhave a great deal to think about.\nI should like now to touch on some matters of\nconcern, such as peace and development \u2014 values and\nhopes that are shared by all.\nDialogue is a prerequisite for \u2014 though not a\nguarantee of \u2014 achieving peace, which is indispensable for\nhuman society to develop and flourish. I refer not only to\nthe civilized dialogue of diplomatic relations \u2014 which, of\ncourse, is essential, but rather to a dialogue that could give\nrise to a culture \u2014 the culture of peace. Indeed, when\neverything is based on violence, dialogue is impossible. As\nBoris Pasternak wrote, \u201cOne cannot win others over by\nviolence\u201d.\nThe Bantu people value dialogue. On the occasion of\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, the President\nof Gabon, from this very rostrum, stated:\n\u201cI wish to propose that a real dialogue, a\npermanent dialogue, be established, under the auspices\nof the United Nations, between Heads of State and\nGovernment of the South and those of the North. In\nthat way, we may be able to find solutions to our\ncommon problems.\u201d (Official Records of the General\nAssembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 36th\nmeeting, p. 16)\nIf each State were to refrain from attempting to\nimpose its views on others, whatever the cost, and agreed\nthat meeting the needs of peoples in a diverse and\ninterdependent world requires dialogue and solidarity,\nthen lasting peace and development can be achieved. That\nis why we must usher in a new era, the era of\ndialogue \u2014 genuine, honest and constructive dialogue.\nWe must continue to work together on an equal\nfooting, with respect for humankind\u2019s interests and values.\nWe must denounce and put an end to political violence,\neconomic marginalization and social injustice. Dialogue\nmust begin again: in Africa, in the Great Lakes region, in\nLiberia and Somalia; but also in the Middle East, in the\nformer Yugoslavia, in Cyprus and in Chechnya \u2014\nwherever it may be necessary.\nGabon is contributing, and will always contribute, to\nbuilding the vast edifice of peace. Our duty, indeed our\ninterest \u2014 in keeping with the letter and the spirit of the\nCharter of the United Nations \u2014 lies in undertaking this\ntask. History has taught us that no country can hope to\nremain an island of peace in a sea of poverty, tension and\nwar.\nI believe that it is imperative to enhance the\nmodalities of action available to the United Nations in the\nfield of preventive diplomacy. In this connection, we must\nexplore further proposals to equip the Secretariat with an\nEarly Warning System aimed at preventing conflicts from\nerupting.\nOur faith in dialogue and our relentless pursuit of\npeace are the reasons why Gabon, whenever asked, has\nalways agreed to engage in mediation to resolve domestic\nconflicts in neighbouring countries, with the particular\ngoal of paving the way for a lasting peace.\nIn January 1996 Gabon hosted a round table aimed\nat inter-Chadian reconciliation. In March 1996 we also\nenabled our Angolan brothers to strengthen the\nfoundations for their future understanding, in the presence\nof several international observers. In both cases, the goal\nwas to settle differences and clear up misunderstandings.\nWhat was important for Gabon and its President was to\nbreak through the wall of mistrust that barred the way to\n23\n\n\nreaching sincere and lasting agreements on solutions to such\ncrises.\nWe cannot claim victory. The peace process in most\ncountries is lengthy, and reversals, which can delay or\njeopardize its conclusion, are frequent. For this reason, the\ninternational community must encourage and support those\nbrothers at war who have opted for the path of dialogue to\nbuild peace. It must also promote goodwill, which will\nenable the warring parties to resolve their conflicts. Africa\nprovides numerous examples of this.\nThe peace we seek requires not only dialogue but also\nother, sound initiatives such as disarmament and\ndenuclearization. In this connection, we welcome the\nindefinite extension last year of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Likewise, we are proud\nof the fact that in March 1996, the African countries signed\nin Cairo the Pelindaba Text of the African Nuclear-\nWeapon-Free Zone Treaty on the denuclearization of our\ncontinent. Finally, we warmly welcome the General\nAssembly\u2019s adoption, on 10 September 1996, of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. I signed it\nyesterday on behalf of my country.\nThe Central African States have decided to harmonize\ntheir policies on conventional disarmament, with a view to\nestablishing a register of conventional arms. The success of\nthis subregional undertaking will depend not only on the\nwill of the States of the subregion, but also on the political\nsupport and assistance of all States Members of the United\nNations.\nPeace is also the result of confidence-building\nmeasures. The adoption of binding legal instruments and\nthe effective use of preventive diplomacy will allow Africa\nto be exorcised of the spectre of death-dealing conflicts.\nThe United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on\nSecurity Questions in Central Africa is working towards\nthat end. It just passed an important test with the solemn\nsignature, on 8 July 1996, of a non-aggression pact during\nthe thirty-second ordinary session of the Assembly of\nHeads of State and Government of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU). This important preventive diplomacy\nmeasure shows that the Governments of the Central African\ncountries intend to give pride of place to dialogue in the\npeaceful settlement of disputes among them.\nThe signing of this pact by the Heads of State of the\nsubregion proves the importance and priority that the\ncountries of Central Africa accord to the Standing Advisory\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa. The\nGovernment of Gabon thanks the General Assembly for\nsupporting that machinery through a trust fund, which\ngenerous donors, such as Japan, are beginning to pay into.\nIn 1974, during the special session of the United\nNations General Assembly, President Bongo, using an\nexample from nature, and according to a Gabonese\nmaxim, stated that:\n\u201cWhen all the animals have been fed, calm reigns\nover the plains. (...) When the peoples of the earth\nhave the vital minimum and maximum of dignity to\nwhich they are entitled, peace and harmony will\nfinally have some likelihood of reigning on earth.\u201d\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, sixth\nspecial session of the General Assembly, 2210th\nPlenary Meeting, para. 30)\nDevelopment is certainly essential to peace. I would\neven go as far as to say that it is an intrinsic element of\npeace.\nAlthough Africa has been wrestling with serious\neconomic, social and political problems for over two\ndecades, it is safe to say that henceforth it will vigorously\nand courageously undertake the reforms needed for its\nrecovery.\nHowever, African countries can make progress in\nthis direction only if they are given adequate support by\nthe international community, and by the developed\ncountries in particular.\nThe goals of sustained economic growth, social\ndevelopment, environmental protection and respect for\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms set in the plans\nof action of several international conferences have\nsustainable development as their common denominator.\nWe are witnessing an era of radical change\ncomparable to the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth\ncentury. The globalization of the economy and of\ninformation and communications is changing relations\namong nations and increasing interdependence.\nWhile these trends inspire great hope, they also raise\nnumerous concerns because the impact of globalization\nvaries from country to country. Those in Africa, in\nparticular, where most come under the category of least\ndeveloped countries, are facing a worrisome economic\nsituation. Despite declarations and programmes of action,\nresources are not forthcoming.\n24\n\n\nInternational economic and financial relations are\nchanging radically and quickly, as is clear from the events\nof recent years. The establishment of the International\nSeabed Authority which is well under way and which we\nwelcome; the creation of the World Trade Organization in\n1995, which is accelerating the easing of restrictions on free\ntrade and its globalization; and the gradual establishment of\nlarge regional blocs in various parts of the world are all\nfeatures of the new international order.\nThis situation, which is conducive to the emergence or\nconsolidation of poles of integration, is far, on every score,\nfrom benefitting African States, whose income, which\nderives essentially from basic commodities, remains\nvulnerable to price fluctuations on the international market\nthat are out of their control.\nIn addition, our continent\u2019s heavy debt burden means\nthat our region is responsible for the greatest volume of\nreverse financial transfers due to debt repayment.\nStructural adjustment programmes, although beneficial,\nmean that populations have to make enormous sacrifices.\nThese programmes are now being followed in countries\nundergoing political reorganization. Because of the way\ndemocracy works, it is assumed that citizens support the\nproposed programmes. Inevitably, this increases the\ndemands made by society. For Governments, it is truly\ndifficult to find a balance between these contradictory\nrequirements.\nOf course, to remain credible partners we must abide\nby the requirements that go along with structural adjustment\nand the recovery of our economies. But we are duty-bound\nto include social needs when formulating and implementing\nreforms. The adoption of measures to promote sustained\neconomic growth should not distract us from financing\nbasic social and economic infrastructures such as roads,\nschools, hospitals, vocational training centres and so on.\nThis financing is essential if we are to improve our\npopulations\u2019 living conditions and quality of life. As\nrepresentatives know, the United Nations remains sensitive\nto this approach. Encouragement is needed, however, to\nensure that this feeling is shared by its various agencies.\nGovernments have been called on to include poverty-\neradication strategies in general, people-oriented\ndevelopment policies. How do we do this?\nIn establishing a favourable economic environment,\nthe international community must support the efforts of all\ncountries that are willing to take this course of action. As\n1996 marks the beginning of the United Nations Decade\nfor the Eradication of Poverty, common objectives and\nthe commitments entered into in the framework of\noverseas development assistance must now become\nreality.\nHowever, since 1991, this assistance has declined in\nreal terms. Private capital flows have been exclusively\nfocused in some 20 developing countries. So far, there\nhas been no upsurge in private investment in countries of\nthe African Financial Community (CFA), despite the\nconsiderable devaluation of the CFA franc in January\n1994.\nWe hope that the United Nations System-wide\nSpecial Initiative on Africa recently launched by the\nSecretary-General will ensure that the United Nations\nsystem as a whole, including the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund, will help to mobilize the\ninternational community. Likewise, the international\ncommunity must look into the crucial issue of debt,\nbecause it is jeopardizing the development of our\ncountries.\nMy country believes that new solutions to deal with\ndebt, its conversion or refashioning in the interests of\neconomic and social development are essential to alleviate\nits heavy burden and to make it compatible with\ndevelopment, in the spirit of consensus prompted by the\nVienna Declaration and Programme of Action.\nWe reject and label as unjust any discrimination or\nclassification between developing countries, as this\nusually makes Gabon ineligible for much of the assistance\nit requires for its development.\nAfrican peoples and Governments are not sitting idly\nby, waiting for assistance from the international\ncommunity. They are tirelessly making tremendous efforts\nto overcome the crisis they face. I am pleased to mention\nin this respect the positive role that the Organization of\nAfrican Unity is playing in backing our efforts.\nOAU, in submitting the Treaty Establishing the\nAfrican Economic Community in June 1991 in Abuja to\nour Heads of State and Government for signature,\nunderstood that in the new international scenario,\nmultilateral relations supersede bilateral relations.\nThe Abuja Agreement entered into force in May\n1994, and the first ministerial session of its Economic and\n25\n\n\nSocial Commission will be held next November in Abidjan.\nSubregional economic communities are becoming stronger\nall the time. Outside institutional frameworks, these\neconomic blocs are implementing common programmes on\ncurrency, payment methods, business law, the development\nof scientific and technological capacity, energy resources,\nthe environment and so on.\nIn the Central Africa subregion, our countries are\ninvolved also in subregional integration, which they see as\na major component of development policy.\nIt was in this spirit that the thirtieth summit of the\nCentral African Customs and Economic Union was\nconvened in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, from 20 to 22\nDecember 1994. The entry into force of customs reform\non 1 July 1995 and the signing in July 1996 in Libreville\nof a text that establishes the Central African Economic\nand Monetary Community are designed to coordinate and\nstrengthen the various regional integration efforts.\nThese are the main ideas that Gabon wishes, through\nme, to contribute to our consideration of the major\nconcerns facing the international community today.\nIndeed, some of these questions are far from being\nresolved. We hope that discussion of these issues will\ncontinue, without getting bogged down and with the\nparticipation of all, in order to find solutions that can\nprovide equitable and comprehensive guarantees for the\ninterests of all of our countries. These interests are,\nbasically, participation in forging a future for the United\nNations; the maintenance and consolidation of peace;\nprogress; and economic development.\nMembers may have noticed that I have dwelt on\neconomic development concerns. I have done so not\nbecause I am biased, but because we in Gabon believe\nthat true peace cannot exist amid poverty and destruction.\nAs the Romans said, \u201cSi vis pacem, para bellum\u201d \u2014 \u201cIf\nyou desire peace, prepare for war\u201d.\nToday, on the threshold of the twenty-first century,\nand in both domestic and international contexts, we\nshould say instead, \u201cIf you desire peace, prepare for\ndevelopment\u201d, because development and economic\nprogress has truly become the face of peace."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a\ngreat pleasure for me, at this fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly, to congratulate you on your election.\nYour wealth of experience in international affairs, your\nprofessional skills and your great diplomatic qualities are,\nfor me and my country, a guarantee that our work will be\nsuccessful. I would like to include in these very sincere\ncongratulations the other officers of the Assembly, whom\nwe have just elected. I wish them all every success in the\nimportant and delicate tasks that lie ahead.\nI should also like express our gratitude to and\nadmiration for the President of the fiftieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, whose very successful term of office\nhas just come to an end. He did sterling work in ensuring\nthe prestige of the numerous and highly symbolic events\nthat marked the fiftieth anniversary of this Organization.\nHe gave great impetus to the extensive discussions within\nthe General Assembly on strengthening the United\nNations system and on the question of equitable\nrepresentation on the and increase in the membership of\nthe Security Council and other matters related to the\nCouncil. Suggestions were made by the delegation of\nMonaco with regard, notably, to the increase in the\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members of the\nCouncil. They appear in annex 11 of the report of the\nworking group established to that end.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to thank\nthe Secretary-General for his efforts to make our\nOrganization less costly and more effective. In a\nparticularly difficult political and economic situation, he\nhas never failed in the mission we entrusted to him five\nyears ago.\nI referred just now to the difficulties of our times.\nThese are major difficulties and often seem\ninsurmountable, at least in the short term.\nMany factors, sometimes very different but broadly\nconnected, exacerbate these difficulties. The major world\nconferences on population and development, on social\ndevelopment and on human settlements clearly brought\nthese factors to light.\nIf the sustainable and harmonious development we\naspire to is to apply to all human beings, we must also try\nto preserve the resources of our planet so that future\ngenerations do not find themselves totally destitute one\nday. In a vital area for us, the Principality of Monaco has\nbeen striving for nearly a century to promote the\npreservation of oceans and seas and the priceless\nresources they provide, through studies and research, but\nalso by taking specific national and international\ninitiatives. Accordingly, Monaco ratified the United\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea and intends in\n7\n\n\n1998 to play an active role, commensurate with our size\nand resources, during the International Year of the Ocean.\nThe General Assembly, five years after the United\nNations Conference on Environment and Development,\nwisely decided pursuant to resolution 50/113 to hold a\nspecial session to consider and review the implementation\nof Agenda 21. This will be an extremely important session.\nWe hope it will give us an opportunity to reinforce the\nobjectives spelt out at Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.\nThe Principality of Monaco is pleased to host next\nyear\u2019s seventh session of the High-Level Advisory Board\non Sustainable Development and then the International\nWhaling Commission.\nMy country is thus showing our interest in the\ninternational cooperation which is essential if we are to\naddress the confrontation between legitimate economic\ndevelopment and protection of the environment and the\nnon-renewal natural resources of our planet.\nOther major concerns which seriously impede\ndevelopment remain. No continent is spared the tensions\nfelt around the world, which pose a serious threat.\nOur Organization does not always have the means\nneeded to face up to these challenges and to the most\nalarming situations. Nevertheless, we welcomed the\nadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\nwhich is finally open for signature and which I will have\nthe honour to sign during this session on behalf of the\nPrincipality of Monaco.\n\n\nMight I refer here to the major role played by the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency which so ably and so\ncarefully monitors compliance with the safeguards\nagreements concluded in the framework of the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which the\nPrincipality of Monaco has ratified. Together with this, the\nAgency very scrupulously seeks to apply, sometimes in\nvery delicate circumstances, the decisions of the Security\nCouncil in this respect. Its responsibilities in the field of\ndisarmament are very substantial. Monaco is therefore\nparticularly proud to be the home of the Marine\nEnvironment Laboratory, which functions with the\nassistance of the United Nations Environment Programme\nand the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.\nFurthermore, my delegation has been following very closely\nthe follow-up to resolution 50/75, of which our\nPrincipality was one of the sponsors, and which the\nGeneral Assembly adopted on 12 December 1995.\nThe strengthening of security and cooperation in the\nMediterranean is of concern to us, as it is of concern to\nneighbouring friendly countries on both sides of the Sea.\nThe Secretary-General has embarked on valuable\nconsultations in this respect, and for this we thank him\nvery sincerely.\nWhen wars break out, once the weapons have fallen\nsilent, the painful aftermath remains, including millions of\nlandmines, which have a devastating, extremely deadly\neffect, scattered in fields and under roads and have a\nmassive impact on civilian populations, primarily on\nchildren. At the human level, the proliferation of these\ndevices causes serious, often incurable, mutilation and\nmajor material damage. The Security Council\u2019s 15 August\n1996 discussions on demining in the context of peace-\nkeeping operations highlighted, if there were any need to\ndo so, the importance that the United Nations and the\nmajor Powers attach to this question. His Serene\nHighness, the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, my father, is\nno less mindful of this. He has requested his Government\nto provide regular financial assistance to demining\noperations by contributing to the fund set up by the\nUnited Nations for that purpose. Without offering an\nimmediate, complete solution, a moratorium \u2014 or, even\nbetter, cessation \u2014 on the production and export of these\nanti-personnel landmines would give us some hope.\nThis year saw the holding of the twenty-sixth\nOlympic Games. Men and women from 197 countries and\nterritories, from very different backgrounds, came together\nand tested their strength. They fought peacefully and, with\nmutual respect and esteem, created imperishable bonds. I\nwas there as Chairman of the Monaco Olympic\nCommittee and as a member of the International Olympic\nCommittee, and I can attest to the unique spirit which\nevery four years brings together the world\u2019s best athletes.\nI wish to pay tribute to them. They are an irreplaceable\nexample for the young people of our nations. I think it is\nright, here, to echo the appeal made by many\norganizations that there be more women representing their\ncountries at the Olympic Games, and that traditions,\nhowever worthy of respect, do not become discrimination\nagainst women in the area of sport.\nThe cooperation that has grown up between the\nUnited Nations and the Olympic Movement, which share\nlofty universal principles and values, gives me great hope.\n8\n\n\nOur General Assembly regularly bolsters this cooperation\nin its resolutions, and I hope that the same will happen this\nyear.\nThese athletic, dynamic and devoted young people\noften work as volunteers for the United Nations and non-\ngovernmental humanitarian organizations, and they deserve\nour heartfelt gratitude.\nI wish too to recall the World Programme of Action\nfor Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond, adopted last year\nby the General Assembly in resolution 50/81. We must take\naccount of its recommendations in every area, particularly\nthose of education, employment, health, the environment,\nand ensuring full, effective participation of women in the\nlife of society and in the decision-making process.\nThe Principality of Monaco, which ratified the\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\nof Racial Discrimination and is a party to the Convention\non the Rights of the Child, is very concerned by\ncontemporary forms of racism and marginalization. We\nencourage the efforts of the United Nations and the Special\nRapporteur on this subject.\nWe are also seriously alarmed by the development and\nscale of child prostitution and the trade in young girls and\nboys. An important initiative was taken last August by a\nnon-governmental organization, End Child Prostitution in\nAsian Tourism, with the assistance of the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the Government of Sweden.\nWe must all heed the work of the world Congress\nagainst Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. I am\nsure that the conclusions and recommendations of this\nCongress, in the form of an agenda for action, will raise\nour consciousness about the seriousness of the situation by\nencouraging States to adopt the necessary national and\ninternational measures.\nBy participating in the Congress, Monaco showed its\ncommitment to a world policy to combat the commercial\nsexual exploitation of children. On the national level, this\nis taking the form of unreserved support for humanitarian\nassociations and non-governmental organizations that are\nactive in this area and, in particular for their efforts to\nsensitize others to this scourge, to prevent it and to\nrehabilitate its victims. We are also introducing a legislative\ninitiative which should lead to a change in Monaco\u2019s penal\ncode before the end of the year, with the introduction a new\ncrime: the sexual exploitation of children for the satisfaction\nof the vices of others, whether these events occur in the\nPrincipality of Monaco or outside our national territory.\nOnce this law is in effect, any person apprehended in\nMonaco who has committed, in any place whatsoever,\nacts that can be qualified as crimes or attacks against\ndecency or morality according to the laws of Monaco as\nregards minors, can be prosecuted and tried.\nI would add that the international community must\nalso think about strengthening international legal\nprotections in this area, in so far as existing texts,\nincluding the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child,\nparticularly its articles 19 and 21, often remain\ninoperative because they are difficult to apply.\nSimilarly, the 1926 Slavery Convention, the 1956\nSupplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery,\nand the 1949 Convention for the Suppression of the\nTraffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the\nProstitution of Others, which are very general in scope,\ndo not provide sufficiently effective, speedy recourse in\nthis particular area, where emergency action is necessary.\nThe strengthening of this protection in the form of\na multilateral instrument, for instance, could permit\njudicial prosecution to go beyond national borders and for\nthe illicit commerce in children and their commercial\nsexual exploitation to be categorized as crimes against\nhumanity, that is, that they be considered indefensible\nunder the Convention on the Non-applicability of\nStatutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against\nHumanity of 26 November 1968. Article 1 of that\nConvention should thus be modified appropriately. Like\nthose stipulated in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention\nand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, these acts\nshould not meet with a refusal to extradite. The law, and\ninternational law, should be fully capable of protecting\nthese weak, destitute beings, while leaving no chance of\nimpunity for the perpetrators of these vile crimes.\nIn addition to strengthening legal protections, we\nshould also give some thought to the steps needed to\nrehabilitate these young victims, as broadly emphasized\nby the Stockholm Congress; without such rehabilitation,\nthat these children would fall back into prostitution circles\nmight prove inevitable.\nAlthough some of the behaviours I have just\nmentioned are intolerable and unacceptable, I wish now\nto speak of the United Nations Year for Tolerance, which\nended in December 1995. Adopted in December 1993\nthanks to a welcome initiative by the General Conference\nof the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization, and supported by a unanimous resolution of\n9\n\n\nthe General Assembly, this manifestation of faith in\nhumankind, concluded with a Declaration and Plan of\nAction that were designed to inspire not only high-level\npoliticians, but each of us in our daily lives.\nIn keeping with General Assembly resolution 49/213,\nthe Follow-Up Plan of Action for the United Nations Year\nfor Tolerance, accompanied by the Declaration of Principles\nthat preceded it and that inspires it (A/51/201), is before\nthis year\u2019s session of the General Assembly. It invites us to\nmake a common effort to combat political and social\nfactors which often seem to be at the origin of intolerance\nand hatred.\nThis invitation should receive the proper response, for\nit could contribute to providing solutions to the tensions\nthat persist in the world, some of which, as we know, are\nextremely disquieting.\nThroughout history, the most important moments of\nprogress have certainly occurred during periods of real and\nprofound tolerance. Such tolerance favoured thought, the\narts, the sciences, the sharing of knowledge and values. It\nbuilt civilizations and enabled them to draw together and\nmutually enrich one another in an exceptional way.\nWhile many today are convinced that history probably\nhas no meaning, it remains none the less a fragile and\nprecious commodity, largely fashioned by the commitments\nand the will of man.\nOn 8 January next year we shall commemorate the\nseven-hundredth anniversary of the establishment of my\nfamily\u2019s dynasty in Monaco. In celebration of that event,\nmany cultural and artistic events, some on an international\nscale, will take place throughout 1997. This will be our way\nof paying a tribute to our past as well as of expressing our\nconfidence and faith in the future and destiny, not only of\nour country, but of mankind.\nOn that note, I should like to conclude my statement\nby thanking the President very much for having allowed me\nto speak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first of\nall to express the honour I feel as an Andorran at the\ndistinction that has been conferred on our small country by\nthis Assembly through your election, Mr. Minoves-Triquell,\nas a Vice-President for this year\u2019s session of the General\nAssembly. I thank you for calling on me to address this\nAssembly and assure you of the support of the people of\nAndorra and, I am sure, of all those who speak the Catalan\nlanguage.\nI must also thank the outgoing President, Mr. Diogo\nFreitas do Amaral, for his excellent tenure at the helm of\nthe General Assembly during the year of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations. I do this with the\nsatisfaction of congratulating an illustrious Portuguese, a\nbrother from the Iberian peninsula who has been able to\ngive this Assembly the necessary impetus to start off on the\nright foot and with hope for the new era of 50 years that\nmust take us to the one hundredth anniversary of the United\nNations. I wish also to convey to the new President, His\nExcellency Mr. Razali Ismail, my warmest congratulations\nand those of my country on his election, and I have the\ngreat pleasure of assuring him of the close collaboration of\nthe Andorran Vice-President of the General Assembly, who\nwill always be at his service.\nAndorra looks to the future of the world with\noptimism, sure that on this Earth men and women of good\nwill will know how to overcome intolerance and injustice.\nIn order to advance towards these objectives of progress,\nwe will have to count on the United Nations. Its reform,\nwhich the Secretary General, at the call of all the States,\nhas promoted during these last years, will give us a more\nefficient Organization, with more coordination and less\ncostly duplication, responsible in the financial sphere and\nconcentrated on its mandate.\nMy fellow citizens often ask me, \u201cWhat can a small\ncountry like Andorra bring to the United Nations?\u201d We are\na State with very little land and with a population that we\ncount in six tens of thousands, and we lack the political\nweight the force of arms normally provides. However, our\nsmall size has been our good fortune. We have opted to\nlack armies and cannons since we destroyed all our\ncountry\u2019s fortifications in 1278. One day, we would hope,\nthat admirable action of the thirteenth-century Andorrans\nwill be imitated by our century\u2019s over-armed Powers,\nlarge, mid-sized and small. Our small population has been\na good school for human understanding and our\nindividual and collective aspirations, allowing for the\nprecision of small-scale observation. Because we are\nsmall and peaceful, and because we have a lengthy\nhistory, we bring to the United Nations a vision of the\nworld that is patient and optimistic, and it is our belief\nthat if we have lived in our territory without bellicose\nconflict for more than 700 years, the same is also possible\nbeyond our borders, for, in the end, the men and women\nwho live in Andorra are different from the rest of\nmankind only in their collective historical experience.\nIt is the young people growing up in this latter part\nof the twentieth century who will pave the way to the\nthird millennium. I should thus like to make them the\nmain point of my statement this year in the Assembly\u2019s\ngeneral debate. Later, I will mention my State\u2019s hopes for\nthe young who are today being educated in an\nunderstanding of the challenges of the United Nations and\nof the need to promote democracy and human rights as\nthe pillars of the peace, prosperity and justice for peoples\nthat we are striving to attain, goals that, if we hurry in\nour task, we may be able to glimpse ourselves.\nEarlier, I indicated that Andorra trusts the future.\nOne of the principal reasons for that trust is probably the\nfact that a great part of our population is young and that\nour demographic pyramid is very different from those of\nour Western European neighbours. When human beings\nare young, everything seems possible. The energy we all\npossess allows us to look forward with strength, with\ncourage and with hope. Raisons d\u2019\u00e9tat, political evils,\neconomic imperatives, the belief that the end justifies the\nmeans \u2014 all these have difficulty taking root in the\nyoung, since youth cares more about fidelity in friendship,\nmore about making its imprint on society. Youth has\nidealism \u2014 something we too often criticize but\nsomething which feeds the genuine and vital fire that\ncompels human beings to strive for dialogue and genuine\ncoexistence \u2014 to aspire, for example, to the United\nNations.\nIt is that aspect of the young that we must nourish\nif we desire a better world. Unfortunately, it is still very\ndifficult for many young people to seek the good of\nmankind when in their own countries, cities or villages,\n9\n\n\nin their homes or in their families, they lack the most basic\nphysical or spiritual necessities, when the education they\nare given is the official doctrine of a despotic regime and\nwhen \u2014 as was the case with their parents and their\ngrandparents before them \u2014 what they eat today is the\nmeagre wage of much sweat. In the developed countries,\nunemployment among the young crushes the hopes of a\nlarge part of today\u2019s well-prepared generation, which will\nbe forced to waste the education that decades of economic\nprogress have enabled it to obtain. In States still striving to\nachieve development, in which 84 per cent of the world\u2019s\npopulation between 15 and 24 years of age lives, the\nsituation is very worrying: AIDS, the rural exodus, poverty,\nhunger, medical shortcomings, sexual exploitation, juvenile\ndelinquency \u2014 problems that also affect the developed\ncountries \u2014 are particularly acute. Unemployment in\ndeveloping countries is also a tragic evil. We know that\nmore than 100 million new jobs will have to be created in\nthe next two decades to satisfy the growing young and\nactive population of the developing countries.\nIn confronting these problems we who govern must\nassume our responsibilities and give priority to policies\naffecting the young, especially those geared towards\nfighting youth unemployment. One of the first areas we\nmust encourage is obviously that of training. Governments\nmust coordinate economic plans with training policies so\nthat students can learn professions that they will have some\nchance of practicing, as well as to prevent, insofar as\npossible, an excess of graduates in saturated sectors. We\nmust also give appropriate encouragement, through\nprogrammes of coordination and technical assistance when\nnecessary, to the integration of young people into the\ncommunity. Small communities, when they work in\nconjunction with non-governmental organizations, pay\nspecial attention to the management of resources and are\nwell aware of the needs of their young people.\nThis joint effort is most appropriate when we recall\nthat we are living in an era in which society realizes that\nbig government and its programmes sometimes give rise to\nmore expenditure than advantages and that fiscal\nresponsibility is of more benefit to the economy than is the\nmultiplication of governmental departments, especially in\nthe developing countries, where the public sector is still\nsuffering the consequences of large-scale programmes that\nhave not produced the results expected. In those States,\nGovernments will find it to their advantage to acknowledge\nthe value of fostering microcredits for young people with\nentrepreneurial projects. The example of Bangladesh, where\nsuch credits have enabled many women to achieve financial\nindependence, is noteworthy in this respect. I would also\nmention as an example of successful action the\neducational measures for young entrepreneurs that some\nLatin American States have taken with a view to the\ncreation of new, small companies.\nAt the United Nations, States must give direct\nsupport to young people and to the programmes related to\nthem. More specifically, I am thinking of the World\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\nBeyond. That Programme, which was adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly on 14 December 1995, defines some\nof the problems that affect the world\u2019s young people and\nindicates medical, educational and job-oriented priorities\nfor the next few years. We must enlarge on that text.\nStates Members of the United Nations must collaborate\nwith the Secretariat in defining the Programme\u2019s\npossibilities and putting it into practice in a concrete way\nso that its message reaches all nations. What we do with\ntoday\u2019s youth will define the twenty-first century.\nFor the past year Andorra has actively participated\nat the United Nations in the debates involving the young.\nOn 26 October of last year, in commemorating the tenth\nanniversary of the International Youth Year, our\nAmbassador spoke in this Hall on the benefits of teaching\ntolerance and human rights to young people in schools.\nAndorra has also contributed to the United Nations Youth\nFund.\nEarlier, at the March 1995 Copenhagen World\nSummit for Social Development, Andorra proposed a full\nand specific commitment asking the Governments of the\nworld to foster dialogue between generations and\nachieved its incorporation into the Declaration by Heads\nof State and Government. Given the lack of specific\nreferences in many United Nations texts, this provides a\ngood basis for subsequent studies on youth-related\nthemes.\nAt this juncture, I should like to say that the fact that\nwe concentrate our attention on youth must never lead us\nto forget members of older generations, particularly the\nelderly. Dignity in ageing must be recognized and\npromoted, particularly today, when the progress of\nmedicine is making possible the lengthening of human\nlife. Intergenerational solidarity accompanied by dialogue,\nis an integral theme of any policy geared to the support\nof the young. Indeed, when we talk of giving primary\nattention to youth, that must not mean a glorification of\nthe first decades of human life to the detriment of old\nage. On the contrary, it should mean a recognition of the\n10\n\n\ndetermining role that young people play in what will\nhappen later.\nI should like for a moment to pay a tribute here to a\ngeneration of young people which the media has of late\ncharacterized as being \u201clost\u201d \u2014 the young people of Bosnia\nand other parts of the former Yugoslavia who, not so many\nyears ago, were confident children of Europe and who have\nnow spent their youth amidst fratricidal struggles and\n\u201cethnic cleansing\u201d, with all the revulsion inherent in that\nexpression, a youth spent between death and barbarism.\nAndorra, which, during the Spanish Civil War and later\nduring the Second World War, was a land of welcome and\nrefuge for other lost generations of other wars \u2014 also\nfratricidal, and, indeed, if all human beings are brothers,\nwhat war is not fratricidal? \u2014 feels solidarity with these\nyoung people of Bosnia, upon whom has fallen the\nresponsibility for building a new coexistence and for\nerasing from the collective consciousness these past years\nof propaganda and demagoguery and for breaking with the\nhistory of confrontation that afflicts the Balkans.\nBosnia is not the only place where we have witnessed\ndifficult times. Angola, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Liberia,\nSierra Leone, Somalia, Haiti, Guatemala, El Salvador,\nBurundi, Rwanda, Iraq and many other places have in\nrecent years been affected by conflicts of great complexity.\nSome of these problems have already been solved or\nattenuated, often thanks to United Nations action.\nDevelopments in the situation in El Salvador are a good\nexample. Other conflicts continue, a cause of great\nconsternation to the international community.\nMy Minister of Foreign Affairs reminded us last year,\nin this Assembly Hall, of the considerable increase in\nmilitary personnel deployed for the United Nations in recent\nyears. At the beginning of 1988, there were just over 9,000\nBlue Helmets in the world engaged in peacekeeping\noperations. Seven years later, there are over 70,000 \u2014 this\nin spite of the fact that the military and logistical means of\nimmediate action are not in the hands of this international\nOrganization.\nUltimately, we \u2014 the States that decide how this\nOrganization shall act \u2014 are the ones responsible for\nfailing to end or prevent conflicts. Criticism must be\nconstructive. When we accuse the United Nations of a lack\nof action in Bosnia, let us ask ourselves why the policies of\nthe members of the Security Council are so divergent and\ndifficult to coordinate. We must therefore make an effort to\nprovide information so that the public has an accurate idea\nof what really happens behind the flags that adorn this\nbuilding. We must make the successes of the United\nNations known, not just its shortcomings. We must\nhighlight its efforts to promote international law, a body\nof law that will guarantee negotiated solutions instead of\nshows of strength, a principle that is essential for the\nsurvival of small States. We must recognize the small,\nquiet steps humanity takes day by day in United Nations\ncommittees, steps geared towards the promotion and\napplication of human rights. If in a particular State some\npeople, be it only a few, no longer suffer torture or\nrepulsive abuse when they are arrested; if in some parts\nof the world blood is not shed because international\nshame projects itself on those countries; if in other places,\nnuclear tests will not shatter the peace of the people\nliving there because we have signed a treaty prohibiting\nsuch actions, then the United Nations deserves all our\nsupport.\nWe must foster confidence in the future of men and\nwomen, not cynicism towards international organizations.\nIf we do not, we run the risk of encouraging movements\nthat seek to express this cynicism through violence and\nterrorist acts. We have no choice but to consider the\nmeans democracy gives to its enemies that they can use\nto destroy it, particularly through terrorism. When the\nmedia tell us that the United Nations is a potential\nterrorist target, we become even more conscious of our\ncommitment to strengthening efforts more effectively to\npublicize the task of our Organization. The energies of\nour youth must not be directed towards violent\nexpressions of social discomfort. We must therefore\nchannel them, as I have stated before, towards creativity\nin one\u2019s work and promoting confidence in humanity\u2019s\npotential. When, a few years ago, the political scientist\nFrancis Fukuyama, as witness to the end of the cold war,\nwrote about the end of history, he forgot about the\nimmense creativity of human beings. When one period of\nhistory ends, another one begins. Our responsibility is to\nensure that the period of history we have entered in the\nnineties rejects the obscurantism produced by the fear\nperpetuated by human beings, and reflects the qualities\nhumanity holds highest.\nThe framing of a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT), which I will sign tomorrow on behalf of\nthe Andorran Government, along with many of the\nrepresentatives here, is an achievement of which the\nUnited Nations Organization can feel proud and a clear\nexample of what we can do when the peoples of the\nworld unite with the strength of an ideal of peace.\nAndorra, an initial co-sponsor of the resolution that\nbrought this Treaty to the General Assembly, adheres to\n11\n\n\nits principles in full, principles which provided the basis for\nthe founding of our country. In the same fashion, not very\nlong ago we gave top priority to acceding to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons with the hope of\npromoting that text of peace. Peace! The cry of alignment\nfor the traditionally neutral States, one of the most noble\ncries, is \u2014 let us not fool ourselves \u2014 still far from being\nanswered. The CTBT is only the first step, and an essential\none, towards more efforts to ensure nuclear disarmament\nand non-proliferation, and the reduction of other types of\narsenals \u2014 goals to which Andorra will devote much\nattention.\nTo help achieve these objectives, the Government of\nAndorra has a mandate of solidarity which is enshrined in\nour Constitution. In its preamble, the Andorran people\ndeclare themselves eager to make every effort to promote\nvalues such as freedom, justice, democracy and social\nprogress, to maintain and strengthen Andorra\u2019s harmonious\nrelations with the rest of the world on the basis of mutual\nrespect, coexistence and peace, and willing to bring their\ncollaboration and effort to all the common causes of\nhumankind.\nAt present, States, large or small, within the\nframework of the United Nations, have a duty to provide a\nsource of inspiration for the ideals of youth, prevent\nisolationism and look beyond their borders, share\nexperiences and show solidarity with States in distress. This\nnotwithstanding, Governments continue to have a\nfundamental role in the internal activities of States, so that\nfew United Nations efforts and initiatives can really be\neffective without their active cooperation.\nFor this reason, the leaders of States who, year after\nyear, gather in this Assembly Hall must leave here\nconvinced of our unavoidable responsibility to promote\nhuman rights within our own borders and social and\neconomic development in our States.\nIn accordance with article 29 of the Convention on the\nRights of the Child, which Andorra signed and ratified less\nthan a year ago, thus contributing to the universal process\nof ratification so desired by the United Nations Children\u2019s\nFund (UNICEF), it is vital that Governments ensure that\ntolerance and human rights are taught freely and\ncomprehensively at school in order to rear new generations\nthat are much more sensitive to the universality and\nrelevance of these rights. We must also encourage States\nstill using other forms of government to adopt democratic\nprocesses, and make the rule of law a priority for leaders in\nthe coming years. There are no peoples unprepared for\ndemocracy, only leaders with little aptitude for fostering\nit.\nI wanted to introduce a spirit of optimism in my\nspeech today. When optimism does not conceal reality,\nbut instead tries to transcend it, it is the best remedy\nagainst the apathy that can affect the human heart in a\nworld full of conflict. I have spoken of youth and its\noptimism, and of the need to focus our attention on the\nproblems affecting youth. I have lauded the successes of\nthe United Nations, but I have also noted the difficulties\nwe will have to overcome if the United Nations, is to\nenjoy qualitative growth. I have advocated the teaching of\nhuman rights, of democracy, of tolerance, and of social\nand individual responsibility for the progress of human\ncommunities. Four years before the new millennium, we\nmust give our youth optimism and confidence in the\nfuture.\nOne year ago, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nAndorra concluded his statement before this Assembly\nwith some words by Robert Kennedy. Previously, my\npredecessor in the presidency of the Andorran\nGovernment borrowed from John Fitzgerald Kennedy the\nexpression \u201cIch bin ein Berliner\u201d to declare himself an\nAndorran in a speech on the particularities of small\nStates. To make reference to the Kennedys is to make\nreference to an optimistic decade imprinted with the\nideals and dreams that a young American President spread\naround the world. It was also a decade of harsh realities\nand contradictions, as in the world today. Ideals, however,\nlast because there is always a new generation to adopt\nthem. Today I reiterate the promise that President\nKennedy made to the United Nations:\n\u201cTo that world assembly of sovereign states,\nthe United Nations, our last, best hope in an age\nwhere the instruments of war have far outpaced the\ninstruments of peace, we renew our pledge of\nsupport to prevent it from becoming merely a forum\nfor invective, to strengthen its shield of the new and\nthe weak, and to enlarge the area in which its writ\nmay run\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I have the pleasure of extending to\nMr. Razali Ismail and to his friendly country, Malaysia,\nmy sincere congratulations on his election as President of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-first session. I wish him\nsuccess in conducting the proceedings of the session and\nassure him of my delegation\u2019s readiness to cooperate fully\nwith him in achieving our Organization\u2019s objectives and\npurposes.\nI also take this opportunity to express my thanks and\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do\nAmaral, for his sincere efforts in guiding the proceedings\nof the previous session.\nIt is also my pleasure to express my country\u2019s\ngratitude and appreciation to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his tireless and dedicated\nefforts to enhance the Organization\u2019s role and standing\n17\n\n\nand to further the Charter\u2019s objectives, especially those\nrelated to the maintenance of world peace and security. I\nhope that he will continue to hold this important position\nand to do this good work.\nThis session convenes a year after the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, which was celebrated in\nthe middle of a decade that has, from the start, witnessed\nrapid changes and diverse trends arising from the remnants\nof the cooperation and cold-war conflict that have marked\nhalf a century.\nThe international community has dealt with the\nchallenges this historic burden with a twofold response.\nFirst, it has sought to reform and develop the United\nNations system so as to enable it to fulfil its role in the\nlight of these changes. Secondly, it has made concerted\nefforts by convening world conferences to deal with critical\nissues relating to the future of mankind, such as the\nenvironment, development, population, trade, social\ndevelopment, women and children. Despite these efforts,\nwhich have continued for several years, this twofold\nresponse has proved woefully inadequate to alleviate the ills\nthat have slowed the progress and political, economic and\nsocial development of the human race.\nGiven the way the United Nations was established and\nthe manner in which the international system has evolved\nsince the 1940s, this phenomenon should not come as a\nsurprise. The international community has been unable to\nabsorb the intense impact of the major transformations of\nthe present decade, which have relied heavily on the\nfoundations and parameters of the current system of\ninternational relations. This means that the international\ncommunity still needs some time \u2014 not necessarily a\nlittle \u2014 in which to fathom the similarities and diversities\nof national interests that influence the contemporary\ninternational political system.\nIn order to be able to understand these political\nramifications in their historical context, we must consider\nthis phenomenon in the context of the flexibility and\ninflexibility that characterize the structure of the\ncontemporary system of international relations. That is\nbecause the crisis afflicting current international political\nrelations has been caused largely by the persistence of\ncomplex political and historical dilemmas that have\ncontinued to interact within a system of international\nrelations based on visions formulated by the allies before\nthe end of the Second World War.\nThe Powers that are influential in the international\narena presently appear to be reviewing the basis on which\nthe present international system was founded, with a view\nto reconfiguring, rather than abolishing, current and future\nglobal imperatives. The underlying purpose of the system\nthat emerged in the 1940s was fundamentally to address\nregional and international security problems in all their\npolitical and economic dimensions. It is a fact that the\nAllied Powers formulated their vision in the 1940s on the\npremise that security and stability in the regional context\nwere basically associated with the creation of a number of\ninternational institutions, most notably the United Nations,\nits specialized agencies and the financial institutions that\ncame into being as a result of agreements reached at a\nnumber of historic conferences.\nDespite this association and the new intellectual,\npolitical and economic trends brought about by the\nchanges, the structural notions of the international system\nhave not developed in tandem with the requirements of\nhuman development, as manifested by the\ncommunications revolution, the exchange of ideas, the\nflow of information and the technological applications\nthat have influenced international relations in various\nways.\nThe historical concept of the link between national\nand regional security could serve as an appropriate\nstarting point for a comprehensive review and redefinition\nof the question of security in all its aspects. In spite of\nthe importance of the administrative and financial reform\nof the United Nations, its specialized agencies and other\norgans, the influential Powers have not given the question\nof collective security adequate attention with a view to\ndeveloping ways and means to preserve international\npeace and security.\nThe international community truly must expand the\nscope of the principle of collective security if States are\nto be free from the fear of strategic threats to their\nnational and regional security. It is my conviction that the\nSecurity Council, as the sensory nerve-centre of the\nUnited Nations, in addressing the questions of world\nsecurity, should be guided by certain collective security\nprinciples that could be activated in the current\ncircumstances. Furthermore, it is possible to increase the\nuse of practical preventive diplomacy to prevent the\neruption of conflicts by containment and by speedily\neliminating their causes.\nIn view of the importance now being attached to the\nquestion of collective security, thought should be given to\n18\n\n\nthe development of mechanisms for maintaining relations\nbetween the Security Council and regional organizations, in\naccordance with United Nations purposes and principles.\nThis is relevant to some particularly important regions of\nthe world, such as the Arabian Gulf region, which is\nafflicted by tensions that threaten the established\nfundamentals of the region\u2019s security.\nTo insure the region\u2019s security and stability, it is\nimperative that relations among all States of the region be\nbased on the principles of good-neighbourliness, mutual\nrespect, non-interference in the internal affairs of others and\nrecognition of every State\u2019s national sovereignty. The\nterritorial and border claims that are currently being made\nin the Arabian Gulf region, and are aimed at changing\nestablished and traditionally accepted boundaries, upset the\nsecurity and stability of the region. We believe that the\noptimal and most judicious course for avoiding that\nprospect is to respect the status quo, refrain from any\nclaims \u2014 total or partial \u2014 and to settle any consequential\ndifferences by peaceful means acceptable to the parties to\nthe dispute.\nWith regard to the situation between Iraq and Kuwait,\nthe State of Bahrain, being keen to maintain security and\nstability in the Gulf region, stresses the need for Iraq to\nmeet fully the requirements of international legality and\nfulfil its obligations under the relevant Security Council\nresolutions, including the release of Kuwaiti and other\nprisoners of war.\nWhile it asserts that care should be given to ensuring\nthe unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq,\nBahrain welcomes the signing of the memorandum of\nunderstanding between Iraq and the United Nations and\ncalls for the accelerated implementation of Security Council\nresolution 986 (1995) on the issue of \u201coil for food\u201d, an\nessential step towards alleviating the suffering of the\nbrotherly Iraqi people.\nOn another matter, the continued occupation by the\nIslamic Republic of Iran of the three islands of Greater\nTunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa \u2014 all of which belong\nto the United Arab Emirates \u2014 is a cause of concern for\nBahrain and other member States of the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil, in view of the serious ramifications for the\nsecurity and stability of the region and good-neighbourly\nrelations among its States.\nThe State of Bahrain therefore calls upon the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran to respond urgently to the appeals of the\nUnited Arab Emirates to solve the question of these islands\nthrough serious bilateral talks and other means available\nfor the peaceful settlement of disputes through\nreconciliation among States.\nEconomic security is also fundamental to a world of\nsecurity and peace. In recent years, significant\ndevelopments have taken place in the sphere of\ninternational economic relations as a result of the\ninterdependence that has come to characterize the world\neconomy, especially since the establishment of the World\nTrade Organization. Over the past four decades, the\nUnited Nations has addressed development problems,\nissued a number of declarations and formulated a number\nof strategies in this respect, but the desired results have\nbeen elusive.\nWe believe that development challenges to any\ncountry can be met only by taking into account the global\neconomic system as a solution that involves the\ndevelopment of a comprehensive framework combining\ninternational and local efforts, with a view to improving\nthe performance of the economy in a favourable\nenvironment wherein local and regional circumstances and\nthe priorities and special conditions of each individual\nState are taken into consideration.\nThe topic of the ninth session of the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development, held this year in\nSouth Africa, was the promotion of sustainable growth\nand development in the context of the globalization and\nliberalization of the world economy. This reflects a global\ninterest in addressing the shortcomings of the world\neconomy. In this connection, we would like to emphasize\nthe importance of the role of the Organization in the\nenhancement of solidarity and interdependence for the\nsake of promoting development in all countries.\nWith regard to the Second United Nations\nConference on Human Settlements, held at Istanbul this\nyear, it is our hope that the principles, commitments and\nplan of action of the Conference will be implemented. It\nis also our hope that the World Food Summit, to be held\nin November in Rome, will make recommendations to\nensure and enhance world food security.\nEnvironmental problems continue to be a cause of\nconcern for the human race in view of their potential\nthreat to our planet. Agenda 21, adopted at the United\nNations Conference of Environment and Development, is\na framework for the protection of the environment.\nPersuaded that collective action is important for the\nprotection of the environment, the State of Bahrain has\n19\n\n\npaid special attention to the issue of the environment.\nAccordingly, an Emir\u2019s decree approving Bahrain\u2019s\naccession to the Convention on Biological Diversity and\nanother on environmental law were issued. The latter\nestablishes an environmental body that can exercise all\nauthorities with respect to environmental planning and\npolicies and the supervision of their implementation.\nThe third element, in our view, is social security,\nwithout which societies would be unable to sustain human\nprogress or protect national security. As far as the people\nare concerned, it is an important precondition for the\nachievement and preservation of peace and security within\nand among States. This fact was stressed by the World\nSummit for Social Development, held in Copenhagen last\nyear.\nResponsibility for social development is based on two\npivotal factors: national responsibility and collective\ncommitment, as reflected in the combined efforts of the\ninternational community. In this connection, it must be\nmentioned that the ability of societies to effect social\ndevelopment is fundamentally connected to the objectives\nof economic progress and comprehensive development in\nall their human dimensions. Any international commitment\nto preserve the stability and security of societies within the\nframework of economic and social development should take\ninto consideration the cultural content of social development\nand the various national factors.\nThe State of Bahrain \u2014 in the light of its conviction\nthat peace in the region is a strategic alternative that must\ninevitably be based on justice, the restoration of rights and\nthe prevalence of security \u2014 follows closely and with deep\nconcern the new developments in the Middle East peace\nprocess. Peace is the only course that can lead to\nreconstruction, prosperity and the well-being of the peoples\nof the region. It can end the cycle of violence and war\nwhich the region has suffered for so long.\nThe progress achieved in the context of the Madrid\nConference, whose underlying principles were the\nachievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in\naccordance with international legality and the principle of\n\u201cland for peace\u201d, should continue without regression. We\nmust build on it.\nThe State of Bahrain views with deep concern the\nserious events that have taken place in the past few days as\na result of the policies of the present Israeli Government.\nThese are manifest in its perpetuation of the occupation and\nits refusal to honour the agreements made and to withdraw\nfrom occupied Arab territories in Palestine, the Syrian\nGolan Heights and southern Lebanon, as provided for in\nGeneral Assembly and Security Council resolutions, in\nparticular resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425\n(1978), as well as in the Madrid terms of reference,\nwhose underlying principle is \u201cland for peace\u201d.\nWe call upon the international community, in\nparticular the two sponsors of the peace process, and the\nStates of the European Community to persuade Israel to\nend its repressive practices against the Palestinian people\nand to resume negotiations on the final status of the\nPalestinian territories in accordance with the agreements\nconcluded between the two parties. They should also\nstress the necessity of resuming negotiations on the Syrian\nand Lebanese tracks. These negotiations should aim at\nachieving just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the\nregion and at insuring the attainment by the Palestinian\npeople of their legitimate rights. These include their right\nto establish their own independent State, with Jerusalem\nas its capital, and the complete withdrawal of Israel from\nall Arab territories, including the occupied Syrian Golan\nHeights up to the boundaries of 4 June 1967 and occupied\nsouthern Lebanon.\nWithout doubt, in violating the principles upon\nwhich the peace process is based, reneging on the\nagreements and commitments reached within the\nframework of this process and procrastinating in the\nimplementation thereof, Israel will drastically set back the\npeace process and lead the region back into a new cycle\nof tension and violence.\nIt is regrettable that Israel continues periodically to\nact repressively against the Palestinian people and\nrepeatedly to violate the sanctity of Islamic holy places.\nWe denounce the Israeli authorities\u2019 opening of a tunnel\nbeneath Islamic archaeological sites. This is calculated to\njudaize and efface the Islamic features of the occupied\nPalestinian territories. This act has caused indignation and\nanger in the occupied Palestinian territories in particular\nand in the Islamic world in general. It is a hostile act\ndirected against the holy Islamic sites and a provocation\nagainst the sentiments of Arabs and Muslims.\nIn condemning Israeli practices and repressive\nactions, which have resulted in scores of deaths and\nhundreds of injuries, we demand that Israel end these\npractices and forswear its plans to change the Arab and\nIslamic character of the city of Jerusalem or to violate the\nsanctity of the Holy Al-Aqsa Mosque. We call upon the\ninternational community to urge and pressure the Israeli\n0\n\n\nGovernment to renounce political policies of expansion and\nsettlement in Arab territories and to comply with the\nrequirements of peace and security in the region.\nWe consider the conclusion of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to be one of the most important\nissues in the field of disarmament. We look forward to the\nday when we can feel secure because all nuclear tests have\nbeen ended and all nuclear weapons eliminated. Bahrain\ntherefore signed the Treaty last week because it considers\nit a step in the right direction of eliminating these weapons.\nThe elimination of all weapons of mass destruction is\nbound to enhance confidence and security at both the\ninternational and regional levels. We have supported the\ninitiatives seeking to make the Middle East, including the\nArabian Gulf region, a zone free of nuclear weapons and\nweapons of mass destruction. Bahrain has done so in the\ndeep conviction that the security and stability of the region\nshould be maintained, that the region should be saved from\nthe calamity of these weapons of mass destruction and that\nthe States of the region should be able to implement\ndevelopment projects and raise the standard of living of\ntheir peoples. In this connection, I would like to applaud\nthe signing of the Pelindaba Treaty in Cairo on 11 April\n1996, which established Africa as a Nuclear-Weapon-Free\nZone.\nTerrorism in all forms is a global phenomenon whose\nthreat today is not confined to a particular people or region,\nbut endangers security and peace in numerous countries.\nBahrain has repeatedly denounced and deplored this\ndangerous phenomenon in more than one international\nforum. Its eradication requires cooperation and the\ncoordination of efforts. Bahrain now calls for concerted\nefforts for the implementation of the Declaration on\nMeasures to Eliminate International Terrorism, adopted at\nthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. It also\ncalls for cooperation in the identification of terrorist\nactivities, their prosecution, the adoption of deterrent\nmeasures and preventing terrorist organizations from using\nthe territories, information media and facilities available by\nvirtue of the respect given to civil liberties in certain\ncountries, in order to mount hostile activities against other\ncountries.\nThe State of Bahrain would like to express its\ngratitude and appreciation to the sisterly and friendly States\nthat lent their support at a time when it was the target of\nforeign-aided terrorist acts aimed at disturbing the security\nand stability enjoyed by our State and other Arabian Gulf\nStates. The events witnessed in the State of Bahrain and\nother States in the region and throughout the world\ndemonstrate the extent of the danger of terrorism and how\nfar the terrorist elements can go in manipulating laws and\ninternational human-rights principles to serve their own\nsubversive and terrorist ends.\nThe fighting in Somalia and Afghanistan has brought\ndevastation and destruction to the peoples of the two\ncountries. With a view to sparing the lives of innocent\npeople, we appeal anew to all parties to the conflict in\neach of the two Islamic countries to embark on a serious\ndialogue to reach a political settlement of their\ndifferences.\nWe welcome the outcome of the elections that took\nplace in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the framework of\nthe Peace Agreement signed in Paris as a result of\nnegotiations held in Dayton in 1995.\nWe support all efforts to restore peace and stability\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina, urge respect for the\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of that\ncountry and emphasize the necessity of economic\nreconstruction and rehabilitation as a means to buttress\nthe peace process.\nWith regard to the question of Cyprus, we call upon\nthe United Nations to continue its contacts with the\nparties concerned so that direct talks can be resumed with\na view to reaching a final settlement.\nThe question of the development and reform of the\nUnited Nations is in the forefront of issues that have\ncaptured the attention of Member States. Extensive\ndiscussions on this matter have taken place over the past\nfew years, especially in relation to the question of\nequitable representation on the Security Council. It is our\nview that the reform of the Security Council is not only\na matter of institutional dimensions and ramifications, but\nthat it also constitutes a challenge that the international\ncommunity should address thoughtfully.\nThe State of Bahrain has consistently supported the\nSecurity Council and its role in and contribution to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. It has\nalso joined the international community in the\nimplementation of resolutions relevant to international\nlegality and related commitments. Bahrain is the host\ncountry for the Field Office of the Special Commission\nestablished under Security Council resolution 687 (1991)\nand has provided the Office with all the facilities needed\nfor the successful performance of its duties. In this\n1\n\n\nrespect, the State of Bahrain wishes to recall with\nappreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the\nwork of the Organization, submitted to the General\nAssembly at its current session, in which he praises the\nsupport given by the Government of Bahrain to the\nactivities and work of the Office.\nSince it joined this Organization, the State of Bahrain\nhas always adhered to the principles and purposes of the\nCharter of the United Nations and therefore looks forward\nto playing a more active role in this regard. The nomination\nof Bahrain to Security Council membership for the period\n1998-1999 \u2014 which received the unanimous endorsement\nof the Group of Asian States, the League of Arab States\nand the Gulf Cooperation Council and the support of other\nMember States \u2014 is a confirmation of its standing as a\npeace-loving State and an indication that it wishes to play\na more active role in the maintenance of world peace and\nsecurity.\nThe characteristic distinction of the late twentieth\ncentury is that relations among nations are based on\ninterrelated, mutual and diverse interests in various political,\neconomic and social fields. This interrelatedness of interests\nhas formed a sort of common culture among nations and\nhas created a favourable climate for the exchange of ideas\nand the tools of knowledge, thus enabling cultural and\nintellectual interaction among peoples of the world and\nenhancing a deeper understanding of the bases of world\npeace and security, an objective which the United Nations\nhas sought to achieve over the past five decades.\nIn view of this fact, it behooves us to lend the\nOrganization support and encouragement so that it may be\nable to play its role in a civilized world and carry out its\nnoble tasks of ensuring the achievement of world security,\nprosperity and peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I am\nconvinced that your experience and your qualities as an\neminent diplomat will facilitate the proceedings and the\nsuccessful outcome of this session. I would like also to\nexpress our thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas\ndo Amaral of Portugal, for the able manner in which he\ndirected the previous session of the General Assembly.\nAllow me to take this opportunity to express our high\nappreciation for the remarkable activity carried out with\nsuch dedication since 1992 by the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to the benefit of the United\nNations.\nThe Assembly has gathered again not only to review\nrecent regional and world developments or to survey last\nyear\u2019s results, but also to discuss especially the prospects\nand challenges we are facing at the threshold of the\ntwenty-first century.\nWe are essentially called upon to reflect and act\njointly on establishing an international system that can\nguarantee security, stability, progress and prosperity for\nall. The United Nations is certainly the pillar of such a\nsystem. The conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty, which we have just signed, is proof of\nthis. We are among those who consider that we now have\na historic opportunity to insure world security and\nstability through the establishment of democratic\ninstitutions, sustainable development, respect for human\nrights and social justice. This requires better international\ncooperation and a new spirit of partnership among all\ncountries.\nRomania intends to contribute to this common effort\nthrough consolidation of its achievements in the building\nof a new democratic society based on the rule of law,\nrespect for human rights and a market economy, with a\nview to establishing itself as a stabilizing factor in the\nregion.\nIn referring to some of the significant events of the\npast year, I will recall that our macro-economic policy\nand the progress we have made in the establishment of\ninstitutions adapted to a market economy have led to a\nsteady improvement of economic performance. The\nprivate sector has become preponderant in our gross\ndomestic product. In order to overcome the difficulties of\n\n\ntransition and to prepare for integration into the European\nUnion, Romania has received substantial assistance from\nthe European Union and its members. The United States\nhas granted Romania permanent most favoured nation\nstatus. My country has become a full member of the\nCentral European Initiative and next year will become part\nof the Central European free trade agreement. The signing\nof a Treaty of Understanding, Cooperation and Good-\nNeighbourliness between Romania and Hungary was a\nsignificant event not only for our historic reconciliation, but\nalso for stability in Central Europe.\nI would also like to take note of my country\u2019s active\nparticipation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s\nPartnership for Peace programme and in the Implementation\nForces operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These\nstrengthen our belief that a favourable decision will be\ntaken on our integration into the Atlantic Alliance.\nAt the subregional level, Romania supported the\nmeasures aimed at the advancement of the Black Sea\nEconomic Cooperation and of the process of stability and\ngood-neighbourly relations in south-east Europe, which is\nalso the subject of initiatives by the European Union and\nthe United States. Aware of the importance of the\ndemocratization process, the Romanian Government has\ndecided to host the third International Conference on New\nor Restored Democracies in Bucharest in early September\n1997.\nAll these developments and initiatives testify to my\ncountry\u2019s willingness to act as a credible and responsible\npartner in international affairs and as a stabilizing factor\nand source of security in Europe and the world.\nOn the occasion of the commemorative meeting held\non the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the entry into\nforce of the Charter of United Nations, numerous heads of\nState \u2014 including the President of Romania \u2014 pointed out\nthat the Organization can and should play a greater role in\ninternational relations in order to respond more effectively\nto global challenges. It is becoming increasingly evident\nthat we are at a point in history when numerous problems\nhave to be reconsidered from a global perspective if we are\nto forge a common vision wherein the individual is the\nfocus of our policies. The main problem to be solved at the\ndawn of the third millennium is finding the appropriate\nsynthesis between the general aspiration to universality and\nthe individual aspiration to identity.\nThe series of major global conferences organized by\nthe United Nations over these past five years have led to a\nnew integrated concept of sustainable development\nfocused on the human being.\nNow that we are in the process of revitalizing,\nstrengthening and reforming the United Nations system,\nincluding a limited enlargement of the Security Council,\nwe consider it timely and useful to capitalize on these\nachievements. It would also be desirable to agree on an\nintegrated common vision of development and on a list of\npriorities that would inspire and guide the general process\nof renewal of the United Nations. By acting in this way,\nwe will be able to facilitate our current objective, as long\nas the working groups established by the General\nAssembly hasten their achievement of balanced and\nrealistic results.\nAlong with the other Member States, Romania also\nconsiders that the moment has come to proceed to an\nexpansion of the membership of the Security Council,\nboth in the category of permanent members \u2014 for which\nGermany and Japan are preeminently qualified by their\nimportance in international affairs \u2014 as in the category of\nnon-permanent members. This should be done through an\nagreed formula, based on proposals already put forward,\nsuch as the Italian, which represents a good basis for\nensuring that an increased number of States \u2014 including\nthose of central and eastern Europe \u2014 be represented in\nthe Council. In short, a special meeting of the General\nAssembly should be called on the results of the reform of\nthe United Nations system.\nHaving made these general remarks, I would like to\nmake a few comments on particular issues of our agenda.\nFirst, with regard to crisis and conflict management,\nit is clearly and primarily the responsibility of the parties\ndirectly involved to put an end to conflict and to restore\npeace and security. We underscore the importance we\nattach to dialogue as a means of reaching negotiated\nsolutions by the parties directly concerned.\nWe will contribute to the establishment of normal\nrelations and the full implementation of the Dayton\nAgreement among the countries of the former Yugoslavia,\nincluding the lifting of the sanctions against the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. We welcomed with interest the\ninitiatives on the economic reconstruction of the region\nand are fully prepared to take an active part in this\nprocess, including through joint cooperation projects with\nneighbouring countries.\nWe express our deep concern over the recent\nworrying developments in the Middle East peace process\n2\n\n\nwhich are the object of Security Council resolution 1073\n(1996). We welcome the United States initiative aimed at\nthe resumption of negotiations between the parties on the\nbasis of the principles agreed upon in Madrid and Oslo, as\nthey represent the only way to build a just and lasting\npeace. Romania recognizes the necessity of strengthening\nregional economic cooperation in support of the peace\nprocess in the Middle East and is actively involved in the\nmultilateral working groups.\nWe are still concerned about the ongoing, complex\nand uncertain situation in the eastern part of the Republic\nof Moldova and we reaffirm the necessity for an\nunconditional and orderly withdrawal of foreign troops from\nthe Transdniester region.\nWe accord due attention to all initiatives aimed at any\nprocess that could lead to a lasting peace in the Korean\npeninsula and in other regions of tension and conflict.\nAs the main guarantor of international peace and\nsecurity, the United Nations should participate more\nactively in the prevention and management of crises by\nemploying flexible peace instruments, including preventive\ndiplomacy and peace-keeping operations. The experience\ngained by contributing States \u2014 including Romania,\nparticularly as a result of its significant participation in the\nUnited Nations peace-keeping Mission in Angola \u2014\nhighlights the necessity of increasing rapid-reaction capacity\nby improving the standby system and other measures aimed\nat the rapid deployment of new peace-keeping operations\nand the efficient management of current ones.\nWith regard to sanctions, Romania, which has been\ndeeply affected by the strict implementation of economic\nsanctions, especially in the case of the former Yugoslavia,\nbelieves that the United Nations should play a larger role in\nthe process of compensating third countries so that the\nefficiency and credibility of Security Council actions in this\narea can be preserved.\nSecondly, I would like to make some comments in\nconnection with non-proliferation, arms control and\ndisarmament. As a party to the process since its inception,\nRomania welcomed with satisfaction the adoption of the\nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. This major step\nrepresents a crucial stage in the fulfilment of one of the\nmain objectives in the implementation of relevant\nobligations of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons. The establishment of nuclear-weapon-\nfree zones in South-East Asia, the Pacific and Africa is\naimed at the same objective.\nRomania will continue to contribute to the promotion\nof the review process of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, both before the next\nReview Conference in the year 2000, the preparatory\ncommittee of which will convene in 1997. We will also\ngive equal attention to the speedy commencement of\nnegotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile\nmaterials, as well as to the implementation of the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological)\nand Toxin Weapons and On Their Destruction and the\nestablishment of an efficient verification mechanism.\nWe again invite all States to consider establishing a\ncode of conduct for conventional arms transfers which\nwill increase transparency and confidence among States\nin that field.\nRomania supports all efforts leading to the total ban\nof anti-personnel mines. To this end, in 1995, the\nRomanian Government declared a moratorium, which will\nbe extended this year, and has begun the ratification\nprocedures of the additional Protocols to the Convention\non Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain\nConventional Weapons.\nMy third and last thought relates to the economic\nand social areas, where we believe there are good\nprospects for the adoption of the Agenda for\nDevelopment. Romania endorses the idea that the United\nNations can and should contribute to implementing a new\nglobal partnership for development among developing\ncountries, developed countries and multilateral\ninstitutions. We noted with interest the inclusion of this\nconcept in the economic communiqu\u00e9 adopted at the\nrecent Group of Seven summit meeting in Lyon, as well\nas the recognition of the fact that the new partnership\nshould be beneficial to all and based on a spirit of\nsolidarity that will distribute responsibility among all\npartners.\nWithin this framework, the United Nations and its\ninstitutions should pursue reform and adjustment efforts\nwith a view to improving their performance in the\nbuilding of consensus in the area of development. We\nwelcome the results of the ninth session of the United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development in\nMidrand as an essential step in its renewal. The session\npaved the way for the reform of its intergovernmental\nstructure, and the reorientation of its priorities in order to\ndevelop cooperation with the World Trade Organization\nand the Bretton Woods financial institutions. This will\n3\n\n\nlead to the integration of developing countries and countries\nin transition into the global commercial and financial\nsystem.\nWe also note the measures recently taken to strengthen\nthe Economic and Social Council\u2019s central role in\nestablishing and coordinating joint policies, as well as the\ninitiatives of the Economic Commission for Europe and\nother regional Commissions in redefining their priorities.\nThe Economic and Social Council has the\nresponsibility to ensure the follow-up to the major\ninternational conferences. We will work together in\npreparing the 1997 special session of the General Assembly\nin order to improve the implementation of agreements\nreached on environmental protection at the Rio Conference\nand at the Vienna regional conference on the review of the\nSocial Summit in Copenhagen. It is worth mentioning that\na subregional conference recently held in Bucharest\nprovided a useful evaluation of the implementation of the\nBeijing Platform for Action on the status of women in\nCentral and Eastern Europe.\nWe support the United Nations fight against the abuse\nof drugs and illicit drug trafficking, including all forms of\nrelated crimes. We intend to participate in the preparations\nof the 1998 special session of the General Assembly\ndevoted to this scourge.\nThe international community must also be mobilized\nto confront the rapid rise in transnational organized crime\nand terrorism. We encourage more active participation on\nthe part of the United Nations. In this respect, we welcome\nthe proposal put forward here last week by President\nKwasniewski of Poland.\nDevelopment assistance requires a new and better\nresponse from the international community in the promotion\nof our common objective of sustainable and socially\nequitable growth focused on the human being and on the\nprotection of the environment. Aid flows should be more\nefficient and directed towards the countries in real need.\nRomania maintains good cooperation with the United\nNations Development Programme and its resident\nrepresentative in Bucharest, other funds and development\nprogrammes \u2014 including the United Nations Population\nFund and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund \u2014 and with\nthe specialized agencies and the Bretton Woods institutions.\nWe insure that the assistance we receive is used for\nstructural reforms, and macroeconomic stabilization and that\nit likewise contributes to the creation of favourable\nconditions for the expansion of a dynamic and\ncompetitive private sector.\nFinally, I wish to reaffirm my country\u2019s deep\ncommitment to the universal nature of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, the promotion and observance of\nwhich represent a priority for the United Nations.\nIn view of this premise, the Romanian Government\ncondemns any form of discrimination and intolerance,\nespecially aggressive nationalism, and intends to\nguarantee the free and equal exercise of human rights,\nincluding the rights of women, children and persons\nbelonging to national minorities. We support the efforts\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights, as overall\ncoordinator of the specialized bodies within the United\nNations system in improving the efficiency of the Centre\nfor Human Rights.\nThe best guarantee for the observance of human\nrights lies in developing democracy. This component of\nthe \u201cdemocracy-development-peace\u201d triad brings me to a\nfinal reflection about the United Nations contribution to\nthe process of worldwide democratization. By convening\nin Bucharest, in September 1997, the third International\nConference on New or Restored Democracies, we wish to\ncontinue the dialogue and the sharing of experience in\nbuilding democratic societies by contributing the\nexperiences of Romania, a country in Central Europe that\nis reviving, irreversibly, its best democratic traditions after\nso many years of dictatorship.\nI wish to assure the Assembly that my country will\ndo its best, in concert with all interested countries, to\nenable the United Nations \u2014 the guarantor of peace and\ninternational legality \u2014 to respond more efficiently to the\nproblems we all share.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOne year ago,\nrepresentatives of Member States gathered in this hallowed\nHall and sang songs of praise in honour of the fiftieth\nanniversary of this venerable Organization. One year ago,\nwe faced the challenges of a changing international system\nand the dawn of the new millennium with courage and hope\nand in the belief that its noble ideals would guide the\nactions of States, great and small, in their relations with\ntheir fellow Members.\nBut now that the cheering and shouting have died and\nthe vivid memories of the fiftieth anniversary celebrations\nhave started to wane, small countries like ours, Saint Lucia,\nare forced to face the realities of survival \u2014 realities far\nharsher than what the bliss of that anniversary promised.\nIt will be difficult to forget the lofty principles\nexpounded during the anniversary or the excitement of\ncelebrating the historic liquidation of apartheid in South\nAfrica and the restoration of democracy in Haiti. But the\nspeeches of this Assembly had hardly faded, the lights of\nthis Hall hardly dimmed, when my country Saint Lucia\nand its sister islands of the Caribbean began to feel the\nfull blast of international hostility towards the\narrangements for the marketing of our main export\ncommodity, the banana, in the European Union,\narrangements which are enshrined in the treaty\nestablishing the Fourth Lom\u00e9 Convention between the\nEuropean Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific\nStates.\nThe reality of size and vulnerability always creates\nan awareness, a perception and a kind of resilience in\nsmall States that make them philosophical about adversity.\nConsequently, we will continue to support the high ideals\nof this institution, but today we must focus on the hard\noptions presented to us by the myopia of some large\ntrading nations.\nAt the historic fiftieth session of this Assembly,\nSaint Lucia took the opportunity to spell out to the\nnations of the world the very serious consequences which\nwould befall our small Caribbean economies if certain\ncountries pursued their intention to challenge the\nEuropean banana regime by invoking Section 301 action\nat the World Trade Organization (WTO). The United\nStates of America itself is now pursuing this action in\nresponse to an application by certain American\nmultinational companies involved in the trade, and other\nlarge banana-producing countries have followed their lead.\nThe battle is now fully engaged within the World\nTrade Organization, but the conditions of war are\nanything but equal and the playing field is anything but\neven. For example, at the behest of the complainants, the\nsmall countries of the Caribbean have been denied full\nparticipation in the hearings of the WTO panel, despite\nthe fact that we are the ones who will be most affected by\nthe WTO ruling, whatever that may be.\nThe diplomatic war being waged against the\nmarketing arrangements of our main export commodity in\nthe name of free trade emphasizes to small nations the\nmonumental insensitivity of some of those participating in\nthe process of globalization and trade liberalization now\nsweeping the international community. In a process that\nignores the special circumstances of the small and the\nvulnerable, nations like Saint Lucia and regions like the\nCaribbean can quickly become marginalized.\n6\n\n\nLet it be understood that we are not against the\nprocess of change in world trade, the globalization of the\nworld economy or the economic integration of continents,\na process currently under way. We do not wish to be\nLuddites in our view of the evolving international system\nand thus we welcome these directions. But, on behalf of the\npeoples whom we represent, on behalf of the peoples of all\nsmall States, we have the right to point out the dangers\nthese trends pose for small, developing economies if\ncompensating mechanisms are not put in place. We need to\ntell the world that these trends, these changes in\ninternational economic affairs, have not lessened the\nvulnerability of small developing States, but have in some\nrespects accentuated them. We need to remind this body\nthat, as the international community seeks to fashion a new\nglobal economic system, it is imperative that it not lose\nsight of the special needs of small States, particularly small\nisland developing countries.\nThe untrammelled pursuit of free trade for the sake of\nfree trade cannot be the guiding philosophy of our Member\nStates. Unbridled free trade which relegates some Member\nStates, and in particular those with small open economies,\nto the position of suffering spectators cannot be acceptable.\nIt is even less acceptable when we realize that some of the\nvery nations that are championing the case of unrestricted\ntrade liberalization do not themselves scrupulously observe\nthat philosophy. Some of them grant huge subsidies to their\nfarmers in order to allow them to continue in production,\nyet they complain that our small farmers are not efficient\nproducers.\nConsequently, it is incumbent on the international\ncommunity to make provisions for the special needs of\nsmall States in this rapidly changing international system.\nIn the creation of free-trade areas that span continents and\nintegrate hemispheres, there must be special provisions for\nthe very small economies of our countries, particularly in\nregions where there are small island developing States. In\nthat regard, we welcome the fact that, in the discussions on\nthe proposed free-trade area of the Americas, a working\ngroup on smaller economies has been established to\nfacilitate the participation of the small economies in that\nprocess.\nFor despite the changing features of the international\nsystem, the forces that threaten the existence of these States\nhave not altered. Small island States are still very\nvulnerable, for example, to natural disasters. Some of the\neconomies of our fellow Member States from the Caribbean\nhave yet to recover from the effects of the ravages of last\nyear\u2019s hurricanes. And in the island of Montserrat, we have\na classic example of the magnitude of the damage which\na natural disaster \u2014 in this case persistent volcanic\nactivity \u2014 can wreak on small island developing\neconomies.\nThe plight of that small Territory is an extreme but\ntragically powerful symbol of why the special needs of\nsmall island developing States cannot be ignored as the\ninternational community seeks to define new rules and\neconomic relationships for the next millennium. The\ninternational community and international economic\ninstitutions must therefore bear in mind that, while they\nhave categorized some of us as middle-income developing\ncountries and therefore as no longer requiring\nconcessionary aid flows, the economic indices utilized to\narrive at these classifications cannot mask the continuing\nreality of the vulnerability of these countries.\nWe will, however, continue within the severe\nlimitations of size and resources to diversify and\nrestructure our economies, to increase efficiency and\nproductivity and to adapt to the new realities. We will\nrely on the support of States Members of this\nOrganization in this regard.\nThere are other States in the Caribbean whose\nparticular situation also deserves the special attention of\nthis body. Saint Lucia once again urges the international\ncommunity to increase its technical, economic and\nfinancial assistance to Haiti to foster development and\nstability in that sister country of ours. The end of the\nUnited Nations Mission should not diminish international\ndevelopment support for Haiti. This is even more urgently\nneeded now to maintain and strengthen the gains achieved\nin the restoration of what is still a fledgling democracy\nand to enhance its fragile stability.\nAgain, Saint Lucia joins its Caribbean colleagues in\ncalling for an end to the economic blockade of Cuba.\nThree decades of denial have not achieved democracy.\nThe economic embargo against Cuba is a policy which\ncan hardly be called relevant in this era and it is therefore\ntime to try the more effective alternative of dialogue,\ndiscourse and openness.\nIn the wider international community, we are\nheartened by the new impetus given to the revitalization\nand development of Africa and encourage Member States\nto continue to support this initiative. But we are saddened\nby the persistence of ethnic disturbances in some areas of\nthat continent \u2014 ethnic troubles which only serve to\nimpede the very development process which Member\n7\n\n\nStates are trying to promote. We therefore urge the United\nNations and regional organizations in Africa to develop\nmechanisms for conciliation with regard to these conflicts.\nSaint Lucia also wishes to express its deep concern at\nthe recent revival of conflict in the Middle East. Is it not\ntime to end the anguish, to stop the pain? Is it not time to\nhalt the shedding of the blood of the ordinary people of\nthese lands? Is it not time to bring a permanent peace to a\nland that means so much to so much of mankind? But the\npath to true peace can only be through dialogue and\nconciliation and we urge all parties to return to this road,\nfor anything which is not built on that foundation will not\nstand.\nWhile Saint Lucia continues to promote the unification\nof China, we still hold the view that Taiwan should be\ngiven the opportunity to participate in and contribute to the\nwork of the United Nations. Taiwan is a vibrant and\ngrowing democracy, capable of meeting its obligations to\nthis institution. As a highly developed economy, Taiwan is\nalso capable of contributing to the growth of other smaller,\nless developed economies of the world. At a time when the\nPowers that have traditionally assisted the economic\ndevelopment of our countries have significantly reduced the\nlevel and quality of their support, new sources of assistance\nshould not be ignored. We are confident that this body can\nfind a creative mechanism through which Taiwan can be\ninvolved in the programmes of the Organization. That\ninvolvement in the work of the United Nations should in no\nway preclude unification.\nWe hope that this fifty-first session will not conclude\nwithout significant progress in correcting the inequitable\ncomposition of the Security Council. Saint Lucia will\ncontinue to work within our regional and other groups to\nachieve the goal of strengthening the relationship between\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council,\ninstitutionalizing the process of briefing and consultation\nand developing greater transparency and predictability.\nAs a small nation caught up in the dynamics of\nglobalization and trade liberalization, Saint Lucia looks\neagerly and hopefully to the principles and ideals of the\nUnited Nations to offer some comfort, some protection and\nsome measure of security in our uncertain entry into the\nnew century. All the indications that herald the approach of\nthis new age seem to tell us that small nations should find\ntheir path to development through the process of\nintegration.\nWe as a nation have a solid track record in\nattempting to forge deep and meaningful links between all\nStates members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean\nStates and the Caribbean Community. In both\norganizations, we continue to build viable mechanisms\nand institutions which will achieve a meaningful\nconsolidation of the various units of the Caribbean\nCommunity. We have progressed even further and\nparticipated in the launching of a brave initiative, the\nAssociation of Caribbean States. This Association ignores\nthe barriers of race, language and culture and seeks to\nunify all countries which border and are part of the\nCaribbean Sea.\nWe urge this Organization, through its various\nagencies, to continue to provide support for the regional\nintegration efforts of developing countries. On many\noccasions in the past, it has been the work of some of the\nUnited Nations agencies which has helped sustain some\nof these regional economic integration schemes and given\nthem the impetus to move forward. For its part, Saint\nLucia will continue to toil in the cause of the closer union\nof the peoples and States of the Caribbean because this is\nthe only logic for our survival. This is the path to the\nenhancement of the quality of life of our peoples.\nThe plight which our country faces as a result of the\nmanipulation of the European banana market regime and\nof the unconscionable pressures exerted by the activities\nof some States on that market, is desperate. We wish to\nremind the Assembly that we are relying on the principles\nand ideals of this body to stand firmly in the corner of the\nsmall and vulnerable and to frustrate the designs of some\nmultinational corporations which threaten our livelihood.\nWe reiterate our call to the United Nations to develop a\nframework of international review and regulations\nregarding the activities and policies of transnational\ncorporations, which are assuming leviathan proportions in\nworld trade.\nI commend you, Sir, on your elevation to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at fifty-first session\nand pledge Saint Lucia\u2019s support for the successful\nexecution of your enormous responsibilities. My country\nalso pledges with customary diligence to assist the United\nNations in implementing the goals of the Charter and\nfostering the spirit of freedom and independence which\nthe fiftieth anniversary year of the Organization\nemphasized. Our small size will not be a deterrent in our\npursuit of democracy and peace.\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLike\nthe speakers who have preceded me at this rostrum, I wish\nto extend to you, Sir, the warm and sincere congratulations\nof the delegation of Benin to the President on his\nunanimous selection to preside over the work of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. This choice\nconstitutes clear recognition of his exceptional personal\nqualities and his wealth of experience as a seasoned\ndiplomat, and it is a collective tribute to his beautiful\ncountry, Malaysia, whose dynamism and outstanding\neconomic success over the past few years I salute. From the\nrostrum of this Assembly, I should like to make a\ncontribution to this important session by expressing a\nmessage of peace, solidarity, faith and hope from the\npeople and the Government of Benin.\nA year ago, in this very Hall, in commemoration of its\nfiftieth anniversary, the United Nations hosted the greatest\ngathering of Heads of State in history. In this setting they\ncarried out a critical, objective and unsparing assessment of\nthe 50 years of the Organization\u2019s existence, a period\nduring which international cooperation made it possible to\nachieve significant progress on each of the principles\nenshrined in the Charter. In the Declaration they adopted,\nthe Heads of State and Government solemnly reaffirmed\ntheir dedication to the great ideals of peace, development\nand democracy inscribed in the founding texts of the\nOrganization.\nGiven this commitment by world leaders on the\nthreshold of a new millennium, the imperative of peace\nmust, more than ever, remain the ultimate goal of the\ninternational community as a whole. This is all the more\nurgent because, despite the end of the cold war, the peace\nand security of nations seem far from being fully assured.\nIndeed, in many respects, on the political and security\nlevel the international situation remains worrying,\nespecially on the African continent, where the course of\nhistory too often bears the imprint of tragic events to\nwhich the international community cannot remain\nindifferent.\nThe resurgence of conflicts which, for the most part,\nno longer take place between States but within nations, is\na challenge for which the Organization must adopt new\nmethods and machinery for intervention and settlement.\nThis means, therefore, that to be able to promote\nharmonious relations among the peoples of the world and\nto guarantee a lasting peace, our shared Organization\nmust strengthen its capabilities and its means in conflict\nprevention, peacekeeping and the consolidation of peace.\nIt cannot be stressed enough that, despite the difficulties,\ninadequacies and gaps that reduce or restrict the scope\nand effectiveness of its actions, the United Nations\nrepresents, embodies and remains \u2014 today and, doubtless,\nfor a long time to come \u2014 the body that can best express\nand bring to a successful conclusion the will of Member\nStates to work for the consolidation of peace and the\npursuit of economic and social progress.\nDespite the new international situation that promotes\nless aggressive, less suspicious and less tense relations\nbetween States, the political instability that continues to\nexist in certain parts of Africa, and the conflicts that\ndevelop there, have become significant barriers to the\neconomic recovery and social cohesion of the continent.\nIn this context, I wish to refer to the very worrying\nsituation in Burundi, where the unjust system of socio-\nethnic relations, military intransigence and political\nintolerance pointlessly prolong the suffering and division\nof a people. It is deplorable that on 25 July 1996 a\n13\n\n\nmilitary coup ended, by force, Burundi\u2019s constitutional,\ndemocratic and legal institutions.\nMy country, Benin, welcomes the strong and\ncourageous reaction of the countries of the subregion and\nencourages their efforts for a peaceful, just and lasting\nsettlement of the crisis in Burundi.\nBenin supports the efforts of the Heads of State of\ncountries of the Great Lakes region and of the Organization\nof African Unity to make the new authorities in Burundi\nquickly embark on negotiations and abide by decisions\nwhich should result from constructive and sound concerted\naction on the part of the healthy forces of this battered\npeople. The various protagonists must understand that only\na new political agreement, based on ordinary common\nsense, with respect for the intangible principles of\ndemocracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms, will\ncontribute to an acceptable solution to all.\nRegarding the situation in Liberia, the summit meeting\nof the Committee of Nine on Liberia of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), held on 17\nAugust 1996, took important decisions to extend the Abuja\nAgreements of 1995, which are rightly considered to be the\nappropriate legal framework for a definitive settlement of\nthe conflict. This last Abuja summit also drew up a new\ntimetable for the implementation of the peace process, and\ndefined the modalities and stages to lead to democratic\nelections. Benin urgently demands that the Liberian factions\ntake advantage of this last opportunity and strictly abide by\nthe Abuja decisions, in order to speed up the return of their\ncountry to normality.\nMy country also invites the international community\nto support the efforts of ECOWAS by stepping up its\nfinancial and logistical assistance for the successful\nimplementation of the Abuja decisions.\nThe most important thing for a nation in crisis is the\nsearch for compromise to settle internal contradictions, no\nmatter how serious they are. This truth has been tried and\ntested elsewhere, in Mozambique for example, and\nrecently in Angola, the results of which we note with\nsatisfaction. Hence the appeal which I am renewing here,\nbefore this Assembly, for sincere dialogue in Rwanda,\nSomalia, the Sudan, Sierra Leone, the Middle East \u2014 in\na word, wherever passions continue at the end of the\ntwentieth century to cloud reason and block the genuine\nstruggle for development and democracy.\nEveryone agrees that peace, if it is to be genuine and\nlasting, must be based on general and complete\ndisarmament under international control. Here, I should\nlike to say how gratified Benin is at the signature of the\nPelindaba Treaty for the establishment of an African\nnuclear-weapon-free zone.\nThe Review and Extension Conference of the Parties\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT), held from 17 April to 12 May 1995,\ndecided to renew the Treaty indefinitely, thus opening the\nway to better prospects in the area of nuclear\ndisarmament. Benin, which has worked for this, believes\nin the strengthening of the provisions of the Treaty, in\nparticular regarding the verification regime, in order to\nmake it a genuine international instrument for effective\nnuclear disarmament and a solid basis for more fruitful\ninternational cooperation in the area of the use of nuclear\ntechnology for peaceful purposes.\nWhile the commitment to non-proliferation and\ndisarmament has been gaining ground throughout the\nglobe, the resumption or continuation of nuclear tests\npainfully reminded us of the dangers and horrors which\nhaunted the collective psyche of nations during the cold-\nwar period. This is why Benin can only welcome the\npositive decision taken by France and recently by the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China to put an end to their nuclear\ntesting programmes.\nThe signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty during the present session will most certainly mark\na major stage in the achievement of an objective which is\ndecisive, even vital, for the international community: that\nof disarmament and non-proliferation.\nAs we can read in the Declaration on the Occasion\nof the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations,\n14\n\n\n\u201caction to ensure peace, security and stability in the\nworld will be futile unless the economic and social\nneeds of people are addressed.\u201d (resolution 50/6, para.\n1)\nThis means that peace comes to nothing if the imperative\nof development is not guaranteed. Here, it is important to\nemphasize that many countries in Africa have made\nconsiderable progress in the key areas of protecting mothers\nand their children, of health, of nutrition and of education,\nbut, from one end of the continent to the other, gains\ncontinue to be drastically limited as a result of endemic\npoverty and economic regression.\nRecent developments in the global economy and the\nserious obstacles encountered by the efforts of the\ndeveloping countries, particularly the least-developed\ncountries, are a cause of profound concern for us as\nAfricans.\nThe accelerated globalization of the rules and practices\nof the system of market economies has led to the\nemergence of a new economic order within which Africa,\nfor the most part, remains marginalized. The agreements of\nthe Uruguay Round concluded in 1994, the rapid\nredefinition of economic groupings in the developed\ncountries, and the ever more important role of private\ncapital in the world economy, have created a new\ninternational environment in which the interests of Africa\ndo not seem to have been taken into account, or in which\nthey are even threatened or compromised.\nWhile it is true that socio-economic development in\nAfrica is first of all the responsibility of the peoples and\nGovernments of the African countries themselves, it none\nthe less remains true that the international community, in\nparticular its most developed and industrialized members,\nmust do their part, a part commensurate with their true\nmeans, in the development process of a continent involved\nin a dual economic and political transition.\nAt a time when one has reason to fear the resurgence\nof national selfishness, the temptations of protectionism and\nof isolationism, the international community should provide\na clear response, a concrete solution that can be rapidly\napplied to the problems experienced by the developing\nworld, in particular Africa. These well-known problems\ninclude the burden of foreign debt, the alarming reduction\nin capital flows, the trend toward a decline in official\ndevelopment assistance, the weak rate of investment, the\ncontinued imbalance in the terms of trade \u2014 despite the\ndevaluation of the CFA Franc in January 1994 \u2014\nprotectionism on export markets, continued weak\ncommodities prices, and so on.\nWe have every right to be pleased that over the last\nfive years, the struggle to eradicate poverty has been a\nprominent issue in negotiations and the drafting of\ndeclarations and programmes of action adopted by\nsummits and conferences organized under the auspices of\nthe United Nations.\nAs we approach the end of the International Year for\nthe Eradication of Poverty and the beginning next year,\n1997, of the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of\nPoverty, new national and international efforts must be\nmade to mobilize the vast resources needed to eliminate\npoverty.\nIn addition, as the decisions and recommendations of\nthe Second United Nations Conference on Human\nSettlements (Habitat II) are implemented, they will be\ntangible assets for present and future generations in the\nprocess of building a more human and better society\nthrough exercise of the right to adequate housing for all.\nEnvironmental protection is essential if we are to\npromote sustainable development. Faced with the threat\nto mankind posed by the rise in sea levels, global\nwarming, creeping desertification and the disappearance\nof biological diversity, Benin attaches the utmost\nimportance to implementation of all the agreements\nreached in Rio and, here, renews its commitment to doing\nall it can to ensure the success of the special session of\nthe General Assembly planned for June 1997 to\nstrengthen implementation of the decisions and\nrecommendations of the Earth Summit contained in\nAgenda 21. In accordance with the commitments made at\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment in June 1992 in Rio, by the end of the year\nBenin will have adopted its own national Agenda 21 and,\nat the same time, will begin drawing up local\nAgendas 21.\nIn the context of the effective implementation of the\nprovisions of the United Nations Convention to Control\nDesertification in those Countries Experiencing Serious\nDrought and/or Desertification, particularly in Africa, the\nGovernment of Benin held a national forum from 20 to\n22 August 1996 which was the starting point for the\nprocess of drawing up its national programme of action to\ncombat desertification through a partnership of\nGovernment, local populations, non-governmental\n15\n\n\norganizations, development associations, the private sector\nand development partners.\nI should like to take this opportunity to thank the\ninterim secretariat of the Convention and, above all, the\nGovernment of Germany and the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, whose technical and financial\nsupport proved decisive in the holding of this successful\nforum.\nIt is regrettable that five years after it was launched,\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\nAfrica in the 1990s has not had the expected impact on the\ndevelopment of Africa even though the priorities our States\nopted for were largely in line with its objectives, including\nin the area of democratic and macroeconomic reforms.\nThis is why Benin welcomes the launching by the\nSecretary-General on 15 March 1996 of the United Nations\nSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa, an initiative that\ncomplements the New Agenda and provides it with new\nimpetus. I should like here to reaffirm Benin\u2019s adherence to\nthis Initiative whose objectives fit perfectly with those of\nour national development plans. Implementation of the\npriority actions of the Initiative require the mobilization of\nAfricans themselves, bodies of the United Nations system\nand Africa\u2019s development partners to ensure ambitious,\nconcerted and coordinated action designed to lead to\ntangible results in Africa.\nWe applaud the initiatives of the United Nations\nsystem which has long been working for the development\nof Africa, as well as the actions of all partners for the\ndevelopment of Africa, including France and Japan, which\nhave made the development and economic recovery of\nAfrica a priority.\nWe appeal to all Member States diligently to\nimplement the results of the mid-term review of United\nNations New Agenda in order to accelerate the process of\nstrengthening the effective integration of Africa into the\ninternational trading system, help Africa diversify its\neconomy and encourage direct foreign investment.\nAlong the same lines, The Agenda for Development,\nwhich Benin actively helped to draft, should be effectively\nimplemented to achieve the development objectives of\ndeveloping countries, the least-developed countries in\nparticular.\nMassive and persistent human rights violations are\ntoday both source and consequence of ethnic, racial and\nreligious tensions which continue to persist in certain\nparts of the globe, particularly on our continent, Africa.\nThe Government of Benin considers that all States,\nwhatever their political system, their economic level and\ntheir culture, have a duty to promote, protect and respect\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. In this regard,\nBenin reaffirms its deep commitment to respect for\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, whose\npromotion and protection are a legitimate concern of the\ninternational community.\nFor our part, we in Benin have continued to strive to\nconsolidate our new democratic experience which has\nbeen in place since the historic National Conference of\nActive Forces of the Nation in February 1990.\nI know that all members have been following with\ninterest, and are well informed about, the deep-seated\nqualitative changes in the political life of Benin and I\nwish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank\neveryone for the genuine interest with which they have\nfollowed our major political event: the recent presidential\nelection in March 1996, in which we could see a peaceful\nand orderly democratic transfer of power, without\nviolence or bloodshed, which was totally in keeping with\nthe rule of constitutional law in force since December\n1990. The generally correct and normal conduct of the\nballot, the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of our\npolitical classes, the courageous and responsible attitude\nof the people of Benin and the unwavering stance taken\ncontinually by the Constitutional Court are all signs which\ndemonstrate genuine political maturity and an irrevocable\ncommitment to building a truly democratic society in the\nRepublic of Benin.\nTo complete its programme of building a State based\non the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all\ncitizens of Benin would enjoy a certain minimum\nstandard of living, the Government of Benin wishes to\nbenefit further from the support and assistance of the\nentire international community. We are well aware of the\nfact that merely going through the motions of an election\nis not enough to install and guarantee lasting democracy\nin a country.\nFor democracy to have real meaning and for a\npeople to fully enjoy the freedom and salvation it brings,\nit must be expressed both on the national and\ninternational levels. This means that democracy must\nalso underlie and govern the organization and conduct of\ninternational relations. The world, so long divided by\nEast-West antagonism and by North-South imbalances,\n16\n\n\ncan and must conceive and implement new, democratic\nrelations among States. Here it is no exaggeration to say\nthat the renewal of the United Nations begun thanks to the\ncourageous, tenacious and fruitful actions of Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali must be resolutely sustained and developed\nto guarantee the conditions necessary for the harmonious\npursuit of the process of democratization in international\nsociety on the eve of the twenty-first century. The\ndelegation of Benin is convinced that our present\ndeliberations on all issues of reform of the Organization\nwill be guided by our shared determination to take\nconcerted, specific and realistic measures which, better than\nin the past, respond to the great stakes and challenges\nemerging on the horizon of the twenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMinister for Foreign Affairs\nLet me begin, Sir, by\nextending to you my heartfelt congratulations on your\nelection to the high office of President of the fifty-first\nsession of the General Assembly. Malawi holds you and\nyour great country, Malaysia, in very high esteem. Your\nelection to preside over this important session, soon after\nthe special commemorative session, surely demonstrates\nthe confidence that the international community as a\nwhole has in you and your country. I have no doubt that\nyou will guide the deliberations of the Assembly to a\nsuccessful conclusion.\nLet me also pay tribute to your predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, for\n3\n\n\nthe very skilful manner in which he conducted the\ndeliberations of the fiftieth session. As we all know, the\nearlier part of that session coincided with the\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, an occasion which attracted an unprecedented\ngathering of world leaders as well as other high-level\nrepresentatives. In spite of the demands which the\nceremony imposed on the Organization, Mr. do Amaral met\nthe challenge with admirable tact and tenacity. To him we\nwish to say \u201cwell done\u201d for a job brilliantly executed.\nThe fiftieth session of the General Assembly was a\nmilestone in the life of the United Nations. It not only\nsymbolized the coming of age of the Organization but gave\ndelegations an opportunity for serious reflection and\nappraisal of the various aspects of the Organization and its\noperations. It was therefore not surprising to us that reform\nwas, and continues to be, the main theme of the\ndeliberations.\nMy delegation is pleased to note that reform of the\nOrganization is being pursued with vigour and a renewed\nsense of direction. Indeed, we cannot wish away the\ninspiring words of wisdom that came out of the statements\nof the world leaders who addressed the Assembly during\nthe Special Commemorative Meeting. The United Nations\nneeds to be strengthened for it to respond fully to the many\npolitical and economic challenges that face the world today.\nWe all agree that now is the time for the Security\nCouncil to be democratized in such a way that its\ncomposition corresponds equitably with the increase in the\nmembership of the Organization. Its working methods and\nprocedures also need to be enhanced in order to bring about\nmore transparency and accountability. The continuing\ndebate on this subject has clearly revealed to us the\nessential issues to be dealt with. We are encouraged by\nwhat seems to be an emerging spirit of accommodation on\nthe subject. It is our sincere hope that the hurdles that\nremain ahead will be surmounted in the same spirit of give\nand take. More significantly, it is necessary to bear in mind\nthat while the relevant Working Group is open-ended in\nspace, it is not open-ended in time. The sense of urgency\nwith which world leaders addressed the question of reform\nduring the commemorative ceremony demands that work on\nthis matter move forward resolutely.\nEven the most reformed United Nations cannot\nperform without the necessary resources. It is no secret that\nthe operations of the Organization have in recent years been\nhampered by financial constraints. We are encouraged by\nthe progress so far achieved in the High-level Open-ended\nWorking Group on the Financial Situation of the United\nNations. We, however, would have liked more sustained,\naction-oriented progress so that we could put to rest a\nmatter which has greater implications, including for the\nmorale of the staff of the Organization. We trust that the\ndeliberations will continue to address the issues in an\nopen and transparent manner. At the same time, it is our\nsincere hope that Member States will continue to honour\ntheir existing obligations without introducing linkages.\nTwo years ago, the President of the Republic of\nMalawi, His Excellency Mr. Bakili Muluzi, stood here at\nthis very rostrum to herald the dawning of a new era in\nMalawi on 17 June 1994, when Malawians ushered in\ntheir first democratically elected Government after 30\nyears of dictatorship. It is common knowledge that the\nnew Government inherited a multitude of problems with\ndebilitating consequences for the socio-economic\ndevelopment and welfare of the Malawian people.\nUndaunted by these enormous challenges, the new\nGovernment, soon after assuming power, put into place\npolicies with the overall aim of reducing poverty and\nimproving education and social services, particularly\namong people living in rural areas. Two and a half years\non, the wide-ranging economic and structural reforms that\nthe Government embarked upon are increasingly yielding\npositive results. General economic activity is expanding\nat a remarkable pace, inflation is coming down steadily,\npublic finances are in the process of being restored to\nsustainable levels, and the situation of the balance of\npayments and foreign reserves continues to improve, thus\ngradually restoring confidence in the economy.\nMost significantly, the liberalization of markets and\nrelative prices in commodities have increased work and\nproduction incentives and opened opportunities for many\nMalawians. We remain committed to removing the few\nremaining rigidities in the economy, which in the past\nhave tended to cause discrimination against the common\nman in the village. The opening up of the economy and\nthe expansion of opportunities for all will continue to\nguide us in pursuing our economic agenda. We are,\nhowever, the first to realize that there are many stumbling\nblocks ahead.\nMalawi is a very small country, and is landlocked.\nLike other countries, we too have our own vision of a\nbetter and more prosperous Malawi. Through our own\n2020 Programme, we hope to solicit the views of the\nvarious sectors of the national populace and chart the\ndirection of the country\u2019s development to the year 2020.\n4\n\n\nSo far, the public has shown considerable enthusiasm in the\nongoing consultations, in the same way that they\nparticipated in the political transformation of the country\ntwo years ago. It is our desire and commitment to control\nour economic destiny. The level of expectation created by\nthe democratic dispensation needs to be matched by\neconomic empowerment and social development. To have\nit otherwise would be to compromise democracy.\nThe Government and the people of Malawi appreciate\nand are thankful for the assistance which the international\ncommunity is rendering our country. We are hopeful that\nthe international community will continue to help Malawi\nrealize its dreams and its vision. We call upon our\ndevelopment partners to continue to augment the assistance\nthat they are currently extending to the people of Malawi.\nWe also wish to appeal to our cooperating partners to come\nand invest in our country. The economic and investment\nclimate is now more conducive than ever before.\nMalawi has welcomed with enthusiasm the launching\nby the international community of programmes which aim\nat encouraging development in Africa. For the past few\nyears, hope in the continent was fanned by the adoption of\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\nAfrica in the 1990s. The much talked about diversification\nof the economies of African States was warmly received as\na move which would strengthen the predominantly primary\nraw material-producing basis of the countries\u2019 economies.\nIt is sad to note that the financial resources required for the\nprogramme have not matched the enthusiasm that revolved\naround the launching of the New Agenda. My delegation\nsincerely hopes that the mid-term review of the Agenda,\nwhich has just concluded, will reignite the enthusiasm of us\nall and enhance the political will of all the cooperating\npartners.\nMore recently, my Government welcomed the\nlaunching by the Secretary-General of the United Nations\nSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa. Malawi is\nparticularly pleased with the innovative nature of the\nInitiative. The conferring of the leadership of the\nprogramme on the Africans themselves only confirms what\nwe have always desired to see happen. In addition, the\nspecificity of the objectives sought under the Initiative is a\nmove in the right direction. We commend the international\ncommunity for this programme and call upon the lead\ninstitutions not to waver at the implementation stage. For\nour part, we stand ready to cooperate fully with the other\nimplementing partners, and so far that is precisely what we\nare doing.\nMalawi is following with interest the current work\non the elaboration of an Agenda for Development. My\ndelegation notes that the basic guidelines for an Agenda\nfor Development are well known and have already been\nnegotiated and agreed upon in the various United Nations\nconferences and summits. What remains is essentially the\nimplementation of the action plans in a more integrated\nand innovative way, entailing political commitment by all\nactive members of the international community. We look\nforward to an early conclusion of an Agenda for\nDevelopment. We in Malawi see all these initiatives as\ncomplementary to our own ongoing efforts to improve the\nwell-being of our people.\nMalawi notes with satisfaction the important role\nthat the United Nations plays in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security in various parts of the\nworld. We welcome the steady progress which has been\nachieved in Angola and hail the Government for\nhonouring its commitments. At the same time, we wish to\nappeal to the leadership of the National Union for the\nTotal Independence of Angola (UNITA) to adhere to the\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol and related\nagreements. We have always maintained that peace in\nAngola will be beneficial not only to the people of\nAngola, a people tired of war, but also to our southern\nAfrican subcontinent as a whole.\nMy Government remains disturbed by the recent\ndevelopments in Burundi. The July 1996 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat was\na major setback to the democratic process, and we\nsupport the position taken by the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) and the countries of the Great Lakes region.\nWe denounce the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Malawi does not condone\nany takeover of power by any party through\nunconstitutional means. Quite frankly, we in Africa are\nsick and tired of this \u201cdisease\u201d. We want the ballot box\nto be the referee in African politics, once and for all.\nCoups d\u2019\u00e9tats have contributed negatively to the fame of\nour otherwise rich and beautiful continent. We remain\nconvinced that the Arusha process is the only credible\nway of bringing about peace in Burundi. We therefore\ncall upon the military rulers in Burundi to pave the way\nfor the resumption of the Arusha peace negotiations.\nThe installation in August 1996 of an interim\nGovernment in Liberia led by Mrs. Ruth Perry gives us\nall hope that the warring factions have chosen the way of\npeace and reconciliation after years of the senseless\nkilling of innocent civilians. Malawi commends the\nleadership of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) for having successfully brokered the\n5\n\n\npeace plan among the warring factions. We reaffirm our\nfaith in the Abuja Agreement and express the hope that the\nimplementation schedule agreed upon recently will lead to\nsuccessful elections next year. We call upon the\ninternational community to closely monitor developments\nand assist the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in\nthe noble work that it is carrying out in Liberia.\nThere remains cause for genuine concern over\ndevelopments in Western Sahara. My Government has\nnoted that for a long time now, progress has stalled over\nthe identification of eligible voters in the referendum. The\nrepeated extension of the mandate of the United Nations\nMission for the Referendum in Western Sahara\n(MINURSO) is a show of commitment by the international\ncommunity which should not be taken for granted. Malawi\ntherefore calls upon the principal players in the process to\nshow some flexibility so that an amicable solution to the\ncurrent impasse can be reached.\nDevelopments in countries of the former Yugoslavia\nhave recently been encouraging. The cessation of hostilities\nin the Balkans under the Dayton Peace Agreement signed\nearly this year and the recent elections have generated\nconsiderable hope within the international community. It is\nthe hope of my Government that no reckless moves will be\ntaken which could jeopardize the existing momentum\ntowards stability.\nDuring the past few years considerable progress\ntowards a comprehensive peace settlement has been made\nin the Middle East. We have in the past expressed support\nfor the peace initiative which, since its birth at Madrid on\n30 October 1991, has grown steadily and has given rise to\nimportant agreements between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO). We remain convinced that\nthe path that was started in Madrid is the way forward. We\ntherefore urge all the parties concerned to abide by their\nprevious commitments and move forward to achieve the\naspirations of the people of the region and the world. The\nrecent disturbing developments only show how thin the\ndividing line is between peace and violence.\nThe international community has recently been\nreminded, through violent clashes, of the volatile situation\nthat exists in divided Cyprus. The division, which arose\nover two decades ago, remains a constant reminder that the\ninternational community has yet to boldly tackle the\nsituation there. My Government hopes that the issue of\nCyprus will be pursued with commitment by both the\nmediators and the parties concerned.\nIt is the wish of my Government that the long-\nstanding question of the international status of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan will be peacefully resolved\nin a manner acceptable to the Governments on both sides\nof the Taiwan Strait. We are encouraged by the recent\nreported indications that the two sides are ready to talk to\neach other. However, the Malawi Government wishes to\nreaffirm its commitment to the promotion of freedom,\nhuman rights and democratic principles and therefore\nsupports the aspirations of the more than 21 million\nTaiwanese people to recognition and full participation in\nall the activities of the international community.\nWe and our prestigious Organization should be\npreventing and resolving conflicts. We should not sit by\nas confrontation builds. Instead, we should find the time\nto initiate dialogue and lasting solutions, and not always\nhave to wake up and respond to emergencies. The\nbenchmark should not always be to please the stronger; it\nshould also be to support the weak and vulnerable and\nthose under stress. But apart from our trade interests, our\nmoral obligation must be renewed every day.\nLet me conclude by reaffirming our faith in the\nUnited Nations. We believe the United Nations has a vital\nrole to play in the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. Many areas of tension remain the world over.\nWe urge the United Nations to act more resolutely in\ndealing with these many troubled areas. The United\nNations has made and continues to make a difference in\nthe lives of millions of people in many countries,\nincluding my own, Malawi, in many areas of human\nendeavour. We have no doubt that a reformed United\nNations will contribute more to making the world a better\nplace to live. We are confident, Sir, that under your\nstewardship of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly, we, the peoples of the United Nations, will\nhave taken another bold step towards a revitalized and\nreformed United Nations, a United Nations capable of\nfully responding to the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury. Our prayer is, let us boldly resolve and go\nforward together to the next millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffVirtue constitutes the greatest\nform of human strength. Indeed, the very origin of the word\n\u201cvirtue\u201d connotes manly strength \u2014 not merely physical\nstrength, but moral strength. With respect to human\ninteraction, it is a widely acknowledged truth that the\ngreatest form of power arises when virtue is furnished with\nmeans. That is the concept that gave birth to the United\nNations, inspired its noble deeds, and generally continues\nto inform its operations. Accordingly, our celebration last\nyear of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations was\nquintessentially a collective expression of rejoicing in the\nwisdom embodied in that powerful truth, as well as an\nexplicit, joint recommitment on the part of Member nations\nto act in accordance with the principle of empowerment of\nvirtue, through the supply of appropriate means.\nIn this context it is, for me, a great honour to be\nafforded the opportunity to address this very distinguished\ngathering of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly.\nThis event is easily the most important in the world\ncalendar, as far as political deliberations are concerned.\nMy delegation conveys to this Assembly the greetings\nof the Government and the people of Grenada, and\ncongratulates His Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail of Malaysia\non his election to the presidency of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-first session. We were particularly impressed\nwith the way in which Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of\nPortugal conducted the affairs of the General Assembly at\nits fiftieth session, and take this opportunity to thank him\nfor his handling of those proceedings.\nMy delegation further expresses appreciation and\nthanks to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his vision and willingness\nto confront the many challenges that the Organization has\nrecently been facing and, specifically for his dedication in\nseeking to solve world problems in the socio-economic and\npolitical spheres.\nThis new session of the General Assembly is being\nheld against the background of a continually changing\nglobal environment. That notwithstanding, there exists, on\nthe one hand, a spirit of international cooperation and, on\nthe other, a high degree of convergence of several ideals,\nsuch as the institution and strengthening of democracy,\npromoting and fostering economic integration and political\nharmony, and the pursuit and practice of a new\nmultilateralism. Yet it must be expressly stated that the\nnoble goal of achieving global democracy, peace and\nprosperity can be realized only with significant inputs\nfrom the developed countries acting in collaboration with\nthe disadvantaged ones.\nCurrently, many of the small developing countries\nthat are Members of this Organization are faced with\nsevere economic problems. It cannot be overemphasized\nthat measures aimed at stabilizing their economies and\ncreating the conditions for sustained growth and\ndevelopment have very painful effects on the populace.\nNonetheless, these effects can be made more bearable,\nand it behoves us to point specifically to the human\ndimension in this regard.\nSince June 1995, the new Administration in Grenada\nhas focused on strengthening our democratic institutions\nand on rebuilding our economy. My Government has been\ndeveloping strategies, mechanisms and procedures to\nincrease transparency and accountability in the conduct of\nGovernment. Moreover, my Government has pledged\nitself to respect the fundamental rights of all citizens as\nwell as to other elements of civil society, such as a free\npress, freedom of expression, a fair and open democratic\nprocess, the supremacy under God of our Constitution and\nthe effective functioning of the parliamentary system, for\nwhich our Constitution specifically and explicitly\nprovides.\nEconomically, our domestic policies are aimed\nprimarily at encouraging individuals and businesses to\nmaximize the return on their enterprise and efforts. We\nhave embraced the notion that promoting micro-\nenterprises is one of the ways to accomplish this goal.\nOnly recently, we initiated a micro-enterprise programme,\nwith the provision of a modest sum to help young\nentrepreneurs in particular to embark upon their several\nventures. We hope that the programme will succeed,\nthereby contributing to our overall economic development,\nboth materially and psycho-culturally. Such preferential\ntreatment is being given to the young so as to better\nfashion a culture of confidence, thoughtful creativity and\npurposeful enterprise. We are actively seeking also to\nenhance opportunities to enable our working population\nto attain higher standards of living.\nMy Government has set itself specific goals\nincluding balanced and integrated sectoral growth, a\nrelevant and adaptive education system, health for all, and\nstrategic human resource planning and development. In\n10\n\n\nthis latter respect, priority is being placed on the\ndevelopment of an adequately skilled and disciplined work\nforce.\nWhile we are aware that the matter of economic and\nindividual personal development is first and foremost a\nnational responsibility, we are deeply conscious that our\nlimited domestic resources constitute a severe constraint\nupon us in our quest to fulfil this obligation.\nAccordingly, we earnestly ask \u2014 indeed we urge \u2014\nthe many United Nations agencies involved in such\nactivities, and also individual Governments, to continue to\nprovide to us and to others in the same position the kind of\nhelp that is needed to meet satisfactorily growing demand\nfor the spectrum of expertise vital to our national\ndevelopment.\nThe grim realities of the very limited resources of very\nsmall countries are well known. Nonetheless, these realities\nhave become more glaring in this era of trade liberalization\nand the globalization of production.\nBoth of these phenomena, as conceived and elaborated\nby the developed countries, are startling reminders to us not\nonly of our condition of institutionalized non-reciprocating\ndependence in a world that is becoming increasingly\ninterdependent, but also of our vulnerability to economic\nmarginalization. Thus, we are in no way, and to no degree,\ninhibited with regard to addressing inviting profound\nreflection on the issue of the special circumstances of small\nisland developing States \u2014 particularly those in the\nCaribbean region, where prominent among the features\ncharacterizing our special circumstances is the ever-present\nvulnerability to natural disaster and the widespread\ndevastation resulting therefrom.\nThe need for official development assistance and the\ntransfer of real resources from the North to the South has\nnever been as pronounced as it is now. Indeed, such are the\ndimensions of that need in terms of both spread and\nintensity that the transfer of resources referred to here can\nbe effected only on the basis of a concept of a new global\norder as was initially envisaged and expressed in principle\nby the President of Guyana, His Excellency Dr. Cheddi\nJagan, and adopted by all the member States of the\nCaribbean Community.\nThis, no doubt, has to be elaborated, and the countries\nof the North are especially requested to give disciplined and\nobjective consideration to this matter. The conceptual\nrequirements of the new global order include: a\nreconstructive change in interaction between North and\nSouth; a new basis for interaction; a new ethic for relating\none to the other; and a genuine partnership, a partnership\nwhich eschews exploitation of any one people by another\nand seeks instead to pursue mutual upliftment of the\npeoples involved.\nMore specifically, it is explicitly posited here that\nthe developed countries should assist the less developed\ncountries in respect of the following: first, the alleviation\nof the debt burden by one means or another; secondly,\nassistance for the development of centres for investment,\nthe training of human resources, and training in how to\nmake the economy more efficient, responsive and\ntransparent; and thirdly, technical assistance to the smaller\neconomies to help them make the transition towards\nincorporation and effective participation in a global\neconomy that is so markedly characterized by so-called\nfree trade. Smaller countries must not be excluded from\nprocesses which they cannot direct in their favour or,\nindeed, effectively influence so as to avoid experiencing\nthe deleterious effects of those processes. Those are but\na few of the tenets upon which the proffered concept of\nthe new global order is based.\nIt is common knowledge that bananas provide a\nlivelihood for a significant percentage of the people of the\nCaribbean, and particularly the subregion of the\nOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States. Thus, the\ncurrent challenge to our special arrangements for that fruit\nin Europe is, to say the least, uncaring, if not hostile.\nGrenada and several of the other States now being so\naffected have, on many issues, collaborated with and\nsupported those very countries that are now quite\nunrelenting in their deliberate assault upon our\npreferential arrangement, which constitutes an assault on\nthe well-being and the very livelihood of a significant\nproportion of our people.\nThere should be no need whatsoever to remind the\nAssembly that there is a direct correlation between the\npremature destruction of our banana industry and the\nwell-being and integrity of our democratic process and\nthus of our democracy itself. Substantial increases in\ncrime and other social ills have been shown to induce\ncommensurate increases in involvement in trading in, and\nthe use of, illicit drugs. We certainly prefer to prevent the\noccurrence of such situations than to have to expend our\nenergies and scarce resources on remedial action to\ncontain and eradicate the now ever-present threat of an\nexpanding narco-culture.\n\n\n\nIt cannot be denied that, there are other, and more\nimportant, objectives to be achieved besides protecting the\nmarket economy. And this applies to all countries, the\ndeveloped as well as the less developed. The time is now\nright for serious thrusts to be made towards the alleviation\nof the poverty and deprivation which are so widespread\nacross the world, although most prevalent in the developing\ncountries. This process must be activated immediately to\nensure that economic progress is buttressed by social\nequity. Freedom from want; good health; genuine\neducation; a clean environment; elimination of the scourge\nof illicit drugs, as well as of unemployment and\nunderemployment; and the better and wider enjoyment of\nbasic human rights: these are the goals we should\nunswervingly and constantly be seeking to reach.\nIn this context, my Government is cognizant of its\nduties and responsibilities. We are convinced that through\nprudent management of our very limited resources, a\nwillingness on the part of our people to work hard and, on\nour part, clear political leadership and virtuously inspired\nguidance \u2014 all enhanced by the support of friendly\nGovernments and donor agencies \u2014 we shall, in due\ncourse, place our country on a sound path towards genuine\ngrowth.\nMy delegation is happy to state in this regard that\nsome improvement has already been made and that our\nGovernment looks forward to achieving in the not too\ndistant future most of the goals we have set ourselves in\norder more effectively to pursue those other goals, which\nwould significantly enhance the quality of our people\u2019s\nlives.\nIn the context of collective international efforts\ntowards the achievement of some kind of sustainable\ndevelopment in the less developed countries, it is instructive\nto refer to the recently held Group of Seven summit in\nLyon, France, where most of the efforts focused on the new\nglobal order.\nThe leaders of the world\u2019s most powerful nations\nagreed that in the present global economic situation it is\nabsolutely necessary to control negative consequences and\nfight against the risks of exclusion, both at the national and\ninternational levels. Their communiqu\u00e9, entitled\n\u201cGlobalization for the Benefit of All\u201d, does seem to signal\nthe stirrings of a new order for humankind.\nGrenada welcomes the discussion held on aid for\ndevelopment \u2014 particularly with officials from the\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank \u2014 and is\nheartened by the fact that in those discussions modalities\nwere defined for a new partnership for development based\non the sharing of responsibilities between developed\ncountries, developing countries and multilateral\norganizations.\nThe pledge by the G-7 countries to ensure\nsubstantial flows of public aid for development to the\ncountries most in need is very timely and most welcome.\nDare we of the South perceive this pronouncement by the\nG-7 to be not simply a pledge of honour but, further, an\nexpression of subscription to the new global order, as\nenunciated by a visionary of the South, underscored now\nby a soulful shinning forth of virtue on the part of the\nNorth? My delegation sincerely hopes so.\nIt is several years since any substantial change was\nmade to the structure of one of the most important organs\nof this Organization. I refer to the Security Council.\nMeanwhile, the international political and economic\nenvironments have undergone some drastic and far-\nreaching transformations. Grenada strongly believes that\nin order to reflect the new geopolitical and economic\nrealities of our world today, there are changes that are\nnow due, particularly in the Security Council.\nAccordingly, my delegation expresses its unwavering\nsupport for the reforms currently being undertaken, as\nwell as those now being contemplated with respect to the\nUnited Nations system.\nIn July of this year, the European Union, through its\nParliament, adopted a resolution to support the call for\nparticipation in international organizations by the Republic\nof China. The Government and people of Grenada\nconsider this action on the part of the European Union to\nhave been a most significant development. We welcome\nthis development, and we applaud the European Union for\nit. Indeed, we are encouraged by that action, for the\npersistent plea of Grenada, constantly repeated over\nseveral years in every appropriate forum, has now been\namplified into a clarion call for moral justice, in contrast\nto the expediency of power politics, economic advantage\nand legislative manipulation of yesteryear.\nThe Republic of China has for many years\nconsistently displayed its commitment to the values and\nprinciples of this body. Indeed, in the face of threats and\nundisguised acts of aggression, the courageous people of\nthe Republic of China boldly chose to embark upon a\npath of freedom, justice, and respect for human rights,\nand recently took part in their presidential election, which\nwas open, free and fair.\n12\n\n\nThe economic achievements of this brave country of\n21.3 million people are well and widely known. Thus, there\ncan be no doubt as to the capability of the people of the\nRepublic of China to make substantial contributions to the\nwork of the United Nations. As to their willingness to make\nsignificant contributions, that also cannot be a matter of\ndoubt. They have given testimony in this regard in several\nways. They have established their good faith. They deserve\nthe right to participate in the conferences and activities of\nthe United Nations system. To continue to deny them this\nright would be to persist in denying them justice within the\nconfraternity of nations.\nSuperior power is found only where there is superior\nexcellence of some kind, and the Republic of China has\nmanifested a certain degree of superior power which\nderives from virtue rather than from physical strength.\nThus, the Government and people of Grenada unequivocally\nexhort this Assembly to secure participation by the\nRepublic of China in the agencies and activities of the\nUnited nations system.\nWith every passing year, contemporary politics\nbecomes more complex and, thus, commensurately complex\nare the related solutions. In this regard, my delegation\nespecially applauds the efforts of the United Nations in\nattempting to maintain some degree of peace and security\nin various parts of the world. From Haiti to the war-torn\nRepublics of the former Yugoslavia, to the famine-stricken\ncities of many an African State, the United Nations\nhumanitarian activities and missions of peace are indeed\nworthy of special commendation. In this regard, I seize the\nopportunity now afforded me to express a father\u2019s\nappreciation of and blessings upon my son Mark, who for\nsome years has been and continues to be so engaged, and\nI ask your indulgence in this regard.\nGrenada is encouraged by the progress \u2014 albeit\nhalting \u2014 made in the Middle East peace process and urges\ncontinued dialogue until the noble ideal of peaceful\ncoexistence is achieved. But world peace and security will\nnot be attained if those countries with nuclear capabilities\ncontinue to promulgate their use for military purposes. My\ndelegation therefore welcomes efforts to institute a\ncomprehensive ban on nuclear testing.\nSimilarly, the practice of transporting hazardous\nradioactive materials, particularly through the Caribbean\nSea, must be stopped immediately. The very\nsurreptitiousness with which this business is conducted and\ntransportation effected is indeed a tacit admission of\nwrongdoing. Caribbean humanness is violated in such\ntransactions. In the name of humanity, therefore, the\nGovernment and the people of Grenada, without\nequivocation and without qualification, call for this\npractice to be stopped, and stopped now.\nIt has been suggested by Max Ascoli that\n\u201ccivilization is a constant quest for non-violent\nmeans of solving conflicts \u2014 a common quest for\npeace.\u201d\nNonetheless, my Government perceives civilization as\nbeing more than simply a quest for peace, more than\nmerely the shunning of visible violence. My Government\nsees civilization as the purposeful pursuit of peace\nthrough commitment to justice; the inherent equality of all\nmen and women; and the inalienable rights which derive\nfrom simply being human. My Government subscribes to\nthe principle of the overriding rule of moral law.\nIn the context of violations of humanness, it behoves\nme to express, on behalf of my delegation, the deep\nconcern of the Government and the people of Grenada in\nrespect of the agonies which are currently being\nexperienced by a significant number of persons in Cyprus.\nGrenada, like Cyprus, is an island nation, small, but\nsovereign. We therefore call for an end to the suffering to\nwhich so many of the families and individual persons of\nthat beautiful country have been subjected. The smallness\nof a nation does not, to any degree whatever, negate the\nfundamental human rights of each of its citizens.\nThe great Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran, in his\nThoughts and Meditations, offered humanity the following\ninsightful observation:\n\u201cMy soul preached to me and showed me that\nI am neither more than the pygmy, nor less than the\ngiant. Ere my soul preached to me, I looked upon\nhumanity as two men; one weak, whom I pitied, and\nthe other strong, whom I followed or resisted in\ndefiance. But now I have learned that I am as both\nare, and made from the same elements. My origin is\ntheir origin, my conscience is their conscience, my\ncontention is their contention, and my pilgrimage is\ntheir pilgrimage.\u201d\nMy delegation is deeply convinced of the\nunsurpassable wisdom which these words of Khalil\nGibran represent. The sentiment conveyed constitutes the\nsine qua non for the realization of international\nbrotherhood. This we do believe.\n13\n\n\nAccordingly, my delegation earnestly urges that\nhenceforth the quintessential sameness of all mankind and\na genuine commitment to virtue should be adopted as the\nguiding principles of this Assembly. May God bless\neveryone participating in this fifty-first regular session of\nthe Assembly, so that, so much the more effectively, the\nAssembly will be a transforming blessing to our world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of my delegation and\non my own behalf, I should like at the outset to\ncongratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his unanimous election to\nthe presidency of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly, and to express my happiness at seeing a fellow\nAsian, from Malaysia, with which my country enjoys the\nbest of relations, guiding our deliberations. I pledge to him\nthe full cooperation of my delegation. I wish also to thank\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for having guided the fiftieth\nsession of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion.\nMy profound appreciation and gratitude also go to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\ntireless efforts in quest of a world of peace, progress,\njustice and humanity.\nThe past five decades have seen the United Nations\nstriving to fulfil its Charter objectives. Yet peace and\nprosperity \u2014 mankind\u2019s highest dream \u2014 remain\nunrealized. Conflicts, enormous cruelty, poverty, hunger\nand, of late, population and environmental problems, have\nbeen relentlessly on the rise. The United Nations, which\nhas limited resources at its disposal and is thus ill-\nprepared to deal with such situations, has become the\ntarget of increasing public criticism. The tendency to\nfocus on the Organization\u2019s set-backs while ignoring its\nrecord of real and substantive success threatens to\nundermine the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations.\nThose formidable odds notwithstanding, the world\nbody has achieved a great deal of success in the field of\npeace, democracy and human rights. It has many recent\nachievements to its credit, in Namibia, Mozambique,\nCambodia, Haiti and El Salvador, to name but a few.\nThanks to the efforts of the United Nations, the hope for\nstability and democracy has been a living reality in those\ncountries.\nThe presence of the United Nations Interim Force in\nLebanon, the United Nations Disengagement Observer\nForce and the United Nations Truce Supervision\nOrganization continues to make a difference in the Middle\nEast. Similarly, the United Nations has exerted efforts to\nkeep and mediate peace in many countries of Asia,\nAfrica, Europe and Latin America through use of its good\noffices and through peacekeeping operations. In spite of\nperceived setbacks suffered by the Organization in some\npeacekeeping operations, which were undermanned and\nlacked clear-cut mandates, we must not forget the real\ngood that has been achieved through the prevention of\nfurther genocides, the provision of massive humanitarian\nrelief and paving the way for political settlements.\nA year ago, many world leaders gathered here to\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations. With a deep sense of optimism, they took stock\nof the past and present performance of the Organization,\nas they also pondered the future course that it may have\nto traverse. They reaffirmed their faith in the principles\nand purposes of the United Nations Charter, renewed their\ncommitment to the world body and pledged their support\nto enable the Organization to come to grips with new\nrealities and challenges. No doubt the fiftieth anniversary\n14\n\n\nunderlined the need to reactivate the United Nations as the\ncentrepiece of international relations, thereby further\ndeepening our hopes in the world body.\nNepal takes comfort in the fact that the Dayton peace\nprocess has provided the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina\nwith a chance to realize their long-cherished dream of a\npeaceful homeland. The recently concluded elections, we\nhope, will contribute to a lasting peace in the Balkans, and\nwe take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to all\nwho contributed to this election process. We are equally\nhappy to be part of this peace process through our\ncontribution of civilian police monitors to the International\nPolice Task Force and the United Nations Transitional\nAdministration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western\nSirmium, under the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. We hope that the next local elections will also\nbe held peacefully.\nLast year in this Hall I said that the peace process in\nthe Middle East had become irreversible. That is still the\nview of Nepal, but the recent aggravation of the situation,\ninvolving heavy loss of lives and consequent negative\nimplications for peace, has given us deep concern. It is my\nearnest hope that the recent Washington summit meeting\nbetween Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat\nwill restore trust between the two sides and be instrumental\nin the immediate resumption of serious negotiations within\nthe Middle East peace process.\nMore than any other country, the landlocked country\nof Afghanistan has been a victim of the cold war, and the\nAfghan people are still suffering from its far-reaching\nconsequences. We hope that peace prevails in that country.\nNepal, however, was deeply concerned at the flagrant\nviolation of the United Nations sanctuary.\nWe believe that United Nations peacekeeping\noperations are indispensable in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. Nepal has been a major\ntroop-contributing country to peacekeeping missions of the\nUnited Nations. Over the years we have participated in\nvarious peacekeeping operations with a total of 30,000\ntroops and hundreds of civilian police. Our commitment to\nUnited Nations peace initiatives continues undiminished.\nNepal supports ongoing efforts for the establishment\nof a rapidly deployable Headquarters team in the\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations of the United\nNations Secretariat, within the framework of a system of\nstand-by arrangements to enhance the rapid response\ncapabilities of the United Nations \u2014 a system to which\nNepal has made a stand-by commitment to provide up to\n2,000 troops and 200 police monitors. Work on such a\nHeadquarters team should proceed in a transparent\nmanner and involve all interested Member States,\nparticularly troop-contributing nations. We believe that it\nshould be composed of staff recruited by the United\nNations.\nThe United Nations is unfortunately beset with a\nchronic financial crisis, which has seriously impaired the\nOrganization\u2019s ability to perform well. Despite the year-\nlong meetings of the High-level Open-ended Working\nGroup on the Financial Situation of the United Nations,\nthe financial health of the Organization is still precarious,\nand cross-funding of the regular budget from the\npeacekeeping account is becoming almost the rule rather\nthan the exception. The continuation of such practice,\nwhich invariably results in late reimbursements to the\ntroop-contributing countries, is detrimental to the rapid\ndeployment capability expected of the United Nations.\nThe capacity of the United Nations to plan and execute\npeacekeeping missions will be greatly undermined if the\npresent financial crisis persists. Without a secure financial\nbase, the international community cannot expect the\nUnited Nations to play the role demanded of it in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nModern peacekeeping missions, involving complex\nintra-State conflicts combined with massive humanitarian\nrelief operations, expose peacekeepers to an\nunprecedented level of danger. It is therefore only fitting\nthat those brave harbingers of peace who are put in\nharm\u2019s way be treated on an equal footing by the United\nNations. We hope that a just system of death and\ndisability compensation, as mandated by the fiftieth\nsession of the General Assembly, will be established\nsoon.\nFor Nepal, the recent adoption by the General\nAssembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nis a landmark in the history of nuclear non-proliferation\nand arms control. We hope that it is the culmination of\nour efforts to ban nuclear testing once and for all. We\nbelieve that the conclusion of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty brings us a step closer to our\ndream of a nuclear-weapon-free world. It is precisely for\nthat reason that Nepal supported the Treaty, to which I\nput my signature yesterday on behalf of my country.\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is only\na partial fulfilment of our Treaty commitment to pursue\nin good faith the goal of the total elimination of nuclear\n15\n\n\nweapons. With the adoption of the Treaty, it has become\nmore urgent than ever that we seriously consider other\npriority issues of nuclear disarmament in a practicable,\ntime-bound framework. In this regard, Nepal wishes to\nunderline its support for the programme of action recently\nput forward by 28 non-aligned and neutral countries for the\nelimination of nuclear weapons through a phased\nprogramme.\nIn recent times, substantial progress has been made in\nthe creation and expansion of nuclear-weapon-free zones.\nThe Treaty of Bangkok and the Treaty of Pelindaba have\nestablished South-East Asia and the continent of Africa,\nrespectively, as nuclear-weapon-free zones. Indeed, these\nare steps, in the best tradition of the Treaties of Tlatelolco\nand Rarotonga, that could contribute greatly to the cause of\nnuclear disarmament and the global nuclear non-\nproliferation regime. We earnestly hope that efforts will be\nintensified in the Middle East and in our own region of\nSouth Asia so that the goal of nuclear-weapon-free zones\nbecomes a reality in those regions as well.\nWe are of the view that our efforts towards the goal\nof total nuclear disarmament must be matched by efforts to\nachieve the non-proliferation of other weapons of mass\ndestruction. We therefore fully support measures aimed at\nimposing a total ban on chemical, biological and other\ninhumane weapons, including the production, sale and\nexport of anti-personnel landmines. In this regard, I am\nglad to say that Nepal is now at the final stage of\ncompleting the necessary constitutional process in order to\nratify the chemical weapons Convention, which we have\nalready signed.\nAs host to the United Nations Regional Centre for\nPeace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, my\ndelegation wishes to emphasize the need for institutional\narrangements for the strengthening of the World\nDisarmament Campaign. The Kathmandu Centre has\ncontributed to international, regional and subregional\ndialogue aimed at transparency and confidence-building in\nthe areas of disarmament and security.\nIn his annual report on the work of the United\nNations, the Secretary-General notes that the past year\nwitnessed a determined effort by the international\ncommunity to take action to end the scourge of terrorism.\nI would like to reaffirm the commitment of Nepal to the\nDeclaration on Measures to Eliminate International\nTerrorism adopted by the General Assembly two years ago.\nThe reform of the Security Council is considered\nnecessary to make that crucial organ of the United\nNations more reflective of contemporary realities. We\nagree that any expansion of the Security Council must\naccommodate the interests and concerns of the bulk of the\ntotal membership, to redress the existing imbalance and\nanomalous representation. Any agreed formula for\nexpansion, in our view, must take into account the issue\nof equitable global representativity. The selection of the\nmembers of an expanded Security Council should be\nguided by the contribution of Member States to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nHaving said that, I want to emphasize that since the\nSecurity Council is the principal instrument of the\ninternational community in the area of collective security,\nno expansion or reform should diminish in any way its\ncapacity for prompt and effective action to maintain\ninternational peace and security.\nThe establishment of the World Trade Organization\n(WTO) following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round\nhas made it clear that no country can ignore the\nglobalization process, which is gaining tremendous\nmomentum. At the same time, the acceleration of this\nprocess of global economic integration has failed to\nnarrow the gap between the developed and the developing\ncountries. The economic situation of many countries of\nAfrica and the least developed countries is further\ndeteriorating, and those countries are being marginalized\nbecause of unfavourable conditions prevailing in the\nglobal market in the trade of their exportable products.\nFurthermore, those countries lack national capacity in\nterms of technology and product development capability\nand also face various tariff and non-tariff barriers to their\nexports abroad.\nThe situation of the landlocked developing countries\namong the least developed countries is further exacerbated\nby the high costs associated with the production and\ntransportation of their exportable commodities and their\ndifficulty in maintaining the tight delivery schedules\ndemanded by the global market. Without direct access to\nthe sea and given the absence of a significant market base\nwithin their boundaries, those landlocked countries cannot\noffer any of the comparative advantages so essential to\nattracting foreign investment. Additional financial\nresources and the transfer of appropriate technology,\naccompanied by concrete measures to offset those built-in\nhandicaps, are the bare minimum requirements. We\nexpect that the WTO ministerial meeting at Singapore\nwill take this reality into account and ensure that the\n16\n\n\nproducts of the least developed countries are given free and\nunrestricted access to world markets in order to facilitate\nthe integration of those countries into the liberalizing and\nglobalizing world economy.\nIt is with great distress that the developing countries,\nand in particular the least developed countries, witness the\nsteep decline in the resources of United Nations operational\nactivities for development. The least developed countries\nneed the enhanced support of those agencies more than\never, since most of them have embarked on far-reaching\nreforms. In the absence of the flows of direct foreign\ninvestment now available to many developing countries, the\nleast developed countries that lack basic physical\ninfrastructure and material resources have nowhere else to\nturn. The efforts of the organs of the United Nations system\nengaged in providing technical and advisory assistance to\nthe least developed countries, particularly the United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD), need to be supplemented adequately by the\nBretton Woods institutions and regional financial\ninstitutions to arrest and reverse the declining economic and\nsocial situation of the least developed countries.\nThe solidarity of the support received from the\nrepresentatives of the Non-Aligned Movement and the\nGroup of 77 during the recently concluded ministerial\nmeeting of least developed countries is an expression of\nunderstanding and an acknowledgment of the responsibility\nof the international community to the least developed\ncountries. We are confident that the emphasis given by the\nleaders of the Group of Seven at the Lyon Summit on the\nneed to assist the least developed countries and to integrate\nthem in the global economy will be backed by concrete\nactions.\nSouth-South cooperation is another important\ncomponent of international economic cooperation that\nshould be further explored and promoted. The Government\nof Costa Rica deserves our appreciation for its generous\noffer to host a South-South conference on finance, trade\nand investment in January next year.\nIn recent years we have witnessed a decline in the\neconomic conditions of more and more people, especially\nthose from the developing countries, who now comprise a\npopulation of 1.3 billion people living in poverty. The\nDeclaration of the year 1996 as the International Year for\nthe Eradication of Poverty and the Declaration of the first\nUnited Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty,\nbeginning in 1997, must be taken seriously if poverty is to\nbe eradicated with renewed vigour and dedication. The\neradication of poverty must be a priority agenda for all\nmultilateral development institutions.\nIn this regard, we express our appreciation to the\nSecretary-General for his initiative to establish, through\nthe Administrative Committee on Coordination, inter-\nagency task forces to oversee coherent implementation by\nthe United Nations system of various cross-sectoral issues\ncovered in recent major international conferences. It is\nheartening to note that one of the task forces, which is on\nthe creation of an enabling environment, is chaired by the\nWorld Bank. We look forward to the reports of the task\nforces, which are expected in April 1997.\nWe are confident that the special session of the\nGeneral Assembly on the Rio Declaration to be held in\nJune of next year will be successful in achieving the\nobjective of acquiring new and additional resources to\nimplement Agenda 21. We urge the developed countries\nto honour the commitments they have made at major\ninternational conferences, including those at Rio, Cairo,\nCopenhagen, Beijing and Istanbul. We are deeply\nconcerned at the declining level of official development\nassistance to developing countries, in particular the least\ndeveloped countries.\nWe are happy to see that the Framework Convention\non Climate Change has entered into force and is being\nimplemented effectively. We are at the same time\nconcerned about the Convention on Biological Diversity,\nwhich has not been ratified by many countries. I am\nespecially pleased to say that the Parliament of Nepal has\nalready ratified the International Convention to Combat\nDesertification.\nWe are firmly committed to the Charter obligation\nto promote and protect fundamental human rights for all,\nwithout distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.\nMy delegation is closely following the negotiations that\nare taking place in the Third Committee working group\nestablished to oversee the recommendations of the Vienna\nDeclaration and Programme of Action.\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women was a\nlandmark in reaffirming the equal rights of women, and\nfocused our attention on the important aspect of the equal\nparticipation of men and women in development\nactivities. We in Nepal are serious about implementing\nthe outcome of that Conference, with the creation,\ninitially, of a separate Ministry of Women and Social\nWelfare.\n17\n\n\nPolitical strife, ethnic conflicts and the denial of basic\nhuman rights in many parts of the world have resulted in an\ninflux of a large number of refugees, mostly women and\nchildren. We express our appreciation to the High\nCommissioner for Refugees for her untiring and continued\nefforts to take care of refugees around the world, despite\nthe limited resources at her disposal. The Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\ndeserves our special praise for providing\nnecessary food and other services to some 100,000\nrefugees in the camps in eastern Nepal. His Majesty\u2019s\nGovernment of Nepal upholds the right of every refugee\nto return to his or her homeland safely and with dignity.\nThe Government will make every effort to solve the\nproblem of refugees from Bhutan through mutual\ndiscussion and understanding.\nAs a critical part of our broad policy of peace,\ncooperation and friendship with all countries of the world\non the basis of the Charter of the United Nations and the\nprinciple of non-alignment, Nepal is pursuing a policy of\npromoting regional cooperation and understanding under\nthe umbrella of the South Asian Association for Regional\nCooperation (SAARC). We celebrated the tenth\nanniversary of the Association last year. The seven\ncountries of the Association are engaged in various areas\nof cooperation, including the suppression of terrorism and\ndrug abuse, environmental preservation, poverty\nalleviation and the promotion of regional trade. It is a fact\nthat SAARC is far behind other similar regional\ncooperation arrangements, but the countries of the\nAssociation, particularly Nepal, are persevering in their\ndetermination to develop both the habit and concrete\nmeasures of cooperation, understanding and peace among\nthe South Asian partners."

However, it is sad to note that I have assumed\nthis leadership at a time when my country, Liberia, is\nexperiencing a tragic and senseless war.\nThe Liberian civil war, which began more than six\nyears ago, has unleashed one of the worst man-made\ndisasters in recent memory. It has claimed over 250,000\nlives \u2014 about 15 per cent of the population; forced over\n800,000 Liberians to seek refuge in neighbouring countries;\nand left several hundred thousand others internally\ndisplaced.\nRegrettably, the most vulnerable groups \u2014 women,\nchildren and the elderly \u2014 continue to be victimized by the\nravages of disease, hunger and malnutrition, which are\ncommonplace under such conditions. The wanton killing\nof civilians and the destruction of basic infrastructure,\nwhich intensified in April of this year, continue to retard\neconomic activities and deprive the people of their\nfundamental human rights.\nThe painful reality of our child soldiers, child\nlabourers and abandoned children in the country point to\nthe formidable task that lies ahead as we seek to\nrehabilitate them into productive citizens.\nThe displacement of large segments of the rural\npopulation has curtailed agricultural production. Before\nthe war, agriculture accounted for 38 per cent of the gross\ndomestic product and 75 per cent of total employment. As\na result of continued hostilities, other potentially high\neconomic sectors such as rubber, timber, iron ore and\nminerals remain inaccessible.\nSince 1990, the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) has deployed a peacekeeping\nforce in Liberia, in keeping with Chapter VIII of the\nCharter of the United Nations. It had been hoped that this\ninitiative, the first by a subregion, would receive the full\nsupport of the United Nations. Unfortunately, the\nassistance of the international community has been both\nslow and inadequate, thereby imposing severe pressure on\nthe scarce resources of the member States of ECOWAS.\nWhile ECOWAS, in the spirit of African\nbrotherhood and solidarity, has taken the initiative in\nLiberia, its efforts must be complemented by the\ninternational community through the provision of\nsubstantial material and financial support to facilitate the\nimplementation of the peace process in the country. It is\ntherefore my appeal that the United Nations assume its\nshare of the burden of peacekeeping in Liberia. The\nsubregion is facing extreme economic hardships due to\nexternal factors beyond its control.\nAfter the failure of several peace agreements, the\nmember States of ECOWAS convened a meeting in\nAbuja, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, in August 1995.\nAt that meeting, a decision was taken to include for the\nfirst time the leaders of the three major warring factions\nin a six-man Council of State. Accordingly, a ceasefire\nwas implemented, and Monrovia was maintained as a safe\nhaven. The members of the Council of State were\ninducted into office on 1 September 1995.\n7\n\n\nIn April of this year, the resumption of fighting, with\nthe accompanying carnage and illegal seizure and\ndestruction of property, dealt another set-back to the peace\nprocess. At this juncture, I extend the profound regrets of\nthe Liberian Government and people to the international,\nintergovernmental, non-governmental and other\norganizations that sustained losses as a result of the April\nfighting. I pledge that our Administration will do all that\nlies within its power to prevent the reoccurrence of such\nlawlessness.\nThe events of April enabled the leaders of the\nsubregion to identify deficiencies in the Agreement and to\ntake measures to prevent the reoccurrence of such\nbreakdown in the implementation of the peace accord.\nAlthough they reaffirmed the Abuja Agreement as the best\nframework for finding a lasting solution to the Liberian\nconflict, they nevertheless resolved that a change was\nnecessary in the leadership to restore confidence and\nenhance its performance.\nThe parties unanimously selected me to lead Liberia\nfrom a devastating war to conditions of peace. The\nselection of a woman is a decision that deserves\ncommendation; for it is a major victory and a recognition\nof the active involvement of Liberian women in the peace\nprocess. The resolution of the Liberian conflict is therefore\na challenge not only to me but also to all Liberian women\nand to the women of Africa and the world, whose advice\nand continuing support I deeply appreciate.\nOur leadership is challenged with the difficult task of\npursuing national reconciliation, national reunification,\nrepatriation and resettlement of refugees and internally\ndisplaced persons, and the creation of an enabling\nenvironment for the holding of free and fair democratic\nelections by May 1997. Additionally, and more demanding,\nwe must ensure the successful disarmament of combatants\nand their demobilization and reintegration into civil society.\nThis task requires us, as a matter of urgency, to first\ndisarm our children and redirect their lives. We also have\nto address the immense suffering that the war has inflicted\non our people. We must establish an independent elections\ncommission to conduct free and fair elections under\ninternational supervision.\nI am confident that, with the support of the United\nNations and the international community, the tasks ahead\nwill be achieved. All of the parties to the conflict have\npledged to me their commitment to the implementation of\nthe revised schedule. Despite some signs of retrogression,\nour timely intervention and appeals have been heeded,\nthus averting the derailment of the process. We are aware\nthat our efforts to maintain the ceasefire must be\nsustained at every stage of the peace process by timely\nintervention and insistence that the terms and conditions\nof the peace agreement must be respected by the parties.\nThere is a renewed hope for peace in Liberia as a\nresult of the decisions taken at the last Abuja summit.\nThe failure over the past six years to achieve peace in the\ncountry made it imperative that long overdue measures be\ntaken to ensure the final and successful implementation of\nthe Abuja Agreement.\nFirst, due care and consideration was given to the\nselection of the Head of Government, with the view of\nensuring effective leadership and a sense of purpose.\nSecondly, provision was made for the regular monitoring\nand assessment of the implementation of the peace\nAgreement. This responsibility was assigned to the special\nrepresentative of the Chairman of ECOWAS and the\nECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia. Thirdly,\nECOWAS member States agreed to impose sanctions on\nany person or group of persons obstructing the\nimplementation of the peace Agreement. These necessary\nmeasures will equally require the support of the\ninternational community.\nThe Government and people of Liberia share the\nconviction of the member States of ECOWAS, as well as\nthe international community, that the Abuja peace\nAgreement provides the best framework for the resolution\nof the Liberian conflict. As Chairman of the Council of\nState, I reaffirm my total commitment to the full\nimplementation of the ECOWAS peace plan for Liberia.\nWe owe a debt of gratitude to the Government and people\nof the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as well as to other\nmember States of ECOWAS, for their untiring efforts and\nsacrifices in the quest for peace in Liberia.\nWe also extend our gratitude to the Governments of\nthe United States of America, the Netherlands and\nGermany for their recent assistance to the ECOWAS\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG). We thank other friendly\nnations that have made, and continue to make,\ncontributions to the resolution of the Liberian conflict.\nThe Liberian Government appeals for assistance to enable\nthe deployment of additional troops to sustain the new\nfocus on disarmament and demobilization as well as\nensure thereafter the rehabilitation and reconstruction of\nour war-torn country.\n8\n\n\nIn order to facilitate the rehabilitation of these\nchildren, we appeal to friendly Governments to help us\nrebuild our educational institutions, especially those\nproviding vocational and technical training. As a caring\nmother, I urgently need to rehabilitate and grant relief to\nthese children. It is one of my principal concerns. In this\nregard, I express appreciation to the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) for their assistance. It is\nmy hope that all mothers and all humanitarian,\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations will\nsupport this worthy undertaking. The Liberian children,\nindeed the children of our world, are our future.\nAs regards the international situation, while we will\ncontinue to accord priority to the civil war in Liberia until\ngenuine peace is restored, we have not lost sight of other\nimportant issues that are of vital concern to the international\ncommunity.\nIt is encouraging to note that since the end of the cold\nwar, Member States have increasingly taken measures in\nsupport of general and complete disarmament, including\nnuclear weapons. The establishment of zones of peace in\nmost regions of the world and the recent adoption of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which my\nGovernment has already signed, are positive developments\nin the field of disarmament. It is hoped that further progress\nwill be made in the total elimination of nuclear weapons\nwithin a given time-frame.\nLiberia, which is emerging from conditions of war, is\nconcerned about the unrestricted use of conventional\nweapons, including anti-personnel landmines. The\ninternational community must also focus its attention on\nconventional disarmament, since these deadly weapons are\nusually resorted to in most conflicts.\nInternal strife in several countries resulting from\nethnic, religious and racial differences continues to cause\ndeath and destruction in Angola, Burundi, Rwanda,\nSomalia, the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and my own\ncountry. In order to spare the lives of innocent civilians, we\nappeal to all parties to enter into dialogue and seek a\npolitical settlement of their differences.\nAs we move towards the twenty-first century, we are\nencouraged by the growing concern about the persistently\nslow and unbalanced growth of the world economy. We\nhave experienced the direct impact of the uneven\ndistribution of resources both among and within nations.\nThe crisis in Liberia today is an expression of this\nunevenness, which has a direct relationship to poverty and\ninstability.\nIt is worth mentioning that in every attempt at\nfinding a solution, such issues as the debt crisis and the\ndecline in official development assistance continue to\nhamper our efforts to bring about the required reform in\nfavour of the development of our people. This situation\ncontinues to undermine development in many regions of\nthe world, especially Africa. Today, Africa remains the\nonly continent where the level of poverty is causing\nincreasing hardship and despair, despite the courageous\nefforts by many countries to undertake reforms.\nRegrettably, programmes proposed by the\ninternational community have yet to receive adequate\ndonor assistance to move Africa\u2019s development forward.\nWe recall the priority programme for Africa\u2019s economic\nrecovery and other measures to address the critical\nsituation facing the continent.\nIt is in this light that I commend the United Nations\nSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa launched earlier\nthis year. The initiative requires commitments amounting\nto $25 billion over a period of 10 years, to be realized\nthrough the reallocation of existing resources, and\ncomplements the United Nations New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s.\nWe therefore plead with the United Nations and its\nagencies, international financial institutions and bilateral\ndonors to re-examine their attitudes towards Africa\u2019s\ndevelopment aspirations. We hope that a solution will be\nfound to the extreme burden that debt now imposes on all\ncountries, but especially on those coming out of crisis.\nIn spite of the difficulties facing Liberia, it has\ncontinued to consider the role of women as crucial to the\ndevelopment process by advocating an improved status\nfor women. Liberia has supported the decisions emanating\nfrom conferences on the advancement of women,\nparticularly the Beijing Conference held in 1995. My\npresence here today as Chairman of the Council of State\nis a testimony to Liberia\u2019s support for its women and for\nthe rights of women everywhere.\nI take this opportunity to say that it would be\nadvantageous to all Member States of this Organization if\nwe, as world leaders, committed ourselves to a policy of\nmutual respect for one another and for our respective\npeoples and their legitimate aspirations in life. I am\nconvinced that prospects for a peaceful world will be\n9\n\n\nmade greater if we summon the courage to equitably share\nwithout restraints the material and technological resources\nthat represent our common inheritance on earth.\nOnce those considerations become our cherished\npreoccupation and the noble focus of our collective\nundertakings, the world will enjoy a better future: a future\nthat will know no bounds for the collective happiness of\nmankind; a future that will be devoid of terrorism and war;\nand a future that will not occasion famine, starvation and\nhuman degradation; a future without jealousy, hatred or\nenvy.\nWe can make tomorrow better or worse. The question\nis: which will it be? The United Nations system and the\nentire international community will be judged on the basis\nof their response to this important question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is my honour to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the post of\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\nsession. On behalf of the Ukrainian delegation, I would\nalso like to express my appreciation to Mr. Freitas\ndo Amaral, who presided so efficiently over the last\nsession and encouraged an intensive exchange of opinions\non the role of the United Nations in today\u2019s world.\nA year ago, at the commemorative session of the\nGeneral Assembly, our Organization received a substantial\ncredit of trust as a universal international institution\nwhich, in the Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth\nAnniversary of the United Nations, was called upon to\n\u201ccreate new opportunities for peace, development,\ndemocracy and cooperation.\u201d (resolution 50/6, third\npreambular para.)\nToday, we can assert that the United Nations has\nbeen and remains the key mechanism for maintaining and\nstrengthening peace and security \u2014 and there is much\nproof of that. There is no doubt that the past year has\nbeen extremely important for arms control and\ndisarmament. Tomorrow, 27 September, I will have the\nhonour to sign, on behalf of Ukraine, the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), as adopted in historic\nresolution 50/245. This important instrument calls for the\nde jure affirmation of the end of the nuclear-arms-race\nera. In signing this Treaty, Ukraine will make yet another\ncontribution to disarmament, the importance of which\ncannot be overstated.\nIn this context, I recall another historic event: the\nfinal withdrawal of strategic nuclear warheads from the\nterritory of Ukraine. Having eliminated the world\u2019s third-\nlargest nuclear arsenal, which we had inherited, Ukraine\nbecame a nuclear-weapon-free State on 1 June 1996. In\ndoing so, we believe that Ukraine made an unprecedented\ncontribution, which has not yet received adequate\nrecognition by the international community, to\ndiminishing the global nuclear threat and thereby\n9\n\n\ndemonstrated to the whole world its peaceful, consistent\nand reliable policy. Accordingly, we expect the nuclear\nStates strictly to adhere to their commitments relating to the\nsecurity assurances given to Ukraine by the United States\nof America, Russia, the United Kingdom, China and France\nin December 1994.\nUkraine\u2019s important role in the new European security\narchitecture has been recognized recently in several\ninternational documents. For us, this means a special\nresponsibility for the maintenance of stability in the whole\nof Europe. We therefore believe that the process of nuclear\ndisarmament should become more dynamic. In this context,\nthe initiative put forward by the President of Ukraine,\nLeonid Kuchma, with regard to the creation of a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone in Central and Eastern Europe between\nthe Baltic and the Black Seas is the next logical step and an\nimportant move in the right direction. I would like to\nemphasize that the possible deployment of nuclear weapons\non the territories of our neighbours in Central and Eastern\nEurope is a matter of great concern to us. We believe that\nsupport for the idea of a non-nuclear Central Europe would\npromote an atmosphere of confidence between and among\nthe States of the region and prevent the emergence of new\ndividing lines on the European continent. By adding to the\nexisting zones in Antarctica, the South Pacific, Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean, as well as the nuclear-weapon-\nfree zones in South-East Asia and Africa, the creation of a\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Central and Eastern Europe\nwould create the \u201ccritical mass\u201d that would foster the\nprocess of global nuclear disarmament.\nIn our opinion, the Conference on Disarmament, which\nincludes Ukraine as a new, full-fledged member, should\nimmediately start developing a programme of complete\nnuclear disarmament with a view to bringing closer the\nrealization of Ukraine\u2019s appeal for a twenty-first century\nwithout nuclear weapons.\nAmong other important international achievements of\nthe past year, I would like to refer to the beginning of the\npeace settlement in the former Yugoslavia. It is important\nto remember that the peace-keeping efforts of the United\nNations were not in vain. Risking their lives in difficult\nconditions, the Blue Helmets have fulfilled their mission\nand prevented the spillover of the conflict. In this context,\nI would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the\nnecessity of the speedy entry into force and implementation\nof the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations\nand Associated Personnel.\nWe hope that the peace process initiated in Dayton\nhas become irreversible. The proof of this will be in the\nsuccessful implementation of the military aspects of the\nPeace Agreement by the Implementation Force (IFOR)\nand of the recent elections held in Bosnia under the\nauspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe (OSCE).\nIn general, we think that recent international efforts\nin the former Yugoslavia have been a success not only for\na peace settlement. In my opinion, we have also\nwitnessed the appearance of a potential machinery for\neffective cooperation between various international\nstructures in crisis management. I refer in particular to an\nimportant experience of the Implementation Force (IFOR)\noperation carried out, under the mandate of the Security\nCouncil, by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO), its partners \u2014 including Ukraine \u2014 and other\ncountries. At the same time, the ultimate success of the\npeace process will be impossible without the active and\naction-oriented involvement of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in the\nimplementation of civil aspects of the Agreement. The\nconcerted efforts by the United Nations, NATO and the\nOSCE to settle one of the most tragic conflicts of our\ntime prove that political will and a clear division of\nfunctions between the respective structures make it\npossible to transform the idea of mutually reinforcing\ninstitutions into reality. In the meantime, the international\ncommunity may have acquired a reliable mechanism for\nthe solution of its acute problems.\nI believe that the experience of the peace settlement\nin the former Yugoslavia could serve as a shining\nexample for the common elaboration of a future global\nsecurity architecture by all Members of this world\nOrganization. This architecture should also contain a\ncomprehensive concept of peace-keeping, the elaboration\nof which, within the framework of the General Assembly,\nhas to be accelerated. An essential element in this work\ncould be the eventual reorientation of peace-keeping\ntowards preventive diplomacy.\nHowever, it is obvious that we will not be able to\nbuild up a new global security architecture without radical\nreform of the United Nations itself. The need for United\nNations reform was emphasized by virtually all\nparticipants at the last session of the General Assembly.\nThis issue is also a matter of discussion at the current\n10\n\n\nsession. Yet real changes can be achieved only on the\ncondition of a substantial revision of the existing financial\nsystem of the United Nations.\nln recent years the United Nations has been\nexperiencing an unprecedented financial crisis which poses\na real threat to its very functioning. Experience shows that\nfinancial crises are the result either of a wrong taxation\npolicy or of unsound spending. We think that in the case of\nthe United Nations both factors are involved. The inability\nof a number of Member States to meet their financial\nobligations is a direct consequence of the overassessment of\ntheir contribution rates. It will be impossible for the United\nNations to avert financial crisis unless existing irregularities\nin the scale of apportionment of its expenses are eliminated.\nAnd we expect that the current session will find a proper\nsolution to this problem.\nAgainst its will, Ukraine has been made one of the\nUnited Nations debtors. This has occurred due to the fact\nthat the decision on the relocation of my country to group\n(c) in the scale for the financing of peace-keeping\noperations has been delayed for several years. The\naccumulation of a substantial debt is a direct result of the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s unfair decision 47/456, whose sponsors\nwere perfectly well aware that the decision would lead to\nthe current financial crisis. They refused to increase the\ncontribution of those nations which could afford to pay and,\ncontrary to the rules, placed larger assessments on the\nshoulders of the countries which were unable to pay such\namounts.\nUkraine has always been aware of the need to provide\nthe United Nations with adequate financial resources. Upon\nthe instructions of my Government, I would like to inform\nmembers that Ukraine will start paying off its debt to the\nUnited Nations. As early as this year, the amount will be\nreduced by $20 million. In coming years, its real payments\nto the Organization\u2019s budget will be increased.\nThe reform of the Security Council should become\nanother important component of transformation within the\nUnited Nations. We support the desire of Germany and\nJapan to acquire the status of permanent members of the\nSecurity Council, but at the same time stand for increasing\nthe number of non-permanent members on the basis of\nequitable geographical representation, which would also\ntake into account the interests of the Eastern European\nregional group. I hope that the \u201ctwo plus eight\u201d formula\nwhich was proposed by Ukraine and which, in principle,\ncoincides with the Italian approach and that of other\ncountries, will be conducive to the achievement of a\nmutually acceptable solution to the problem within the\nframework of the relevant Working Group of the General\nAssembly.\nOne of the essential features of general peace and\nsecurity in the next millennium should be qualitatively\nnew international economic cooperation, the globalization\nof production and trade, the development of science and\ntechnology and the broadening of the flows of finances\nand services.\nWe believe that the attention of the world\ncommunity should focus today on more than the political\nand military aspects of security. It must also encompass\nthe economic, social and ecological dimensions of peace\nand sustainable development. For Ukraine, this is not just\nan abstract idea without a fixed deadline for its\nimplementation. Chernobyl turned the ecological\ndimension of our national security into a priority of\nUkrainian domestic and foreign policy.\nTen years have passed since that catastrophe, but we\nare still experiencing its grave consequences. Chernobyl\nhas not disappeared into the past. If humankind continues\nto ignore common sense and to think only about today,\nChernobyl may be a reflection of our future.\nWe are encouraged by the Secretary-General\u2019s report\non the work of the Organization (A/51/1) stating that the\nUnited Nations remains deeply concerned by the\nconsequences of Chernobyl and is committed to pursuing\nmeasures aimed at their alleviation. We hope that the\ninternational community will continue to create\nconditions, including material and financial ones, which\nwould allow Ukraine to meet its obligation and to\ndecommission the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by the\nyear 2000.\nWe should also remember that durable peace and\nsustainable development on a global scale cannot be\nachieved unless all countries secure adequate living\nstandards for their populations and overcome\nunemployment, poverty, social disintegration and\nenvironmental pollution.\nIn this context, I would like to draw attention to the\ninitiative concerning the creation of the Council on\nEconomic Security put forward by the President of\nUkraine at the Special Commemorative Meeting of the\nGeneral Assembly last year. In our view, it is high time\nto concentrate the efforts of United Nations Member\nStates on the formation of a legal basis which would\n11\n\n\nallow us to implement this important initiative as one of the\nsteps towards increasing the level of international economic\nsecurity, securing the global coordination of the activities\nof international, regional and national economic institutions\nand preventing economic coercion and discrimination.\nThe issues of international terrorism, organized crime,\nillicit trafficking of drugs and money laundering have\nbecome matters of special concern. Ukraine has always\nplayed an active role in international efforts, particularly\nwithin the framework of the United Nations, aimed at\neliminating these scourges of the present, which not only\nthreaten the security and the health of people but have a\nnegative impact on the social, economic and political\nsituation in many countries. We believe that special\nattention should be paid to the elaboration of specific\nactions to be taken against transnational organized crime. In\nthis context, Poland\u2019s initiative to place on the agenda of\nthe current session the question of the possible elaboration\nof a convention on those issues is more than timely and\nshould be supported. Ukraine is ready to participate in the\ndrafting of this legal instrument.\nIn view of the present financial situation of the\nOrganization, the search for new ways to revitalize\ninternational cooperation in the field of development has\nacquired new significance. One of the promising trends,\nprimarily in finding additional sources of financing, is the\npromotion of regular dialogue between the United Nations\nand the financial institution of the Bretton Woods system.\nWe are convinced that larger resources allocated by\nthese institutions for development would speed up social\nand economic transformations both in economies in\ntransition and in developing countries. They would also\ncreate conditions for the successful reform of the global\nsystem of international economic relations. It is quite\nobvious that the integration of those countries into the\nworld economic system would benefit the entire global\ncommunity. We believe that this very philosophy should\nbecome a foundation for a new strategy of global economic\ndevelopment. The United Nations is called upon to play a\ndecisive role in its elaboration.\nIn this context, we welcome the gradual deepening of\nunderstanding among Member States of the problems faced\nby the countries with economies in transition, as is shown\nby the increased resources allocated by the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme for its operational activities in the\ncountries of Eastern Europe, including Ukraine. For its part,\nUkraine is considering becoming a full member of the\nmultilateral General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World\nTrade Organization system as an integral part of its own\neconomic reform.\nThe successes of the United Nations depend upon\nthe stable development of each Member State. Steadily\novercoming the obstacles that befell our State in the\nprocess of radically transforming its society, Ukraine has\nrecently marked the fifth anniversary of its independence.\nFrom this rostrum I would like to reaffirm that the choice\nof the Ukrainian people in favour of independent\ndemocratic development is final and irreversible.\nThe adoption on 28 June of this year of the\nConstitution of Ukraine has become an event of historic\nimportance for the Ukrainian people. As President Leonid\nKuchma emphasized,\n\u201cIt is an event of a great significance belonging to\nthose few historical dates which unite people not by\nthe iron fist but by the imperatives of the heart, and\nwhich turn a population into a nation and a territory\ninto a State.\u201d\nIn adopting its fundamental law, Ukraine has chosen\nits own model of State-building and for reformatting its\npublic life. In drafting the law, Ukrainian legislators\nbenefited not only from previous historical experiences \u2014\nsuch as that provided by Pylyp Orlyk, a famous\nseventeenth-century Ukrainian public figure who wrote\none of the first European democratic constitutions \u2014 but\nalso drew upon the modern experience, in particular that\nof the members of the Council of Europe.\nWe in Ukraine are consistently building a sovereign,\nindependent, democratic and socially-oriented State which\npromotes human rights as the highest social value. Under\nextremely difficult circumstances, we have managed to\nfollow the European model of public life.\nI would like to emphasize that integration into\nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic structures is a strategic goal\nof Ukraine. At the same time my country is still\ncommitted to non-bloc status. Having yesterday become\nan observer in the Non-Aligned Movement, Ukraine once\nagain proved this.\nNo less important for us remain relations with the\nnewly independent States of the former Soviet Union,\nnotably with the Russian Federation, to which we are\nlinked by common historical experiences.\n12\n\n\nTransformations initiated by the market reform of the\neconomy are becoming increasingly perceptible in Ukraine.\nThe recent introduction of a new currency, the hryvnya,\nproves conclusively that the radical economic changes in\nUkraine have become irreversible. The first results of\nmonetary reform show that in addition to a positive impact\non business activities, it has had a stabilizing psychological\neffect on the Ukrainian people.\nOur society is in the process of formation. We realize\nthat ours is a long and difficult path. There are a number of\nimportant objectives we have to achieve. This will require\nthe gradual revival of democratic standards and their\nintroduction into the fabric of Ukrainian society, which has\nbeen scarred by the totalitarian policies of the last decades.\nWhile advancing along this road, Ukraine will\ncontinue to count on the support of the international\ncommunity. At the same time, I would like to reaffirm that\nUkraine will continue to be committed to supporting the\nUnited Nations which, like my own country, is experiencing\na difficult but vital time of transformation. This is the\nimperative of our times, and we have to meet this\nchallenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I wish to\nexpress my pleasure at seeing you, Sir, assume the\npresidency of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly. Your election to this very responsible post\nattests to the important role of your country, Malaysia, a\ncountry with which the Lao People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic has excellent relations of friendship and\ncooperation in many areas. Aware of your outstanding\n4\n\n\ncompetence and your qualities as an experienced diplomat,\nI am convinced that this session\u2019s proceedings will be\ncrowned with brilliant success.\nI also wish on this occasion to express my sincere\nappreciation to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nfor the outstanding work he has accomplished during his\nfive years in office in the service of the nations and peoples\nof the world.\nThe strengthening of cooperation for development\namong peoples that we have seen in recent years reflects\nthe general trend throughout the world. In various regions,\nhowever, we must sadly note the persistence of complex\nsituations and tensions arising from bloody ethnic conflicts\nand religious differences.\nEven more serious, we are witnessing interference in\nthe internal affairs of States. Hegemonic policies are\ntargeted against small States through arbitrary economic\nblockades, which constitute new forms of racism and\nslavery. This threatens and could destroy harmonious\ncoexistence among States and peoples. The entire\ninternational community must work even harder to find\nways and means to solve these problems as soon as\npossible. This is no easy task. We must all be patient and\nresolute. If we work together, keeping equity and justice in\nour sights as we have done many times, we believe that we\ncan reach our ultimate goals.\nIn Europe, the Dayton Peace Agreement signed on 14\nDecember 1995 to address the problems of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, and the recent ensuing elections, marked an\nimportant stage in the search for a solution to the\ndistressing and destructive conflict in that country. We\nappeal to all parties concerned to show maximum restraint\nand objectivity in their sincere and rigorous implementation\nof the commitments made, in order to restore peace,\nstability and cooperation in that region.\nIn South Africa, under the resolute guidance of\nPresident Mandela, the South African people are trying to\novercome the aftermath of apartheid and rebuild the\nbeloved country. We pay tribute to the new South African\nauthorities for their determination and courage, and hope\nthat South Africa and its courageous people will enjoy\nevery success in these difficult undertakings.\nIn the countries of the Caribbean, economic\ncooperation and cultural and other relations have continued\nto develop in accordance with the current international\nclimate, thereby enhancing peace and security in that part\nof the world. Given this logical course of events, we hope\nthat the United States of America will adopt a more\nreasonable position in its efforts to solve the ongoing\nproblem with the Republic of Cuba through sincere\ndialogue in order to respond to the legitimate interests of\nthe two peoples and help promote understanding between\nthe two countries.\nIn the Middle East, following the establishment of\nthe Palestinian Authority in accordance with the\nWashington peace accord signed in 1993, the peace\nprocess was a source of great hope. But recently it has\nrun into difficulties. Events last week in Jerusalem further\ncompound the situation. We are deeply concerned at the\nsituation and the Government of Laos hopes that the\ncoming meeting between leaders of the parties to the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict will help normalize the\nsituation so that the commitments they made can be\nrespected in the interest of peace and cooperation in the\nregion and throughout the world.\nOn the Korean peninsula, the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea and the United States are rightly\ncontinuing to implement agreements reached, thereby\nhelping consolidate peace in the region. We welcome this\nsituation, and the Government and the people of Laos\nexpress their full support for the deep-seated aspirations\nof the Korean people for a situation in which a new war\nbecomes impossible and the peaceful reunification of\nKorea can take place on the basis of dialogue and new,\nsuitable mechanisms that can turn aims into reality.\nIn South-East Asia, a movement towards peace and\ncooperation has gathered strength. Recently, in Malaysia,\nrepresentatives of the countries of the region discussed a\nplanned railroad from Asia to Europe, from Singapore\ntowards China via Laos. This project would enhance\ncooperation in the region. With this in mind, the countries\nof the region are trying to work together to solve their\nproblems by peaceful means in accordance with regional\nrealities. By remaining true to their policies of peaceful\ncoexistence and security in the interests of development,\nthese countries, including the Lao People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic, have signed a treaty on the establishment of a\nnuclear-weapon-free-zone in South-East Asia. This\nhistoric event is their major contribution. The Government\nof the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic believes that the\nadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nby the fiftieth session of the General Assembly is a sign\nof the immeasurable success of efforts made by the\ninternational community to bring about the gradual\nelimination of nuclear weapons throughout the world.\n5\n\n\nIn the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, the\neconomic reform that began in 1986 has borne its first\nfruits for our people. Average annual economic growth over\nthe past five years, from 1991 to 1995, stands at\napproximately 6.4 per cent. The inflation rate is generally\nstable, thereby helping gradually to raise the living\nstandards of the multi-ethnic Lao populations. What we\nhave accomplished has helped maintain political stability\nand social harmony. This was why, during its congress last\nMarch, the Lao People\u2019s Revolutionary Party gave an\nexhaustive account of socio-economic development and\ndecided to continue reform unremittingly on the basis of a\nmarket economy. It also decided to aim for average annual\nnational economic growth of 8 to 8.5 per cent and a per\ncapita income of $500 per year by the year 2000. Currently,\nour Government is encouraging the various economic\nsectors to develop and is helping foreigners invest in the\npotential of the country with a view to laying down\nmaterial and technical foundations that can help the country\nsay goodbye to underdevelopment by the year 2020. This\nis a major and arduous task which the Government will\nwork hard to fulfil.\nIn its foreign relations, the Government of the Lao\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic intends to continue its policy\nof peace, independence, friendship and cooperation with all\ncountries and international and non-governmental\norganizations. For now, it will focus its efforts on preparing\nthe conditions necessary for us to be able to join the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1997.\nThis will enable the country to develop along the general\nlines of other countries in the region and throughout the\nworld. We are pleased that Cambodia and Myanmar have\nindicated that they too wish to join ASEAN.\nPositive developments are taking place in the\ninternational economic situation. Some countries are\nshowing signs of progress. However, there have been no\nindications that the world economy will make a speedy and\nlasting recovery. Increased interdependence and\nglobalization in the international economy have both\nprovided new opportunities and caused new tensions and\nimbalances, and have, in particular, increased the\nmarginalization of developing countries. The entire\ninternational community must act together to ensure that\nthere will be a more favourable and more equitable\ninternational economic environment in which developing\ncountries can effectively wage their struggle against poverty\nin order to achieve progress throughout their societies.\nThe right to decent housing for all is essential in\nguaranteeing stability and sound development in the socio-\neconomic sphere. We are therefore pleased to note the\naccomplishments of the United Nations Conference on\nHuman Settlements, held in June at Istanbul. The Lao\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic is also pleased to note the\npositive results achieved at the ninth United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development, which took place\nlast May in Midrand, South Africa.\nRecently, the World Congress against Commercial\nSexual Exploitation of Children, held in Stockholm,\nSweden, seriously considered the troubling situation in\nwhich every year, more than a million children throughout\nthe world are victims of abusers of all sorts, and\npresented various measures to the international\ncommunity to combat this new danger which threatens the\nfuture of the new generation. The Lao Government\nsupports these efforts and is determined to implement\nthem in every manner possible.\nThe problem of drug abuse continues to weigh\nheavily on the international community. Because of its\nglobalization, this problem can be solved only through\neffective international cooperation founded on the\nprinciple of shared responsibility. In recent years, the\nGovernment of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has\nformulated a comprehensive programme for drug control\nthrough the year 2000, which consists in a gradual\nreduction in poppy cultivation through the implementation\nof integrated rural development projects. Given the\nseriousness of drugs in our society, we have recently\namended our penal code and laid down more severe\nsentences for such offenses. We have achieved a certain\nnumber of satisfying results in implementing this\nprogramme, although a great deal remains to be done.\nWith the cooperation and assistance of friendly countries\nand international and non-governmental organizations, we\nhope to be able to make even greater progress in the\nfuture, which will contribute to the international\ncommunity\u2019s effort to eradicate this scourge from the face\nof the Earth.\nThe environment is one of the issues to which the\ninternational community attaches great importance.\nDeveloped and developing countries alike have a\nsovereign, sacred right to exploit their natural resources.\nIn exercising this fundamental right, sustained, economic\ngrowth must go hand in hand with environment\nprotection, and vice versa. Environmental protection\nshould in no way imply a rejection of economic\ndevelopment out of fear of damaging the environment. As\nthe two pillars of lasting development in all countries,\nthese concepts must be mutually reinforcing. It would be\n6\n\n\nunwise, in our view, to emphasize one at the expense of the\nother. Only equal regard for these two aspects will\nguarantee the success of any development effort.\nWe live in a complex and still uncertain world. In this\ncontext, nations and peoples throughout the world accord\ngreat importance to the United Nations, the only universal\nmultilateral forum for the consideration of world problems.\nIn order to ensure that it can discharge its great duties, the\ninstitution needs to adapt itself to new world realities. In\nthis vein, it is essential to affirm the role of the General\nAssembly, where all States are represented, as the United\nNations system\u2019s principal organ for deliberation and\ndecision-making. As for the Security Council, the Lao\ndelegation believes that it should be restructured and made\nmore democratic, and that there should be a limited\nexpansion in the number of its permanent and non-\npermanent members according to equitable geographic\ndistribution and taking into account the relative importance\nof the various countries. In an effort to achieve this goal,\ncertain countries, such as Japan, Germany and India in\nparticular, should become permanent members of the\nSecurity Council. The Security Council would thus be in a\nposition to meet the legitimate aspirations of Member\nStates, and particularly of the developing countries, which\nconstitute the vast majority of nations on our planet. In this\nvein, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, in cooperation\nwith other delegations, will spare no effort to positively\ncontribute to the current efforts to strengthen our universal\nOrganization.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should first like to greet you,\nSir, and to wish you a successful term as President of the\nGeneral Assembly. I am also happy to inform the Assembly\nthat I come here today from Bosnia, where there is no\nkilling any more. I make both of these statements with\ngreat satisfaction.\nAllow me now to deliver a less optimistic page of my\naddress. While flying to New York the day before\nyesterday I read an article published in a prominent\nAmerican newspaper that dealt with the provision of the\nBosnian army with arms during the war. The author of the\narticle does not say so explicitly, but he implies that\neverything that is Muslim smells of terrorism. For him, it\nseems it is enough to have a Muslim name and to wear\na beard to be suspicious. The writer also mentions a\nnumber of people. Their only fault is that they helped the\nBosnian army to obtain some arms during the war. Today,\nthere are more than a billion Muslims world wide. I do\nnot know in whose interest it is, in this or similar articles,\nto push them into the embrace of the extremists.\nOur country and people went through hell. The\nworld deemed that it had the right to impose an arms\nembargo; we believed that we had the right to self-\ndefence. In a competition between those two rights, we\nbelieved, and we still believe, that our right was greater.\nTherefore, I am not going to apologize to anyone for our\nhaving done everything possible to secure arms in order\nto survive. On the contrary, I pay tribute to all brave\npeople, and express my gratitude to all of the friendly\ncountries that assisted us during the war. That page of our\nhistory is over, and we are turning to a new one: Peace.\nI thank the United States of America for starting the\ninitiative for peace and for making efforts, together with\nother countries, to strengthen this fragile and complex\npeace.\nWe are a small country, and we must pursue an\nopen and honest policy. Secret diplomacy and double\ngames are privileges of the mighty. For this and many\nother reasons, among which is also the aforementioned\narticle, I should like to reiterate some facts and our\nobjectives.\n\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina is possible only as a\ndemocratic State of three equal nations and of free citizens.\nWe accept this fundamental provision of the Dayton Peace\nAgreement, with all of its consequences. That is, the well-\nknown formula: one State, two entities, three nations.\nIt is often considered that the Dayton Agreement is not\ngood enough. It is good because it has stopped the killing\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina and because a better plan does\nnot exist. Its main deficiency is not in it, but in its\nimplementation. All of the bad aspects of the Agreement\ncould be improved if it were completely and consistently\nimplemented. Unfortunately, this is not the case. According\nto the provisions of the Agreement, \u201cHerceg-Bosna\u201d,\nestablished as a parallel State during the war, should cease\nto exist. But it still exists and impedes the building up of\nthe Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe Dayton peace accord provides that the second\nentity, the Republika Srpska, should facilitate the return to\ntheir homes of more than half a million Bosniaks and\nCroats who have been expelled. This is not happening;\nrather, expulsions are continuing.\nGenerally speaking, the problem of the Dayton Peace\nAgreement lies in its selective, that is, partial\nimplementation. The Serbs, for instance, like paragraph 2\nof Annex 4, which mentions the Republika Srpska, yet they\ndo not like Annex 7, which demands the return of people\nwho have been expelled. They accept the first provision and\nreject the second one. The world, and above all, the Contact\nGroup members, should tell them explicitly that the Dayton\naccord is a whole. If there is no return of the expelled\npeople, there is no Republika Srpska. Otherwise, the\nDayton Agreement will grow from a small and bearable\ninjustice into a huge and intolerable injustice \u2014 and an\nintolerable injustice leads to new conflict.\nThe provisions of the Dayton Agreement stipulate that\nthere should be respect for human rights but, nevertheless,\nhuman rights are being violated more or less throughout the\nentire territory.\nThe September elections and the pre-election campaign\noffered an opportunity to test this in a very effective\nmanner. Conditions are particularly bad in this regard in the\nterritory of Republika Srpska. For the people from the\nFederation, neither before nor during the elections was there\nfreedom of movement, or it was very limited; and only\nSerbian political parties could act. Moreover, the electoral\nboards that registered the voters and counted the ballots\nconsisted in all cases of only one nation and, very often,\none party.\nWith regard to free media, significant progress has\nbeen achieved only in the territory of the legal Bosnian\nGovernment, where a large number of independent\nnewspapers and magazines, 40 radio stations, and 12\ntelevision stations operate. During the last 50 days of the\npre-election period, the ruling party had only one-tenth of\nthe allotted time available at prime time on the State\ntelevision station, Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nfrom 8 p.m. to 12 p.m., while opposition parties had nine-\ntenths of the allotted time at their disposal. The\nGovernment also granted preliminary approval to the\nOpen Broadcasting Network and stands ready to extend\nthis approval on the condition that the Open Broadcasting\nNetwork covers the entire territory of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and is open to all the political tendencies,\nleft and right.\nThe issue of Brcko will be solved by the main\nArbitrator, Mr. Roberts Owen, an American, since the\nSerbian side does not attend the meetings of the\nArbitration Commission. Both parties have presented their\narguments. I wish to emphasize that, in making his\ndecision, the Arbitrator will not be totally free. He is\nbound by respect for the principles of legality and equity,\nas explicitly stated in Annex 2, Article V of the Dayton\nAgreement.\nI will complete this brief analysis of the\nimplementation of the Dayton Agreement by stating that\nthe main war criminals, Karadzic\u00b4 and Mladic\u00b4, are still\nfree, in spite of Dayton, in spite of the orders of the\nHague Tribunal and in spite of the elementary demands\nof justice.\nWe would like to proclaim the principle of\nreconciliation of peoples and nations. Bosnia needs this.\nHere, no one advocates the idea of the collective guilt of\na nation. Guilt is always individual, regardless of the\nnumber of perpetrators. But for the people to be absolved\nand for the road towards reconciliation to be open, the\ncriminals must be punished. That is why the international\ntribunal in the Hague was established, but, as is well\nknown, neither the chief Prosecutor nor the President of\nthe Tribunal are satisfied with what the international\ncommunity is doing. In vain, they repeatedly indict the\nperpetrators and forward the warrants. Even on the issue\nof war crimes, the world is seeking some painless middle-\nground solution. When the issue of war crimes like those\ncommitted in Bosnia and Herzegovina comes into\n2\n\n\nquestion, every compromise is a shameful betrayal of\njustice. Unpunished war criminals will continue to poison\nthe world and ruin its institutions.\nSome people in Europe, and in the United States also,\nask whether, after everything that has happened, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is possible. These people either do not know\nthe facts or are morally corrupt. They do not know that on\nthe territory of the Serb entity, over half a million people,\n40 per cent of the indigenous pre-war population of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, were either killed or expelled, and they\nare totally indifferent to this fact. My answer is that if\ngenocide without punishment is possible, then Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is not possible.\nSo the real question is not whether the people can live\ntogether, it is more concrete and more straightforward: does\na larger nation have the right to expel a smaller nation and\nthen, under the slogan \u201cwe cannot live together\u201d, usurp its\nproperty and demand that these violations be forgotten and\nlegalized? This is how the question \u201cis Bosnia and\nHerzegovina possible?\u201d should be formulated. And for\npeople of principle and morality, the answer is clear.\nFinally, what should the future Government of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina do at this crucial and historic moment for\nBosnia and Herzegovina? In my opinion, it should be\nconstituted as a maximally representative Government\ncomposed of all the relevant political actors in conformity\nwith the results of the elections, including an opposition\nfrom both entities. It should thereafter proclaim that its\nprogramme consists of at least three points. First, it should\nrequest from all the signatories of the Dayton Peace\nAgreement that the Agreement be fully and consistently\nimplemented. At this moment, all the domestic as well as\ninternational actors, at least verbally, express their support\nfor this Agreement. The Government should hold them to\ntheir words. International pressure in this regard will be\nnecessary for a long time.\nSecondly, the Government should proclaim the\nreconciliation of the peoples and nations on the condition\nthat war criminals are prosecuted vigorously. And thirdly,\nthe Government should ensure freedom of the media as a\nway to heal the country. The media started the war several\nyears ago with the unprecedented spread of hatred. The\nmedia can have the same influence in strengthening peace\nthrough spreading tolerance and understanding among the\npeople. State radio and television were an appropriate\nexample during the election campaign. The Open\nBroadcasting Network could also contribute to this if it is\nopen to all ideas and all political directions and if it is\nregulated by Parliament.\nThis programme cannot be carried out by the\nGovernment alone. Bosnia and Herzegovina is still a\nrecovering patient and it needs the world\u2019s support. The\npresence of international military forces will be\nindispensable for a certain limited period of time, and\neconomic assistance will be necessary for longer.\nBefore I conclude, I would like to say a few words\nabout the United Nations. We support reform of the\nUnited Nations system. The changes are necessary not\nonly in the Organization but in its psychology as well, if\nI may say so. Reform of the Security Council is also\nnecessary, in conformity with the changes in the world,\nand also to ensure a new attitude towards obligations. The\nUnited Nations must not undertake obligations it cannot\ncarry out. This is impermissible. My people have paid an\ninfinitely high price for this irresponsibility.\nThe \u201csafe area\u201d of Srebrenica and its more than\n8,000 innocent victims are not the only, but are the\ngravest, example of this incomprehensible attitude. We do\nnot know who is responsible, but we seek reforms which\nwill ensure that this will never happen again.\nYesterday, in this very building, I signed the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We are a small\ncountry, and my signature on that Treaty is not of great\nsignificance. Nevertheless, we want to participate, even if\nonly symbolically, in everything that is constructive. One\nday Bosnia and Herzegovina, through its representative,\nwill sign a treaty on the suppression of terrorism, and\nsome other day a treaty on the struggle against drugs and\norganized crime. I hope that in future Bosnia and\nHerzegovina will join in any activity whose aim is to\nconfront evil, and that it will continually push the limits\nin the direction of good and towards a better and safer\nworld.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the State of Kuwait, it gives me\ngreat pleasure to extend to Mr. Razali our sincere\ncongratulations on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-first session.\nGiven his personal experience and wisdom, we\nbelieve that he will be able to guide our discussions\nefficiently towards a successful conclusion. Since he\nrepresents a sister Muslim country, I am particularly\npleased to take this opportunity to underscore the firm\nbonds of brotherhood in Islam between Malaysia and\nKuwait.\nI am pleased to use this occasion also, to pay tribute\nto the President of the previous session of the Assembly\nfor his outstanding efforts and contributions during that\nhistoric session.\nKuwait views with pride and acknowledgement the\nimpressive performance of the Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, especially his\nleading role in and commitment to the enhancement of\nthe functioning of the world Organization in the areas of\nglobal peace, security and development. Mr. Boutros-\nGhali has consistently worked to restructure the United\nNations to bring it more into line with the aspirations and\nexpectations attached to it. I want to make special\nmention of the concrete steps the Secretary-General has\ntaken to curb and rationalize expenditures, to streamline\nthe administrative structure, and to reorganize the\nSecretariat in order to reflect current realities in the global\narena. Hence, Kuwait subscribes to the position adopted\nby the League of Arab States and the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) in supporting the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s bid to remain on board in order to pursue his\nreform programme for the revitalization of the United\nNations.\n19\n\n\nLast year, the family of nations observed the fiftieth\nanniversary of the establishment of the United Nations\nagainst a backdrop of universal recognition of the\nwonderful achievements of the United Nations system. The\nrecord includes, to cite only a few areas: assistance in the\nattainment of national independence by many States; the\nestablishment of the principles contained in the Charter,\nincluding the right to self-determination; the consolidation\nof codes of civilized conduct among States; the upholding\nof justice and equality; and the promotion of economic and\nsocial development. Perhaps the most shining success of the\nUnited Nations is the peacekeeping operations it carries out\nin many volatile regions of the world. Such operations have\nrecently assumed a new humanitarian dimension in the\nform of relief efforts in cases of natural disasters and civil\nwar, and election monitoring.\nWe view the United Nations as a forum for debating\nthe future of humankind among nations, with a view to\npromoting the well-being, dignity and basic freedoms of the\nhuman person. The ever-increasing complexity of\ncontemporary life in this global village and the ever-\nchanging set of common and pressing issues which continue\nto emerge require a concerted international effort through\nthe United Nations. By the same token, we must admit that\nthere are gargantuan challenges that continue to face the\nUnited Nations, most poignantly the ethnic and regional\nconflicts that endanger regional stability and the\ninternational security system. Other pressing issues include\nthe population explosion, environmental degradation, the\nwater shortage, desertification, the food deficit, the growing\ngap between the North and the South, the regional arms\nrace, the threat posed by nuclear weapons, the proliferation\nof weapons of mass destruction, development concerns,\nbarriers to economic and trade cooperation, the removal of\nrestrictions on free trade and, last but not least, human\nrights.\nTo rally all States members of the world community\nround ways to deal with the fundamental transformations\nthat face the world, we must: believe in the energy,\npotential and mechanisms of the United nations system to\nbe able to address global concerns in a multilateral fashion;\nprovide enthusiastic financial, political and moral support\nfor the United Nations and identify with its principles and\npurposes; fully pay assessed contributions to the United\nNations budget; and actively pursue a genuinely peaceful\npolicy that recognizes and respects the rights and legitimate\nconcerns of other Member States, with a view to building\nup a regional order in line with the norms of international\nbehaviour. Accordingly, regional arrangements should be\nanchored in the established codes of justice and rules of\ninternational law and treaties. Here we must ensure\nrespect for human rights, and protect human dignity and\nthe freedom of choice. In this context, human\ndevelopment without discrimination is essential for the\noverall economic and social development of society. Top\npriority should be given to this goal rather than to\nsquandering national resources on weaponry. We must\nface up to terrorism and muster the national will to work\ncollectively on a global level to stamp out the root causes\nof this plague which afflicts both the weak and the strong,\nthe poor and the rich, for, in the final analysis, terrorism\nis not susceptible to reason; it stems from bigotry,\ntraumatizes the innocent, resorts to violence and seeks no\ndialogue.\nAgainst this backdrop, the indisputable fact remains\nthat today\u2019s world is interdependent in its security as well\nas in its general concerns. The affluent few may not be\nable to live in exclusive comfort while a majority of\nhumankind is marginalized in deprivation and poverty.\nHere emerges the stark need for a collective conceptual\nand material effort to develop a common agenda for the\nbenefit of all human beings.\nIt is from this perspective that we view the\nsignificance of the revitalization and refashioning of\nUnited Nations organs to keep abreast of the rapid\ndevelopment of international relations. In this context,\nKuwait is following closely the ongoing discussions in the\nOpen-Ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\nSecurity Council. We had hoped that consensus would\nhave been reached on the restructuring and reform of the\nSecurity Council to coincide with the celebration of the\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations last year.\nFailure to attain that goal so far should not dampen our\nhopes. Rather, we should redouble our efforts towards\nthat end. Our aim should be a Security Council whose\nwork and procedures are more transparent. Its resolutions\nshould reflect more faithfully the will of the universal\nmembership of the United Nations. Its composition should\nbe expanded to reflect the recent increase in membership,\nsovereign equality among States and the equitable\ngeographical distribution of seats among the various\nregional groups.\nAny reform of the Security Council must in the end\nensure collective efforts by both members of the Council\nand other members of the international community to\nrespect and implement its resolutions. The Council should\nbe able to demonstrate its firm resolve against any regime\nthat does not comply with Council resolutions.\n20\n\n\nA textbook case in point is the just position towards\nthe Iraqi regime adopted by the Council and supported by\nthe international community as a whole. As recently as\n23 June 1996, leaders of Arab States, in the final statement\nissued at the end of the extraordinary Arab Summit in\nCairo, urged the Iraqi Government:\n\u201cnot to embark on any aggressive policies aimed at\nprovoking its Arab neighbours and to implement in\nfull all the relevant Security Council resolutions and\nespecially those requiring it to take the necessary\nmeasures to release all Kuwaiti and third-country\nprisoners and detainees, to return the property seized\nand to comply with the compensation mechanism.\nThey regard this as the right way to ensure that the\nsanctions imposed on Iraq are lifted and the\nappropriate conditions created for Iraq to resume its\nrole in the inter-Arab regional order.\u201d (A/50/986,\nappendix, p. 7)\nThis statement shows a recognition by the Arab\nleaders of the nature of the Iraqi regime and their\nappreciation for the importance of the full implementation\nof all relevant Security Council resolutions. Hence, Iraq\nmust cooperate sincerely with the International Committee\nof the Red Cross in order to account for all Kuwaiti and\nthird-country prisoners and detainees, so that the chapter on\nthis human tragedy can be closed. We must note with regret\nhere that the Tripartite Commission, which meets every\nthree months in Geneva, and its Technical Subcommittee,\nwhich meets monthly on issues relating to the border\nbetween Iraq and Kuwait, have so far gotten nowhere. In\npoint of fact, the Iraqi regime exploits such meetings for\npropaganda purposes.\nI must reiterate here that this question of prisoners and\nhostages remains a human tragedy precipitated by the Iraqi\nregime. And it remains a top-priority humanitarian issue for\nthe people and Government of Kuwait.\nThe Iraqi regime is legally bound to cooperate with\nthe United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in\neliminating its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.\nUNSCOM's bitter experience shows that the Iraqi regime\nwill not pass up any opportunity to use it for deception,\nmisinformation and the concealment of required data. It\neven went so far as to block repeatedly the work of\nUNSCOM inspectors as recently as March, June and\nAugust of this year, thus prompting the Security Council to\nadopt resolution 1060 (1996) in addition to presidential\nstatements issued by way of warning to the Iraqi regime.\nKuwait, keen as it is on ensuring the safety and\nstability of the region, supports UNSCOM efforts. Indeed,\nwe commend UNSCOM for its resolve and its insistence\non the absolute necessity of implementing all provisions\nrelating to the liquidation of Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nGiven the human suffering of the brotherly people of\nIraq emanating from the policies of the ruling regime,\nKuwait continues to provide humanitarian relief assistance\nin kind to the Iraqi refugees. We also welcomed the\naccord reached between Iraq and the United Nations on\nthe implementation of Security Council resolution 986\n(1995) as a step forward towards alleviating the suffering\nof the Iraqi people.\nLet me take this occasion to reiterate Kuwait\u2019s\nposition that Iraq\u2019s unity and territorial integrity must be\npreserved. In the meantime, we understand \u2014 indeed\nappreciate \u2014 all measures taken by the Coalition States\nin order to ensure the full implementation by Iraq of all\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. The essence and\nthrust of these resolutions is the evolution of a regional\norder anchored in the established principles of justice and\nstability, the rule of law, observance of the norms of\ninternational behaviour, and respect for international\ntreaties, at the core of which is the Charter of the United\nNations.\nIn view of Kuwait\u2019s concern for peace and security\nin the Arabian Gulf region, and by virtue of our close\nrelations with our sister State, the United Arab Emirates,\nand with our friendly neighbour, the Islamic Republic of\nIran, Kuwait associates itself with the position of the Gulf\nCooperation Council (GCC) regarding the issue of the\nislands. Kuwait calls upon the two parties to continue\ntheir negotiations in a bid to reach a just and peaceful\nsettlement through dialogue.\nOn another regional matter, Kuwait fully supports\nthe sister State of Bahrain in the recent measures it took\nto combat terrorism with a view to consolidating its\nsecurity and stability. Our position is in harmony with the\nprinciple that the GCC member States have a common\ndestiny, and their security and stability are therefore\nindivisible.\nKuwait has been following with grave concern the\nstalling of the Middle East peace process following the\nelection of a new Government in Israel, which adopted a\nseries of positions that contradict the arrangements\nworked out in Madrid, primarily the land-for-peace\n21\n\n\nformula and the implementation of Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) towards a\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East.\nThe recent Cairo summit document underscored the\nadherence by the Arab States to the peace process, in order\nto achieve the ultimate goal of a just and comprehensive\npeace, as a strategic option under the umbrella of\ninternational law. The Arab position requires a matching\ncommitment by Israel to work in a sincere and forthright\nfashion all the way through until the overall peace process\nis completed. This must include the restoration of rights and\nthe return of occupied territories, as well as ensuring\nsecurity and a strategic balance of all States of the region,\nin accordance with the principles laid down in Madrid.\nFor the record, let me recall in this context that\nKuwait put the question of Palestine among its top\nconcerns. In point of fact, that issue has been central to our\nrelations with other members of the international\ncommunity. We have channelled enormous effort and\nresources into this cause, since Kuwait has always believed\nthat Israel has not recognized the legitimate rights of the\nPalestinian people to self-determination and statehood \u2014 let\nalone the fact that it has seized Palestinian territory in total\ndisregard of United Nations resolutions and by using force\nas a means of imposing faits accomplis. We demand that\nthe Israeli Government stop its settlement activities in the\nPalestinian territories, especially in the Holy City of\nJerusalem, and that it cease forthwith all changes to its\nArab character and legal status. The refugee problem must\nalso be resolved according to United Nations resolutions.\nFinally, a Palestinian state must be established with\nJerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the will of the\nPalestinian people.\nIn this context, we condemn the steps taken by Israel\nin commissioning and excavating a tunnel under the\nwestern wall of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. This constitutes a\ndesecration of that holy site and is a provocation to the\npeople of Palestine \u2014 indeed to all Arabs and Muslims\nthroughout the world. The use of great force and violence\nby Israel has left many people dead or wounded. We\ndemand that Israel put an immediate end to these practices\nand that it fulfil its obligations to preserve the Arabic and\nIslamic character of these holy places.\nLasting and comprehensive peace requires mutual\naccommodation of the parties\u2019 rights, compliance with\naccords concluded, action in good faith, avoidance of\nprovocative acts, and long-term vision \u2014 all with a view\nnot to inflict injury on any major party to the peace\nequation.\nWithdrawal by Israel from the Golan is a litmus test\nof its good intentions to achieve a just and balanced\npeace. Therefore, Kuwait supports Syria\u2019s position that\nnegotiations should resume from the point at which they\nceased, in view of the fact that the peace process is a\ncontinuum that should not stop before reaching its\nultimate destination.\nKuwait also supports Lebanon in its legitimate\ninsistence that Israel must fulfil all provisions of Security\nCouncil resolution 425 (1978), under which Israel must\nwithdraw fully and unconditionally from all Lebanese\nterritory under occupation.\nWe believe that, in the final analysis, world peace is\nindivisible and that consequently, the question of global\nsecurity has worldwide ramifications. Hence we think that\nthe issues of ethnic strife and civil war should remain on\nthe international agenda. Thus, we welcome the peaceful\nmeasures taken thus far in the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina with a view to bringing that tragedy to an\nend while ensuring that the people of that Republic are\naccorded their legitimate rights. We also welcome the\noutcome of the recently held elections there and\ncongratulate President Alija Izetbegovic\u00b4 on the well-\ndeserved confidence placed in him.\nWe also call upon the international community to\npursue its efforts towards ending the current tragedies that\nafflict Somalia, Afghanistan and Burundi. In the same\nvein, we hope that the peoples of those countries will be\nresponsive to the efforts of the international community.\nKuwait notes with satisfaction the success of the\nUnited Nations earlier this month in the adoption of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which\nis the culmination of a long-standing universal effort and\nof hopes for a safer world. Indeed, the CTBT represents\nan essential step forward on the path towards the\nelimination of nuclear weapons.\nCooperation among member States of the\ninternational community in the economic and trade\nspheres has engendered a welcome openness following\nthe conclusion of the world free trade agreement. We\nhope that this accord will expand the volume of the\ndeveloping countries\u2019 exports to the world markets.\nKuwait was in the vanguard of advocating the removal of\ntrade barriers simply because we believe that, in the\n22\n\n\ncontext of an interdependent globe, collective political\nsecurity cannot be isolated from the economic concerns of\nnations. Against this background, we welcome the steps\nalready taken by some developing countries to readjust their\neconomic approaches towards genuine openness and the\nadoption of free-market policies. In our view, this type of\nrestructuring will help attract foreign investments and\naccelerate the transfer of technology, which, in the end, will\nfoster international economic relations in terms of\ngenerating a freer cash flow, a better investment\nenvironment and an increase in joint ventures.\nKuwait believes in the need to harness human energies\nto narrow the gaps that exist among nations, based on a\ncommon understanding of the tenets that underpin world\nsecurity and economic well-being. We also believe that\ndialogue and the tolerant exchange of views, coupled with\nsincere and determined joint action, will lay a solid\nfoundation for improved international relations. Under this\nscenario, the good forces will combine to neutralize the evil\nones; the \u201chaves\u201d and the \u201chave-nots\u201d might stand a better\nchance of interacting beneficially; reason and prudence will\nreign supreme, while the outlaws, saboteurs and vicious\ntyrants will continue to lose ground. In the end, living\nconditions will improve under a new world order based on\nthe principles of justice, which promote peace and security\nfor all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Our two countries have since joined\nhands in cooperative relations, which are growing from\nstrength to strength. I congratulate you and wish you\nevery success in your challenging task.\nYour Prime Minister, Mr. Mahathir Mohamad, is a\ngreat friend of the Namibian people. His eloquent voice\nilluminates the burning international issues advocated by\nthe South. It also serves to define most clearly the basis\nof South-North dialogue, as well as the vital work being\ndone for the developing countries by the Group of 77 and\nChina.\nYour predecessor, Mr. Diogo Feitas do Amaral,\nearned himself a place of honour in the annals of history\nby presiding over the fiftieth commemorative session of\nthe General Assembly. I commend him for his valuable\nefforts and constructive contribution.\nOur illustrious Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, has been a devoted champion of the\nCharter of the United Nations, a firm reformer and an\nindefatigable promoter of peace, social development and\npeacekeeping throughout the world. Africa holds the\nSecretary-General in high esteem and supports his tireless\nefforts in behalf of peace and a better future for\nhumanity, an outlook that is common to the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU), the United Nations and the\nNon-Aligned Movement.\nAt the most recent OAU summit, held at Yaound\u00e9,\nAfrican leaders demonstrated unity and solidarity by\nendorsing Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for reelection as\nSecretary-General of the United Nations. Namibia stands\nbehind that decision.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations was a\ncelebration of the success and durability of our\nOrganization. At the same time, it was a celebration of\nthe triumph of the will and determination of world leaders\nand citizens alike to conquer tyranny, hegemony, poverty,\n5\n\n\nilliteracy, social inequities and underdevelopment amidst the\nwealth and knowledge that abound in the world.\nPresident Nujoma had this to say last year, from this\nrostrum:\n\u201cDuring the past 50 years, this Organization has\nserved humanity as a universal market-place of great\nideas and collective action.\u201d(Official Records of the\nGeneral Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings,\n35th meeting, p. 10)\nPresident Nujoma has also said that the promotion of\nworld peace and security was meant to save succeeding\ngenerations from the scourge of war and, moreover, to\npromote social progress and better standards of life in\nlarger freedom. These are living commitments for all\nnations and peoples and must be realized fully. They bind\nus together as members of one human race and as each\nother\u2019s keepers.\nYou, Mr. President, issued a charge to the fifty-first\nsession of the General Assembly in your acceptance speech\non 17 September 1996. I thought its essence was\nencapsulated in these words, which seemed to echo what\nmy leader had said:\n\u201cThe United Nations must begin to embed itself\nin reality and push the critical issues, especially\npoverty and social injustice, to the centre of national\nand public debate. What will it take to do this? Of\nimmediate need is political will by Member States to\ncommit to the principles of democracy and\naccountability. The nature of democratic practice\nneeded for such an enterprise is one based on careful\ndeliberation and consultation so that compromise to\nthe lowest value is minimized in favour of optimizing\nthe best options that will protect universal values.\u201d\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-First\nSession, Plenary Meetings, first meeting, p. 4)\nI could hardly agree more with those sentiments.\nI shall never be convinced, and I shall never succumb\nto the notion, that nuclear weapons assure world peace and\nsecurity, development, prosperity or equality among nations.\nOn the contrary, I am convinced that peace, disarmament,\ndemocracy, multilateral cooperation and resource allocation\ncan unleash human ingenuity and industry for development\nand social progress.\nIt is for these reasons that Namibia insists on\ncomplete nuclear disarmament in all respects. The other\nday I signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\non behalf of the Republic of Namibia, not out of\ncomplete satisfaction but to encourage the ongoing work\ntowards disarmament, bearing in mind the constructive\nand timely advisory opinion of the International Court of\nJustice on nuclear weapons, as well as the Treaties of\nPelindaba, Rarotonga and Tlatelolco, which created\nnuclear-free zones in Africa, the South Pacific and Latin\nAmerica respectively.\nAfrica is bleeding, just as the souls of our people,\nthe African people, are burning in misery and mayhem.\nTheir precious humanity and lives have been denuded of\ndignity and worth. How long must this carnage and\ndehumanization be allowed to continue in Somalia,\nBurundi and other tormented places in Africa?\nThe glimmer of hope in Liberia engendered by the\nrecently concluded peace accord, brokered by States\nmembers of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS), and the inauguration of Mrs. Ruth\nPerry as the first-ever woman Head of State in Africa,\nmust not be snatched away again by unscrupulous power-\ngrabbers and political opportunists. Rather, the newly\ninaugurated Head of State must be given all the support\nshe needs to pursue a national course of democratization,\nreconciliation and reconstruction for all Liberians.\nThe long-standing partnership and cooperation\nbetween the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and\nthe United Nations should be brought to bear in the\nemerging favourable situation in Liberia with a view to\nstabilizing the transition and to preventing any military\nreversals. Just as peacekeeping cannot be successful\nwithout international involvement, so also do regional\npost-conflict peace-building and reconstruction depend on\ninternational support to be successful. It is here where\npreventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and peacemaking\ncome together to do good for all.\nMr. Salim Ahmed Salim, the very able and\nhardworking Secretary-General of the OAU, is anxious to\napply in all those conflict situations, the Mechanism for\nConflict Prevention, Management and Resolution. But he\nis short of resources, including personnel, as well as of\nappropriate capacity to do the job. Namibia will continue\nto make its contribution in spite of its limited means. We\nurge the international community to render generous\nassistance to the OAU for this purpose.\n6\n\n\nDrug trafficking is a horrendous killer disease which\npermeates the social fabric of society. Drug lords are\nnotorious gangsters not unlike those responsible for\norganized crime, with corrupting inroads into Governments,\nbusinesses and civil society, targeting youth, students and\neven small children. The member States of the Southern\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) recently signed\na protocol on drug trafficking in our region and agreed to\ncoordinate their law enforcement efforts to combat this\nmenace jointly.\nToday, the risk of dying due to anti-personnel\nlandmines in many parts of the world has increased\nastronomically. This risk exists in southern Africa as well,\nmainly in Angola, but also in Mozambique and Namibia.\nThis is another area in which SADC is combining the\nefforts of its members with a view to regional initiatives.\nCooperation between SADC and the European Union\nhas made it possible for us to benefit from resources and\nexpertise to deal more effectively with this very serious\nproblem. That is why Namibia welcomes the initiative\ntaken on this matter by my colleague, Mr. Klaus Kinkel,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of\nGermany, and supports his Seven-Point-Action Programme\non Anti-Personnel Mines.\nIn this connection, we encourage other ongoing\ninitiatives aimed at banning anti-personnel landmines, as\nwell as the commendable work which some countries are\ndoing in the field of demining, including in Namibia.\nNamibia therefore supports the inclusion of a ban on\nanti-personnel landmines in the agenda of the forthcoming\nsession of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.\nIn the interest of democratization and national\nreconciliation, and in order to mitigate the existing harsh\nand racially biased social disparities which we inherited\nfrom the apartheid order, Namibia has been pleading with\nthe United Nations and the rest of the international\ncommunity for least-developed country status. So far, this\nplea has remained unheeded in the main, but, to be fair, not\nentirely. While renewing our plea, it is worth\nacknowledging with appreciation the implementation of\nGeneral Assembly resolution 46/204, concerning \u201cas if\u201d\nleast-developed country status, which has aided Namibia in\nsome constructive ways. This was made possible by United\nNations Member States, as well as by specialized agencies.\nWe thank them all for their support and also for having\nextended the \u201cas if\u201d least-developed status for an additional\nthree years.\nWe believe, as most do, that economic growth, job\ncreation, human resource development and gender\nequality must be visible and qualitative in content as\ncritical weapons against social dislocations and strife.\nWithout exception, during last year\u2019s fiftieth\nanniversary commemoration of the founding of the United\nNations, world leaders dealt, one way or another, with the\ndemocratization, restructuring and revitalization of the\nUnited Nations. This was as it ought to be. Systemic\nreform of the United Nations was already overdue\ndecades ago.\nWhile the reform process itself is still very much on\ncourse, its forward momentum seems to have been\ndeflected for one reason or another.\nThe common position shared by the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU), the Non-Aligned Movement and\nother fair-minded bodies and persons is based on the\nprinciple of equitable representation and transparency in\nterms of decision-making at all levels of our\nOrganization.\nIn this context, Africa, Asia and Latin America and\nthe Caribbean each deserve to be allocated at least two\npermanent seats on the Security Council, as well as a\nconcomitant increase of non-permanent seats in the spirit\nof democracy and fairness. Namibia has already expressed\non a number of occasions a position on the addition of\nJapan and Germany as permanent members of the\nSecurity Council, but not in isolation of the representation\nenvisaged for the aforementioned three continents.\nAt the same time, Namibia believes that the General\nAssembly was not meant by the authors of the United\nNations Charter to play second fiddle to any of the other\nprincipal organs. It is a universal parliament of equal\nmembers with the same preoccupation for world peace\nand security, as well as for human survival and\nprosperity.\nIt stands to reason, therefore, that United Nations\nreform must not end up by making the Assembly a rubber\nstamp of other principal organs, be it the Security Council\nor the Economic and Social Council. We should like, in\nthe end, to see well-balanced and mutually\ncomplementary organs and institutions of the United\nNations system.\nMultilateralism is the essence of the United Nations\nsystem. Decisions taken by the majority of Member States\n7\n\n\nshould not be changed in the interest of a few through\nadministrative fiat. It is for the General Assembly itself, if\nneed be, to reconsider or to change any programme\nactivities or personnel requirements approved previously.\nIn addition to reaffirming their continued commitment\nto and strengthening, of South-South cooperation, the\nmember States of the Group of 77 and China, in their latest\nreport, renewed their call for a just and predictable\nmultilateral trading system that would ensure the complete\nintegration of the economies of the South into the world\neconomy and the emerging international trading system.\nTo this end, the South attaches great importance to the\nfirst Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\nOrganization, to be held in Singapore in December 1996.\nNamibia strongly supports this meeting.\nThe 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accord and the\nestablishment of the Palestinian Authority raised hopes for\nlasting peace in the Middle East. Regrettably, bloodshed\nand enmity are once again threatening to derail the Middle\nEast peace process.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu and President Arafat cannot\nafford to waste one more minute. An urgent one-on-one\nmeeting and joint action, which ought to be routine, to end\nthe vicious circle of violence should take place without\ndelay. The first step in this direction is putting an\nimmediate end to the creation of new settlements and to the\nreconstruction work in the Old City of Jerusalem. The\ninitiators as well as the supporters of the Madrid peace\nprocess should also bring their weight to bear towards\nrestoring the partnership for a comprehensive, just and\nlasting settlement, in the best interest of all parties in the\nMiddle East, especially in the exercise of self-determination\nby the Palestinians and the establishment of an independent\nstate of their own.\nAnd, of course, we are not forgetting Bosnia. Namibia\nhopes that the progress achieved so far will continue and\nwill eventually lead to lasting peace and reconciliation in\nthe area.\nNamibia cannot have a split personality on the\nquestion of self-determination and decolonization. Western\nSahara is crying out for self-determination and\ndecolonization. Only when these goals are fully realized can\nAfrica and the United Nations boast of the complete\npolitical emancipation of our beloved continent.\nNamibia welcomes the high-level contacts that the\nKingdom of Morocco and the Saharan Arab Democratic\nRepublic (SADR) have commenced. I should like to\nentreat them to maintain and invigorate these encouraging\npolitical talks. The objective we would all like to see\nimplemented, I believe, is the early holding of a United\nNations-sponsored referendum in which only the authentic\nSaharawis will be able to express their unfettered will and\nassume their destiny.\nThere is an extensive update on Angola in the\nSecretary-General\u2019s annual report. In his important\nstatement of 23 September 1996 to this Assembly, my\ncolleague, Venancio de Moura, Foreign Minister of\nAngola, provided representatives with useful additional\ninformation on the worrisome situation in his country,\ninclusive of constitutional and political issues.\nI can hardly add to this information. For Namibia,\nnonetheless, the suffering of our Angolan brothers and\nsisters, not to mention the children, is of paramount\nconcern. The other concern we have in Namibia is about\nthe fast-approaching deadline of the presence of the\nUnited Nations Angola Verification Mission\n(UNAVEM III) in Angola, which includes financial\nimplications arising out of the obstacles and delays which\nkeep cropping up in the implementation of the Lusaka\nProtocol. Be that as it may, Namibia is bound by blood\nand common destiny to stand with Angola. That is why\nour military contingent attached to UNAVEM III will\nremain in Angola until the Mission is satisfactorily\nconcluded.\nThis week, the leaders of the Southern African\nDevelopment Community Organ on Politics, Defence and\nSecurity, under the co-chairmanship of President Robert\nMugabe, will meet in Luanda to exchange views on the\ncritical situation in Angola and its implications for the\nregion, the United Nations and the world at large.\nPresident Nujoma will attend this crucial and timely\nmeeting.\nBefore concluding, let me say that an enduring\nchallenge for the United Nations, now and into the next\ncentury, is to reactivate multilateralism as the centrepiece\nof international relations and constructive cooperation in\nthe emerging world order.\nThis new world order cannot be built with a cold\nwar mind-set characterized by confrontation, military\nintervention, economic blockade and political\n8\n\n\nassassinations. There is no place for it in today\u2019s world of\ncooperation and open trade.\nThe General Assembly, where all United Nations\nMember States are represented, is the ideal forum for\nresolving the conflicts of interest of the haves and the\nhave-nots, guided by the principles of equality, justice and\nequity for all.\nFinally, let me end with President Nujoma\u2019s\nconcluding words, spoken here last year:\n\u201cThe future belongs to the youth and children.\nOur collective duty must be to reinforce their\nvision for a peaceful, harmonious and prosperous\nfuture in the spirit of brotherhood and\ncooperation\u201d. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nh"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a\nsource of profound satisfaction to see a diplomat of the\nexperience of Mr. Razali Ismail, representing Asia and the\nfriendly and brotherly country of Malaysia, presiding over\nthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly. I wish to\ncongratulate him on his well deserved election. I am\nconfident that, with his abilities, he will be able to steer\nthe work of this important session in an exemplary\nmanner. I assure him of the full cooperation of the\ndelegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran in discharging\nhis important mandate.\nThe developments during the last decade on the\nglobal scene, particularly the demise of the bipolar\ninternational system and the need to replace it with a new\n24\n\n\nworld order, have created many hopes and expectations.\nNations around the globe, irrespective of their diverse\ncultures, customs and religions, expected that on the\nthreshold of the twenty-first century the process for the\ncreation of a new world order characterized by collective\nparticipation and human development would emerge in a\nclimate governed by realism and a sober grasp of the\nessence of the ongoing changes in international relations.\nThe essence of these international developments was\nindeed the overwhelming rejection at the national level of\ntotalitarianism and dictatorship, with a profound message\nfor humanity at large: if we desire to construct a world of\ncollective participation and human development we must\nbuild international relations on the foundations of justice,\ntolerance, the rule of law, cooperation and transparency.\nHuman society hoped and expected that justice would\nguarantee the inalienable rights of all individuals, nations\nand States through a rejection of hegemony and special\nprivileges for a dominant few; they hoped that, through\nrecognition of diversity of cultures and beliefs, as well as\nrespect for the rights of all States, tolerance would facilitate\nintercultural communication and mutual understanding,\nthereby enriching common human civilization and\nempowering all members of the international community to\nparticipate fully and effectively in determining the shape\nand setting the norms and standards of behaviour in a\nfuture world. They hoped that the rule of law would ensure\nthe security and legitimate interests of individuals, groups\nand States.\nCooperation would replace confrontation, bringing\nabout joint human efforts to resolve common problems and\nto further common objectives. Transparency, by providing\nobjective and clear explanations and solutions to global\nissues, would consolidate mutual confidence at the\ninternational level.\nIn such a world, the United Nations occupies a\nparamount position. It embodies the hopes and aspirations\nof the entire membership of the international community,\nand as such, provides a suitable framework for collective,\ntransparent and rule-based international decision-making\nand implementation geared towards the promotion of the\ncommon good and the resolution of common ills. The\nconvening of many international conferences in the past\ndecade to articulate and codify further norms of behaviour\nfor an orderly new system, the relative success of the\nUnited Nations machinery in preventing and de-escalating\nmany international and regional conflicts, and the\nconstructive debate on reinvigorating the General Assembly\nand reforming the Security Council are positive examples\nproviding hopeful signals in that direction.\nOn the other hand, amid competition and rivalries\nfor the shaping of the emerging world order, a new\nphenomenon has surfaced. This phenomenon is so distant\nand alien from the universally envisaged world of\ncollective participation and human development that its\nconsolidation and persistence would send any hope for a\nglobal human society to the oblivion of more rivalries and\ninsecurity. Indeed, concurrent with the expansion of\nparticipatory democracy in many countries, a complex\nmovement has emerged towards autocracy or even\ntotalitarianism at the international level, a trend which is\nfounded on hegemony and flouts justice, freedom,\nparticipation, the rule of law, tolerance, human rights,\npluralism and democracy in a dangerous and\nunprecedented manner.\nThe evident behavioural characteristics of this\nmenace, disguised behind appealing facades, can be\nsummarized in the following manner: first, there is\nunilateralism, which means a total lack of commitment to\nmutual cooperation and common solutions, and complete\nreliance on unilateral measures in various fields. Second\ncomes opportunism, in which international forums are\nresorted to only as mechanisms for the promotion of\nnational self-interest and often in pursuit of a domestic\nagenda. Third, there is secrecy, which takes the form of\nan insistence on dogmatic, non-transparent and closed\nmethods and a rejection of transparency, which impedes\nthe abuse of multilateral arrangements. Fourth comes\nlawlessness, which is the evasion of the rule of law\ncoupled with audacity in breaking the law and universal\nnorms, even in a public and official manner. Fifth we\nhave imposition, which means the promotion of domestic\nagendas and national priorities through the imposition of\npolicies on others, including through the extra-territorial\napplication of domestic legislation. And sixth there is\ncoercion, the unbridled recourse to the threat and use of\nforce in international political, economic and commercial\nrelations.\nThe most notable manifestation of the new\ninternational totalitarianism surfaces in the cultural sphere.\nOur world is characterized by a diversity of religions,\ncivilizations, cultures and customs. This diversity has\nnaturally resulted in the emergence of many systems of\nlaw and values, with similarities as well as differences.\nRegrettably, the claimants of world leadership have either\nfailed to grasp this self-evident reality due to their own\nlack of historical and cultural depth or have found it\n25\n\n\nincompatible with their interests and therefore attempt to\nneglect it. More regrettable is the fact that the collaboration\nof certain other States in this field has exacerbated such\nopportunistic intolerance.\nIn this context, the misguided propaganda waged to\ndistort the image of Islam, and the unprecedented\nintolerance exhibited against the tide of Islamic resurgence\namong Islamic nations and States indicate a futile campaign\nto suppress this great divine religion of justice and\ntolerance, and of defiance against oppression, tyranny and\ndomination. The claimants of world leadership have yet to\nrealize that a people\u2019s religious devotion is intertwined with\nits very existence, and will only draw more strength and\nresilience in the face of campaigns of external pressure and\nnegative propaganda. The progressive march of the Islamic\nworld, which benefits from the rich heritage of Islamic\nculture, history and civilization, cannot be halted. Thus this\nsignificant and important segment of humanity will\ncertainly occupy an increasingly prominent role in the\nshaping of the future world order.\nThe irreconcilability of totalitarianism with the rule of\nlaw has had dangerous manifestations on the international\nscene. The passing and signing of legislation to allocate\nmoney for subversive and terrorist activities against the\nIslamic Republic of Iran is the most dangerous\nmanifestation of this lawlessness, which is no longer\nconfined to the secrecy of intelligence services but has been\nrecklessly made into law by the United States Congress.\nThis law and similar unlawful behaviour, including the\ninfamous decision of the United States Supreme Court\napproving kidnapping by the United States Government,\nrepresent a very dangerous trend. They illustrate a growing\ntendency to institutionalize and even legalize illegality and\ndisregard for international obligations.\nA similar pattern of behaviour that has been\nmanifested in the past several years by the United States\nGovernment is the self-arrogation of the right to legislate\nfor the international community by attempting to apply its\ndomestic legislation beyond its borders. Recent unilateral\nsanctions enacted by the United States against the trading\npartners of a number of countries not only constitute a\ngrave breach of various norms and principles of\ninternational law and many resolutions of this Assembly\nand other international forums as well as blatant\ninterference in the internal and external affairs of other\nStates, but, indeed, point to a very dangerous trend, which\nundermines the very foundations of contemporary inter-\nState relations.\nThe rejection of such legislation by various\nGovernments and international forums along with\nuniversal resistance against their application illustrate the\nfact that unilateral interference, the imposition of policies\nand the self-arrogated leadership of one State over the\nnational priorities and external relations of others cannot\nand will not be tolerated by the international community.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has referred these two\npieces of legislation to the pertinent international tribunal.\nWe strongly believe that unless this dangerous trend is\narrested at the earlier stages of inception, it will have\nirreversible implications, including the undermining of the\ncredibility and reliability of international undertakings. If\noutlaws are left to trample upon the rule of law, peace\nand security around the globe will be in peril.\nThe same general tendency of domination has\ndebilitated the Security Council, which has repeatedly\nfallen prey to the interests of a permanent member. The\nCouncil, for example, not only failed to prevent the Israeli\nattacks against defenceless Lebanese women and children\nin a United Nations compound, but also turned a blind\neye to reports substantiating the deliberate nature of the\natrocity, thus putting aside its humanitarian and Charter\nresponsibilities in the interests of the political\nconsiderations of supporters of Israel.\nRelying on such unconditional support, the Zionist\nregime pursues with impunity its expansionist policies of\noccupation in Palestine, southern Lebanon and the Syrian\nGolan Heights, as well as its routine practice of State\nterrorism and blatant violation of the most fundamental\nrights of the Muslim people of Palestine. Israel has\nneither regard for international law nor any commitment\nto peace, its only objective being the consolidation and\nexpansion of its occupation of the territories of others.\nConsidering these realities, the only logical conclusion is\nthat peace in the Middle East requires a just and\ncomprehensive resolution of the question of Palestine\nthrough the return of all Palestinian refugees to their\nhomeland, the exercise of their inalienable right to self-\ndetermination and the liberation of all occupied territories.\nIt is noteworthy that the mere expression of such\nrealistic analyses by a sovereign State is misportrayed as\nopposition to peace and provides the pretext for concern,\nanger and even illegal political pressure. In other words,\nthe new international autocracy, contrary to its\nproclamations of support for freedom of expression,\ncannot tolerate the least dissenting view regarding its\ndestructive policies.\n26\n\n\nThe prevalence of such attitudes in the Security\nCouncil has clearly shown that the Council needs\nfundamental and substantive reform and modification,\nparticularly in its rules and decision-making procedures.\nThe realities of today\u2019s international scene are so different\nfrom those prevailing in the aftermath of the Second World\nWar that the Security Council is weakened by its present\nstructure and prevented from meeting the new challenges.\nOn the other hand, the General Assembly enjoys\ngreater credibility in view of its relatively universal,\ndemocratic and transparent character. This supreme body of\nthe Organization should not become the forum for general\nand inconclusive discussions. The Assembly, in accordance\nwith the Charter, must assume its rightful place as the\nprimary decision-making body on important international\npolitical and economic issues.\nIn today\u2019s world, the imperative of global participation\nand collective effort in the advancement of common\nobjectives and the resolution of international problems is\nself-evident because of the mutual interdependence of the\nmembers of the international community. One of the most\nnotable areas for serious cooperation involves the challenge\nof combating all forms of terrorism. Regrettably, the same\nGovernment that has engaged in sponsoring and aiding\nvarious forms of terrorism \u2014 through, inter alia,\nappropriating a budget for subversive operations against\nIran, harbouring and assisting acknowledged terrorists, and\nsupporting Israeli state terrorism, mass murders and\nabductions \u2014 has also prevented serious international\naction in this regard by irresponsibly levelling\nunsubstantiated accusations against others.\nI reiterate in this Assembly that levelling politically\nmotivated accusations against one or a few States, groups\nor regions cannot and will not help in the resolution of this\nmajor international problem. The eradication of this\ninternational menace requires serious global cooperation\nbased on the following criteria: condemnation and rejection\nof all forms of terrorism, regardless of the identity of the\nvictims or perpetrators and irrespective of their political\ntendencies and objectives; refusal to provide sanctuary to\nterrorists or terrorist groups and prevention of operations by\nor on behalf of terrorists; and cessation of all baseless and\nunsubstantiated propaganda and allegations. We once again\nreiterate our commitment to participating in any serious,\ncomprehensive and rule-based universal cooperation to\ncombat and eradicate this inhuman phenomenon.\nIn the field of disarmament and in its efforts to end\nthe nightmare of nuclear holocaust, the international\ncommunity has been plagued by unilateralism, secrecy\nand evasion of the rule of law. Ironically, in recent years,\nthe major arms producers and suppliers have exhibited\nmore concern over their proliferation than have those\nStates that do not possess such sophisticated weaponry. At\nthe same time, the former have been reluctant to accept\nany scheme of general and comprehensive disarmament\nunder credible international monitoring.\nSome nuclear Powers and their allies continue to\ninclude the doctrine of nuclear response against non-\nnuclear threats in their defence alliances. In the\nInternational Court of Justice, these very Powers made\nevery effort to prevent the Court from rendering a\ndecision outlawing the use or threat of use of nuclear\nweapons.\nDuring the negotiations in the Conference on\nDisarmament on the finalization of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, in contravention of the\nAdvisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice on\nthe legal requirement of good-faith negotiations for\nnuclear disarmament, any reference to nuclear\ndisarmament within a time-bound framework faced strong\nopposition by a small number of nuclear Powers. In the\nsame negotiations, insistence on unilateral, non-\ntransparent national technical means \u2014 as opposed to a\nmultilateral and transparent international monitoring\nsystem \u2014 created a major obstacle for consensus. Even\nthe commonly accepted principle of negotiations to\nresolve these and other problems and to attain consensus\non this vital international instrument was vetoed. This\nundemocratic and dogmatic procedure resulted in the\nAssembly\u2019s approval and opening for signature of a\ndefective Treaty that does not reflect an international\nconsensus. We, along with many other non-aligned States,\nwill join the signatories of this Treaty solely because of\nour commitment to be an active participant in any effort\nto combat the inhumane weapons of mass destruction,\nwhile at the same time redoubling our efforts to achieve\na nuclear-weapon free world.\nNon-proliferation policies have also been marred by\ndiscrimination, shortsightedness and ambiguity. On the\none hand, Israel\u2019s nuclear-weapons programme has\ncontinuously received the direct and indirect political and\ntechnical support of one State; on the other, the\ninterventionist policy of coercive deprivation of other\ncountries in the same region of their inalienable right to\nacquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes has\nbecome a cornerstone of the foreign policy of the very\nsame State.\n27\n\n\nThe dissemination of false allegations to instil fear and\nanxiety, the depiction of an imaginary enemy and the\nfanning of division and tension have often been employed\nas pretexts to justify an external military presence and\nintervention as well as mind-boggling sales of excessive\nand unnecessary weapons systems. This behaviour\ncharacterizes the United States policy in the Persian Gulf,\nwhich has only resulted in the exacerbation of insecurity\nand instability within and between States of the region.\nIn spite of obstructions and misinformation campaigns,\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran has continued to articulate and\npursue initiatives and measures aimed at fostering greater\nregional confidence; enhancing respect for principles of\ninternational law; bringing about transparency in armaments\nand reduction of military spending; creating zones free from\nweapons of mass destruction; strengthening peace and\nsecurity through persistent endeavours to encourage and\nfacilitate understanding and conciliation; and consolidating\neconomic cooperation.\nIn Central Asia and the Caucasus, cognizant of the\nreligious, cultural, historical and commercial bonds that\nexist among member States of the Economic Cooperation\nOrganization, the Islamic Republic of Iran has tried in\nearnest to expand areas of cooperation among member\nStates of that important regional organization. The\nexpansion of transportation networks, including the revival\nof the Silk Road, provides the possibility for a dramatic\nincrease in the volume of trade not only among member\nStates but also between them and other countries of Europe,\nEast Asia and the Persian Gulf.\nRegarding Afghanistan, in pursuance of our mediation\nand in view of the fact that the return to peace and stability\nthere requires all States, particularly those in the region, to\nuse their influence in order to convince the warring factions\nto stop the vicious cycle of fratricide, we plan to convene\na regional conference next month in Tehran, with the\nparticipation of regional foreign ministers and\nrepresentatives of the United Nations and the Organization\nof the Islamic Conference.\nAs regards the crisis in Tajikistan, we have used every\nmeans available to us to bring the positions of the parties\nto the conflict closer to each other, in the strong belief that\nthese differences cannot be settled through force or by\nmilitary means. Considering the consequences of the\nexpansion of the conflict, more coordination and\ncooperation among regional States and between them and\nthe United Nations are imperative.\nIn Karabakh, we welcome the establishment and\ncontinuation of the ceasefire and believe that this conflict\ncan only be resolved through negotiations, withdrawal\nfrom occupied territories and the return of refugees to\ntheir homelands. The Islamic Republic of Iran, enjoying\nfriendly relations with both Armenia and Azerbaijan, is\nprepared to continue its efforts towards the resolution of\nthis conflict in cooperation with other States in the region.\nIn northern Iraq, the policy of the Islamic Republic\nof Iran has always been founded on maintaining the\nsecurity of our border areas and the prevention of terrorist\ninfiltration, coupled with consistent emphasis on and\nrespect for Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity as\nwell as on the prevention of tension and conflict between\nvarious Iraqi Kurdish factions. Regrettably, obstructionist\nand monopolistic tendencies, as well as self-serving\ninterventions and indifference, have resulted in a grave\nhumanitarian nightmare and the influx of hundreds of\nthousands of innocent refugees across Iran\u2019s borders.\nAs a cornerstone of its foreign policy, Iran has\nalways pursued the promotion and strengthening of peace\nand understanding not only in the region but also in the\nworld at large. During the recent visit of the President of\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran to Africa, our efforts to bring\nabout reconciliation between Sudan and Uganda led to the\nsignature of a memorandum of peace between the two\nneighbouring States and we hope that, with everyone\u2019s\ncooperation and understanding, a more lasting peace can\nbe attained.\nOur world today, more than at any other time, needs\nand deserves morality, security, mutual respect and\nconfidence, the rule of law, the participation of all and\ncollective cooperation for human development. The new\ninternational totalitarianism, notwithstanding its deceptive\nfacade, is inherently antithetical to these values and\nconstitutes the very negation of the recent achievements\nof human society. The progressive evolution of the\ninternational community can be achieved not by replacing\ndomestic dictators with international tyranny, but only\nthrough a collective endeavour to achieve common human\nideals and aspirations, including, inter alia, understanding\n28\n\n\nthrough respect for holy values and mutual tolerance for the\ncultures and beliefs of others; collective participation and\ncooperation in the resolution of international issues within\na free, democratic and transparent decision-making process;\nsecurity through the rule of law and practical commitment\nto international norms and obligations; and the re-direction\nof energies and resources from coercion and the arms race\nto universal respect for human rights and human\ndevelopment in all of its cultural, moral, social, political\nand economic dimensions."

        "file_text": "\ufeffYour noteworthy election, Sir, to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session is an eloquent\nand solemn tribute from the Members of our Organization\nto your great country, Malaysia. Your intellectual and moral\nqualities, your faith in the United Nations and your vast\nexperience in international relations guarantee, in our view,\nsuccess in the work of this session. For all these reasons,\nSenegal, which enjoys a strong relationship of friendship\nand cooperation with your country, is happy to convey to\nyou, through me, warm congratulations. We assure you of\nour full support in the achievement of the lofty mission\nentrusted to you.\nTo your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Diogo\nFreitas do Amaral, I wish to express our profound gratitude\nfor the effectiveness, competence and the commitment with\nwhich he discharged his mandate during a historic and\nparticularly productive session.\nI would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, at this\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly. Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali is an ardent champion of peace and\ncooperation among peoples, and his commendable work for\nthe United Nations should be emphasized today, to\nencourage perseverance along this path. Moreover, the\nAfrican Heads of State recently adopted at Yaound\u00e9 a\nstatement recommending his re-election to a second term of\noffice as United Nations Secretary-General.\n\nThe international climate today strikes us as one of\nthose special situations that should awaken our\nconsciences, inviting us to enhance our efforts and clarity\nof vision to ensure humanity a future of peace, solidarity\nand cooperation.\nIndeed, we are meeting at a time conducive to major\nchanges in the life of our Organization. The most striking\nillustration of our common desire for reform was\nexpressed here last year, during the solemn\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations. It was in that spirit that during the\ncommemorative meeting of the General Assembly some\nof the most authoritative voices in the world \u2014 those of\n128 Heads of State and Government \u2014 forcefully\nreaffirmed their profound faith in the United Nations, its\nprinciples and objectives.\nFurthermore, these leaders unanimously called for\nin-depth reflection so that we might enter the twenty-first\ncentury with a restructured, reinvigorated Organization,\nequipped with the necessary human, material and financial\nresources to more effectively accomplish the lofty mission\nof an Organization that harmonizes the complementary\nefforts of Member States in order to achieve new goals in\na context of freedom and active solidarity.\nGuaranteeing peace and collective security;\ndeveloping friendly relations among nations based on\nshared values; promoting respect for human rights and\nfundamental freedoms; and developing varied forms of\ncooperation in the economic, social, cultural and\nhumanitarian fields \u2014 these were the dreams of those\nwho, 50 years ago, created the United Nations. They are\nstill today the foundation, the moral basis and the\njustification for the objectives we must continue to pursue\nin these final years of the twentieth century, a century\nthat, despite two world wars, was one of prodigious\ndiscoveries \u2014 a century that saw man walk on the moon,\nexplore the environs of Mars and make significant\nprogress in combating disease.\nHowever, we must agree that today\u2019s world is not\nthe world of 50 years ago. This one presents new and\nwidespread dangers but also offers different possibilities.\nWe must therefore close ranks, minimize our differences\nand combine our efforts, as peoples, nations, States and\ncommunities.\nToday, all nations face an enormous paradox: on the\none hand, countries have never been closer to one another\ndue to the increasing globalization of technology; on the\n8\n\n\nother hand, the fragmentation of nationalities has triggered\nthe resurgence of new forms of confrontation and conflict,\nas well as misunderstandings and serious delays in the\nevolution of continents.\nDuring the cold-war period, it was generally\nconsidered that the main threats to peace would come from\nwars between States, and the greatest fear was that a\nnuclear conflict would break out and devastate the planet.\nThe end of the cold war gave rise to a sense of trust\nin the advent of a world free from the spectre of a nuclear\ncataclysm, which we welcomed with optimism. We shared\nthe belief that the many regional conflicts could be resolved\nquickly once they were no longer fuelled by unbridled\nmilitary assistance and by positions of continual escalation\nin both hemispheres.\nToday, unfortunately, we are forced to recognize that\nthe state of the world for the most part belies these\noptimistic visions; many old conflicts continue to resist the\ninternational community\u2019s attempts to settle them.\nPernicious and persistent intra-State conflicts have broken\nout. The conflicts in Africa and in the former Yugoslavia\nillustrate this situation.\nIndeed, from Angola to Somalia, from Burundi and\nRwanda to Liberia, Africa is beset by conflicts whose\nnature, as we are forced to recognize, prevents the proper\nand effective implementation of the solutions proposed.\nIt is true that significant progress has been made in\nsome of these conflicts, particularly in Angola and to a\nlesser extent in Rwanda. We need to continue our efforts in\nthis direction.\nIn other conflicts, the road to peace remains uncertain.\nIn Liberia, the situation is extremely murky due to the\ndifficulty of managing conflicts between rival factions,\ndespite the initiatives of the United Nations, the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the African\ncountries in the area.\nHowever, we must not become discouraged. At the\nrecent Ministerial meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, the member\ncountries of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) took some courageous decisions. These,\nwe hope, will create new conditions conducive to the\nnormalization of the situation in that country through the\norganization of free and democratic elections, with the full\nsupport of the entire international community.\nTurning to Burundi, it is clear that the measures\nprescribed by the United Nations and by the OAU have\nnot managed to end the bloodshed, nor did they prevent\nthe military coup de force of 25 July last. This is\nregrettable and we must take action.\nHowever, we must not lose faith. Given this new\nsituation, Senegal, like the African countries of the Great\nLakes region, calls for the restoration of constitutional\norder and reaffirms its conviction that any solution to the\ncrisis in Burundi requires the initiation \u2014 despite any\nfeelings of resentment \u2014 of a free and transparent\ndialogue in good faith between the various parties to the\nconflict.\nIn Europe, the former Socialist Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia represented, before it was torn apart, a\nsuccessful example of a pluralistic and harmonious ethnic\nand religious coexistence, which was the pride of the\nworld. It was in the name of these values that, from the\nbeginning of the conflict, Senegal rejected any notion of\npartitioning Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that is why it\nwelcomed with great hope the signing of the Dayton\nAgreement. It is in this spirit that the momentum for\npeace of this Agreement must be consolidated.\nIn this regard, the smooth conduct of the elections of\n14 September was an important step. The prosecution,\narrest and sentencing of war criminals by the international\ncriminal Tribunal remains a major test for the\ninternational community. More than that, is it a matter of\nproving that our community is able to implement Security\nCouncil decisions.\nAgainst this background, Senegal, my country, will\ncontinue, as it has in the past, to do what it can within the\nframework of the Contact Group of the Organization of\nthe Islamic Conference (OIC) to bring about the advent of\na Bosnia and Herzegovina at peace with itself, so that the\nseeds of peace and stability can finally bear fruit in this\nwar-torn land and throughout the rest of the former\nYugoslavia.\nExactly one year ago we welcomed with relief the\nsigning of the Washington and Taba agreements \u2014\nimportant milestones for the establishment of peace and\nreconciliation between the peoples of the Middle East.\nThe door thus opened must never close again. Today,\nregrettably, doubts and the fear of returning to a past\nmarked by war and hatred are beginning to resurface. Let\nus put an end to these threats while there is still time.\n9\n\n\nWhile my country has always believed, and continues\nto believe, that some realities are inescapable \u2014 the\nexistence of Israel is one of them \u2014 it is also of the\nopinion that the security of that State can, in the long term,\nbe assured only in the framework of respect for, and\nimplementation of, the current peace process, which should\nlead to the definitive creation of a sovereign and\nindependent Palestinian state, a fully-fledged member of the\ninternational community.\nIt is therefore up to the new Israeli Government,\nelected in May 1996, to make decisive efforts so that the\nflame of peace, ignited just recently with such courage and\nclear-sightedness, continues to inspire the leaders and\npeoples of Israel and Palestine towards a Middle East that\nbuilds its future on a spirit of solidarity, cooperation and\nfriendship.\nGiven the changes in the world since the fall of the\nBerlin Wall and given the new types of conflicts, which\nrequire a new approach to the management of our collective\nsecurity system, our Organization, the United Nations, must\nbe understood, supported and strengthened.\nIncreasingly, the United Nations has been called on to\ncreate a new generation of peacekeeping operations. The\nBlue Helmets have been joined by civil experts who\nprovide political, economic, social and humanitarian\nassistance, thus contributing to the stabilization of situations\nand conflicts as well as to the search for a political\nsettlement to conflicts through national reconciliation\nwhenever necessary.\nAccordingly, my country, Senegal, will continue to\ntake part with resolve in this noble mission in the service\nof peace, with the conviction that has always inspired our\ninternational policy. This same desire prompted its\nparticipation, with 36 other countries, in the standby forces\nsystem initiated recently by the Secretary-General, as well\nas its commitment to the establishment of an early warning\nand rapid reaction system.\nGuided by these same principles, Senegal continues to\nmake a modest contribution to the attainment of the goal of\ncomprehensive and effective disarmament. Senegal\u2019s recent\nadmission to the Conference on Disarmament, when that\nbody was expanded, attests to its will to work together with\nall peace-loving nations to build a better future in a world\nfree from weapons of mass destruction.\nIn this respect, I wish to welcome warmly the\nagreement concluded here on the indefinite extension of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\nparticularly since it meets the concerns of all Member\nStates of our Organization, specifically the African States.\nIn a spirit of remarkable unanimity, African States signed\nin Cairo last March the Pelindaba agreement on the\ndenuclearization of the continent.\nIn the same spirit, the international community\nrecently took an important step to halt the nuclear arms\nrace with the adoption by the General Assembly on 10\nSeptember 1996 of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty, which my country has just signed on 26\nSeptember 1996, here in New York.\nHowever, it is a fact that at a time when the\ninternational community faces new challenges stemming\nfrom the end of the cold war, our Organization will\nincreasingly be asked to play a more central role in world\naffairs. Naturally this means that meaningful\nimprovements must be made in the work of the\nOrganization; most importantly, the principle of\nuniversality should be implemented methodically and\neffectively. Accordingly, the restructuring and\ndemocratization of the Security Council must remain a\npriority goal. This central body of the United Nations\nmust reflect in its decision-making process the concerns\nof the entire membership of our Organization. Its reform\nmust lead to increased transparency and a better\nrepresentation by all regions of the world.\nGuided by the ideal of the universality of the United\nNations, Senegal supports the request of the Republic of\nChina to be admitted to membership in our Organization,\nand, generally speaking, to membership in the specialized\nagencies of the United Nations system. It is inarguable, in\nour opinion, that that State, in view of its socio-economic\nperformance, its development level, its commitment to\ndemocratic values and its behaviour in international\naffairs meets all the criteria and conditions set forth by\nthe Charter of the United Nations for admission to\nmembership. This admission to membership, should it\noccur, would make an important contribution to\nstabilizing international relations in that part of Asia and\nwould allow for an unprecedented economic, technical\nand cultural cooperation among the countries of South-\nEast Asia and Africa. Its admission would in no way\njeopardize the efforts made by the international\ncommunity for peace and development in the world.\nThe values of peace, freedom and economic and\nsocial justice, which 50 years ago inspired the creation of\nour Organization, must now more than ever remain the\n10\n\n\nbasis of our common action towards a life of dignity for all.\nThe post-cold-war experience has taught us once again that\nthe many facets of underdevelopment remain a serious\nthreat to international peace and security.\nNow that globalization and interdependence are\nphenomena recognized by all, we must understand that the\ndestiny of humankind is one and indivisible. This obvious\ntruth must persuade us to seek, in a spirit of solidarity, joint\nsolutions to the persistent problems of underdevelopment.\nThe series of major world conferences set to conclude next\nNovember with the World Food Summit \u2014 a positive\ninitiative welcomed by my country \u2014 is an encouraging\nsign of the international community\u2019s resolve to meet these\nchallenges in the best interests of the peoples of the world,\non the basis of a comprehensive, integrated approach to\nhuman development.\nWe need now to maintain and strengthen that spirit by\nmobilizing additional financial resources, without which the\ncommitments undertaken will remain a dead letter, which\nwould betray the legitimate hopes to which they gave rise.\nWe must find an early and comprehensive solution to the\nsevere debt crisis. The components of the problem are fairly\nclear today. The sustained structural-adjustment efforts\nmade by our country will remain futile and ineffective if\nexternal factors such as the debt burden and the\ndeterioration of the terms of trade continue seriously to\nhinder our development prospects.\nThe Agenda for Development gives us a new\nopportunity to reaffirm our commitment to world peace and\nstability by defining a comprehensive framework for action\nbased on economic justice, social well-being, the protection\nof human rights and the preservation of the environment.\nThe development of Africa, and I cannot\noveremphasize this point, is the primary responsibility of\nthe Africans themselves. That is why in many African\ncountries today Governments continue with determination\nto carry out bold and difficult reforms, reflected, inter alia,\nin the improved and more rational use of public funds, in\nthe opening of our economies to international trade and in\nthe creation of conditions conducive to private enterprise\nand to the transparent management of public affairs with,\nmost importantly, all sectors of society participating in the\nwork of national development, in the interests of all. In this\nregard, we must pay tribute to the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, the World Bank and the International Monetary\nFund for the assistance and support they have extended to\nour countries. For these ongoing efforts to be successful,\nthey must be supported by increased official development\nassistance, substantial debt relief and by the lifting of\nbarriers and other protectionist measures. These three\nareas require dynamic action on the part of the\ninternational community.\nSenegal is firmly convinced that we can combat\nAfrican pessimism if we are resolved jointly to promote\na mutually beneficial partnership for the recovery of an\nAfrica with enormous potential, which, if tapped, would\noffer our partners real opportunities. It was this\nconviction, let us recall, that prompted the Head of State\nof Senegal, His Excellency Mr. Abdou Diouf, to take the\ninitiative during his first term of office as Acting\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity, to request\nthe convening for the first time of a special session of the\nGeneral Assembly to discuss the economic situation in\nAfrica. That is the light in which my country sees the two\ninitiatives devoted to Africa: the United Nations New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s and\nthe Special Initiative for Africa, launched by the\nSecretary-General in March 1996.\nFurthermore, we noted that the mid-term review of\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\nAfrica at this session gave a very frank assessment of\nwhat must be done to make this project a genuine\nframework for multilateral cooperation and a source of\ninspiration for a fruitful partnership for development.\nIn conclusion, I should like to touch on the United\nNations financial crisis, which has become a source of\nmajor concern for all our States. Since the causes of the\nsituation have been discussed at length in this very Hall,\nI do not believe it is necessary to recall them. However,\none thing is very clear. At a time when our Organization\nis committed on several fronts, both to restoring peace\nand to strengthening its role as the primary framework\nand instrument for the advent of the new world order, its\nfinancial stability is essential to enable us jointly to meet\nthe major challenges ahead.\nTherefore, my country, Senegal, would like once\nagain to appeal to all Member States regularly to meet\ntheir financial obligations. In this regard, it is essential\nthat the credibility of the United Nations not be impugned\nat a time when, individually and collectively, we have\nsuch high hopes for the future of humankind.\nOnce again, the effectiveness of the United Nations\nwill depend upon our common resolve to harmonize our\nown interests to achieve our shared goals in strict\n11\n\n\naccordance with the fundamental principles of the San\nFrancisco Charter.\nAs our President, His Excellency Mr. Abdou Diouf,\nhas said repeatedly, Senegal will continue, as it has in the\npast, to work tirelessly for the attainment of the ideals of\npeace, justice and solidarity, and to reaffirm and seek\ncompliance with all the principles on which a true\ninternational community, sharing a common destiny, is\nbased.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Nigerian\ndelegation, I convey to Mr. Razali Ismail our\ncongratulations on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-first session. His election is a\nrecognition of his wide-ranging experience, candour and\ndiplomatic skills. It is also a tribute to his great country.\nWe are confident that, under his presidency, the work of\nthe General Assembly will be highly successful.\nMay I also convey the appreciation of my delegation\nto his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas Do Amaral of\nPortugal, for the admirable manner and great sense of\ncommitment with which he conducted the affairs of the\nfiftieth session of the Assembly. Nigeria also commends\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for the energy, sense of\npurpose and direction which he has brought to bear on the\noffice of the Secretary-General in the meritorious service\nof our Organization.\nWhen we met last year to commemorate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, we observed that a\nnumber of developments on the political and economic\nscene had affected relations between States and modified\nthe configuration of power at the global level. We\n9\n\n\nrecognized that the United Nations continues to be a viable\ninstrument for the conduct of relations amongst States. We\nrededicated ourselves to the principles and objectives of the\nUnited Nations Charter, including, in particular, the\npromotion of social and economic development and the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In this\nendeavour, the United Nations has a central role to play.\nMember States, in line with their obligations under the\nCharter, have a duty to assist the United Nations in carrying\nout this responsibility. This requires the political\ncommitment of all Member States and in particular of those\nupon which the Charter confers special status.\nSome of the developments which have occurred on the\ninternational scene include the globalization of the world\neconomy, the upsurge in market economies, the rise in\neconomic growth in a number of countries and the growing\ntrend towards political pluralism and democratization.\nHowever, new forms of conflict, new nationalisms,\nterrorism, an increasing incidence of poverty and global\nsocial decline have cast a sombre shadow on international\npeace and security, as well as on economic growth and\ndevelopment. The growing incidents of conflict, whether in\nEurope, in Africa or in the Middle East, and the slow pace\nof their resolution, are helping to exacerbate international\ntension and undermine confidence among States. The\nUnited Nations has a duty in this regard to redefine its role\nand sharpen its peacemaking and peacekeeping tools in\norder to effectively address them.\nPeace is indivisible. The burden of peace, therefore,\nshould be shared by all in a mode of global responsibility\nand partnership. Let me add also that the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security is not an exclusive\nresponsibility of the United Nations. Regional and\nsubregional arrangements have important roles to play and\nhave demonstrated their commitment.\nAlthough many regions of the world are now\nwitnessing one form of conflict or another, with varying\ndegrees of implications for the United Nations system, no\nregion perhaps is more afflicted by this menace than Africa,\nboth in the number of conflicts currently raging and in their\nunimaginable negative effects on the people. The individual\nand collective efforts of African States to achieve socio-\npolitical transformation have been threatened by these\nconflicts. In spite of this, the States of Africa have\ncontinued to make concerted efforts at regional and\nsubregional levels to address this situation. The unique role\nbeing played by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention Management and\nResolution is important and should be supported by the\ninternational community. Nigeria welcomes the\ncooperation between the OAU and other regional\norganizations and the United Nations in the field of\npreventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and peacemaking.\nIn our own subregion, the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS) undertook an\nunprecedented initiative in crisis management by\nestablishing a peacekeeping force, the ECOWAS\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG), in Liberia six years ago.\nIn spite of the difficulties we have encountered in the\nprocess, we remain committed in our endeavour to help\nthe Liberian process reach its logical conclusion. In this\nregard, Nigeria shares the view of many observers who\nhave described the revised Abuja peace agreement of\nAugust 1996 as providing the best legal framework for\nthe resolution of the Liberian crisis. I am pleased to\nreport that the implementation of the Agreement revised\nat Abuja last August is now on course. A new Council of\nState, headed by Mrs. Ruth Perry, has been installed.\nSince her installation, Mrs. Perry has enjoyed the\nconsiderable confidence of the other members of the\nLiberian National Transitional Government and indeed of\nmost Liberians. I take this opportunity to appeal to all\nLiberians to extend cooperation to the new leadership in\nthe interest of peace in their country. Let me assure the\nAssembly that it is the determination of my Head of\nState, General Sani Abacha, Chairman of ECOWAS \u2014\nin collaboration with other leaders in our region and with\nthe support of the international community as a whole \u2014\nto ensure the resolution of the Liberian crisis.\nIt is our expectation that the Liberians themselves\nwill assume their destiny in favour of peace, national\nreconciliation and national reconstruction. We therefore\nrenew our appeal to the international community to\nprovide much-needed financial, material and logistic\nsupport to enable ECOMOG and the United Nations\nObserver Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) to effectively\ndischarge their respective mandates. Meanwhile, we\nacknowledge with appreciation the renewed cooperation\nand assistance with the ECOWAS effort of some of the\nmembers of the international community.\nOf great importance to the search for peace in the\nvarious troubled spots of the world is the urgent need to\ncontrol the instruments of war. It is a matter of deep\nregret that the end of the cold war has not ushered in in\nits wake any appreciable reduction in the global arms\nbuild-up. As the arms build-up and the proliferation of\nconflicts are mutually reinforcing, there is an urgent need\nfor the international community to contain the trend. The\n10\n\n\nthreat posed by existing stockpiles of weapons of mass\ndestruction and conventional armaments is yet to be\nremoved.\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT),\na priority item on the disarmament agenda of the United\nNations, has been adopted. In spite of the imperfections of\nthis Treaty, the Nigerian Government was able to support\nit and will be signing it in due course. Its adoption, which\nputs an end to the further qualitative improvement of\nnuclear weapons and arsenals, represents a significant first\nstep towards the goal of nuclear disarmament. It is our\nexpectation that the Conference on Disarmament, the single\nmultilateral negotiating body on disarmament, will now take\nthe next logical step to negotiate such disarmament within\na time-bound framework. The nuclear-weapon States have\na clear responsibility and duty to cooperate with the\nConference on Disarmament to negotiate such a treaty.\nThe adoption of the Treaty of Pelindaba creating a\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa has been an important\ncontribution to confidence building in Africa, in addition to\nbeing a collateral disarmament measure. In view of the\noverwhelming support enjoyed by the Treaty beyond the\nAfrican continent, it is recommended that other regions\nundertake similar efforts by establishing nuclear-weapon-\nfree zones or zones of peace. While it is commendable to\nobserve that the majority of nuclear-weapon States have\nsince signed the protocol to the Treaty, we take this\nopportunity to urge other States that have not yet done so\nto do so, in order that the full objectives of the Treaty can\nbe achieved.\nPeace and development are mutually reinforcing. A\njust and enduring peace can only be founded on the general\nwelfare and socio-economic progress of all peoples and all\nnations. It is indeed disconcerting to note that while the\ncountries of the North are becoming more affluent, the\ncountries of the South, which contain the majority of the\nworld\u2019s population, are getting more impoverished. We\nmust collectively recognize and accept the fact that the\ndeepening crisis of development faced by developing\ncountries can only undermine the new world order which\nwe seek to create.\nAfrica, in particular, has continued to experience the\ncrippling impacts of external debt, deteriorating terms of\ntrade, increasing barriers to trade, declining investment and\nfinancial inflows, and capital flight. African countries\nrecognize that the primary responsibility for finding a\nsolution to the economic difficulties facing the continent\nlies with themselves. Hence they have sought to put in\nplace sound macro-economic policies and adopted very\npainful programmes of economic reform. However, their\nbest endeavours have continued to be constrained by the\nprevailing unfavourable international economic climate.\nWe believe that development cooperation should engender\ngenuine interdependence, mutual interest and benefits in\nthe context of global partnership, rather than the old mode\nof a donor-recipient relationship.\nWe must recognize the central role of the United\nNations in engendering the process of global\ndevelopment. In this regard, my delegation calls for faster\nprogress in the ongoing work on the Secretary-General\u2019s\nAgenda for Development. In the same spirit, we of the\nAfrican continent urge the international community to\ndeliver on its promises under the United Nations New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-\nNADAF). We have just taken part in the mid-term review\nof its implementation. We recognize that UN-NADAF has\nhad a poor record of implementation. None the less, the\nUnited Nations system and the international community\nat large must deliver on their various commitments.\nNigeria considers as complementary the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s United Nations System-wide Special Initiative\nfor Africa, particularly as it envisages collaboration and\ncoordination of efforts between the international\ncommunity, the Bretton Woods financial institutions and\nthe United Nations development agencies on the issue of\ndevelopment. In recognition of its role as the centre for\nthe harmonization of the actions of nations, the United\nNations successful hosting of major global conferences on\ndevelopment \u2014 from New York in 1990 through Rio in\n1992, Vienna in 1993, Cairo in 1994, Copenhagen and\nBeijing in 1995, to Istanbul in 1996 \u2014 deserves our\nspecial commendation. The faithful implementation of the\ndecisions and programmes of action of these conferences\nwould assist in bridging the yawning gap between the\ndeveloping and the developed economies and constitute a\nsubstantive benefit to development. Accordingly, we\nendorse and will continue to give our unqualified support\nto the hosting of a special session of the General\nAssembly in 1997 to review the implementation of\nAgenda 21.\nIt is hardly necessary to recall that contemporary\ninternational relations were founded on the basis of\nrespect for the principles of sovereign equality of States,\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States and\npeaceful co-existence. It is therefore a matter of great\nconcern that these hallowed principles are increasingly\nbeing eroded by some powerful States. The United\n\n\n\nNations should serve as the bulwark against the imposition\nof the will of the strong over that of the weak.\nToday all countries are engaged in a universal quest\nfor human dignity. It is no longer sufficient for us to be\ncontent that our nations have been liberated from\noppression and foreign domination. It is now universally\nacknowledged that the full meaning of national sovereignty\ncannot be realized unless the individual citizen is free to\nexercise his true conscience. The rise of this new\ninternational conscience is a legitimate extension of the\nearlier emergence of the new international morality which\nthrew colonialism into disarray.\nThere ought to be no conflict between national\nsovereignty and the fundamental rights of the individual.\nWe welcome the growing international concern with human\nrights, but unless we are careful to strictly define the\nparameters of what actions justly constitute human rights\nand what are excesses threatening the security of the State\nas well as the safety and well-being of the citizens, we\ncould unwittingly be doing a disservice to the essence of\nhuman freedom and dignity. We must therefore guard\nagainst the use of human rights as a pretext for advancing\nthe individual or collective interests of one section of the\ninternational community against those of the other.\nIn today\u2019s world, the collation, delivery and\nmanagement of information has become an essential\ncomponent of development. Countries which are better\nendowed technologically have tended to use that\nendowment to the disadvantage of the less endowed. There\nis a need therefore to establish a New World Information\nOrder, which respects the mutual sensitivities of States and\nprotects the values of their differing cultures.\nMost developing countries lack the resources and\ntechnological capacity for the requisite information delivery.\nThis, in no small measure, constrains their ability to project\nnews of events in their society promptly and effectively,\navoiding the tendentious reporting of the media in the\ndeveloped countries. Nigeria\u2019s desire to be friends with all\nnations, our commitment to the maintenance of international\npeace and security and our abiding faith in the principles\nenshrined in the charters of the United Nations, the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and our subregional\norganization, ECOWAS, are demonstrable and beyond\nquestion. It was therefore a matter of surprise to the\nNigerian Government that this Assembly, in December\n1995, adopted resolution 50/199 of 22 December 1995 on\nthe human-rights situation in our country. We believe that\nthis action was based largely on media reporting and\nwithout any investigation of the facts of the matter. In\nspite of the fact that the Nigerian Government was not\nhappy with that action, we subsequently took the initiative\nto invite the Secretary-General to send a fact-finding\nmission to Nigeria to ascertain the realities on the ground.\nThat mission visited the country from 28 March to 13\nApril 1996, and conducted its work unfettered. While the\nmission\u2019s report identified areas of progress in our\ndomestic situation, it also made constructive\nrecommendations. I would like to take this opportunity to\nexpress the appreciation of the Government and the\npeople of Nigeria to those Governments which took a\nprincipled position of not supporting the resolution against\nus. We note with satisfaction that since the United\nNations visit, a growing number of countries have\nreconsidered their position on the matter in favour of\nNigeria. We therefore urge the Assembly to take\ncognizance of these positive developments.\nThe present Administration in my country has\ncontinued to make steady progress in the implementation\nof its programme of transition to democratic rule. The\nfundamental difficulties which faced our nation in its\nprevious efforts at building a viable democracy are being\nprogressively addressed, taking into account the objective\nrealities of our national situation, so as to ensure an\norderly transition and the establishment of durable\ndemocratic structures of governance at all levels in our\ncountry. We are encouraged by the successful outcome of\nthe elections which were conducted at the local\ngovernment level in March this year. The impressive\nturnout of voters nationwide and the general atmosphere\nof tranquillity prevailing in our country have elicited\ngoodwill and support from within and outside the country.\nPolitical parties have now been registered and full\npolitical activities have resumed nation-wide. Our\ntransition to civil rule is now fully on an irreversible\ncourse.\nIn our resolve to ensure that the evolving democratic\ninstitutions take root in a fertile economic environment,\nthe Nigerian Government has undertaken economic\nreforms aimed at promoting rapid growth and sustainable\ndevelopment. The overall macroeconomic performance of\nthe economy has improved with the implementation of\ndeflationary fiscal and monetary measures. Efforts are\nongoing to establish a conducive environment for the\npromotion of investment, both domestic and foreign.\nAdditionally, in recognition of the vital role of finance in\nthe attainment of greater economic efficiency, a wholesale\noverhaul of the banking and financial services sector has\nbeen undertaken to sanitize this important sector of the\n12\n\n\nnational economy. It is also worthy of mention that\nnecessary instruments have been put in place in order to\nintensify economic deregulation and create a conducive\nenvironment for domestic and foreign investment.\nIn the year 2010, Nigeria will be 50 years old as an\nindependent and sovereign nation. It is envisaged that by\nthat date, Nigeria will have achieved economic prosperity,\npolitical stability and social harmony. In order to realize\nthis objective, our Government announced, a few weeks\nago, a new socio-economic campaign, \u201cVision 2010\u201d, to\nprovide insights into and articulate the goals and objectives\nof our national economy in a macroeconomic format. It is\nalso intended to focus on the contribution of the private\nsector as the engine of growth of our economy. We urge\nthe international community to give this programme the\nnecessary support and encouragement.\nIn order for the United Nations to respond fully to the\npurpose for which it was established, there is need to\nstrengthen the Organization and to reform its principal\norgans. Such reform must be system-wide and must be\nundertaken not for its own sake but to achieve efficiency\nand effectiveness. It should aim to enhance rather than\nweaken the capacity of the United Nations to respond\neffectively to the legitimate aspirations of all its Members.\nA vibrant and responsible United Nations requires an\nassured financial base. The failure or unwillingness of\nMember States to pay their assessed contributions as and\nwhen due is a dereliction of Charter obligations and a threat\nto the survival of the United Nations. For our part, Nigeria\nhas continued to pay in full and without conditions our\nassessed contributions to the regular budget including, in\nparticular, for the year 1996. We therefore call on all\nMember States that have yet to do so to pay their assessed\ncontributions promptly, in full and without conditions.\nFor several decades, the Middle East question has\nengaged the attention of the international community.\nNigeria has been concerned with the various wars and acts\nof terrorism which have brought incalculable loss of life\nand property to that region. There can be no question but\nthat we will continue to support the just struggle of the\nPalestinian people for their inalienable right to a homeland.\nThere is an increasing awareness, even among the countries\nof the region, that the right of Israel to live within safe and\nsecure borders can no longer be denied. We call on all\nparties to intensify their efforts to ensure that the peace\nprocess in the Middle East remains on course.\nFor some time now, the world has been faced with\na new upsurge in terrorist incidents. Nigeria condemns\nunreservedly all acts of terrorism in all its manifestations,\nas terrorism cannot be a substitute for dialogue and\npeaceful negotiations in resolving conflicts and\nmisunderstandings between nations. We call on the\nGeneral Assembly to take additional steps to eradicate the\nscourge of this menace, which also constitutes a threat to\ninternational peace and security.\nAs the principal organ of the United Nations, the\nSecurity Council is in dire need of reform. Its\ncomposition must reflect the principle of equity, balance\nand equitable geographical distribution. It must seek to\ncorrect the current anomaly of the non-representation of\nAfrica in the permanent membership category.\nWe should, however, be mindful that reform of the\nUnited Nations, particularly in a period of transition, is an\nonerous undertaking. My delegation recognizes the vital\nrole of the office of the Secretary-General in overseeing\nthis reform process. In spite of the difficulties the United\nNations is passing through and the fluidity of the\ninternational situation, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali has shown uncommon and unrelenting\ncommitment to meeting the challenges of his office. He\ndeserves our gratitude and continued support. We\ntherefore wish to see him complete the laudable changes\nhe has initiated, some of which are already yielding\nuseful results. In this connection we reiterate and support\nfully the collective African position that Africa should be\ngiven the opportunity to serve two terms in the office of\nSecretary-General. For that purpose, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali is the only candidate recommended by the\nOrganization of African Unity. Like his predecessors,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali should be given a second term\nto serve our Organization. It is the only credible thing to\ndo. This is a matter of principle in our country.\nMy delegation recognizes the enormous tasks facing\nthe Organization as it seeks to concretely address the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century, and we wish to\nreaffirm Nigeria\u2019s commitment to continue to contribute\neffectively to the realization of the Organization\u2019s twin\nobjectives of global peace and prosperity.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is indeed a pleasure\nfor me to extend my delegation\u2019s congratulations to\nAmbassador Razali and his country, Malaysia, on his\nelection to the high office of President of the fifty-first\nsession of the General Assembly. I entertain no doubt that\n17\n\n\nhe will be able to draw upon his proven diplomatic skills\nand considerable experience to guide the affairs of the\nGeneral Assembly in a creditable and exemplary manner.\nPermit me also to express my appreciation and thanks to\nhis immediate predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of\nPortugal, for the competence which he demonstrated in\npresiding over the historic fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly.\nThe United Nations was established 51 years ago with\na focus on the maintenance of peace and security, and\nwhile that remains the objective, the linkage between peace\nand economic and social development, enshrined in the\nCharter, must be recognized and strengthened if the world\nis to escape the inexorable consequences of the\ncontinuously widening gap between rich and poor nations.\nWe were led to believe that the peace dividend resulting\nfrom the end of the cold war would provide the engine for\ngreater economic development. Obviously, that has not\nmaterialized. Indeed, the opposite has occurred. The\ndeveloping world continues to experience a steady\nshrinkage of development assistance. And at this critical\njuncture, small island States, already hampered by size,\ngeographic location, topography and climatic conditions, are\nhaving their very existence threatened by the policies and\npractices of multinationals, made all the more formidable\nby overwhelming support from their Governments.\nThe production and export of bananas are vital to the\neconomic viability of the Commonwealth of Dominica, as\nthey are to all the islands of the Windward group. The\nbanana industry in the Windward Islands accounts for less\nthan 5 per cent of world production. The producers are\nsmall landowners; the production costs are relatively high;\nand any attempt by the Windward Islands producers to sell\ntheir products on the open market would be suicidal.\nRecognizing the peculiar difficulties of Windward Islands\nproducers and their traditional access to the European\nmarket, the European Union has established a regime\nreserving less than 10 per cent of its market for bananas\nfrom the Caribbean. That regime is now under attack from\nmultinationals in Latin America and elsewhere, with huge\nresources augmented by the power, prestige and political\nmight of their national Governments.\nIn the struggle to save an industry critical to our\neconomic survival, our political stability and our democratic\ntraditions and institutions, we call upon the international\ncommunity to take note of the very real possibility of social\nupheaval and political disaster in the region if this challenge\nto the European Union regime were to succeed. It is rather\nincongruous that the same forces that are at the forefront of\nthe effort to establish democratic institutions and\nrepresentative governments in certain parts of the world\nare also engaged in an enterprise which, if successful, is\ncalculated to destroy the free and democratic way of life\nin the eastern Caribbean. The international community has\nan interest in seeing that these small societies remain free\nand stable, and it has an obligation to ensure that that\nfreedom and stability subsist.\nThe scourge of illicit drug traffic and drug abuse\nmust continue to be of great concern to the international\ncommunity. The problem knows no boundary, it respects\nno ideology or power, it makes no distinction between\nrich and poor, North and South, East and West. Its engine\nis driven by the prospect of huge fortunes amassed\nclandestinely and quickly. Universal in its destructive\nforce, the illicit drug problem presents a unique challenge\nto the world. The Commonwealth of Dominica has taken\nsteps, commensurate with its limited resources, to deal\nwith the problem at the national level, and it is a party to\ncooperative regional arrangements aimed at impeding the\ntrans-shipment of illicit drugs through the Caribbean\nregion. Recognizing, however, that the problem is\ndemand-driven, we must make it clear that the prospects\nfor success in this effort will remain dim unless there is\na greater undertaking by the major consumer centres to\nreduce the demand for the product.\nConnected with international drug trafficking is the\nillegal trade in arms and, tangentially, international\nterrorism. The twin evils of illicit arms and international\nterrorism have as their purpose the destruction of innocent\nlives, the violation of the fundamental tenets of the\ncivilized world and the subversion of the democratic\nfreedoms of all mankind. An unprecedented effort by\nMembers of the United Nations will be required if we are\nto control the illicit trade in arms and extinguish the\nthreat of terrorism. Compounding the problem is the legal\ntrade in conventional weapons of increasing sophistication\nand destructiveness. With regard to nuclear weapons, the\nCommonwealth of Dominica believes that the Non-\nProliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty are merely way-stations on the road to the\ndesirable end of a world free of all such arsenals.\nWe are extremely concerned and aggrieved by the\ncontinuing practice of trans-shipping nuclear waste and\nother hazardous substances through the Caribbean Sea.\nAssurances of safe procedures and infinitesimal risks are\nunconvincing, particularly when such trans-shipments are\nmade through the Caribbean Sea during the hurricane\n18\n\n\nseason and at a period of heightened seismic activity in the\nCaribbean region.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica, together with other\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\ncontinues to view this dangerous practice as a potentially\nserious threat to the fragile ecosystem and to the livelihood\nand well-being of the people of the region, and we call\nupon the States engaging in the practice to demonstrate\nsome regard for our justifiable concerns. We earnestly seek\nthe support of the international community in our ongoing\neffort to halt the shipment of these dangerous materials\nthrough the Caribbean Sea.\nFor several decades, the Republic of China on Taiwan\nhas exercised and continues to exercise sovereign authority\nover a defined geographical area inhabited today by 21\nmillion souls. This year, the process of political reform\nachieved its ultimate goal when, for the first time in\nhistory, the President of the Republic of China on Taiwan\nwas democratically elected in free and fair elections.\nDemocracy is alive and well in the Republic of China on\nTaiwan. The peace and security of the region are not\nthreatened today, nor have they ever been threatened, by the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan. Indeed, the Republic of\nChina\u2019s human rights record, its commitment to market\neconomy and multilateralism and its economic assistance\nprogrammes have served to enhance the prospects for\npeace, security and stability in the area and beyond.\nAs the members of the European Parliament stated in\ntheir resolution of 17 July 1996, the Republic of China on\nTaiwan can play an important beneficial role in the\ninternational community, and it is clear that the exclusion\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan from the world\u2019s\ncouncils, from the United Nations and its specialized\nagencies, and from the major international financial\ninstitutions concerned with development and the eradication\nof poverty is a detriment to us all. The Commonwealth of\nDominica believes that on the principle of universality, the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan should be admitted as a\nMember of the United Nations.\nJust over two years ago the world applauded the\nprogress that had been made in the bilateral negotiations\nbetween Israel and its Arab neighbours in the Middle East,\nand we expressed cautious optimism with respect to the\neventual resolution of the conflict and the progress towards\na full and just peace in the region. Recent events have\ngiven reason for pause, however. We recognize that a\nsolution to the problem in the Middle East can only be\nachieved through the energies of the States in the region\nand their genuine commitment to peace. But the\ninternational community and the United Nations in\nparticular have an interest \u2014 indeed, a duty \u2014 to\nfacilitate and assist the process towards the realization of\nthe legitimate hopes, aspirations and security needs of the\npeoples in the area.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica abhors the concept\nof national laws having extraterritorial jurisdiction and\nserving as underpinnings for illegal secondary boycotts.\nWe are particularly troubled by the potential use of these\ninstruments by large and powerful States to compromise\nthe territorial integrity and national sovereignty of small\nStates like ours.\nThe restructuring and reform of the United Nations\nsystem continues in the face of a forced financial crisis\nthat undermines the very result intended by the reform\nprogramme, namely, an Organization with the capacity to\ndischarge its worldwide obligations effectively and\nefficiently. We continue to be supportive of the efforts to\nexercise budgetary restraints, to reduce waste and to\neliminate unnecessary duplication, but we caution against\na programme of retrenchment detrimental to the existence\nof programmes designed to assist small developing\nnations. Indeed, we believe that the end-product of the\nreform of the United Nations should be an Organization\nbetter equipped to be an effective force for development\nand economic growth.\nIn this age of globalization, the United Nations\ncontinues to be an important agent for economic growth\nand development and a vital instrument in maintaining\nworld peace. The Commonwealth of Dominica recognizes\nand applauds the achievements of the United Nations in\nthose areas. The capacity of the Organization to meet the\nchallenges of the years ahead will depend on our\ncollective will and commitment to effecting measurable\nimprovement in the human condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt\ngives me great pleasure to begin my statement by\ncongratulating Mr. Razali Ismail on his election to the\noffice of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nfirst session.\nI am quite confident that his extensive experience\nand competence will definitely contribute to the\nsuccessful outcome of this session. I should like to assure\nhim that we are keen to cooperate with him and support\nhis efforts to bring the proceedings of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly to a successful conclusion.\nIn recent weeks, Iraq has been the focus of\nworldwide attention and interest because of the American\nmissile attacks to which it has been subjected and the\nintensive American military build-up that followed in\npreparation for a large-scale military aggression on the\npretext that Iraq violated Security Council resolutions.\nI would like here to describe our views on these\nevents. Iraq has acted in no way contrary to the Charter\nor Security Council resolutions or to justify an American\nmilitary aggression against it. What Iraq did was to move\nits forces on its own territories and within its\ninternationally recognized borders at the request of one of\nthe main Iraqi Kurdish factions in order to repel a\nmilitary aggression committed by another faction in\nalliance with a neighbouring foreign country. This action\nof the Iraqi Government falls within the sovereignty of\nIraq over its own territories and in the context of its duty\nto defend its own people and repel any foreign aggression\nagainst them. This is a right guaranteed by all\ninternational covenants and laws. It is also a basic\nresponsibility of the Government of any country.\nThe operation was limited, swift and carried out\nwithout the loss of human lives. This has been attested to\nby all observers, including officials of United Nations\nagencies who were working in northern Iraq. T h i s\noperation put an end to the state of civil war, in-fighting,\nchaos and insecurity in northern Iraq and restored peace\nand stability to that region. The United States, however,\ntried to exploit these developments and to use them as a\npretext to carry out missile attacks against Iraq and\ndestroy a number of civilian installations, leaving many\nmartyrs and wounded civilians in its wake.\n20\n\n\nThe United States Administration was not satisfied\nwith its military aggression against Iraq. The United States\nPresident openly announced, on 3 September 1996, his\ndecision to expand the no-fly zone in southern Iraq, which\nhad been imposed by the United States in 1992, from the\n32nd parallel to the 33rd parallel. The imposition of no-fly\nzones in Iraqi airspace is a use of armed force in violation\nof the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. It was a\nunilateral decision that had nothing to do with the United\nNations nor with Security Council resolutions on Iraq. This\nfact was confirmed by the official spokesman of the United\nNations on 7 January 1993, when he said that the\nimposition of the no-fly zone in southern Iraq was not\nbased on any Security Council resolution.\nThe spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry\nannounced on 2 September 1996 that:\n\u201cThere is no United Nations or the Security Council\nprovision defining the basis for a no-fly zone north of\nthe 36th parallel or south of the 32nd parallel. The\ndecision to establish these zones is a quadrilateral\ndecision by France, the United States, Britain and\nTurkey. There is no provision by the United Nations\ndefining these zones.\u201d\nAs the Permanent Representative of Russia to the\nUnited Nations pointed out on 5 September 1996:\n\u201cThis no-fly zone, from its inception, was not based\non any international legal foundation.\u201d\nThe Arab and world reaction to the aggressive actions\nof the United States has been one of rejection and\ncondemnation. The whole world now knows that the\nimposition of the no-fly zones in Iraq is neither legitimate\nnor legal and constitutes an ongoing aggression against\nIraq. It must cease.\nFrom the beginning, Iraq has been very clear in\nrejecting the so-called no-fly zones unilaterally imposed by\nAmerica and some of its allies. America and Britain\ninsisted on expanding this no-fly zone and claimed that its\naim, as declared by the highest officials in the United States\nAdministration, was to protect United States strategic\ninterests in the region. I wonder: Is a State entitled forcibly\nto impose such a situation on another independent State,\nalso a United Nations Member, on the pretext of protecting\nits strategic interests? Such acts would cause the law of the\njungle to prevail in international relations over the law of\nthe Charter.\nWe demand that the United Nations, the General\nAssembly and the Security Council reject this logic \u2014\nwhich is based neither on international legitimacy nor on\nthe authorization of the Security Council itself \u2014 and\nrelieve our country of this injustice. None of the\nallegations and pretexts put forward by the United States\nto justify its attacks and military build-up against Iraq\nhave any justification in law, fact or legitimacy. They\nshould be deplored and condemned.\nI would like here to express the gratitude of the\npeople of Iraq for the Arab and world reaction to this\naggression and the acts that followed, which were aimed\nat violating Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nNo one here is unaware of the suffering of the Iraqi\npeople as a result of the total blockade imposed on them,\nwhich has prevented them from satisfying their basic\nhuman needs for more than six years. Conditions in Iraq\nhave reached such an extreme that it has become\nimpossible for the United Nations to maintain the silence\nimposed on it by one party\u2019s will, especially when\nhumanitarian organizations and United Nations agencies\nhave loudly warned of the serious consequences and harm\nof continuing the total blockade of Iraq. Infant mortality\nrates have soared for lack of food and medicine. Disease\nis rampant. The health, education and environmental\nsectors have deteriorated. There have also been major\neffects and regression in other humanitarian fields, in the\ngrowth and development of which Iraq had been a\npioneer among third-world countries.\nHowever, the United States of America, which has\nbeen shedding crocodile tears over the humanitarian\nconditions of the Iraqi people and their need for food and\nmedicine, stands today publicly and blatantly against the\nlegal, balanced and proper implementation of the\nmemorandum of understanding on the \u201coil for food\u201d\nformula arrived at by Iraq and the United Nations\nSecretariat on 20 May 1995.\nWhile the professional and diplomatic dialogue\nbetween Iraq and the United Nations Secretariat managed\nto reach agreements satisfactory to both sides, the United\nStates tried to put all kinds of hurdles in the way of the\nnegotiations at each phase, with a view to delaying the\nfinalization of the memorandum of understanding. Then\nit started to set up road blocks, hindering the actual\nimplementation of the memorandum\u2019s provisions in the\nframework of the sanctions committees and in the\ncompletion of the administrative arrangements needed for\nsuch implementation.\n21\n\n\nI would like here to provide some statistics to\ndemonstrate the magnitude of the obstacles the United\nStates threw up to the process of drafting the memorandum\nof understanding. It is well known that it took 50 working\nmeetings to complete the memorandum \u2014 50 working\nmeetings \u2014 from 6 February to 20 May 1996. In the\ncourse of this process, the United States presented 29\namendments to the provisions of the memorandum agreed\nupon with the United Nations Secretariat during the\nnegotiations. Although Security Council resolution 986\n(1995) provides for accelerated procedures to implement\nagreements, it took 80 days to establish the said procedures.\nDuring this period, 28 informal meetings were held with\nexperts from the French and German missions; there were\nfive formal meetings, at which the procedures were\nsupposed to have been quickly completed and adopted. The\nUnited States, however, delayed that adoption for three\nmore weeks. The United States remains to this day the only\nparty blocking the implementation of the memorandum of\nunderstanding, and it does so for political reasons that\ncompletely contradict its own allegations that the purpose\nof resolution 986 (1995) is purely humanitarian.\nBecause of United States pressure and interference, the\nSecretary-General has so far been unable to implement the\nmemorandum of understanding. This is evidenced by the\nfact that discussion on the implementation of a six-month\nplan to provide food and medicine to the Iraqi people has\ntaken seven months. It is not yet complete because of\ncontinuous United States interference and derailing of the\nprocess to implement this memorandum. We believe that\nthese acts should cease and that the United Nations\nSecretariat and Iraq should be allowed to implement the\nmemorandum as soon as possible and without further\ninterference.\nThe Iraqi people want to be able to satisfy their own\nneeds, using their own capabilities and financial means.\nThey seek the lifting of restrictions whose sole aim is to\nstarve them and wound their honour and pride. However,\nlike the people of Iraq, a proud people more than 6,000\nyears old that has given birth to human civilizations, will\nnot kneel before any threat nor surrender its sovereignty\nand pride to those whose only aim is hegemony over the\nwealth of peoples and things sacred to them. Iraq is only\ndemanding its right \u2014 guaranteed by all international\ncovenants and customs and Security Council resolutions \u2014\nsince all the obligations imposed on Iraq have been carried\nout and all the reasons for the imposition of these unjust\nsanctions have been removed.\nIraq has fulfilled all its obligations under Security\nCouncil resolutions in spite of the injustice they involved.\nWhile these same resolutions place corresponding\nobligations on the Security Council, we have seen no\nmovement by the Council to meet them. We feel, rather,\nthat the Council has abdicated its powers of control and\nmonitoring of the implementation of its resolutions. It\nassigned that task to the Special Commission\n(UNSCOM), which it entrusted with the implementation\nof section C of resolution 687 (1991) and gave sole\nresponsibility to decide whether Iraq has carried out all its\nobligations and deserves to have the sanctions lifted.\nUNSCOM has been working throughout Iraq for\nnearly six years. It has sent 373 inspection teams,\ncomprising a total of 3,754 international inspectors, in\naddition to its established staff located in Baghdad, which\nis made up of more than 90 officials. The Commission\nuses the most up-to-date scientific and technological\nmeans and methods, which should have enabled it to\naccomplish its mission and verify the results of its work.\nIs it conceivable that this Commission has been unable to\naccomplish its mission to date? Would anybody ask the\nExecutive Chairman of UNSCOM what has been\naccomplished and what remains to be done? Is it\nconceivable that UNSCOM has not yet been able to\ndestroy the weapons of mass destruction once owned by\nIraq? What has this huge army of inspectors been doing\nall this time? They did not come to Iraq for a vacation. Is\nit true that the documents and equipment which the\nCommission alleges to remain but has been unable to find\nconstitute a threat to international peace and security and\nrequire the withholding of its recommendation that the\nsanctions against Iraq be lifted, even partially?\nIraq has fulfilled all its substantive obligations with\nregard to the implementation of section C of resolution\n687 (1991) on the elimination of prohibited weapons. I\nwould like to reaffirm from this rostrum, on behalf of my\nGovernment, that Iraq has retained no prohibited\nweapons, components of such weapons or documents\nrelated thereto. What UNSCOM has been saying about\nIraq\u2019s concealment of prohibited weapons, components of\nsuch weapons or documents related thereto is based on\nmere suspicion unsupported by material evidence. Those\nsuspicions emanate from American and British\nintelligence services and their agents.\nIraq has asked UNSCOM to address these suspicions\nin a practical, objective and apolitical manner. UNSCOM\nis not a political body to be influenced by the political\ngoals of any one country. It is, rather, a technical\n22\n\n\nCommission obliged to carry out its tasks in a technical and\nscientific manner free from political conflicts and\nantagonistic positions. We have witnessed in our dealings\nwith UNSCOM, however, that it tends to act out of political\nconsiderations rather than on the basis of technical and\nscientific facts.\nMy country demands that the permanent members of\nthe Security Council \u2014 including the Arab Republic of\nEgypt, the Arab representative on the Council and one of\nthe largest countries of the Middle East genuinely interested\nin seeing the region free from weapons of mass destruction\n\u2014 participate directly in the work and activities of\nUNSCOM and in the evaluation of its work and final\nconclusions. We are quite certain that, if this participation\nis carried out quickly and scrupulously, the conclusion will\nbe reached, supported by evidence and convincing\narguments, that the substantive issues in this file have been\nresolved as required by resolution 687 (1991) and that it is\nnow time for the implementation of paragraph 22 of the\nsaid resolution.\nWe wish to point out that our most recent experience\nwith work carried out under the auspices of the United\nNations has proven that there is a problem with the\nOrganization\u2019s structure. This problem is the large\nimbalance that exists between rights and obligations, in\naddition to the prevalence of the logic of force, which is\nnot in the provisions of the Charter. The machinery of the\ninternational Organization has been used as a tool to\nimplement the foreign policy of certain international super-\nPowers and to divert the United Nations, particularly the\nSecurity Council, from its natural path towards one that\nclearly contradicts the letter and spirit of the Charter which,\nas the organizing document of this Organization, forms the\nconstitutional and legal basis upon which the United\nNations must rely in all its practices.\nThe provisions of the Charter dictate that the Security\nCouncil shall act in accordance with these purposes and\nprinciples when discharging its duties in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and in adopting its\nresolutions, whose content and implementation should\nconform to the principles of justice and international law.\nThere are restrictions that the Council should abide by\nwhen adopting its resolutions, which should accord with the\npurposes and principles of the Organization, so that\nMember States are able to fulfil their obligation to accept\nand carry out the decisions of the Security Council\nresolutions in accordance with Article 25 of the Charter.\nThe Security Council is not a world Government endowed\nwith the power of legislation and detailed implementation\nbeyond the letter and spirit of the Charter. It is, rather, a\nUnited Nations organ that must abide by the legal norms\nwhich constitute the legal basis for international\nlegitimacy, embodied in every provision of the Charter of\nthe United Nations.\nBelieving in the principle of interdependence and in\nthe common interests of all the peoples of the Earth,\nbased on the sovereignty, independence and common\nconcerns of States, Iraq has contributed and continues to\ncontribute to the strengthening of the relations and values\nof multilateral international action. The poor countries of\nthe southern hemisphere are facing a series of attempts to\nmarginalize, isolate and prevent them from keeping pace\nwith scientific and economic developments. These\nattempts include raising trade and political barriers to\nhinder these countries\u2019 acquisition of technology and their\nchances of scientific progress, thereby subjecting them\nwilly-nilly to an economic machinery that furthers only\nthe interests of the large industrial Powers or the rich\ncountries of the North. As President Saddam Hussein\npointed out in his speech on Iraq\u2019s National Day last July,\nthe battle of the developing countries is the battle of the\nsouthern hemisphere for freedom, independence,\ndevelopment, prosperity and the enjoyment of rights and\njustice.\nPresident Saddam Hussein also pointed out that the\nUnited States of America and other international Powers\nhave promulgated slogans publicly calling upon the\ncountries of the South to develop their capabilities and\npotential, allegedly in order to bale themselves out from\nunderdevelopment, poverty and deprivation. But when\nIraq developed its capabilities and potential and used this\ndevelopment and its oil wealth to further its national\ndevelopment and advancement and to enhance Iraqis\u2019\nabilities and qualifications, the people responsible for the\nbanners and slogans mobilized, under United States\nleadership, all the forces of evil against Iraq and attacked\nit with the bombs, missiles and armies of the 30-nation\naggression in order to destroy my country\u2019s infrastructure\nand one of the new pillars of development among the\ncountries of the South.\nThis places on the United Nations a large and\nhistoric obligation to shoulder the responsibilities\nentrusted to it by the Charter and to ensure the rights of\nall peoples and countries to peace, development and\neconomic prosperity. The United Nations must be, as its\nfounding fathers wanted it to be, the international\ninstrument for the economic and social advancement of\nall peoples, rather than an instrument in the hands of a\n23\n\n\ncertain Power that uses it to impose its hegemony on the\nworld by force and blackmail.\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my country\u2019s\nfirm belief that the United Nations, through the strenuous\nefforts of its working groups on the reform of its structure\nand methods of work, and thanks to the good will of many\nof its Members, will in the near future again approach its\ntrue potential and capabilities to reject hegemony over it\nand to accomplish the goals and purposes of its Charter in\nconformity with international legitimacy and in the interest\nof the welfare and happiness of all mankind.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I congratulate the President\non his new responsibilities and pay tribute to Mr. Freitas\ndo Amaral of Portugal. During last year\u2019s jubilee session,\nhis persistence furthered this Assembly\u2019s revitalization\nprocess.\nLess than a year ago, world leaders met in this Hall to\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\nand renew their commitment to the Charter. The world\ncommunity rejoiced. Hope had survived the darkness of the\ncold war. Trust in the United Nations was, however,\ntempered by an awareness of the difficulties threatening its\nsurvival and the aspirations of the peoples it represents.\nCould the Organization address the new phenomenon of\ninstability which risked sapping its capacities and\nresources? What prevailed was a pragmatic assessment. The\nalternatives to the United Nations were either that of\nattempting to reinvent the wheel or scuttling this forum of\ndialogue and cooperation to have arrogance and chaos usher\nin the new millennium.\nWe, the peoples, can ill afford war. Rhetoric can never\ncancel the grief and destruction it generates. The United\nNations was founded to save succeeding generations from\nthis scourge. Notwithstanding the then-widespread\ncolonialism and the angst of bipolarism, the world\ncommunity worked to contain the risk of war. As the\nability to destroy grew, so did the potential of States to be\nannihilated. Brave, bold steps required clear vision and a\ncommitment to peace. The Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, extended indefinitely\nlast year, is a monumental landmark in this arduous quest.\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is another\nmilestone. Malta co-sponsored the resolution that led to\nits adoption by the General Assembly and is honoured to\nhave been amongst its first signatories.\nThe challenge remains. We must generate broader\nconfidence to ensure universal adherence and compliance\nto these treaties and others, including the Chemical\nWeapons Convention. Procrastination in their ratification\nby the States that matter most could expose them to the\ndanger of becoming dead letters. Malta welcomes the\ncommitment expressed by President Clinton of the United\nStates of America in this regard.\nThe risk of world conflict, though remote, is still\npresent. The total horror of a nuclear holocaust induces an\nin-built restraint. This is not the case with conventional\narmaments or weapons of mass destruction. Millions of\nvictims of local and regional conflicts \u2014 be they dead,\nmaimed, refugees, displaced, widowed or orphaned \u2014\ncontinue to torment the conscience of humankind. These\ntragedies spur us to pursue initiatives which foster\nsecurity and confidence. The call for a ban on the\nproduction, export and use of anti-personnel landmines\nhas Malta\u2019s full support. The seven-point programme of\naction proposed by the Foreign Minister Kinkel of\nGermany provides a good basis for progress.\nWe must melt the bastions of suspicion. Only a\nconsolidated regime of confidence-building and\ndisarmament measures can buttress belief in and\ncommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes. This\nprocess requires regional and international concerted\naction. Malta has been active in promoting security and\ncooperation in the Mediterranean. Malta and France have\nboth made proposals for a stability pact for the\nMediterranean. The sharing of concerns among countries\nafflicted by common problems can help overcome them.\nThis and other initiatives could turn our sea of turmoil\ninto one of mutual trust.\nMalta\u2019s foreign policy is both inspired and\ndependent on the notion of regional stability. It continues\n15\n\n\nto sustain our efforts at greater Mediterranean cooperation.\nIt inspired our proposal to have the Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe declare itself a regional\narrangement in terms of Chapter VIII of the United Nations\nCharter.\nThe enlargement of the European Union, of which\nMalta expects to become a full member in the near future,\nprovides a unique dimension of the process of regional\ncooperation. Malta welcomes the statement made by Deputy\nPrime Minister Spring of Ireland on behalf of the European\nUnion. It reflects the common values which have always\ninspired the European process and led to the consolidation\nof democracy, prosperity, social justice and solidarity. In\nthe framework of the structured dialogue, Malta has worked\nwith its European Union partners on key issues to promote\npeaceful coexistence, cooperation, development and\nprogress within the world community.\nMalta supports the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.\nCooperation in the political, security, economic and\nfinancial areas cannot but yield results. Social, cultural and\nhuman relations are other important aspects of this\npartnership. Malta has always seen its application for\nmembership of the European Union in terms that\nencompass the economic and the broader political\ndimensions. The successful outcome of the negotiations on\nMalta\u2019s accession, due to start in the coming months, will\nfurther strengthen our contribution.\nInterlocking institutions of the European security\narchitecture, such as the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe, the Partnership for Peace and the\nCouncil of Europe, have strengthened the distinct areas of\ncooperation on which security depends. We must identify\nand combat threats to peace as they emerge.\nWe have witnessed the horror of intolerance based on\nnationality, race, creed or political belief. Agonizing\nconflicts and acts of terrorism have shattered lives and\ntrampled upon the rights and dignity of whole populations.\nSuch events have shocked us into action. The\nestablishment of the ad hoc Tribunals and the current\nnegotiations on the establishment of an international\ncriminal court, which Malta fully supports, are proof of the\nvaried manner in which the United Nations responds to new\nneeds.\nThe road to peace, through the compromise of\nnegotiated settlement, is not always immediate or popular.\nYet, it is the only path. Reconciliation does not happen of\nits own accord. It requires courage and leaders who\nstretch out their hand to their adversaries and build, brick\nby brick, the edifice of stability.\nThe universally acclaimed processes which rekindled\nthe hope of settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the\nMiddle East are parts of this noble task.\nThe implementation of agreements reached between\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization, the\nresumption of negotiations and the full realization of the\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people are\nindispensable for stability in the Middle East. The\ninternational community must continue to assist this\nprocess. Malta welcomes the first meeting between Prime\nMinister Netanyahu and President Arafat. The most recent\nincidents of violence in Jerusalem and Ramallah in recent\ndays give rise to great concern. The momentum of\nachievement should not be dissipated by acts which erode\nthe confidence built thus far.\nThe people of Cyprus have thirsted for peace and\nunity for too long and also deserve the attainment of a\njust and long-lasting settlement.\nIn this Hall, recognition was always and exclusively\nreserved for peacemakers. It was never bestowed on\nwarmongers, aggressors or cynics who constantly doubt\nand discourage others from building hope.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the Office of\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the\nWorld Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme and United Nations actions in\nPalestine, Namibia, Cambodia and Mozambique are part\nof this Organization\u2019s history in contributing towards the\nwell-being and development of peoples, peacekeeping and\npeace-building. The success achieved should not be\nrobbed of merit by instances where it is lacking. Are not\nthe Blue Helmets across the globe a signal of\nengagement? Are not negotiations on preventive\ndiplomacy a commitment to addressing the root causes of\ntension and conflict? Are not our deliberations on\ndevelopment means to create stability and well-being at\nthe local level?\nIn 50 years, we have created a range of tools to\npromote cooperation. True enough, our tools need\nperfecting. We must calibrate them to current realities.\nTools, however, need to be used. A shed full of perfect,\nbut unused, tools never provided any farmer with a\n16\n\n\nlivelihood. Only the will to operate tools and invest energy\nwhere it matters helps to reap the fruit.\nThe future demands a more action-oriented approach:\nmore time in the field, rather than pondering in the shed.\nThis resolve inspires us as we follow up the United Nations\nconferences on the environment, human rights, population,\nsocial development, women\u2019s rights and human settlements.\nThe World Food Summit is another example of action.\nRenewed focus on development has led to various\ninitiatives, including those specific to Africa. Partnerships\nforged by the European Union and Japan with the\ndeveloping world reflect active cooperative involvement.\nAchievement registered by a number of developing States\nunderlines the benefit of such undertakings. The dialogue\ninstituted between Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of\n77 and the Group of Seven is an important and welcome\nstep.\nMalta\u2019s academic institutions, in collaboration with\nUnited Nations agencies and the Commonwealth secretariat,\nannually sponsor and organize a number of training\nprogrammes. Most fall into the category of the training of\ntrainers. Students from the developing world and from\ncountries with economies in transition have attended short-\nor long-term courses and are now back in their countries\ndirectly contributing to development.\nMalta, through its Government and non-governmental\norganizations, regularly donates funds for a number of\nhumanitarian and overseas development aid programmes.\nThese initiatives, together with the traditional involvement\nof Maltese teachers and social workers in the developing\nworld as volunteers from non-governmental organizations\nor members of religious orders, symbolize our national\ncommitment to international solidarity.\nWe view our collective achievements with pride. Each\nconvention and treaty agreed upon by the international\ncommunity is a testimonial of our common will to build a\nbetter life, each a symbol of our resolve to beat our swords\ninto ploughshares. Yet, the anguished sea of faces of\nmillions of children denied the right to hope still haunts us,\nwhether it is war, famine, or exploitation which generates\nmisery. Our collective future can never be secure until these\nchildren acquire the right to smile in hope and to their fair\nshare in the bounties of society.\nCynicism and fatalism cannot cure us of social ills.\nBlended with hope, pragmatism yields reward. What is\nmore pragmatic than the care of the destitute to which\npeople like Mother Theresa dedicate their lives. One\nperson less going to bed with an empty stomach, one\nperson less torn with pain, one person less denied\nshelter \u2014 small pragmatic steps inspired by the innate\ndignity of each human being; acts of caring solidarity\nwhich each individual, each family, each community is\ncapable of; commitment to others generates hope. Each\nounce of food which alleviates famine; each drop of water\nwhich combats drought and desertification; each dose of\nmedicine which contains the spread of disease; each book\nwhich kindles knowledge helps build a better world.\nDemocracy, the rule of law, free and fair elections\nand constant vigilance in the promotion and protection of\nhuman rights are the guarantors of peace. International\nelection observer missions are an important contribution\nto confidence-building. Malta has participated in this\nprocess, most recently in Palestine and Bosnia and\nHerzegovina.\nAs much as action is instrumental, so is restraint.\nEmissions which pollute the environment; lumbering\nwhich depletes the rain forests; indiscriminate trawling\nwhich exhausts our fishstocks \u2014 even if disguised as\neconomic imperatives \u2014 undermine efforts towards\nsustainable development.\nMalta looks forward to this Assembly\u2019s 1997 special\nsession to follow up and update the Rio achievements.\nWe have strategies and action plans. Now is the time\nfor dynamic engagement. Present and future generations\ndemand that we use these instruments to combat drug\ntrafficking, illicit arms transfers, money laundering and\norganized crime, which sap the life of the communities\nwe built with so much effort.\nMy Government is totally committed in this regard.\nLegislation adopted has strengthened the arm of the law\nin apprehending traffickers, halting the flow of drugs and\nconfiscating illegal funds accrued. This determined policy\nis bearing fruit. Malta supports the convening of a\nGeneral Assembly special session in 1998\ncomprehensively to address drug trafficking and related\nissues. Poland\u2019s proposed convention to fight transnational\ncrime has been noted with interest. Regional and\ninternational cooperation on these issues remains the key\nto success.\nOur children have a right to a life free from fear in\na safer world. That remains our responsibility as parents\nand policy makers.\n17\n\n\nThe United Nations is often accused of lacking in its\nassigned role. Yet the United Nations is what Member\nStates make of it. They decide on its future. United Nations\nreform requires discipline in our operating methods. We\nhave to discard self-imposed fetters and act with the\nrevived spirit that our times demand.\nTempered by the fires of conflict and the lessons of\nthe League of Nations, the founding fathers built into the\nCharter a balance worth preserving. Reform should not be\nreduced to a simple juxtaposition of organizational charts.\nOnly by revitalizing the spirit that gives our Organization\nlife and purpose will we achieve the ideal of nations large\nand small working in unison for a better world.\nAs President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth\nsession, in the immediate aftermath of the cold war, my\nDeputy Prime Minister, Mr. Guido de Marco, called for\nreflection and action to better the symbiotic relationship\nbetween the United Nations principal organs. Since then\nworking groups have been set up to discuss restructuring.\nWithin the Security Council reform group, work has\nevolved, but it is still far from reaching common ground.\nThere is consensus that the Council should be expanded and\nbe more representative. The type of expansion and the\ncategories are still subject to a wide divergence of views.\nMalta looks forward to an expanded Security Council that\nbest serves the world community. On the merits of\nincreasing the Council\u2019s permanent membership, we still\nhave an open mind. The very nature of permanence\ndemands that we establish clear and exact criteria on\nrequired qualifications for present and future candidates.\nGiving due recognition to changes in international\nrelations and the nature and extent of the contribution of\nStates towards tasks assigned to the Council, we must avoid\nrigid stances or those that may be construed as such. There\nare a number of compromise proposals that could help us\nfind a solution, even if temporarily. We have listened with\ngreat attention and positive interest to Foreign Minister Dini\nexplaining the Italian proposal as one which takes into\naccount both the special contribution of a number of States\nand the right of all States to serve on the Council regardless\nof their size, wealth or military might.\nOnly understandings between States that win the\nconfidence of all can assist us in surmounting existing\nobstacles. We are satisfied to note the consensus existing on\nbettering the important qualitative relationship between the\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly. Changes\nintroduced in the working methods of the Council are an\nindication of a universal positive disposition.\nThe Open-ended High-level Working Group on the\nStrengthening of the United Nations system has registered\nsignificant progress and tackled a variety of complex\nissues. Malta has consistently advocated greater efficiency\nand a more effective role for the General Assembly to\ndissipate negative perceptions that may exist.\nResponsibilities of this Assembly, of which we are all\npermanent members, are many and varied. We have\nalready noted the benefits of streamlining. More is\nrequired. Our deliberations have an impact on public\nopinion and political contingencies. We would be remiss\nif indifference or bureaucratization were to numb us from\nfully assuming the responsibilities and obligations\nimposed by the Charter.\nStarting with the forty-fifth session, my Deputy\nPrime Minister has also called for a review of the role of\nthe Trusteeship Council. Creating or abolishing\ninstitutions necessarily has an impact on the principles on\nwhich they are based. The balance characteristic of the\nCharter needs to be enhanced rather than diluted. The\nUnited Nations should continue to cherish all principles\non which it was founded, including the notion of trust, on\nwhich the Trusteeship Council rests.\nLast year, Malta submitted a resolution seeking the\nopinion of States on the Trusteeship Council\u2019s future. The\ndiversity of views expressed is indicative of the existing\npotential. Malta looks forward to further discussion on the\nsubject, confident in the will to better utilize existing\ninstitutions to serve the principles of the Charter. Our\ncommon heritage and the welfare of future generations\ndemand that in reorienting the United Nations we\npreserve and protect the vision and ideals that gave it\nbirth.\nThirty years ago Malta launched the concept of\ncommon heritage. This concept has become ingrained in\nthe reality of the United Nations Convention on the Law\nof the Sea and the International Sea-Bed Authority. It\ntakes time for ideas to mature and consensus to emerge.\nThe most recent development, which we welcome, is the\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, to be\ninaugurated at Hamburg, Germany, next month. Those\ninstitutions will undoubtedly continue to contribute to the\nunderlying principle of trust in protecting and preserving\nour common heritage.\n18\n\n\nThe financial crisis facing the Organization has\ndampened hopes and discouraged many. Malta believes that\nthe ongoing exercise of assessing costs, eliminating waste\nand rationalizing structures must go on. Although pruning\nis essential to strengthen the United Nations, so also is the\nneed for all Member States to meet obligations and to pay\ntheir assessed contributions to the regular and peacekeeping\nbudgets, in full, promptly and without conditions.\nDiscussion on the scale of assessments will also contribute\nto improving the financial base of the Organization.\n\u201cBankruptcy\u201d is an awful word. It is too often\nrepeated in relation to the United Nations. Finances are\nundoubtedly a cause of common concern. There is,\nhowever, another threatening phenomenon which looms \u2014\nmoral bankruptcy. This is by far the greater danger and the\none that we should fear most.\nWith the end of the cold war, a second-generation\nUnited Nations had to find in its Member States the resolve\nand commitment to face winds of change that at times\nassume the force of gales and whirlwinds. With a steady\nhand on the rudder and our eyes fixed on that guiding star\nthat inspired the founding fathers, we can still bring ship to\nport. The fate of humankind is our precious cargo and\nresponsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a pleasure for me to warmly congratulate Mr. Razali\non his election to the presidency of the fifty-first session of\nthe General Assembly. We are sure that his extensive\nexperience and political sophistication will make a\nsignificant contribution to the success of its work. I should\nlike also to express my thanks and appreciation to his\npredecessor for his judicious management of the work of\nthe General Assembly during its last session.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express once\nmore my country\u2019s appreciation of the role played by the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and of his\nsincere, invaluable efforts to strengthen the role of the\nOrganization in keeping abreast of international events and\ndevelopments to the benefit of all humanity and in order to\npreserve international peace and security. On behalf of\nYemen, I would also like to express my country\u2019s support\nfor the re-election of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a\nsecond term as Secretary-General so he can continue the\ncomprehensive restructuring of the United Nations, which\nwill enable it to play a significant and fundamental role\nresponsive to the demands of the twenty-first century.\nAs this session is being held, new and dangerous\ndevelopments are taking place, threatening peace and\nsecurity in the Middle East. The situation in Jerusalem and\nother parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has\nexploded as a result of the aggressive unjustified actions\nand harsh practices undertaken by the Israeli authorities\nagainst the Palestinian people, and their continued attempts\nto change the character of Holy Al-Quds Al-Sharif. The\nmost recent of these attempts was Israel\u2019s opening of a\ntunnel linking Al-Borac Square and Al-Mujahidin Street\nnear Bab Al-Asbat, threatening the integrity of Al-Haram\nAl-Sharif and other Islamic monuments. During the last few\ndays, the Israeli army and police force have used various\nkinds of weapons and live ammunition against unarmed\nPalestinian protesters. These clashes have caused the\ndeath or injury of hundreds of innocent Palestinians.\nWe strongly condemn and denounce the actions and\npractices of the Israeli military forces and their repeated\nacts of aggression against Palestinian officials and citizens\nin Arab Al-Quds and other Palestinian towns, which have\nled to the death and injury of hundreds of people. The\nterrorism and oppression carried out by the Israeli\noccupying authority constitute a gross violation of human\nrights, legitimate international resolutions and the Fourth\nGeneva Convention, which applies to occupied territories.\nThis critical development can only exacerbate the\nsituation and return the region to a cycle of tension and\nviolence. It threatens peace and security not only in the\nMiddle East region but in the whole world.\nThis year, the Republic of Yemen celebrated the\nsixth anniversary of its unification, achieved after\nsuccessfully overcoming all the difficulties and challenges\nin the way of unity and development. These celebrations\ncoincided with preparations for voter registration for the\nsecond parliamentary elections since the reunification of\nour country, which are to be held in April 1997\nreinforcing democracy in our country. Our democratic\napproach is demonstrated by our political pluralism, and\nour respect for human rights and freedom of the press,\nand will enable us to achieve qualitative changes in the\neconomic, social and political life of Yemeni citizens.\nToday the Republic of Yemen is enjoying stability,\na democratic process and economic reforms, which must\nenjoy the encouragement and support of the international\ncommunity since this democratic process will contribute\nto the strengthening of security and stability at the local\nand regional levels.\nAt the same time, our people are in the midst of a\ndifficult and important battle for social and economic\ndevelopment and modernization and for the elimination of\nbackwardness. Some of the most serious problems we\nface as a developing country are inflation, the increase in\nthe rates of population growth and their effects on the\ngrowth rate of the national economy. In order to deal with\nthat, the Government has adopted a programme of\neconomic, financial and administrative reforms in\ncooperation with the International Monetary Fund and the\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development\nwith the aim of correcting economic, financial and\nstructural imbalances. This has been done to achieve\nbalance and stability in the economy as a whole and to\n20\n\n\nactivate the role of the private sector on the basis of a\nmarket economy and free competition, while taking into\naccount the importance of improving basic essential social\nservices, building a modern State and improving the\nstandard of living of citizens.\nEfforts by the Yemeni Government to implement this\nprogramme have yielded improvements and have had\nnotable success, especially in preventing the collapse of the\nlocal currency, reducing the rate of inflation and achieving\na positive growth rate. However, it has proved difficult to\nalleviate suffering in the social sphere. These difficulties\nhave been compounded by the disastrous floods which\nplagued Yemen last June, causing extensive, grave losses of\nlife and property. These affected some parts of the\ninfrastructure and harmed many people. Agricultural land\nwas eroded and livestock was destroyed. Houses, roads,\nbridges, health centres, sources of drinking water and\nschools in many areas of the Republic of Yemen were all\ndestroyed. These losses and damages were a major disaster\nand economic setback for Yemen.\nI would like to take this opportunity to renew my call\nfor international and humanitarian organizations and\nfraternal and friendly Governments to provide help and\nsupport to overcome the disastrous effects of the floods. I\nwould also like to thank all those organizations and\nGovernments that have responded and offered support for\nand solidarity with the people of Yemen in their ordeal.\nThe Republic of Yemen, in the framework of its\npolitical orientation, is pursuing a foreign policy based on\nmutual respect and the common interests of States. It\ntherefore stresses the importance of maintaining security,\nstability and cooperation among all States in the region. In\nthis regard, demarcation of the border between our country\nand the fraternal Sultanate of Oman has been definitively\nconcluded through a dialogue based upon mutual interests,\nequitable treatment and respect for the rights of both\ncountries. This achievement represents a significant positive\nstep that will serve security and stability in the region and\ndeepen trust between the two countries. Similarly, our\ncountry is working with the same sincerity and credibility\nto settle the issue of the border with the fraternal Kingdom\nof Saudi Arabia on the basis of mutual interests and in the\nlight of the Taif Agreement and the contents of the\nmemorandum of understanding signed by the two countries\non 26 February 1995 in the Holy City of Mecca.\nPursuant to this, joint committees have been formed to\ndiscuss the border issue, its demarcation, the development\nof all aspects of cultural, trade and economic relations and\nthe strengthening of cooperation between the two fraternal\ncountries.\nMoreover, a security agreement was signed on 27\nJuly 1996 that emphasized the concerns of both countries\nfor their joint security and to combat terrorism, exchange\nsecurity information and strengthen cooperation between\ntheir institutions, thus giving concrete form to the spirit of\nthe 1934 Taif Treaty and the memorandum of\nunderstanding signed on 26 February 1995. An agreement\non technical, investment, trade and economic cooperation\nwas also signed.\nThe Republic of Yemen has shown a sincere desire\nand strong political will and has made continuous efforts\nto address the matter of the Eritrean occupation in\nmid-December 1995 of the Yemeni island of Hanish\nal-Kabir in the Red Sea. While negotiations were taking\nplace between the two countries aimed at reaching a\npeaceful settlement that would respect legal, historical and\ngeographical rights, our country did not opt for the use of\nforce. From the very first day, we stressed the necessity\nof using peaceful means, dialogue through mediators and\ninternational arbitration in order to spare the two\nneighbouring peoples the scourges of war and conflict, in\nkeeping with its belief in the principles and purposes of\nthe United Nations and its commitment to the provisions\nof the Charter. Accordingly, an agreement of principles\nbetween Yemen and Eritrea was officially signed in Paris\non 21 May 1996. This was the fruit of French, Egyptian\nand Ethiopian mediation efforts and of the support of our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. This\nagreement was a sound basis on which to settle peacefully\nthe dispute between the two countries regarding issues of\nterritorial sovereignty and maritime borders. On this basis,\ndiscussions have begun on special arbitration measures\nand the mechanism to be used with a view to starting the\nprocess as soon as possible. It is unfortunate that, despite\nall these procedures, Eritrea took new action on the island\nof Hanish af-Saghir on 10 August 1996. This act violated\nthe agreement of principles and created an atmosphere of\ntension and conflict in the region, threatening stability,\nsecurity and the safety of international shipping in the\nregion.\nNow that Eritrea has withdrawn its forces from the\nisland of Hanish af-Saghir and the crisis has passed, we\nwould like to express our thanks and appreciation for the\nrole played and efforts made by France and its special\nenvoy, and the positions of the Secretary-General and the\nPresident and members of the Security Council, and to all\nthose fraternal and friendly States that declared their\n21\n\n\nsupport for the principles agreed upon for resolving the\nconflict peacefully through arbitration. Finally, my country\nwould like to stress that a peaceful settlement is the proper\nway to improve relations between Yemen and Eritrea and\nto promote the trust necessary to creating an atmosphere\nconducive to the development of relations between the two\ncountries and the peoples of Yemen and Eritrea.\nThe civil war in Somalia has gone beyond the bounds\nof reason and, as our country is a neighbour of fraternal\nSomalia, we have found ourselves shouldering the burden\nof receiving and housing tens of thousands of refugees. We\nhave also cooperated with the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees and non-governmental\norganizations in sheltering and feeding the Somali refugees,\nalthough this is a heavy burden on our country and\ncompounds its existing economic and social ills.\nWe are deeply disturbed by the continuing\nfragmentation, fighting and uncertainty in Somalia. The\nRepublic of Yemen considers that the responsibility for\nsolving the refugee problem, which is a social and\neconomic burden of significant proportions, and the solution\nof the Somali problem lie with the Somalis themselves. On\nthat basis, we urge the Somali leadership once again to\ndemonstrate greater political will and a genuine desire to\nreach a final settlement for peace and stability in their\ncountry and to engage in dialogue in order to save their\npeople, rebuild their country and give the refugees the\nopportunity to return to their homes and resettle. In order\nto facilitate this, Yemen has received a number of Somali\nleaders and made every effort to assist the Somalis\nthemselves to reach a national accord acceptable to all. We\nhope these efforts will be successful. The achievement of\nnational reconciliation in Somalia and the improvement of\nsecurity and stability in that country and the entire Horn of\nAfrica are at the forefront of our concerns, embodying our\nhistorical and strategic relationships, which are inextricably\nintertwined with all the States of the region.\nIn view of the Republic of Yemen\u2019s positive support\nfor the peace process in the Middle East, which began with\nthe Madrid Conference in October 1991, guaranteeing a just\nand comprehensive peace on the basis of legitimate\ninternational resolutions, particularly Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978), and\nsubsequent agreements and protocols in this regard, and on\nthe basis of the principle of land for peace and guarantees\nof complete Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab\nterritories, we once again emphasize the necessity for a\nlasting, just and comprehensive peace as the basis for\nsecurity, stability and prosperity in the region. Only this can\nensure that the root causes of violence and extremism will\nbe destroyed and that the values of tolerance, peaceful\ncoexistence and civilized cooperation among peoples will\nbe promoted.\nAccordingly, we would like to express our concern\nabout the resumption of the Israeli policy of settlement on\nPalestinian land, especially around the city of Al-Quds\nAl-Sharif. The Israelis are establishing settlements,\ndestroying Palestinian houses, building bypass roads for\nIsraeli settlers, continuing the blockade of Palestinian\nlands and refusing to redeploy Israeli forces out of\nHebron. These Israeli practices constitute blatant\nviolations of agreements and pledges made between Israel\nand the Palestinian Authority and can only exacerbate\ntensions and return the peace process to its starting point,\npossibly even derailing the entire process.\nWe therefore stress the importance of making rapid\nprogress towards a final settlement leading to restoration\nof the Palestinians\u2019 legitimate rights, particularly the\nrights to self-determination and to establish an\nindependent State with Jerusalem as its capital, in\naccordance with relevant international resolutions and the\nbasic principles underlying the Madrid Conference.\nNegotiations on the basis of those principles and with all\nparties respecting their commitments should be conducted\non all tracks.\nThe peace process is currently facing risks and\nchallenges that are preventing it from achieving its aims.\nIsrael is deliberately dragging its feet and is persistent in\nits procrastination over negotiations with the Syrian Arab\nRepublic on the basis of the agreements reached by both\nparties under the previous Israeli Government. Among the\nmost important of these was the obligation to withdraw\nfully from the occupied Syrian Golan and southern\nLebanon in accordance with relevant international\nresolutions and the principle of \u201cland for peace\u201d. We\nstress the need for Israel to respect the sovereignty and\nindependence of fraternal Lebanon, release Lebanese\nprisoners and detainees from Israeli concentration camps\nand acknowledge its responsibility to compensate\nLebanon for the losses it has sustained as a result of the\ncontinuing Israeli acts of aggression against its land and\npeople.\nA just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the\nMiddle East, together with security and stability in the\nregion, can be achieved only if every State of the region\nfulfils its obligations equally and through the\nestablishment of a nuclear-, biological- and chemical-\n22\n\n\nweapon-free zone in the region. Israel must ratify the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and\nsubmit its nuclear installations to the international\ninspection regime as a step towards establishing a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone in the Middle East and freeing the area\nfrom the threat of all weapons of mass destruction. In this\ncontext, we would like to express our satisfaction at the\nsigning of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty at\nthe beginning of this session. Yemen will sign the Treaty\ntoday.\nWhile Yemen stresses the importance of Iraq\u2019s total\ncompliance with resolutions of the international community\nand its continuing cooperation with the United Nations, we\nwould also stress the need to preserve the unity, territorial\nsovereignty and integrity of Iraq. We also express our great\nconcern about and condemnation of any action in this\nregard affecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\nIraq and appeal for the alleviation of the suffering of the\nIraqi people. We therefore welcome the memorandum of\nunderstanding signed in May 1996 between Iraq and the\nUnited Nations on the implementation of Security Council\nresolution 986 (1995), providing for the sale of petroleum\nfor the purchase of food as a first step towards alleviating\nthe terrible suffering of the fraternal Iraqi people.\nWe call upon the international community and the\nSecurity Council to pursue the lifting of the air blockade\nand other measures imposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\npursuant to Security Council resolutions and to respond to\nthe resolutions and proposals of regional organizations. The\nmost recent of these was the initiative put forward at the\nemergency Arab summit held in Cairo from 21 to 23 June\n1996 in order to resolve the conflict between the Libyan\nArab Jamahiriya and the three countries concerned.\nThe Republic of Yemen renews its call to the fraternal\ncountries of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United\nArab Emirates to continue a direct dialogue aimed at\nreaching a peaceful settlement of the issue of the three\nislands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, in\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the\nprinciples of good neighbourliness and respect for the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States in the region,\nand to resort to international arbitration in a manner that\nwill satisfy both parties.\nOur country also emphasizes its solidarity with\nfraternal Bahrain and expresses its complete support for the\nmeasures it has taken to ensure its security and stability.\nThe tragic situation of the people of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina has preoccupied the Yemeni people. The\nRepublic of Yemen therefore welcomes the Agreements\nthat the parties involved in the conflict reached last\nNovember in Dayton and Paris in order to bring peace to\nBosnia and Herzegovina, and to express its satisfaction\nwith the contents of the Agreements, which stressed the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of\nBosnia and Herzegovina. On this occasion, we wish to\nregister our appreciation of the efforts made by the United\nStates of America and the States of the European Union\nto bring about these Agreements. We call upon the\ninternational community to provide every possible support\nto the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and their plans\nfor the development and reconstruction of their country.\nWe would also stress the need for every party to\nsurrender all war criminals to the International Tribunal\nin The Hague so that they may be brought to account for\ntheir heinous crimes against humanity in violation of\ninternational law, human rights and international\nagreements.\nThe Republic of Yemen, in view of its geographical\nposition on the Indian Ocean, places particular importance\non any effort made to strengthen cooperation between the\nOcean\u2019s littoral States. Accordingly, our country took part\nin the most recent meeting, held in Mauritius, to complete\nthe drafting of the constitution and platform of action for\nthe planned Indian Ocean rim initiative.\nWe take this opportunity to express our satisfaction\nwith the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian\nOcean to implement the Declaration of the Indian Ocean\nas a Zone of Peace, free of nuclear weapons. We call\nupon the permanent members of the Security Council and\nmaritime users of the Indian Ocean to participate in the\nwork of the Committee in order to strengthen security,\npeace, stability and cooperation in the region in\naccordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions.\nIn conclusion, I should like to express our hope that\nthe work of this session will enjoy every success,\nstrengthening the United Nations and its bodies and\nenabling them to achieve their goals and the ideals\nembodied in the Charter in a manner appropriate to the\nspirit of the age and international changes\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I, on behalf of the\ndelegation of Jamaica, convey to Mr. Razali Ismail our\nwarmest congratulations on his election as President of\nthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly. In so\ndoing we pay tribute to his country, Malaysia, which is\nlinked to Jamaica by close ties of friendship and\ncollaboration and which continues to play a prominent\nrole in international affairs. I would assure him of the full\nsupport and cooperation of the Jamaican delegation in the\ndeliberations on the many important issues before us.\nI should like to congratulate your predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for the able\nmanner in which he guided the work of the fiftieth\nsession. Let me also express appreciation to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his untiring\nefforts to promote peace and development.\nThere are many who, with good reason, approach\nthis fifty-first session with a sense of despair and deep\nconcern about the future of the United Nations and the\nvital mission that it must undertake on behalf of the\npeoples of the world. They look back at the promises and\nthe pledges made during the fiftieth anniversary\ncelebrations and try to reconcile these lofty messages with\nthe continuing crisis being faced by this body and the\ndifficulties confronting the multilateral system.\nRather than dwelling on the missed opportunities and\nthe difficulties that have confronted us, my delegation\nwould wish for this Assembly to recognize the imperative\n15\n\n\nneed for effective global action in the pursuit of the goals\nof international peace and security, economic and social\nwell-being, and justice for all. In so doing, we must all\nreaffirm our commitment to the principles on which the\nUnited Nations is based. Our Prime Minister, P. J.\nPatterson, and other world leaders joined in renewing the\ncollective commitment to these principles at last year\u2019s\nSpecial Commemorative Meeting.\nThe fundamental goal of the United Nations is the\nachievement and preservation of international peace and\nsecurity. We have witnessed in recent times the end of the\ncold war and the dramatic reduction in East-West tensions.\nAt the same time, we have witnessed the tragic emergence\nof horrific levels of ethnic tension, regional instability and\nintra-State upheavals, which have threatened international\npeace and security. These have severely tested the mettle of\nthe United Nations system and the community of nations as\na whole.\nThe challenges to peacemakers and peacekeepers in\nthis period have been many. We must, today, recognize the\nsuccesses that have been achieved through combined\nmultilateral and regional action in the spirit of the Charter.\nA functioning multilateral system should work effectively\nto restrain aggression and the exercise of military power.\nWe must resist tendencies towards unilateralism which are\nunhealthy and negative signs for the international system.\nWe must insist that the established mechanisms for conflict\nresolution and decision-making in relation to issues of\nmultilateral security are upheld.\nJamaica and sister nations of the Caribbean joined the\ninternational community in mounting a United Nations\nMission in Haiti that brought an end to the wanton violence\nand the tragedies at sea that characterized the period of\nmilitary dictatorship in that country.\nThe return of democracy has brought renewed hope,\nopportunity and optimism to the people of Haiti. These\nsentiments can be sustained only if we continue to help the\nGovernment and people of Haiti to overcome the obstacles\nthat still confront them in this quest. It is important that the\nUnited Nations Support Mission in Haiti be given the\nmeans necessary to enable it to meet its objectives. It is\neven more critical that the international community commit\nitself to providing the technical and financial resources\nnecessary to assist Haiti to achieve economic and social\ndevelopment.\nThe nations of the Caribbean seek to maintain a\nclimate free of tension and confrontation. We seek the\nnormalization of relations, which will reduce the\natmosphere of uncertainty and the dangers of\nconfrontation in the region. We seek this in an\natmosphere of respect for sovereign rights and a\ncommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes. We\nreject the extra-territorial application of national\nlegislation, which is inconsistent with international law.\nWithin the wider Caribbean, we continue to pursue\nthe goal of regional integration through the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) and the Association of\nCaribbean States. It is our objective to achieve the\ncreation of a Caribbean zone of peace and cooperation.\nWe are united by a common determination to remove the\nbarriers that divide us and to protect the precious natural\nheritage that we share. For this we have to engage the\nactive participation of all countries in the region.\nWe wish to commend the efforts of African\nGovernments and the Organization of African Unity to\novercome the grave difficulties that Africa has been\nexperiencing. We particularly welcome the initiative for\na conference on peace, security and stability in the\nAfrican Great Lakes region. We can only hope that,\nthrough a comprehensive approach, lasting solutions can\nbe found to the situations in Burundi and Rwanda. We\nreiterate our strong support for the efforts of the\ninternational community to implement the United Nations\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\nand the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on\nAfrica.\nWe are encouraged by recent events in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, which have paved the way for elections in\nthat country, and look forward to the restoration of\nstability and a harmonious relationship among its people.\nWe support the position that the Middle East peace\nprocess should be consolidated and proceed on the basis\nof the principles already agreed and accepted by all\nparties. There should be no turning back. Peace is\nattainable if the parties approach negotiations in a spirit\nof accommodation and compromise, and recognize their\ncommon interest in ensuring stability and mutual respect\nfor each other\u2019s rights. We hope that the talks, which\nbegin today at the invitation of President Clinton, will\nlead to a speedy agreement among the parties.\nWhile the United Nations must focus critical\nattention on the crises caused by conflict and violent\nconfrontation, it must never lose sight of the root cause of\ninstability and tension \u2014 poverty, deprivation, hunger\n16\n\n\nand disease. It is in the depth of human misery that the\nswords of anger and division are most quickly unsheathed.\nA commitment to the goals of peace and security is\nmeaningless without a commitment to fostering sustained\neconomic growth and sustainable development, and to\nwaging war on poverty and human misery.\nThe emerging global economic environment gives us\ncause for both optimism and grave anxiety. Phenomenal\neconomic growth in a few countries is contrasted with\ndecline and stagnation in the majority. An increasingly\naffluent world coexists with a huge and marginalized\nunderclass. This polarization is reflected both internally and\nexternally.\nA failure to address inequities can and will inevitably\nlead to what the 1996 Human Development Report so\ngraphically describes on page 8 as\n\u201ca world gargantuan in its excesses and grotesque in\nits human and economic inequalities.\u201d\nFor many low-income countries that lack adequate\naccess to development capital and other resources, official\ndevelopment assistance remains a critical but diminishing\nsource of support. Moreover, the problem of external debt\nis also a burden for many of these countries. Agreed\narrangements have proved inadequate in alleviating debt\nburdens, and alternate strategies still have to be found.\nIt is against this background that Jamaica continues to\ninsist that achieving sustained economic growth and\nsustainable development must remain a priority objective of\nthe global agenda. In the series of global conferences\nending recently with the Second United Nations Conference\non Human Settlements (Habitat II), Governments\ndemonstrated their ability to collaborate in analyzing socio-\neconomic and environmental problems.\nTaken together, these conferences represent deliberate\nefforts to define a framework for development cooperation\nand multilateral commitments. These global forums have\nraised the level of awareness of development issues. We\nshould now not allow inertia to take over. It is essential,\ntherefore, that we honour the commitments and meet the\ninternationally agreed targets emanating from these\nconferences. Their success depends on political will and the\nprovision of adequate resources to ensure follow-up and\nimplementation.\nThe 1997 special session devoted to the assessment\nand review of the implementation of Agenda 21 and the\nresults of the 1992 United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development in Rio will provide an\nideal opportunity for the international community to\nassess progress in carrying out the agreed commitments.\nFor small island developing countries, the review\nprocess is of great significance, and we hope it will\nprovide the momentum fully to implement the Barbados\nProgramme of Action.\nGovernments, including my own, have created their\nown framework for implementation at the national level.\nJamaica has embraced the concept of sustainable\ndevelopment, and our policies have been oriented towards\nachieving these goals.\nThe main challenge faced by small island developing\nStates is to find the resources to develop a programme\nthat is designed to reduce the vulnerability of their\neconomies and generate economic growth and\ndevelopment. This envisages a systematic approach to the\ncategorization of island developing countries by\nspecialization or socio-economic performance.\nThe Uruguay Round agreements, on which the\nWorld Trade Organization is founded, provide the\nframework for a liberalized multilateral trading system.\nMany developing countries are unlikely to benefit in\nthe short term from the Uruguay Round agreements.\nStructurally weak and vulnerable developing countries\nrequire favourable arrangements and equitable terms and\nconditions to enable them to make the necessary\nadjustments to participate successfully in world trade.\nFree trade must never be viewed as an end in itself;\nit must be a vehicle for development. It is for this reason\nthat the World Trade Organization recognizes the need for\nspecial and differential treatment for developing countries\nand waivers for special trading regimes. This must be\nrespected in both letter and spirit.\nWe are of the firm view that no action should be\ntaken to erode our vital interests or remove equitable and\nlong-standing arrangements that affect the very economic\nsurvival of some developing countries. In this context, I\nrefer to the current action by a coalition of powerful\nspecial interests with respect to the special terms enjoyed\nby a number of developing countries through their\narrangements with the European Union. It has been made\nabundantly clear that the removal of preferences would\n17\n\n\nhave a serious negative impact on the economies of\nJamaica and other Caribbean countries.\nMy delegation therefore calls upon those who would\nseek to use the World Trade Organization as an instrument\nto attack the very foundation of the economies of small\ndeveloping States to desist from this course of action. The\nthoughtless assault upon the Lom\u00e9 Banana Protocol is of\ngreat concern to my country and to sister Caribbean banana\nproducers, which stand to suffer economic devastation if the\nselfish acts of these powerful interests are allowed to\nsucceed.\nThe trend towards globalization is irreversible, but not\nall of us are capable of making the adjustments necessary\nin the short term to cope with its consequences. The United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\nhas an important role to play in assisting developing\ncountries to meet the challenges brought about by\nglobalization and liberalization and to facilitate their\nintegration in the world trading system. In this regard, we\nwelcome the renewed vigour of this body, as exemplified\nat the ninth session of UNCTAD, where Governments\nreaffirmed the relevance of UNCTAD\u2019s mandate as the\nfocal point for dealing with trade and related development\nissues.\nIt is necessary to examine and assess the United\nNations system and its capacity to respond to political and\nhumanitarian emergencies. The United Nations must begin\nto link peace-keeping and peacemaking in a more coherent\nand consistent manner. We note the work in this regard\ntaking place in the Assembly\u2019s Informal Open-ended\nWorking Group on an Agenda for Peace. We recognize the\nneed for a rapidly deployable unit and support the efforts to\nput this in place.\nAn important step was taken in the field of\ndisarmament recently with the adoption of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). Jamaica\nregards the CTBT as an incremental step and looks forward\nto the next stage, which is the adoption of a programme to\nachieve the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament.\nThose States with nuclear capabilities have a responsibility\nto carry out their obligations in good faith not only in\nregard to nuclear testing, but also with respect to non-\nproliferation.\nThe problem of drug abuse and illicit traffic in\nnarcotics continues to pose a serious threat to society. The\nextent of drug abuse and drug trafficking shows that it\ntranscends national and geographic boundaries. National\ncommitment and international cooperation are therefore\nrequired to address this problem. It is against this\nbackground that Jamaica strongly supports the convening\nof a special session of the General Assembly in 1998 to\naddress the illicit trafficking in and use of drugs. At the\nsame time, we must recognize the impact of related\ncriminal activity, which is spawned by the illicit drug\ntrade. Of particular concern is the nexus between drug\ntrafficking and trafficking in arms and high-powered\nweapons. We urge those States that are producers of these\narms to be more vigilant in enforcing control over their\ndistribution and illegal export.\nSince we met last year, significant developments\nhave occurred with regard to the implementation of the\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. With the completion\nof elections to the various institutions of the authority, the\nInternational Seabed Authority is now operational. We\ncongratulate Secretary-General Mr. Satya Nandan on his\nelection and express our confidence that his leadership\nand guidance will enable the Authority to discharge its\nmandate. It is vital that adequate resources be provided in\norder to ensure that the Authority becomes firmly\nestablished.\nWe also take this opportunity to welcome the\nhistoric election on 1 August of the members of the\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. We look\nforward to the inauguration of the Tribunal in its host city\nof Hamburg later this month. This will be another\nlandmark in the process of the implementation of the\nConvention on the Law of the Sea.\nWe should note the tremendous achievements of the\nUnited Nations in the progressive development of\ninternational law. A significant number of instruments\nhave been concluded that provide the legal underpinnings\nof the multilateral system. It is a dynamic process which\nis helping to bring more order to international relations.\nThe creation of an international criminal court is among\nthe latest initiatives on which substantive work has been\ndone. Jamaican experts have participated actively in the\nprogressive development of international law. We are\nready to contribute further to the machinery of the\ninternational legal system.\nTo respond to a multitude of challenges, the United\nNations needs to be renewed and revitalized. There is a\nstrongly shared perception that we must proceed\nexpeditiously with the task of bringing about the much-\nneeded reform of the United Nations system in the\ncollective interest. The initiative to restructure and\n18\n\n\nimprove performance, productivity and the cost-\neffectiveness of the United Nations system is an important\none. The adoption of resolution 50/227 \u2014 which contains\nfurther measures for the restructuring and revitalization of\nthe United Nations system in the economic, social and\nrelated fields \u2014 is evidence of the efforts to improve the\noperational aspects of the work of the system. Jamaica is\ncommitted to working with other Member States throughout\nthis session of the General Assembly to continue the\nprocess of strengthening the Organization.\nThe persistence of disputes and conflicts suggests the\nneed for strengthening the United Nations machinery for\ndealing with these problems. The Security Council, which\nunder the Charter of the United Nations holds the mandate\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security, has\nan important and strategic role to play in the process. As\nwe all know, aspects of its composition and role are\ncurrently under review. Certainly, it is acknowledged that\nwe should be moving in the direction of greater\ndemocratization and increased participation by Member\nStates in critical decisions affecting the international\ncommunity. The expansion of the membership of the\nUnited Nations and the significant changes in the political\nand economic conditions in Member States must surely be\nimportant factors in determining changes in the composition\nof the Council and the status of its members.\nJamaica is not committed to any rigid formula for\nchange, but whatever formula is arrived at should satisfy\nthe need for democratic participation consistent with the\nsovereign equality of States and with the equitable\ndistribution of seats. The need for reform should be\nmatched by increased political will to use the machinery of\nthe United Nations for the peaceful settlement of disputes\nand to cooperate with conciliation efforts under the auspices\nof the Secretary-General.\nReform must not be for its own sake. The purpose of\nreform must be to strengthen the capacity to deliver\nresponsive and responsible leadership on questions of peace\nand security, socio-economic development, human rights\nand environmental protection.\nWe understand and support the need for reform of the\nadministrative and management process in the system, but\nwhat we cannot accept are unilateral actions to force reform\nby withholding assessed contributions to the United\nNations. This has brought the Organization to the brink of\ninsolvency and is hampering the very efforts being made\nfor reform and restructuring. More critical are the serious\nconsequences for the development programmes of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe current crisis will not be resolved until Member\nStates pay their arrears and assessed contributions\npromptly and without conditions. At the same time, we\nrecognize the need to examine carefully the existing\nformula for contributions. The establishment of any new\nformula must be based on the principles of equity and the\ncapacity of Member States to pay.\nThe agenda of issues before us at this session shows\nthat there is a great deal to be done. In many areas, we\nhave made progress, even if it has been slow. It is\nessential that we continue to make the effort, through\ndiscussion, debate and negotiation, to find solutions that\nremove from our world the threats of war and conflict\nand the pain of poverty and misery. Through our joint\nefforts we can make progress, reach compromises and\narrive at solutions that will make our world safer and give\neach and every one of us a greater stake in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"

We are convinced that his personal qualities,\nexperience and great skill are our best guarantee for the\nsuccess of this session and will enable us to achieve\npositive results.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express\nour gratitude and esteem to Mr. Freitas do Amaral,\nPresident of the fiftieth session, who so ably guided the\nwork of the Assembly last year.\nI should also like once again to extend our entire\nconfidence to our brother, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and\nto express to him our thanks for the great efforts he has\ntirelessly expended since shouldering his heavy\nresponsibilities in strengthening the universality and\ncredibility of the United Nations and enhancing its\ncapacity to play its rightful role, notwithstanding\nparticularly difficult international circumstances.\nIt is gratifying to note that, as the Organization\nenters into its second 50 years of life, substantial progress\nis being made on the road to peace throughout the world.\nThus, East-West confrontation, more commonly\nknown as the cold war, has ended and the spectre of the\nbalance of terror has disappeared, giving way to dialogue\nand cooperation in the establishment and maintenance of\nworld peace and security. Other important steps have also\nbeen taken towards decolonization, the eradication of\nracial discrimination and the full exercise by peoples of\ntheir right to self-determination.\nWe must, however, note that these achievements,\nvaluable as they are, have not contributed significantly to\nimproving the situation in many parts of the world where,\nin some countries, there are still hotbeds of tension and\nbloody wars. Nor have they sufficed to eliminate the\npoverty and underdevelopment that are still the daily lot\nof a large proportion of the inhabitants of our planet.\nThus, developing countries continue to suffer the\ncombined effects of the world economic crisis and the\nongoing deterioration of terms of trade and to bear the\nburden of an external debt that exhausts their resources at\nthe very time that official development assistance is\nconstantly decreasing.\nThe past year has seen no important improvement in\nthe world economic situation. That conclusion is\nunavoidable, since the current economic crisis has as its\nbasis the inequity inherent in the world economy, an\ninequity whose major consequences are macroeconomic\nimbalance, unfair terms of trade and inequality in the\ndistribution of wealth.\nIn this framework, the African continent is obviously\nthe hardest hit by the negative effects of the deterioration\nin economic conditions owing to the burden of its\nexternal debt and the fall in the prices of the raw\n12\n\n\nmaterials that make up the principal source of income for\nmost African countries.\nThe Sahel region is among those on our continent that\nis suffering the most from this situation, especially given\nthe chronic drought from which it has suffered for over\nthree decades and that has weakened and sometimes\ndestroyed the economies of its component countries.\nHowever, we are gratified by the increased interest\nshown in recent years with regard to African development\nand we welcome the System-wide Special Initiative for\nAfrica launched by the Secretary-General, which we would\nlike to see implemented as soon as possible.\nThe consolidation of democracy and the construction\nof a State based on the rule of law and respect for human\nrights are positive results of the activities of the\ninternational community, as reflected in the resolutions of\nthe United Nations and its specialized agencies as well as\nin the decisions and recommendations handed down by\nseveral conferences organized under United Nations\nauspices or with its support. This confirms the importance\nof the collective effort of the United Nations and should\nencourage the Organization to continue its pursuit of the\nnoble objectives of mankind.\nIn that connection, and in order to enable the United\nNations to strengthen such action, it is particularly urgent\nand essential to work on the restructuring of its organs, the\nrationalization of its working methods and the improvement\nin its performance.\nTo that end, my country supports the proposals\ndesigned to give renewed dynamism to the Economic and\nSocial Council, to end duplication in its subsidiary bodies\nand to improve its rules of operation. We also support\nproposals aimed at enlarging representation in the Security\nCouncil in keeping with the requirements of democracy,\ntransparency and equity.\nWe also believe that the principle of equality among\nMember States should be the basis for any action\nundertaken to restructure the Security Council, which,\naccording to Article 24 of the United Nations Charter, acts\non behalf of all Member States. This means that the\nCouncil has an obligation to reflect the universal character\nof the United Nations.\nAllow me to say a word about the democratic process\nin Mauritania, the first phase of which began 10 years ago\nin 1986 with the first local elections and was followed by\nthe adoption of the 1991 Constitution. Pluralistic, multi-\nparty presidential and parliamentary elections followed in\n1992 and the second round of local elections in 1994.\nThis process is being strengthened once again by the\nholding on 11 October of the second round of legislative\nelections in a free and transparent climate. Two hundred\nand sixty-nine candidates, most from 13 political parties,\nwill appeal to the voters for the 79 seats of the National\nAssembly. All provisions have been made to ensure that\nthis election takes place under the best conditions.\nWith this new achievement, the Mauritanian people\nwill confirm that it has become, as stated by His\nExcellency President Maaouya Ould Sid\u2019Ahmed Taya,\n\u201cthe source of sovereignty and legality\u201d and the master of\nits own destiny and affairs.\nHaving won the struggle for democracy and\nachieved the institution of the rule of law and the\nguarantee of all individual and collective rights,\nMauritania is engaged in another, equally determined\nstruggle against economic and social underdevelopment.\nIn this regard, many economic reform programmes have\nbeen implemented since 1985 within the framework of a\nliberal policy incorporating all development dimensions\nand designed to raise the living standards of citizens and\nmaking basic services available to them.\nThese reforms have allowed us to reinvigorate public\nfinances, overcome inflation and restore continued\ngrowth. Many projects have also been carried out in the\nareas of communications, transportation infrastructure,\nvillage electrification, expanded water-supply networks\nand increased health-care coverage. Let me express our\nappreciation to all of the brotherly and friendly countries,\ninstitutions and non-governmental organizations that have\nsupported my country\u2019s efforts towards these goals and\nthank them for the aid they have provided and continue\nto provide.\nStrengthening democracy and economic and social\ndevelopment requires the consolidation of peace and\nsecurity both for States and individuals. We must\ntherefore note the striking paradox, despite the end of the\ncold war and new hopes for peace and justice, of the\nre-emergence of terrorism, instability and the proliferation\nof hotbeds of tension around the world.\nThe Middle East is one region where, unfortunately,\nthis paradox is most alarming. My country, renewing its\nfull support for the peace process, remains convinced that\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and\n13\n\n\n425 (1978) and the principle of \u201cland for peace\u201d, adopted\nat the Madrid Conference, remain the bases for any\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace in that region.\nWe also believe that there can be no real solution to\nthe Middle East problem as long as Israel has not\nwithdrawn from all the occupied Palestinian territories,\nincluding the Holy Arab City of Al-Quds, the Golan and\nsouthern Lebanon.\nWe had therefore welcomed the new era that seemed\nto have emerged with the signing on 13 September 1993 of\nthe Declaration of Principles on the autonomy of Gaza and\nJericho and other positive advances that followed,\nespecially the 1994 Cairo agreement, the peace Agreement\nbetween Israel and Jordan, and the Taba Agreement on the\nimplementation of the second phase of the Declaration of\nPrinciples, signed in Washington on 28 September 1995.\nWe had hoped that the Palestinian people will soon see the\nend of its tragedy by recovering its legitimate right to self-\ndetermination and to establish its independent State on its\nterritory.\nOn this basis, and in order to ensure the continuation\nof the peace process, the concluded Agreements must be\nimplemented and commitments undertaken must be\nhonoured. Negotiations must resume among all the\nconcerned parties on the basis of the principles arrived at\nand accepted by all and in accordance with the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions. My country also insists on the\nneed to lift the embargo imposed on the brotherly\nPalestinian people, the devastating consequences of which\non the fledgling Palestinian economy and the repercussions\nof which on security in the Palestinian territories could\nendanger the peace process.\nFinally, we invite the two sponsors of the peace\nprocess to assume fully their responsibilities in order to\nallow the people of the region to recover their legitimate\nrights and to open a new chapter in the history of this\nsubregion, so that its potential can be put to the service of\neconomic development and social advancement.\nNearby, the aftermath of the Gulf War continues to\nraise obstacles to the normalization of the situation in that\nregion. In this regard, my country has always affirmed and\nwishes to reaffirm today its dedication to respect for\ninternational legality and the United Nations resolutions\npertaining to the Gulf War and its consequences. We\nreiterate our rejection of any threat to the independence of\nKuwait and its territorial integrity and we call for the\nsettlement of the question of Kuwaiti prisoners.\nWe also reaffirm our consistent position of rejecting\nany action threatening the unity of fraternal Iraq and the\nintegrity of its territory. We call for the lifting of the\nembargo imposed on the Iraqi people, which is subjecting\nthem to famine and disease. In this regard, my country\nwishes to see implemented, as soon as possible, Security\nCouncil resolution 986 (1995) on the issue of oil for food.\nWe also wish to express our rejection of the plan being\nentertained by some of Iraq\u2019s neighbours to create a safe\narea in northern Iraq, in contradiction to their declared\ndedication to territorial integrity and unity and in violation\nof the principles and rules of international law and the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nMy country believes that the United Arab Emirates\nhas the inalienable right to recover its full and complete\nsovereignty over the islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb\nand Lesser Tunb. We reiterate our support for the United\nArab Emirates in its endeavours to recover its rights by\nall available means.\nIn the Arab Maghreb, the question of Western\nSahara is a consistent source of great concern because of\nits threat to stability and security in the subregion. My\ncountry also believes that the United Nations, and the\nSecurity Council in particular, should, now more than\never, assume its full responsibility for the implementation\nof the settlement plan, in keeping with resolutions adopted\nto that end on the holding of a free and impartial\nreferendum that will make it possible to achieve a\ncomprehensive and definitive solution to the question of\nWestern Sahara and to ensure security and stability in the\nregion. For our part, we continue to be prepared to\ncontribute positively to the achievement of that aim.\nWith regard to the embargo that for several years\nhas affected the Libyan people, my country wishes to see\ngreater receptivity to Libya\u2019s obvious willingness to\ncooperate with the United Nations and other concerned\nparties, in seeking a solution to the crisis between it and\ncertain western countries. We call for the lifting of this\nembargo \u2014 which is hurting the Libyan people and all\nthe peoples of the Maghreb \u2014 and hope that the proposal\nof the League of Arab States, which enjoys broad support,\nwill open up new opportunities to put an end to it.\nWith regard to security and stability, Africa\ncontinues to face major problems. Conflicts are spreading\ndeath, famine and epidemic throughout the continent. In\nSomalia, the war continues to leave a train of death and\ndestruction and the international community, despite the\nsolidarity it has shown in the past through its\n14\n\n\ninvolvement, no longer evinces much interest in a situation\nthat is threatening the Somali people. We hope the Somali\npeople will overcome their differences and find a way to\nconduct a constructive dialogue.\nIn Liberia, we hope that the peace process will\ncontinue, in keeping with the Abuja Agreement, and we\nreiterate our support for the decisions taken by the\nministerial ad hoc Committee of the Economic Community\nof West African States (ECOWAS) at its seventh session\nand the decisions and recommendations of the last two\nsummits of the Organization of African Unity and\nECOWAS on Liberia, so that peace and harmony may\nreturn to that fraternal country.\nWe hope that our Rwandan and Burundian brothers\nwill, in their countries, resolve their conflicts and seek\ndialogue and understanding in solving their problems. We\nalso hope that they will be able to face the challenges of\ndevelopment and devote to it the energies now being\ndevoted to their differences.\nWith regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, my country\nexpresses satisfaction at the important advances made along\nthe road to peace, especially the recent democratic\nelections. We reaffirm also the need to continue\nimplementation of the Dayton Agreement and to see the\ninternational community exert the necessary effort for the\nreconstruction of that country, whose infrastructure has\nbeen destroyed and whose people have suffered the most\nhorrifying forms of aggression.\nThe United Nations must adapt to the world as it is\nand to the changes it undergoes. The Islamic Republic of\nMauritania wishes to reiterate its willingness and\ncommitment to work in concert with other Member States\ntowards the realization of the noble goals of our\nOrganization, in particular the consolidation of peace and\nsecurity in the world.\nAt a time when most third-world countries are facing\nenormous challenges that hamper their advance towards\ngreater progress and prosperity, and while our planet is\nfacing environmental challenges that threaten the future of\nall life on Earth, considerable resources are being devoted\nto the production, refinement and acquisition of weapons of\nmass destruction of all kinds, while official development\nassistance continues to decline.\nIn this respect we hope that the recent Treaty\nprohibiting nuclear tests will be one important step along\nthe way to complete and general disarmament, the only way\nto free up the necessary resources for the development of\nthe third world.\nToday, more than half a century after the creation of\nour Organization, we must be fully aware of our common\ndestiny. We must dedicate ourselves to promoting\nmutually advantageous international cooperation and\nbringing about effective solidarity equal to the challenges\nwe face to ensure a better future for all humankind.\nMy country, as in the past, will continue to work\ntowards the strengthening of friendly and brotherly\nrelations among all peoples and nations in the pursuit of\nthe noble ideals aspired to by the founding fathers of the\nUnited Nations.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nwould like first of all to express to Ambassador Razali my\ncordial congratulations on his election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly. I am firmly convinced that his qualities\nwill enable us to solve successfully the central questions of\nparticular relevance included in our agenda. Permit me as\nwell in these opening comments to extend my fraternal\ngratitude to Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal for\nhis rigorous and able leadership during the fiftieth session\nof the General Assembly. I would also like to express my\nrespect to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, whose efforts at the head of the Secretariat in this\nparticularly difficult moment Spain considers very positive\nand worthy of our support.\nThe Spanish delegation fully subscribes to the\nstatement made a few days ago by the Deputy Prime\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland on\nbehalf of the European Union, in which he set out the\ncommon goals and priorities of Europe for the present\nsession of the General Assembly.\nI would now like to refer in detail to various issues\nof particular interest to my country. First of all, however,\nI wish to reaffirm the strong commitment of Spain and its\nnew Government to the purposes and principles of the\nCharter of the United Nations. On 26 June 1945 at San\nFrancisco, at a time when mankind still had not recovered\nfrom the horrors of the Second World War, the\nrepresentatives of the peoples of the United Nations\nexpressed their firm resolve to save succeeding\ngenerations from the scourge of war. They also reaffirmed\ntheir faith in fundamental human rights; in the dignity and\nworth of the human person; and in the equal rights of\nmen and nations, both large and small.\nFifty-one years later, when the necessary conditions\nfor a new international order based on cooperation and\nsolidarity among nations have finally been met, the\ncommitments made in San Francisco take on renewed\nstanding. The United Nations, in fact, constitutes at\npresent the best instrument at mankind\u2019s disposal to face\nand solve \u2014 jointly, on the basis of dialogue and\nsolidarity among Member States \u2014 the global challenges\nconfronting mankind at the end of the millennium.\nWe must make sure that our political commitment to\nthe Organization is manifested in actions, not only by\nmaking available the necessary financial resources, but\nalso through the active search for consensus solutions for\nthe reform of the United Nations within the various\nworking groups of the General Assembly. Our\nOrganization, which was designed to respond to both\nglobal challenges and to the needs of its Member States,\nwill not be able to play its double role in the coming\ncentury unless it can count on a sound, solid and stable\nfinancial basis. Convinced of this need, Spain, the ninth-\nlargest contributor to the budget of the Organization, pays\npromptly and in full its assessed contributions.\nWhen we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations with the renewed commitment of all the\nMember States to the principles of the Charter, we all\nconcurred on the need to adapt the Organization to the\nnew international situation by enhancing its efficiency\nthrough an in-depth reform which will revitalize and\nstrengthen it. Obviously, carrying out this task means the\n9\n\n\ncontinuation and the deepening of the necessary\nrationalization and savings measures already undertaken by\nthe Secretariat. In this respect, the approval at the last\nsession of the General Assembly of the programme budget\nfor the biennium 1996-1997, has given Spain satisfaction.\nWe are aware today more than ever before, of the\ninterrelated nature of the problems confronting the\ninternational community and of impossibility for Member\nStates of solving them individually. This is why there is no\ndoubt that it is within the framework of the United Nations\nwhere we must bring together efforts in order to face in\nsolidarity the many crises which menace the world.\nThe international community certainly cannot remain\nimpassive before the magnitude of problems such as the\nones faced by the African continent. This year we have\nwitnessed terrifying massacres \u2014 such as those in\nLiberia \u2014 and the displacement of people in the Great\nLakes region, particularly in Burundi where we continue to\nwitness a terrible and tragic spectacle.\nAfrica is not, however, a continent entirely and\ninevitably abandoned to hopelessness. There are countries\nin which the tenacious efforts of their leaders and the\ncourage of their peoples allow them to embrace hope. The\nreturn to the rule of law, the establishment of solid\ndemocracies and respect for human rights are the way to\nestablish the foundations of a sustained and sustainable\ndevelopment which will ensure the welfare of all Africans.\nThe Government of Spain has followed with great\nattention the developments in the Middle East \u2014 focused\nin the peace process between Arabs and Israelis \u2014 in\nwhich the question of Palestine continues to be the central\npoint. We are following with great concern the serious\nevents that have taken place in recent days in Jerusalem,\nthe West Bank and Gaza, and we wish to reiterate our call\nto the parties involved to abstain from all acts of\nprovocation and violence that could lead to a new\nescalation of tension which could jeopardize the peace\nprocess.\nFurthermore, the Israeli elections held in May and the\nestablishment of the new Government became the basic\npoints of reference for the assessment of this complex issue\nand for the analysis of its future prospects. After a brief\nperiod of uncertainty, the Israeli Government has clearly\nstated its intention to honour fully the contents of the\nagreements concluded in Oslo and Washington in the spirit\nof the principles of Madrid.\nSuch a positive statement of intentions would have\nto be followed immediately by concrete and tangible\nprogress, which would strengthen the credibility of the\npeace process as the only valid alternative to attain\npeaceful coexistence in the region.\nThere are still many problems to be solved. On the\none hand, it is of course necessary to preserve and\nstrengthen the safety of civilians from the blind and\nruthless violence of terrorism; on the other, the closure of\nthe Palestinian territories, the delay in redeployment of\nthe Israeli Army in Hebron and the policy of settlements\nrepresent serious obstacles for progress in the peace\nprocess.\nOn the basis of the Florence Declaration issued by\nthe European Union, I avail myself of this opportunity\nfirmly to reiterate the commitment of Spain to the Middle\nEast peace process as the only way to solve this question.\nIn this respect, my Government will continue to work\nactively, at the national level and within the European\nUnion, to promote the cause of peace and understanding\namong the peoples of the region.\nOn a broader level, I wish to express my satisfaction\nat the initial achievements of the Euro-Mediterranean\ndialogue. The Spanish Government\u2019s priority objective is\nto contribute to the balanced and harmonious development\nof the three dimensions of this process: political,\neconomic and human. To this end, it will be necessary to\nmaintain and enhance the \u201cspirit of Barcelona\u201d shown by\nall countries participating in the Ministerial Conference\nthat my country had the honour of hosting last November.\nIn connection with the question of Western Sahara,\nI must express the concern of the Spanish Government at\nthe suspension of the voter-identification operation and\nthe blocking of the settlement plan. In this respect, I wish\nto recall before this Assembly Spain\u2019s principled position,\naccording to which the question of Western Sahara will\nbe solved permanently only through the exercise of the\nright of self-determination by the people of Western\nSahara in a free referendum with international guarantees.\nThe recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina have\nended a cycle in the process of implementation of the\nDayton Agreement that was marked by an inevitable\npredominance of military over civilian aspects. Peace has\nbecome a reality in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the\nabsence of confrontation is tangible evidence of the\nsuccess of the multinational military operation. However,\nalong with this success has been an absence of the\n10\n\n\nnecessary reconciliation between the parties and the\nrestoration of mutual confidence.\nSince the onset of the conflict, Spain has contributed\nto its solution with a substantial military presence in the\nUnited Nations Protection Force, subsequently renewed in\nthe multinational, Implementation Force. My Government\nintends to continue supporting stability and reconciliation in\nthe region as well as the United Nations efforts along those\nlines.\nThe consolidation of democratic Governments,\ngrowing respect for human rights and economic and social\nprogress are a tangible reality in and a stimulus for the\nfuture of Latin America, a continent to which Spain is\nlinked by solid historical ties of mutual friendship and\nconfidence. We are particularly gratified by the positive\ndevelopments in Central America, where the consolidated\nadvances of democracy and the increasing stability of peace\ndemonstrate that efforts to promote the rule of law, good\ngovernance and respect for human rights are finally having\ntangible effects on the lives of the people.\nI wish to underline, from this rostrum, Spain\u2019s\ncommitment to peacekeeping operations. My Government\nfirmly intends to continue contributing to these operations.\nI wish to pay my warmest and most sincere tribute to the\nmen and women involved in all these operations for their\naltruistic and selfless work in conditions of extreme\ndifficulty and high risk, which sometimes has meant\nsacrificing their lives in the interest of peace.\nThe United Nations peacekeeping operations have\nbecome a cornerstone of the activity of our Organization.\nI wish to highlight here the important momentum given by\nthe Secretary-General in his \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d to the\ndevelopment and deepening of new concepts of preventive\ndiplomacy, peacemaking and peacekeeping.\nThe role of the United Nations in the decolonization\nprocess, particularly in the definition of its general\nprinciples, to which Spain adheres unequivocally, has been\nfundamental. The current membership of this General\nAssembly clearly demonstrates that the process has been\none of the great achievements of our time.\nIn fact, the main phase of decolonization ended some\ntime ago. However, anachronistic colonial situations persist\nthat ought not to be forgotten. One of the priority objectives\nof the Spanish Government is the decolonization of\nGibraltar. Through its resolutions, this General Assembly\npointed the way to a decolonization process which, based\non the principle of territorial integrity, should be carried\nout through bilateral negotiations between the United\nKingdom, the Colony\u2019s administrative Power and Spain,\nthe State in whose territory the Colony is located. The\nSpanish Government will carry out with the greatest\nflexibility, but also the greatest firmness, the future\nbilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom on the\nbasis of the Brussels Declaration of November 1984, with\nthe clear aim of moving forward in the process to\nculminate in the restoration of Spain\u2019s full territorial\nintegrity, generously safeguarding the interests of the\nColony\u2019s population and convinced of the urgent need to\nbring an end to the anachronism of the existence of a\ncolony of one European Union member State in the\nterritory of another friendly and allied member State.\nSpain is pleased to have fulfilled its aspiration of\nbecoming a full member of the Conference on\nDisarmament. In this capacity, we will continue to\nsupport the enlargement of the Conference to include\nother candidates still hoping to join.\nWe are pleased that the General Assembly adopted\nby an overwhelming majority the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which I have had the\nhonour to sign on behalf of my country. Spain will\nparticipate in the network of seismological centres set up\nfor the international verification of compliance with the\nTreaty and will support the early start-up of the Treaty\norganization.\nUniversal adherence to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons continues to be a\npriority objective, along with the other initiatives in the\nfield of nuclear disarmament.\nSpain, one of the first signatories to ratify the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons\nand on Their Destruction, is also pleased that the figure\nof 65 ratifications necessary for its entry into force is\nabout to be reached. We trust that all the signatory States\nthat have yet to do so will deposit their instruments of\nratification as soon as possible.\nMy country is carrying out the necessary procedures\nto ratify the new Protocol IV on blinding laser weapons\nand we are making every effort to put an end to the tragic\neffects of anti-personnel mines.\nI referred at the beginning of my statement to the\nneed, which I know is shared, to proceed with the reform,\n\n\n\nrevitalization and strengthening of the United Nations. We\nmust make our Organization the centre for harmonizing\nefforts to promote respect for international law, world peace\nand equality for all, streamlining the mechanisms of the\nCharter and removing the political and logistical obstacles\nthat all too often hinder its work.\nAs part of the institutional reform, the process of\nexpanding and reforming the Security Council stands out.\nIt is well known that Spain supports a moderate increase in\nthe membership of the Council as the result of a considered\nnegotiating process and with the final aim of enhancing the\nlegitimacy of its actions.\nOn the other hand, \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d\nmust be a key element in this reform process and the\nculmination of the series of major conferences focusing on\nthe integral development of the individual that have been\nheld in recent years.\nIn the general context of this common task of\nreforming the United Nations, I should like in particular to\nrefer to the new measures, adopted by this Assembly in\nresolution 50/227, on restructuring and revitalization in the\neconomic, social and other fields. These measures reaffirm\nthe unequivocal will of all countries significantly to\nimprove the work of the Economic and Social Council as\nthe central mechanism for coordinating and supervising\nUnited Nations activities in the economic and social fields.\nAs an example of Spain\u2019s commitment to the\ndevelopment activities of the Organization, I should like to\nrecall that, in the past year, my country has concluded a\nhost of bilateral agreements with various bodies of the\nUnited Nations system for the funding of specific projects\nfor developing countries.\nThe Rio Summit was a milestone in the history of the\nfight against environmental deterioration and established the\nbasis for a concept of sustainable development that does not\ncompromise the welfare of future generations. However, the\nhealth of our planet is far from being as good as it ought to\nbe. We must take advantage of the forthcoming special\nsession of this Assembly to give new impetus to the joint\nefforts being made to protect the environment, the true\ncommon heritage of humankind.\nThe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action\nadopted at the World Conference on Human Rights defined\nthe promotion and protection of human rights as a priority\nobjective of the international community. Spain fully\nsubscribes to this principle. The promotion and protection\nof human rights are in themselves ineluctable necessities,\nand the survival of many, many human beings depends on\ntheir effective implementation. Sustainable development\nfor all is not feasible without institutions that help in the\nrealization of human rights.\nIn this regard, the High Commissioner for Human\nRights should have more resources at hand to continue his\nlaudable work on restructuring the Centre for Human\nRights. On the other hand, defending human rights is\nparticularly important where the weakest people, those\nmost needing protection and self-defence, are involved. In\nthis context, Spain believes that we should capitalize on\nthe stimulus of the World Congress on the Commercial\nSexual Exploitation of Children held recently in\nStockholm, to promote through this Organization the most\nrigorous and comprehensive protection of minors.\nIn the final phase of the League of Nations, an\nattempt was made, unfortunately without success, to\nimplement the trilogy of arbitration-security-disarmament.\nThe Government of Spain is convinced that the\nprohibition of the use and threat of use of force must be\naccompanied by a general provision in international law\nmaking recourse to jurisdictional channels mandatory for\nthe settlement of disputes. It was for this reason that, in\na unilateral declaration of 15 October 1990, our\nGovernment, the Government of Spain, recognized as\ncompulsory, ipso facto and without special agreement, the\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, as\nprovided for in the Statute of the Court.\nIt is true that the United Nations cannot solve all the\nproblems of humankind. But our Organization can look\nback with the certainty that its role, in the past and in the\npresent, has not been and is not insignificant and that, for\nmany regions of our planet, the present and the future\nwould be different, harsher and more forlorn without the\nUnited Nations.\nFor this reason, I could not conclude without\nreiterating the firmest and most rigorous commitment of\nSpain to the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAlmost two years have passed since the establishment of\nconstitutional order and the rule of law in Haiti. The spectre\nof an illegal government and the acts of violence it\nperpetrated has vanished. The Haitian people, with the\nsupport of the international community, have succeeded in\ndemonstrating in a country that the rule of law is more\nimportant than effectiveness where political shake-ups are\ncommon. Today, democracy and tolerance are part of the\nHaitian scene, breathing new life into the struggle to\npreserve freedom.\nHowever, for this success to be complete, it must lead\nthe way to security, knowledge, expertise and hope and to\nthe well-being of seven million Haitians, who are still\nwaiting for the realization of the dreams inspired by the\nreturn to democracy. Thus, the thorny question of socio-\neconomic recovery \u2014 the true prerequisite for the\nconsolidation of democratic gains \u2014 is more pressing than\never.\nThe United Nations has since 1991 been a focal\npoint for the Haitian people, because the Organization did\neverything in its power to give full force to the rule of\nlaw in my country. That is why I attach great importance\nto the outcome of the fifty-first session, which should\nconfirm the commitments we made last year, at the\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nOrganization, to peace, international security and\ndevelopment. I am certain, Mr. President, that your\nleadership, your experience and your personal qualities\nwill ensure the success of our work.\nI should like to take this opportunity to pay a well-\ndeserved tribute to His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do\nAmaral for the work that he accomplished as President of\nthe fiftieth session.\nI also wish to pay sincere tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose tireless efforts\nare breathing fresh life into the Organization. The\nGovernment of Haiti acknowledges his active role in\nresolving the Haitian crisis. His latest report on the\nsituation in our country reveals the perceptiveness of his\nanalysis and his profound understanding of Haitian\naffairs.\nSince the international community, through the\nUnited Nations, has invested in Haitian renewal, we have\na duty to report to the Assembly on the progress made by\nthe Haitian Government and the difficulties it is facing,\nand on its commitment to national development and to\ninternational peace and security.\n\n\nThe general elections held on 17 December 1995 led\nto the installation on 7 February 1996 of a new Government\nand to the renewal of Parliament. The new Government\nteam is striving to ensure respect for public freedoms and\nhuman rights, in spite of the various constraints it is facing.\nIt is encouraging free expression of opinion and the\nestablishment of organized bodies to improve the\nfunctioning of civil society.\nHowever, in its efforts to establish a democratic\nsociety and the rule of law, the Haitian Government must\nlabour under two constraints: the economic problems that\nworsened after the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and the shortcomings of the\njudicial system, which have given rise to frustration among\nthe population. Those factors have combined to create a\nstate of affairs favourable to those forces that are against\nchange, which have not yet abandoned their plans to\ndestabilize the Government.\nWith respect to the reform of the justice system, the\nGovernment is mindful of the urgent need to end the\nincompetence and corruption of most magistrates. To that\nend, on 3 October of this year it submitted to Parliament a\nbill outlining the substance of the reforms to be undertaken\nto correct the discredited justice system and make it more\ncredible and accessible.\nAn independent judiciary will be a crucial element in\nthe reform. The Government is taking every step to ensure\nthe elimination of any hindrance to judicial impartiality and\nintegrity. Similarly, it is doing its utmost to provide the\nsystem with the means it needs to function properly.\nFor some time now Haiti has been experiencing an\nacute economic crisis. National productivity is declining.\nInfrastructures are seriously dilapidated. Real gross\ndomestic product fell an average of 5.11 per cent from\n1991 to 1995. The country\u2019s balance of trade is in chronic\ndeficit, amounting to $440 million, or 22 per cent of gross\ndomestic product for fiscal year 1994-1995. Exports have\ndropped to less than $100 million.\nAt the macroeconomic level, the Government is\ncurrently pursuing an economic policy that takes into\naccount the need to curb inflation, balance the budget,\nreform financing, combat corruption, impose austerity on\npublic administration and ensure equilibrium among the\nmacroeconomic variables.\nThat programme, which is supported by the\ninternational financial institutions with which we have\nworked out clear-cut modalities for negotiation and\ncooperation, will enable us better to meet an economic\nand social future that will be more promising and that\nwill better favour the integration of the Haitian economy\ninto the world scene.\nA production-oriented policy should emphasize\nincreased agricultural and industrial output. However, we\nmust take into account that Haiti\u2019s agriculture is in crisis\nbecause it is unable to meet its two main goals: food\nsecurity and increased export earnings for the country.\nThus, the Government is striving to establish\ntechnological and social conditions that can relaunch\nnational agricultural production.\nIn the same spirit the Government is giving special\nattention to relaunching industrial production. A strategy\nhas been developed to restore a climate favourable to\nbusiness, which is a necessary condition for promoting\ninvestment, which is the driving force of industrial\ndevelopment. There can be no question that such an\nobjective can be achieved only through close cooperation\nbetween the country\u2019s various sectors. We believe, inter\nalia, that a dynamic private sector open to foreign\ninvestment is a necessity for economic growth.\nThe present Government recognizes that future\ndevelopment can be achieved only if we protect our\nnatural resources. Thus, it intends to take steps to curb\ndeforestation and soil degradation. Safeguarding our\nenvironment is one of our priorities.\nEqually aware of the role played by the tourist\nindustry in the world economy, the Government has\ndevised a set of directives covering the principal elements\nof national tourist policy. It is encouraging to note that\nactivities in that sector are beginning to pick up.\nOn the social level, the Haitian Government believes\nthat there is a vital need to combat poverty, illiteracy and\ndeficiencies in health care. The struggle against poverty\nentails a demonstration of strong political resolve to\ndistribute the country\u2019s scanty resources on a fairer basis\nand to take steps to combat unemployment and encourage\nprivate investment.\nThe persistence of a high rate of illiteracy is a major\nhandicap when it comes to improving economic results\nand raising social standards. Over the next four years the\nGovernment intends to achieve a significant increase in\nthe number of children attending school. Here, we should\nnote that particular attention is being put on improving\nhealth conditions in the country, and in that regard a\n2\n\n\nprogramme of action has been developed that will be\nimplemented by mobilizing all available resources and with\nthe support of certain bilateral and multilateral partners.\nThe task before us is enormous, but we are confident\nthat we can meet the challenge, thanks to the determination\nof the Haitian people and the continuing support of the\ninternational community, which has been unstinting in its\nefforts to help resolve problems that threaten international\npeace and security.\nOn the subject of international peace and security, the\ninternational community has once again this year been torn\nbetween fear and hope as it has confronted developments in\nsituations in various parts of the world. Long-standing\nconflicts have shown encouraging positive signs, while new\noutbreaks of violence have exacerbated world tensions.\nThus, the Haitian Government welcomes the positive\ndevelopments in the situation in the former Yugoslavia,\nmarked by the holding of general elections in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. It is truly heartening to see that the peace\nprocess has once and for all, we hope, replaced the spiral\nof warfare and hatred, with its concomitant systematic\nviolations of human rights.\nThe initiatives taken by the Organization, in particular\nthe creation of the United Nations Protection Force and the\nInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International\nHumanitarian Law, have greatly contributed to creating a\nclimate favourable to peace and ethnic reconciliation in that\ncountry.\nWith regard to the Middle East, my Government\nwishes to express its satisfaction at the resumption of\ndialogue there. It encourages the two parties to continue\ntheir efforts to achieve lasting peace in the region, in\nkeeping with the relevant United Nations resolutions.\nOn our own continent we welcome the prospects of\npeace that have appeared in Guatemala, after 35 years of\narmed conflict. The Haitian Government commends the\nUnited Nations on the leading role it has played in that\npeace process.\nOur Organization should not only intervene in regional\nand inter-State situations that pose a threat to international\npeace and security but also contribute to help eradicate such\ndangerous evils as international terrorism and illicit drug\ntrafficking or to assist in finding solutions to certain\nproblems that threaten mankind\u2019s survival, such as the\nnuclear-arms race. In that regard, my Government\nfollowed with interest the negotiations held within the\nframework of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament\nand decided to become a sponsor of the draft resolution\nsubmitted to the General Assembly, in the conviction that\nthe Treaty was already a step towards nuclear\ndisarmament. That is why, two weeks ago, on behalf of\nmy country\u2019s Government, I signed the text of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, whose adoption\nby 156 States Members of the Organization eloquently\nattests to the profound desire of all nations to build a\nsafer world for future generations.\nTerrorism and illicit drug trafficking also represent\ngrave threats to international peace and security.\nCoordinated action involving all members of the\ninternational community will be increasingly necessary in\norder to eradicate these scourges. As far as terrorism is\nconcerned, the Haitian Government has always vigorously\ncondemned indiscriminate acts of violence against\ninnocent individuals and believes that the international\nconventions adopted on this question provide a legal\nframework for the prosecution of the perpetrators of such\ncrimes. However, along with laws and criminal\npunishment, we must also try to find a solution to the\nproblems at their source.\nMindful of the gravity of the situation, the member\ncountries of the Organization of American States\nconvened a specialized conference on terrorism that met\nin Lima, Peru, from 23 to 26 April 1996. The Republic of\nHaiti signed the Declaration adopted on that occasion\nwith a view to preventing, combating and eliminating\nterrorism within the overall framework of the applicability\nof international law, respect for the sovereignty of States,\nthe principle of non-intervention and strict compliance by\nStates with their rights and duties. The Haitian\nGovernment also subscribes to the new actions\nrecommended by the Ministerial Conference held in Paris\non 30 July 1996.\nIn the area of international drug control, I would like\nto note that the Republic of Haiti is aware of the effort\nbeing made by the international community to tackle the\nphenomenon of drug abuse and drug trafficking. It is\nincreasingly necessary for us to define, by means of\nappropriate conventions, an integrated framework for the\nrelentless struggle that we need to wage against drugs in\nall phases: production, consumption, abuse, money-\nlaundering and money-recycling, extradition and\ninternational prosecution of traffickers and confiscation of\ngoods.\n3\n\n\nLast year the commemoration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Organization allowed us not only to take\nstock of its record and of the activities it has undertaken\nbut also to reopen the question of the reform of the United\nNations necessary to tackle the challenges of the\napproaching twenty-first century.\nAs far as the expansion of the Security Council is\nconcerned, the Haitian Government would like a consensus\nto be reached on a new configuration of that important\nbody that would favour active participation for all States in\nthe activities of maintaining international peace and\nsecurity.\nAt the same time, we need to find ways and means to\nrevitalize the Economic and Social Council. While\nrecognizing the positive actions of the Economic and Social\nCouncil in various aspects of development over half a\ncentury, the Haitian Government believes that it is possible\nto improve its operation in order to make it a more\neffective instrument to promote sustainable development.\nWe stand at a turning point in history where we are\nfaced with grave dangers as well as many signs of hope. In\nHaiti we are striving to restore hope to our people in order\nto make a complete break with a past of suffering and\ndeprivation. It is also the responsibility of all States to\nmake the reform of our Organization a reality so that it can\nusher in a better world for future generations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me congratulate\nAmbassador Razali on his election to the office of President\nof the fifty-first session of the General Assembly and wish\nhim all the best in that challenging post. I would also like\nto thank the outgoing President, Mr. Diogo Freitas do\nAmaral, for the outstanding manner in which he conducted\nthe work of the previous session.\nA year ago, many world leaders gathered here to\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\nand, in particular, to discuss its future prospects. No one\nquestioned its importance as a worldwide forum for dealing\nwith important global problems. Based on the principle of\nuniversality, it should be open to all those who are willing\nand ready to participate in this endeavour.\nBut as it enters the second half-century of its\nexistence, the United Nations faces increasing, ever more\ncomplex and often even conflicting demands. Its response\nhas often been to try to do everything, eventually watering\ndown its energies and drive, thus contributing to a\nperception of declining efficiency. It should in fact focus\nonly on what it does best: maintaining international peace\nand security, promoting respect for human rights, providing\ndevelopment assistance and alleviating human suffering.\nWe therefore believe that a critical stage in its reform\nshould consist of setting out clear-cut priorities for United\nNations action. There are areas where the United Nations\nholds a competitive advantage, where it can act more\nefficiently than individual States or regional organizations,\nand where it has proven its ability to achieve more cost-\neffective and rapid results than other entities.\nReform is no longer a subject for discussion. Action\nis needed. Significant steps in the right direction have, of\ncourse, already been taken. We have noted with\nsatisfaction the gradual downsizing of the Secretariat in\nthe past several years and the adoption of a no-growth\nbudget for the current period. Similar efforts by\nspecialized agencies have furthermore included moves\ntowards their better coordination. We welcome the\nestablishment of an Efficiency Board within the\nSecretariat.\nThough reform is well under way, the current system\nis still hindered by overlapping mandates and duplication\nin the work of various United Nations bodies and\nspecialized agencies. Departments within secretariats\nsuffer from insufficient coordination and oversight\nmechanisms, unclear priorities and bureaucratic\nprocedures. Intense reflection on these matters is taking\nplace in various United Nations bodies. The Open-ended\nHigh-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the\nUnited Nations System has discussed rationalizing the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s methods and organization of its\nwork, streamlining its agenda and reshaping its subsidiary\nmachinery, as well as reforming the structures and\nfunctioning of the Secretariat. We hope that some of these\nideas will mature enough to be presented as formal\nrecommendations to the General Assembly.\nThe financial situation of the United Nations\ncontinues to be critical, in spite of a reduction in\npeacekeeping activities. In our view, there are two main\ncauses of this situation: the present method of assessing\ncontributions and arrears.\nOn the first point, we believe that a new scale of\nassessments should be developed that would equitably\nreflect the economic circumstances of individual Member\nStates and their capacity to pay, based primarily on gross\nnational product (GNP) indicators. On the second point,\nit is essential that Member States fulfil their financial\nobligations in full, on time and without conditions.\nCertain incentives and disincentives should be adopted to\nencourage Member States to honour their financial\ncommitments. These measures, however, should not be\napplied to Members unable to pay for reasons beyond\ntheir control.\nThe Czech Republic fully associates itself with the\nEuropean Union\u2019s package of financial proposals. I recall\nalso that our share of peacekeeping operations has not\nbeen determined yet. We take this issue very seriously\nand have made certain specific proposals to resolve it.\n17\n\n\nSecurity Council reform has attracted extremely wide\nattention. As I mentioned in 1995, we support an increase\nin both permanent and non-permanent seats while insisting\non safeguarding rapid and effective Council action. Yet the\nmore members it has, the more its effectiveness will be\nhindered. In our view, therefore, only a modest expansion\nis feasible. We oppose new categories of membership.\nThe criteria for new permanent members should\ninclude their level of commitment to maintaining peace, to\npromoting development and to meeting their financial\nobligations to the United Nations. We believe Germany and\nJapan are suitable candidates, and support an expanded\nrepresentation of Africa, Latin America and Asia.\nThe second aspect of Security Council reform relates\nto its working methods. Several proposals have been\nsubmitted, including the Czech one, on a broader\ninterpretation of Article 31 of the United Nations Charter.\nThe proposals submitted include a number of points\nacceptable to the overwhelming majority of Member States.\nWe regret that the Working Group on the Security Council\nhas not yet reached consensus on any of them. We believe\nthat issues not requiring amendments to the Charter should\nbe resolved separately from those that would. We will\npursue our efforts in this respect and strive for some\nagreement next year.\nHaving been elected to the Economic and Social\nCouncil and having assumed the post of its Vice-President,\nwe have taken on a fair share of responsibility for its work.\nWe strongly support reform efforts to restructure the\nCouncil and to enhance its efficiency and its coordinating\nrole. It should more adequately reflect the new world\neconomic and social situation. We believe that the\nCouncil\u2019s position within the United Nations system should\nbe strengthened and its procedures streamlined. It should\nprovide policy guidance for development activities and\nbecome the supreme steering and coordinating body for all\nUnited Nations-based programmes that fall under its\npurview.\nRestructuring its functional commissions is a key\naspect of its reform. Regional economic commissions\nshould play a more visible role. Upgrading development\ncooperation with Bretton Woods institutions and the World\nTrade Organization is another challenge for the Economic\nand Social Council. To reduce duplication with the General\nAssembly, the Council should pass on to the Assembly only\nthose issues that it does not have the power to decide by\nitself. On the other hand, the General Assembly should\nstrike from its agenda those items that are fully within the\nCouncil\u2019s authority.\nAlthough the Czech Republic\u2019s two-year term on the\nSecurity Council expired at the end of 1995, we continue\nto pay attention to the conflicts and other events that\nendanger world peace and security.\nThe Dayton peace process gave a chance to the\npeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to the other\ncountries involved. The September 1996 elections\nconstituted a milestone on the road to a lasting peace in\nthe Balkans. The Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe performed its election task in an\noutstanding manner. We applaud all those who\nparticipated in those elections.\nOn the other hand, we cannot ignore the fact that the\nelection results reconfirmed ethnic divisions in the\ncountry. It will not be easy for the parties to overcome\nthis problem. The international community should\ntherefore remain alert and continue in its peaceful\nengagement by committing the necessary troops and by\nexerting political pressure on all the parties to keep up the\nmomentum of the Dayton peace process. Local elections,\nto be held in November, are the next step in this process.\nIt is important that all planned political institutions be\nformed and start functioning as soon as possible.\nAnother area of deep interest to us is the Middle\nEast. As a participant in the multilateral talks on peace\nand economic cooperation in the Middle East and as one\nof the donor States in the area, we have consistently\nvoiced our full support for the continuation of the peace\nprocess based on a just and comprehensive solution of the\nissues. We do so again today with renewed urgency in\nview of the recent tragic events in Jerusalem.\nSecurity and stability in the Gulf region are\nimportant to the Czech Republic. We support all efforts\nto solve the tense situation concerning Iraq. Iraq must\ncomply unconditionally with all relevant Security Council\nresolutions in order for sanctions to be lifted and for Iraq\nto return to the international community. At the same\ntime, the territorial integrity of Iraq must be preserved.\nWe look forward to a peaceful resolution of the Iraqi\nissue. For humanitarian reasons we hope that Security\nCouncil resolution 986 (1995) is implemented as soon as\nconditions permit.\nDespite geographical distance, we are deeply\nconcerned by conflicts in African countries, such as\n18\n\n\nAngola, Somalia, Liberia, Rwanda and Burundi. My\ncountry supports United Nations efforts to rid these\ncountries of war and suffering, which, besides engendering\nviolence, further widen the gap between developed\ncountries and these often desperately poor countries.\nThe Czech Republic intends to contribute to\ninternational stability and economic development.\nDomestically, we laid the foundations for this policy by\nstrengthening our democratic institutions and by reforming\nour economy. Internationally, this effort was endorsed last\nDecember when the Czech Republic was admitted to the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(OECD). For my Government, OECD membership amounts\nalso to a serious commitment to share the knowledge and\nexperience of the Czech people with other countries and to\nprovide development assistance.\nSolid domestic results are also a precondition for\nmembership in the European Union and in the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). These regional\narrangements are vital for Europe\u2019s security structure.\nThrough membership in NATO, the Czech Republic intends\nto contribute to Europe\u2019s security and stability. The\ndecision on our membership will be made by NATO\nmembers and by our country. Russia\u2019s participation in\ndiscussions on European security is, of course, critical, and\nwe understand the need for a strategic partnership between\nNATO and the Russian Federation. These discussions,\nhowever, should not precondition the process of NATO\nenlargement.\nPeacekeeping is an important tool in the hands of the\nSecurity Council. However, it has its limits, in so far as\nhostilities often occur within States. These limits are\ndictated by the principles of impartiality, the non-use of\nforce \u2014 except in self-defence \u2014 and consent of the\nparties. Following United Nations experiences in Somalia,\nBosnia and Herzegovina and, most recently, in Liberia,\nunwarranted enthusiasm concerning peacekeepers has\nevaporated.\nThe Czech Republic has been actively participating in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping. We support the establishment\nof stand-by arrangements and intend to participate in the\nsystem aimed at expanding United Nations capacities to\ndeploy its forces. My country\u2019s participation in the\nImplementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nis our current major effort devoted to peace. The United\nNations does not have peace-enforcement instruments of its\nown, but regional arrangements are often useful in\nenforcing peace. Our IFOR experience only confirms this.\nLast year we signed the Convention on the Safety of\nUnited Nations and Associated Personnel, and we\nanticipate its early ratification. We hope that it will enter\ninto force soon.\nThe fifth Review Conference of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) reconfirmed\nthe elimination of nuclear weapons as its ultimate goal.\nConcluding the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nrepresents a significant step in this direction, and we\nintend to sign the Treaty very shortly. It is disturbing\nhowever, that the Conference on Disarmament did not\nreach consensus on this question and that the Treaty was\nnot adopted unanimously. Every effort should be made to\nachieve universality of NPT membership. Perhaps the\nmost important task is the implementation of Article VI\nof the Treaty. The role of the Conference on\nDisarmament in this process is irreplaceable and will take\non even more importance, as the Conference is expected\nto deal with another growing problem that we want to\nhelp resolve \u2014 the elimination of anti-personnel\nlandmines.\nMatters of security have long ceased to be only\nmatters of armies and weapons. The devastating social\ndamage done by drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking\nthreaten the entire international community. Close\ninternational cooperation in tackling the drug menace\nshould be our response to this dangerous challenge.\nInternational terrorism is another source of great\nconcern. The international community must stand united\nto suppress it. It is the responsibility of each State to fight\nterrorism and to strictly apply and abide by all\ninternational instruments in this field. We appeal to States\nthat have not ratified the appropriate conventions to do so\nwithout delay and to implement them.\nThe Czech Government attaches great importance to\nthe promotion of human rights and in particular to United\nNations activities in this field. An environment that\nupholds human rights is our best protection as individuals\nand as a society. We defend human rights because it is in\nour own best interest. This year the Czech Republic has\nbeen elected to the United Nations Commission on\nHuman Rights. As a member of the Commission, we\nintend to contribute actively to its work and to meet the\nobjectives of the international community in this field.\nPresident Havel is one of the 16 Heads of State or\nGovernment who have recently issued a statement on\nreviving multilateralism. The statement voices deep\n19\n\n\nconcern over the lack of progress, both in pace and in\nscope, of multilateral renewal. Nations must either move\nforward to reform and strengthen the United Nations\nsystem, or we risk facing a weakened solidarity, more\nunilateralism and perhaps conflict and overt disregard of\ninternational law and human values. Multilateral diplomacy\ngoes well beyond the United Nations itself. Regional\ncooperation is crucial to strengthening global cooperation.\nWithout a stronger United Nations, however, other forms of\ninternational cooperation will lose coherence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am happy to join other\nspeakers in warmly congratulating His Excellency Mr.\nRazali Ismail on his assumption of the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly. I also wish to express Canada\u2019s deep\nappreciation of the excellent manner in which Mr. Freitas\ndo Amaral managed the deliberations of the fiftieth\nsession of the Assembly.\nForty years ago, in the depths of the cold war, the\nGeneral Assembly authorized the setting up of a\npeacekeeping force in Suez. Thus emerged an important\ntool for the international community, one that has since\nserved the cause of peace in many different forms around\nthe world.\n(spoke in French)\nCanadians take special pride in peacekeeping\nbecause the concept was developed in part by their\nForeign Minister, Lester B. Pearson, who received the\nNobel Peace Prize for his efforts.\nAs we reflect on the fortieth anniversary of United\nNations peacekeeping, there are certain conclusions to be\ndrawn. The United Nations has played a crucial role\nthroughout the world by dint of its peacekeeping role.\nInnovation is both necessary and possible within the\nUnited Nations, and in our time, different as it may be,\nthe spirit of internationalism, of commitment to\ncooperation, calls to us once again.\n(spoke in English)\nIn a new and changing global environment\ninternationalism is ever more important for all nations,\nlarge or small, weak or powerful. Changing times have\nset for us a new broad agenda, which includes focusing\non the security needs of individuals \u2014 in other words, on\nsustainable human security. Unfortunately, the new times\nhave not sufficiently been reflected by a rededication to\nthe United Nations as an expression of the spirit of\ninternationalism. There remains too often a tendency to\nact according to old power configurations rather than to\nseek out collective approaches that address the roots of\nconflict and attempt to resolve them through common\naction.\n12\n\n\nThe need for recommitment to the United Nations is\nclear, and so too is the need for the renewal, restructuring\nand refocusing of the Organization and its various bodies\nand agencies. In implementing this agenda of United\nNations renewal we will no doubt encounter difficulties and\ndifferences of opinion. But this should not discourage us.\nWe need the courage to innovate on two fronts, grappling\nwith a new and complex world agenda and restructuring the\nUnited Nations to respond effectively to that agenda.\nThe basic mandate of the United Nations at its\nfounding was the prevention of international conflict. As\npeacekeeping has changed over time, one can see the\nevolution of a security agenda itself, from being a simple\nbuffer between States to an international responsibility for\nmaintaining order and an involvement in reconstruction.\nThe range of activities in recent times has been impressive,\nfrom Haiti to Cambodia, from the Golan Heights to El\nSalvador, from Bosnia to the peace accords now being\nsigned in Guatemala.\nThat range demonstrates that the international response\nto threats to security has gone well beyond the initial\ndefinition, which was limited to dealing with cross-border\naggression. Rather, in a continuum of threats, there is an\nincreasing focus on conflicts that take place within borders\nbut that have severe ripple effects throughout the entire\ninternational system. These types of conflict are still, in\npeacekeeping terms, largely uncharted waters, and of course\nthere are differences of view on how best to respond.\nWhat is clear is the need for a new tool kit for the\nUnited Nations to respond to a variety of different\nsituations. In this context I am glad to note that most of the\nrecommendations made in the rapid-reaction study\nsubmitted by Canada last year are now being implemented.\nCanada will continue to support United Nations efforts to\nestablish a headquarters that will enhance its ability to\nrespond rapidly and with flexibility. But that is only one\ntool. Many more are needed, especially in the area of\nprevention of disputes and in the arduous and complex task\nof peace-building.\nThe failure of conflict prevention in Rwanda, as\noutlined in the Rwanda evaluation report, has made\nabundantly clear the need to enlarge the concept of peace-\nbuilding to embrace prevention as well as peacemaking and\nreconstruction. Preventive action will require much greater\ncommitment from United Nations Members to intervene\nearly.\nIn Canada, we are currently focusing our approach\nto these issues. We have started reworking our own\ninternational tool kit to improve our ability to initiate and\nsupport peace-building operations in areas such as\nmediation, dialogue, human-rights monitoring, judicial\nreform, police training and demobilization of military\nforces. We look forward to cooperating with other nations\nthat are also exploring similar innovative approaches.\nThe search for new tools and the means to utilize\nthem collectively cannot, however, be a substitute for the\nreinforcement of existing mechanisms to build peace. We\nare about to take a historic step forward on the nuclear-\ndisarmament agenda. Today, the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty was opened for signature. That Treaty is\nthe result of decades of hope and effort by people around\nthe world. This morning I signed the Treaty on behalf of\nCanada. We call upon all States Members of the United\nNations to do the same.\nThe children of tomorrow should, we hope, never\nhave to know what a nuclear test is. If we can succeed in\nthis goal, and if we can vigorously pursue the goal of\nsystematically and progressively reducing nuclear\nweapons, with the ultimate goal of their elimination, we\ncan ensure that those children know less and less about\nthe most terrible scourge to face humanity.\nIf the world can focus its energies on ending the\ntesting of sophisticated and expensive nuclear weapons,\nwe believe that there is real hope for setting ourselves the\ngoal of ending the use of the most simple, cheap and, on\na daily basis, most destructive weapon in use today, the\nanti-personnel landmine.\nWe have all witnessed the suffering, death and\nhorrifying mutilation caused by mines. Canada, along\nwith many other countries and organizations, is engaged\nin mine-clearance operations. But the simple fact is that\nanti-personnel mines are being laid far faster then we can\npull them out of the ground. This is not just a\ndisarmament issue. It strikes at the very heart of\ndevelopment, and the thousands upon thousands of\nvictims affected every year pose a stark challenge to\nhumanitarian and peacekeeping efforts.\nCanada will host an international strategy session\nthis autumn, bringing together like-minded Governments,\ninternational agencies and non-governmental groups to\nprovide impetus and direction to international efforts\ntowards a global ban on anti-personnel mines. I hope this\nwill help to catalyse efforts to build a consensus on a\n13\n\n\nstrong, forward-looking resolution for this fifty-first session.\nAs such, it can provide further impetus to multilateral\nnegotiations on a full global ban.\nA third milestone in this area is the Chemical\nWeapons Convention, the first international treaty that aims\nto introduce a complete, global ban on an entire category of\nweapons of mass destruction. It is of the greatest\nimportance that it be brought into force as soon as possible.\n(spoke in French)\nDuring the cold war, we re-examined and redefined\nthe dimensions of international security to embrace the\nconcept of sustainable human security. The rule of law and\ngood governance are as important to maintaining global\npeace as disarmament measures. We are also coming to\nrealize that real security cannot be guaranteed by the State\nalone, but must involve civil society as well.\n(spoke in English)\nThese realizations stemmed in part from a growing\nsense of insecurity at the newly emerging but deadly threats\nof what one writer has described as \u201cthe underside of\nglobalization\u201d, including environmental degradation, crime\nand terrorism, and a lack of equity between the peoples of\nthe Earth.\nThe recent series of United Nations conferences has\nserved both to define the concept of sustainable human\nsecurity and to bring home the growing challenges to the\nsecurity of the individual. The road map is clear; we do not\nneed to study it any further. Now is the time to move\nforward in a concerted, comprehensive way.\nThere are already notable examples of what the United\nNations system has achieved, such as programmes to\nimprove children\u2019s health and strategies to combat such\nenvironmental threats as depletion of the ozone layer.\nBut as important as these advances are, there remain\nfar too many paper commitments instead of real progress\non the ground. Currently we are swamped by a plethora of\nagendas, blueprints and plans that run the risk of exhausting\nthe ability of donor nations to respond to or have a real\nimpact on those most in need. Too many bodies are\nestablished to implement these plans, creating jurisdictional\nconfusion and an overlap in implementation. We need to\nrecognize that in the realm of sustainable human security,\nGovernments are not alone. The groups and networks that\nhave emerged around the world representing women,\nindigenous peoples and children, along with business and\nfinance, are now major players, and we need a system of\ngovernance that recognizes this and brings them into\npartnership with Governments themselves.\nOne example of a new system is the Arctic Council,\nwhich was inaugurated in Ottawa last week. This\nmultilateral regional body brings together Arctic nations\nand indigenous groups to cooperate in the sustainable\ndevelopment and environmental protection of a unique\nand precious part of the globe. The Council represents a\nnew model of international organization, bringing together\npeople and States to share their energy and resources in\na common cause.\nThe upcoming World Food Summit organized by the\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n(FAO) provides another opportunity to combine\ngovernmental and non-governmental efforts. As a major\nagricultural producer, Canada looks forward to working\nwith other nations and with non-governmental\norganizations and representatives on solutions to the\nproblem of food security through approaches to\ntechnology transfer, financing and land reform.\nAs private trade and investment flows into\ndeveloping countries increasingly outweigh the\nsignificance of official development assistance, issues\nsuch as terms of trade and debt take on even greater\nsignificance. At the same time, new and complex issues\nare emerging which existing international structures are\nnot well placed to address.\nOne major emerging issue is the relationship\nbetween trade and labour standards. We are pleased to see\nthe International Labour Organization (ILO) focus on core\nlabour standards, including by working towards an\ninternational convention on the elimination of forced child\nlabour. There can be no clearer example of an issue\nwhere cooperation and dialogue with other international\nand regional organizations, particularly between the ILO\nand the World Trade Organization (WTO) and with non-\ngovernmental groups is required in order to produce\nsynergy rather than overlap.\nSustainable human security means providing for\nbasic needs not just in economic ways, but in political\nways as well. Recent conflicts have demonstrated by\nnegative example that respect for human rights and\n14\n\n\ndemocratic principles is fundamental to the prevention of\nconflict.\nLast year, Canada commissioned work on the human\nrights components of the United Nations field operations.\nI am pleased to announce today that we will immediately\nbegin compiling a roster of qualified Canadian human rights\nexperts available for rapid deployment as part of larger\npeace-building operations. We look forward to coordinating\nour efforts with those of Norway and others to ensure\ncoherent, focused support for such United Nations efforts.\nIn 1998 we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This will be an\noccasion not only to reaffirm our commitment to its\nprinciples, but also to consider further practical steps to\nimplement them. One step we will take is to promote, as\npart of the fiftieth anniversary, the preparations led by the\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, international\ndialogue on means to combat hate propaganda, which is so\noften the trigger of human tragedies such as genocide and\n\u201cethnic cleansing\u201d.\nThe establishment of international war-crimes\nTribunals in The Hague for the former Yugoslavia and for\nRwanda represents a critical element of necessary progress\nin the field of human rights. They signal our determination\nto hold accountable all individuals guilty of committing\natrocities, be they officials of the State or extra- or para-\nState actors. Above all, they signal our determination to\nbreak the cycle of hatred. It is for these reasons that Canada\nstrongly urges the prompt establishment of a permanent\ninternational criminal court as a new instrument in the fight\nagainst massive human rights violations.\nThere is one aspect of human rights that my\nGovernment and I have personally decided to make an\nutmost priority: the rights of children. Let me take this\nopportunity to thank the Swedish Government and\ncommend the organizers of last month\u2019s World Congress on\nthe Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. It is\nCanada\u2019s fervent hope that this Congress will lead to the\nimplementation of the most effective practical measures, as\nwell as to the adoption and ratification of legally binding\ninternational instruments to combat child slavery and the\ncommercial sexual exploitation of children. We should\nmove resolutely to conclude negotiation of the Draft\nOptional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child\nPornography.\nWe will work through our own development funds\nwith all countries interested in similar goals.\nThe concept of sustainable democracy requires,\nbeyond a commitment to respect for basic human rights,\nalso a commitment to democratic development. In the last\ndecade we have seen the United Nations involved in the\npromotion of democracy from Cambodia to South Africa\nto Haiti. Other multilateral organizations are also playing\nan important role, such as the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in the recent elections\nin Bosnia. Recent conflicts have demonstrated the\nimportance of stable democratic structures in promoting\nsustainable human security. They have also highlighted\nthe need to distinguish between legitimate aspirations and\ndangerous tendencies towards fragmentation. Attempts to\nstructure political participation around culturally or\nethnically \u201cpure\u201d mini-States must be resisted by the\ninternational community.\n(spoke in French)\nHaiti has been a critical test for the United Nations.\nThe promotion of democratization has been an integral\npart of security. Concerted international effort is needed\nto support democracy, not merely for the sake of one\nleader or one election, but as part of the ongoing process\nof laying the foundations of democratic institutions. We\nmust recognize this and must make the commitments\nneeded to ensure that the United Nations can work\neffectively for peace and stability in Haiti.\n(spoke in English)\nNigeria, Burundi and Burma are among the most\nrecent challenges to our collective ability to support\ndemocratic aspirations. Canada remains firmly committed\nto the restoration of democracy in these countries, and to\nworking in these countries and with our partners,\nbilaterally, multilaterally and within the Commonwealth\nand francophonie to this end.\nThe explosion of information technologies presents\ngreat dangers but also great opportunities for human\nsecurity. Extremist groups can spread their message of\nhate and intolerance more easily, and we have only to\nlook to Bosnia and Rwanda to see the tragic effects this\ncan have. Yet at the same time, these technologies have\nplaced powerful tools for the strengthening of civil\nsociety in the hands of millions of individual citizens and\ngroups.\n15\n\n\nThe development of information technologies raises\nmany other questions, including issues of access and of\ncountering abuses such as the transmission of child\npornography or terrorism. The Economic and Social\nCouncil has mandated a study of these issues. In Canada\nwe believe we have solid knowledge and expertise in these\narea in terms of technology and jurisprudence and we will\nmake major contributions to finding solutions.\nI have outlined some of the major issues that require\nconceptual innovation on the part of the United Nations.\nThe counterpart to conceptual innovation is innovation in\nrenewing existing United Nations structures and developing\nnew ones. We should not hesitate to eliminate those\nprogrammes or bodies that no longer serve any useful\npurpose, to reorient those whose mission so requires, and\nto consolidate and eliminate duplication. Nor should we\nhesitate to create new instruments, within existing\nresources, to deal with the challenge of the day. Reform is\nmore than just cost-cutting, though that aspect must not be\nignored.\nOur first priority is the ongoing financial crisis the\nUnited Nations faces. We have seen some encouraging\nprogress in the establishment and early results of the\nEfficiency Board.\nPerhaps more importantly, there is a growing\nawareness of the need for financial and administrative\nrestructuring. But much remains to be done. I cannot\nsimply content myself here with calling yet again for all\nMembers to pay their dues unconditionally \u2014 in full and\non time. I have to ask why it is that over half the Member\nStates are failing to meet this standard, and some are failing\nto pay at all. Pressures on government budgets is no\nexcuse; Canada has in recent years undertaken some of the\nmost severe expenditure cuts of any developed country. Yet\nwe have maintained our commitment to pay our dues in full\nand on time, because we believe that the United Nations\nresponds to key international priorities.\nPerhaps some Members are withholding dues as a\nform of blackmail, hoping to pressure the United Nations\ninto reforms through fiscal starvation. This is both wrong-\nheaded and short-sighted. An organization in crisis will not\nhave the energy required to tackle genuine reform. What is\nneeded here is political will, both in paying dues and in\nmoving forward in the difficult task of reviewing the scale\nof assessments to better reflect the ability to pay. Canada\nhopes that others will join us in demonstrating that will\nduring the current session of the Assembly.\nAnother priority is to strengthen the effectiveness of\nthe Security Council by giving it greater accountability,\nrepresentativeness, transparency and responsibility.\nCanada attaches particular importance to the need to\nensure meaningful participation in decision-making by\nthose Members whose nationals \u2014 military or civilian \u2014\nare in the crossfire of the conflicts that the Council is\ndebating.\nThe Council needs to address two issues: its role and\nits composition. On the former, if the Council is to come\nto terms with the more complex nature of international\npeace and security, it must be prepared to assume a\ngreater role in conflict prevention. This will require\ncooperation among the Security Council, the Secretary-\nGeneral and other Governments and non-governmental\nactors in identifying and addressing emergency crises.\nOn the latter issue, the Council can address\ncriticisms of it as a closed body whose membership does\nnot fully reflect changes in the world since 1945 by\nincreasing the number of seats. The distribution of those\nseats should take into account in the first instance the\ncontribution of Members to the broader purposes of the\nUnited Nations Charter, and also the need for equitable\ngeographic representation. Membership has its privileges,\nbut more importantly, it must bring with it a special\nresponsibility and commitment to the principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter and to sustainable human security.\n(spoke in French)\nEqually important is the revitalization of the General\nAssembly. The United Nations General Assembly is the\none body that brings together all nations of the world in\ntheir full diversity. It represents on a global scale both the\nessence and the challenge of democracy. The General\nAssembly must achieve consensus and take decisions on\nthe new human security agenda. It must promote\nsustainable human security, a concept that combines the\nneed to husband natural resources, to generate growth and\nto ensure peace and security.\n(spoke in English)\nI have outlined today some of the steps that Canada\nhas taken to advance thinking, to improve existing\npractices and to develop new ones. And I know that other\nMember States have been working towards the very same\nend. We now have many options to consider and discuss.\n16\n\n\nBut plans, proposals and studies are not enough. As\nthe poet Yeats said, \u201cIn dreams begins responsibility.\u201d It is\neasy to dream; it is much harder to act. We have a renewed\nvision of multilateralism, and a renewed mandate not just\nfor the prevention of conflict, but for the nurturing of\npeace. We have started work on making that vision a\nreality. We all recognize how daunting this task is as we\nembark upon it; but we must persist, for the task is as vital\nas it is difficult.\nWe in 1996 must show ourselves capable of restoring\nthe spirit of 1956 when, in the deepest freeze of the cold-\nwar climate, the United Nations gave birth to peacekeeping\nand changed international relations forever. We need to find\nwithin ourselves the ability and the will to innovate and the\npersistence to implement our innovations. It is in the\ninterest of each one of us, as much as it is in the interests\nof all of us, to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to take this\nopportunity on behalf of His Excellency President Amata\nKabua and the Government and the people of the\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands to thank and to\nacknowledge the leadership of the outgoing President,\nProfessor Diogo Freitas do Amaral, and also to\ncongratulate you, Ambassador Razali Ismail, on your\nwell-deserved election to the high office of the Presidency\nof the General Assembly.\nI am pleased to inform you, Sir, that at the recently\nconcluded South Pacific Forum meeting in the Republic\nof the Marshall Islands, your country, Malaysia, was\ninvited to join the post-forum dialogue next year as a\npartner, where we hope to further our cooperation.\nIn our capacity as Chairman of the South Pacific\nForum, I have the honour first to make some remarks of\na regional nature on behalf of the Forum members that\nare also United Nations Members, followed by some\nremarks of a more national perspective.\nThe South Pacific Forum held its twenty-seventh\nmeeting last month in Majuro, the capital of the Republic\nof the Marshall Islands. The theme for this session,\n\u201cPacific Solidarity for the Common Good\u201d, highlights one\nof the important building blocks of our regional\ncooperation towards sustainable development. The Forum\nleaders reviewed a broad range of measures in the area of\neconomic reform and development. These and other\nimportant decisions of the South Pacific Forum leaders\nare contained in the Forum communiqu\u00e9, which has been\nsubmitted to the Secretary-General and will be circulated\nas an official United Nations document.\nIn his opening remarks to the Forum at Majuro, the\nPresident of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, His\nExcellency Mr. Amata Kabua, emphasized the unity and\nthe harmony of the nations gathered at the meeting, which\ntraversed immense ocean barriers. The restraining pull of\nnational interests and cultural differences are all\nharmonized \u2014 fine-tuned, so to speak \u2014 into a single sea\nof unity. It is through this unity that seemingly\ninsurmountable obstacles or intractable problems can be\nresolved. In deliberating on and reviewing their respective\nperformances together and charting the way towards a\nprosperous and secure future for the region, the Forum\nleaders gave deeper meaning to the theme of this year\u2019s\nsession.\nI wish to make some remarks about the outcome of\nthose discussions. Climate change is a global problem that\n5\n\n\nrequires a global solution. The Forum has again highlighted\nits concern over climate change and called for urgent action\nin view of the second assessment report of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which states\nthat the balance of scientific evidence suggests a discernible\nhuman influence on the global climate. This report has\ngiven us much to be concerned about, and the Forum\ncountries call on the international community to accelerate\nnegotiations at the next conference of the parties.\nThe international community needs to achieve\nsignificant progress towards the goal of lowering\ngreenhouse gas emissions in the near future. The survival\nof many small island developing States, as well as many\nother developing States that are adversely affected in some\nway by climate change depends upon our taking action. We\nwill all be adversely affected by climate change. For this\nreason we reaffirm our full support for the alliance of small\nisland States protocol in the context of the discussions of\nthe Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate, which calls for\nstronger carbon dioxide reductions in a time-bound\nframework.\nDuring this session of the General Assembly we will\nreview progress on a number of related issues under the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,\nincluding fisheries conservation and management and\nefforts to reduce the incidence of illegal fishing practices.\nWe will also reiterate the importance that our region has\nplaced on the effectiveness of an international legal regime\nfor oceans and their resources, including, in our view,\nproviding adequate financial resources to the International\nSeabed Authority in Kingston, Jamaica.\nThe Forum leaders underscored the importance that\nthe Pacific fish stocks have for international trade and our\nlivelihood. We recognize that this important resource must\nbe managed sustainably to maximize its benefits to our\nregion. In this connection, the Forum leaders have\nrequested our regional experts to develop comprehensive\nagreements for the sustainable management of the region\u2019s\nfisheries across the full geographical range of the stocks,\nincluding the high seas, taking into account the Agreement\non straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks\nopened for signature here in New York last year. The\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands has offered to host a\nsecond High-level Multilateral Consultation on the\nConservation and Management of Fisheries Resources of\nthe Central Western Pacific next year to advance this\nprocess. This ministerial meeting will discuss a number of\nissues, including restocking, greater involvement of the\ndistant-water-fishing nations in conservation and\nmanagement, data gathering on the range of the stocks,\nand transshipments.\nThe Forum leaders are also committed to the review\nand appraisal of Agenda 21, which will take place at the\nspecial session of the General Assembly next year.\nMechanisms have been established for regional dialogue,\npartnership and participation in the development of\nconcrete proposals for action regarding the progress made\nsince the United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment in 1992. The Forum has asked its Advisory\nCommittee to coordinate these tasks and make\npreparations to submit reports to that special session. In\nthis respect I wish to call on our development partners to\nsupport the efforts of the Forum countries and our\nregional organizations, so that the special session will be\na thorough and comprehensive review. But in this regard,\nwe caution against a proliferation of organizations and\nmeetings when the concerted efforts of the international\ncommunity should be focused on practical measures,\nwhich will improve on the efforts under way at the\nregional level. It is problematic for our administrations,\nwith limited resources, to cover too many meetings\ndealing with the same topics, and we fear that\nunnecessary duplication may occur as a result.\nWe will report to that session on a number of\ninitiatives, following on from the report submitted to the\nCommission on Sustainable Development in 1996 by the\nSouth Pacific Regional Environmental Programme\n(SPREP). In our region we recognize the importance of\nthe multiple role that forests have, and the need for a\ncomprehensive approach by the international community\nto the sustainable management and conservation of all\ntypes of forests. For our part in sustainable forests\nmanagement, the Forum endorsed a South Pacific Code\nof Conduct for Logging of Indigenous Forests in selected\nSouth Pacific Forum countries. Also, in the light of the\nfact that 1997 will be the Year of the Coral Reef in the\nPacific, we hope to include progress reports on the\nimplementation of coastal-zone-management strategies.\nThe international community took steps at the\nBarbados Conference to acknowledge the special situation\nand interests of small island developing States. We stress\nthe need to give particular attention to the comprehensive\nProgramme of Action produced at that Conference, and to\nhave the special needs of small island developing States\nadequately addressed in the United Nations development\nefforts. In its review of Agenda 21 the special session\n6\n\n\nshould lay the grounds for further international cooperation,\nnational and regional initiative, and the mobilization of\nresources for meeting the sustainable development needs of\nsmall island developing States.\nI wish to raise some of issues of political significance\nfor our region. The Forum commended progress by France\nand parties in New Caledonia on the implementation of the\nMatignon Agreements. It welcomed the recent reception\naccorded to the Ministerial Mission from the Forum\ncountries by the French and New Caledonian authorities.\nForum countries encourage all parties to continue dialogue\nin the search for a durable solution to the question of the\nterritory\u2019s long-term future.\nI wish to inform the General Assembly that the Forum\nhas reaffirmed its strong and unanimous support for\nAustralia\u2019s candidature for the Security Council in this\nyear\u2019s election. Furthermore, in recognition of the\nimportance of Japan as a constructive partner for the region,\nthe Forum also expressed strong and unanimous support for\nthe candidature of Japan at the same election.\nThe Forum expressed satisfaction at the permanent\ncessation of French nuclear testing in the South Pacific.\nThis marked the end of all nuclear testing in a region that\nhad been subjected to both atmospheric and underground\ntesting for five decades. China\u2019s recent announcement of a\nmoratorium on nuclear testing meant that all five nuclear-\nweapon States were now observing testing moratoriums\nlong urged by the Forum. Earlier this month the General\nAssembly took action to adopt and open for signature a\ncomprehensive test-ban Treaty (CTBT). This was an effort\nfully supported by the Forum, and the resolution was\nsponsored by all the United Nations members of the Forum.\nWe are pleased with the passage of resolution 50/78, and\nurge all States to join with us in signing and ratifying the\nCTBT as soon as possible, to facilitate the Treaty\u2019s earliest\nimplementation.\nWe should recall the Advisory Opinion tendered by\nthe International Court of Justice on the legality of the\nthreat or use of nuclear weapons, which recognized that all\nmembers of the international community have an obligation\nto pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion\nnegotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its\naspects under strict and effective international control. The\nForum leaders urged all States concerned, particularly the\nnuclear-weapon States, to continue meaningful negotiations\nwith a view to further significant reductions of nuclear\nstockpiles in the near future as a step towards the ultimate\nelimination of nuclear weapons.\nThey also warmly welcomed the signature and\nratification by Vanuatu of the South Pacific Nuclear-Free\nZone Treaty, the signature of Tonga, and the signing of\nthe protocols to the Treaty by France, the United\nKingdom and the United States of America. As a result\nof these developments, all States within the Treaty area\nhave now given their support to the Treaty, and all five\nnuclear-weapon States have undertaken to respect its\nprovisions. We welcome the ratification by France of the\nprotocols. The Forum also urged early ratification of the\nprotocols by the United Kingdom and the United States\nof America.\nThe Forum leaders were encouraged by the\nestablishment since their last meeting of two nuclear-\nweapon-free zones: in South-East Asia and Africa.\nLeaders noted with satisfaction that these developments\nrepresented progress with respect to the decisions\naccompanying the indefinite extension in 1995 of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In\nthis context, Forum leaders expressed support for an\nappropriate resolution at this session of the United\nNations General Assembly whereby signatory States of\nthe southern hemisphere nuclear-weapon-free-zone treaties\nand other members of the international community could\naffirm their support for these zones and cooperate in the\nfurtherance of the goals of these zones and of nuclear\nnon-proliferation and disarmament.\nThe Forum again reaffirmed the existence of a\nspecial responsibility towards those peoples of the former\nUnited Nations Trust Territory administered by the United\nStates, the Marshall Islands, which was adversely affected\nas a result of nuclear-weapon tests conducted during the\nperiod of the trusteeship. This responsibility includes the\nsafe resettlement of displaced human populations and the\nrestoration to economic productivity of affected areas.\nThe Forum wishes again to raise concerns over\nshipments of plutonium and radioactive wastes through\nour region. These shipments must be carried out in\naccordance with the strictest international safety and\nsecurity standards. All contingencies must be fully\naddressed, and full consultation must be carried out with\nthe countries of the regions through which the shipments\nwill occur.\nI now wish to make some comments on behalf of\nmy national delegation.\nIn regard to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT), it is important that countries that were\n7\n\n\nseverely affected by nuclear testing play a role in the 51-\nmember Executive Council being envisaged within the\nCTBT framework to oversee all aspects of the\nimplementation of the Treaty. I wish to reiterate that the\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands stands ready to present its\ncandidacy for that Council, once established.\nWe are grateful to President Clinton and his\nAdministration for their transparent policy of disclosing\npreviously classified information relating to the nuclear-\ntesting programme in the Marshall Islands. We also wish to\nthank our friends and supporters in the United States\nCongress for their assistance. We hope that our cooperation\ncontinues to improve and that the process of disclosure is\naccelerated. All the information pertaining to the nuclear-\ntesting programme should be provided to my Government,\nin order that we may fully comprehend the implications for\nour planning for the health and well-being of our citizens\nand our environment.\nThe Government of the Republic of the Marshall\nIslands has recently learned that the damage caused by\nnuclear-weapon-test programmes during the trusteeship is\nfar greater and more horrible than originally disclosed. The\nradiation released by all 67 nuclear-weapon tests is\ncurrently known to affect more atolls and more groups of\npeople than previously disclosed, as reported by the White\nHouse Advisory Committee on Human Radiation\nExperiments. The health, environment, medical, social and\neconomic consequences resulting from the effects of the\nradiation released remains a major concern for the\nGovernment of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. As a\nresult, at our current level of knowledge the costs related to\nthe effects of radiation make it very hard to properly treat\nand care for the people who have, and continue to show,\nradiation-related illnesses. This also applies to programmes\nrelated to the rehabilitation of contaminated islands and the\nsafe resettlement of affected communities.\nWe cannot solve these problems on our own, and we\nfeel obliged to appeal to the international community. Our\nconcern continues to be that our situation has not been fully\naddressed and rectified until now. We welcome the new\nwillingness of the United States authorities to constructively\nwork with the Republic of the Marshall Islands to address\nthe full range of outstanding nuclear issues, which have for\nso long affected our relationship and the well-being of our\npeople. We acknowledge the assistance that has been\nprovided up to now, which includes efforts at clean-up and\nresettlement. But much more needs to be done.\nWe reiterate the call that was made to the High-level\nOpen-ended Working Group of the General Assembly on\nthe Financial Situation of the United Nations to reduce\nthe so-called floor rate in the scale of assessments. This\nis an issue of vital importance to all developing countries\nwith small economies, in particular a large number of\nsmall island developing States and least developed\ncountries. The situation was firmly noted by the\nCommittee on Contributions in its last report:\n\u201cthe current floor assessment rate of 0.01 per cent\nresulted in a serious departure from the principle of\ncapacity to pay for a number of smaller Member\nStates.\u201d (A/50/11/Add.2, para. 50)\nWe call on the Fifth Committee to take action on\nthis matter as soon as possible, and the time for this has\ncome at this session of the General Assembly. In our\nview, this would have a beneficial effect for over 60\ncountries.\nAnother area of reform that is of great concern to us\nis the expansion of the Security Council. The need for a\nmore democratic process and for allowing greater\nparticipation in the work of the Council is something that\nwe all reaffirmed during the fiftieth-anniversary session.\nHowever, we have to make more progress in\nimplementing our ideas in this regard.\nThis will be a very important year for the United\nNations in that we will take stock of many of our current\nactivities and lay the groundwork for many others. As\nChair of the South Pacific Forum, the Republic of the\nMarshall Islands will spare no effort to ensure a\nsuccessful conclusion to this year\u2019s agenda. The Republic\nof the Marshall Islands has been an active participant in\nthis Assembly in the five years that we have been a\nmember. We have come a long way since the adoption of\nour Constitution in 1979. We pledge our cooperation to\nthe President\u2019s leadership and we look forward to\nworking closely with him and the members of the General\nAssembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset I would like, on behalf of my country, to\ncongratulate the President sincerely, and the friendly\ncountry of Malaysia, on his election to preside over the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. His\ncompetence and profound knowledge of international\naffairs will clearly contribute to the achievement of the\nexpected results of the session. I should like to take this\nopportunity to assure him that the delegation of the\nKingdom of Morocco will provide its full support and\nassistance in order to achieve those results.\nI would also like to express my deep appreciation to\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for the wisdom with which\nhe guided the proceedings of the fiftieth session and for\nhis commendable efforts in connection with the\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations.\nAlthough the cold war ended a few years ago, and\ndespite the hopes of the peoples of the world that a new\ninternational era would dawn in which they could reap the\nbenefits and dividends of peace and take part on an equal\nfooting in the guidance and management of international\naffairs in order to preserve their ideals, values and\ninterests, we note that the current world situation is\ncharacterized by instability and confusion and is far from\nreflecting the order we so hoped to achieve. Indeed, far\nfrom bringing peace, security and justice, the end of the\ncold war spawned a situation in which local crises have\nbrought suffering to millions of people in several regions\nof the world, severely stirring our global conscience.\nThese crises have also highlighted the inability of the\ninternational community to devise effective mechanisms\nto resolve such conflicts in an equitable way and to put\nan end to the tragedies they engender.\nMorocco believes that the Secretary-General\u2019s\ninitiative for restructuring the United Nations and\nstrengthening its role falls precisely within this\nperspective and can prepare the Organization to deal with\nthe effects of these conflicts through preventive\ndiplomacy, the development and reform of United Nations\nbodies, and coordination between the United Nations and\nother international and regional organizations. We are,\nmoreover, convinced that the re-election of Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali to a second term as Secretary-General\nwould be the best guarantee for the continuation of those\nreforms. The Secretary-General\u2019s experience, competence,\n15\n\n\ncourage and spirit of initiative in settling international\nconflicts and reactivating international cooperation in\nvarious fields, make him the best choice to guide the affairs\nof the Organization during a second mandate. Morocco also\nhopes that any controversy on the subject will be avoided\nin order to forestall adverse repercussions on the work of\nthis session and on the future of the Organization.\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of our\nOrganization provided an opportunity for the numerous\nHeads of State who attended the celebration to express\nconcerns and apprehensions regarding the challenges\nconfronting us. They issued a Declaration that contained\ntheir proposals and recommendations for meeting those\nchallenges and devising effective mechanisms to promote\ncloser relations among countries. In our view, this session\nprovides us an opportunity to reflect on those\nrecommendations and proposals and to find answers to the\nquestions raised by the Heads of State regarding the\nfundamental and structural reforms of the United Nations.\nWith regard to the Security Council and its\nprerogatives in discharging its mandate to maintain\ninternational peace and security, we believe that any\ninitiative aimed at expanding the membership of the\nSecurity Council and improving its modes of action would\nrequire much thought and circumspection. It must take into\naccount current realities if any final decision in this regard\nis to lead to the desired reform and thereby guarantee\nequitable representation of all continents. The aim here is\nto ensure the Council\u2019s efficiency and credibility and to\nenhance its ability to cope with any violation of\ninternational law without impinging on the prerogatives and\nrole of the General Assembly.\nHowever, any reform that does not take into account\nthe current financial difficulties of the Organization clearly\ncannot produce the expected results. It will be extremely\ndifficult for the United Nations to fulfil its mission without\na stable financial base. Hence the need for all Member\nStates to pay their contributions, settle their arrears and\nthereby give concrete substance to their collective and\ncontinued support for the efforts of the Organization.\nIn the field of disarmament, many important steps\nhave been taken in the control of weapons of mass\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons. Following the\nestablishment of nuclear-free zones in Latin America and\nthe South Pacific and the indefinite extension of the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the African\ncountries signed a Treaty making Africa a nuclear-free\ncontinent. In addition to these achievements, we hope to see\nthe Middle East also become a zone free of weapons of\nmass destruction and of nuclear weapons in particular.\nMoreover, following the success of the efforts to\nproduce the final version, the Comprehensive Nuclear\nTest-Ban Treaty will be open for signature tomorrow.\nMorocco, which made an important contribution to the\ndrafting of the Treaty, is convinced that this document\nwill open the way for the complete elimination of nuclear\nweapons, strengthen international cooperation and\npromote the exchange of knowledge about the peaceful\nuses of nuclear energy, so that developing countries can\nachieve their economic and technical goals.\nMorocco\u2019s interest in this subject is predicated on its\nacute awareness of the risks involved and that arms\ncontrol is the cornerstone of any initiative aimed at firmly\nestablishing the basis for international peace and security\nthroughout the world. Humanity can be sheltered from the\ntragedy of massively destructive wars only through the\nfull and complete elimination of nuclear, chemical and\nbiological weapons under effective international control.\nLast year, I told this Assembly that the efforts of the\nKingdom of Morocco to achieve territorial integrity had\ngone through a series of phases unique in the history of\nthe independence of nations. The time has come for\nMorocco to recover all its territories.\nBeing fully committed to peace and to the settlement\nof problems through dialogue, and having continually\ndefended this principle in international forums as a means\nfor resolving problems between nations, Morocco is\nconvinced that the return of the cities of Ceuta and\nMelilla and of the neighbouring islands still under\nSpanish occupation can only occur through those same\nmeans. This is particularly true given the common\ninterests and the well-established and good-neighbourly\nrelations existing between Morocco and Spain. This is,\nmoreover, precisely what His Majesty King Hassan II\ntook the initiative to underscore when he called for the\nestablishment of a Moroccan-Spanish think tank\ndefinitively to resolve this question.\nAccordingly, the final, complete solution we are\nadvocating is one which preserves Moroccan sovereignty\non the territories it holds, while guaranteeing Spanish\ninterests. This would further consolidate the dynamics of\nthe diverse and close cooperation between the northern\nand southern shores of the Mediterranean. We are also\nconvinced that our age-old relations with neighbouring\n16\n\n\nSpain will be instrumental in finding a permanent solution\nto this question.\nThe developments in the Middle East over the past\nfew years opened prospects of tolerance and coexistence for\nthe peoples of the region, instead of dissension and fighting.\nWe view the progress that has been made as an auspicious\nsign in that regard, starting with the Madrid Conference and\nthe Oslo agreements and progressing to the\nPalestinian-Israeli agreement and the Jordanian-Israeli\nagreement.\nMorocco has contributed to giving life to the concept\nof peace in the region, and has made tireless efforts to\nestablish a comprehensive, just and lasting peace that would\nguarantee the return of all occupied Arab territories,\nincluding Al-Quds al-Sharif, the occupied Syrian Golan\nHeights and southern Lebanon in keeping with Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978)\nand the principle of land for peace. We therefore regret the\ninterruption of the peace process, which threatens to destroy\nall the efforts we have made to establish security and\nstability in the region.\nWe have the right to wonder whether the principles\nand commitments agreed upon at the Madrid Conference,\nwhich provided the groundwork for the process towards\nestablishing a just and comprehensive peace in the region,\nhave become outdated, not to say null and void. Has the\nnew Israeli Government, which seeks to cast doubt on those\nprinciples and commitments, realized the disastrous\nconsequences of such a course of action, which could take\nthe region and its peoples back to a situation we thought\nwas behind us thanks to an irreversible commitment and a\nnew perception of the region\u2019s future?\nWe believe in peace and are dedicated to its defence\nand maintenance as an irreversible option and goal. My\ncountry has contributed to this mission of its own free will\nand in good faith. Similarly, we have on many occasions\npointed out that genuine security for all the countries of the\nregion can be achieved only through the establishment of a\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace which guarantees the\nrights of all parties in the region.\nIn this respect, we call for scrupulous and unequivocal\ncommitment, with no delays, to all that has been agreed\nupon, in order to implement the agreements reached\naccording to the scheduled phases of the peace process. We\nalso call for removing the obstacles impeding the bilateral\nArab-Israeli negotiations so that we may keep abreast of the\nsubstantial progress made in the multilateral peace process\nin order to achieve the desired final solution.\nThe blockade imposed on the Palestinian territories,\nwhich hinders even the delivery of international assistance\nto the Palestinian people, makes it particularly difficult\nfor the Palestinian Authority to discharge its obligations\nto its people, who are living in extremely difficult\nconditions. In addition, the colonization policy applied by\nIsrael and the changes it is introducing in the old part of\nthe city of Al-Quds and neighbouring areas constitute a\nviolation of the United Nations resolutions, principles and\ncommitments to which I referred earlier.\nIn this respect, we call for a lifting of this blockade\nand for providing full material support and assistance to\nthe Palestinian Authority, in accordance with the decisions\ntaken by the international community, so that the\nAuthority can discharge its mission in the best possible\nconditions and launch the process of the economic\ndevelopment of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in\norder to enable the Palestinian people to establish their\nindependent State, with Al-Quds as its capital, and to\ncontribute, on equal footing, to the progress, cooperation\nand prosperity of the region.\nThe Gulf crisis has long cast a dark shadow on the\nregion and created crisis conditions. We have repeatedly\ncalled for transcending these conditions through the\nimplementation of internationally binding resolutions\nwithin the framework of ensuring the security and\nstability of the region and preserving the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of the countries of the region. We are\nconvinced that this situation cannot continue indefinitely.\nThe prospects for an easing of the crisis are\nbeginning to emerge, based on the progress made in the\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions, and the\nunderstanding reached by Iraq and the United Nations on\nthe implementation of resolution 986 (1995), known as\nthe oil-for-food resolution. We regret the latest\ndevelopments in the Gulf region, which are likely to once\nagain plunge that area into a spiral of instability and\npostpone the implementation of that resolution. As we call\nfor restraint and calm in order to avoid any escalation, we\nreaffirm the need to respect Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity and to implement Security Council\nresolution 986 (1995), in order to alleviate the hardships\nof the Iraqi people, who are still suffering from the\nembargo which has been imposed on them for the last six\nyears.\n17\n\n\nThe problem of the United Arab Emirate islands of the\nGreater and the Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa has not yet\nbeen resolved. Given the relationship of kinship and\nbrotherhood between us and the United Arab Emirates, and\ngiven our historic and brotherly relations with Iran, we call\nupon the two neighbouring countries to find a definitive\nsolution to this crisis on the basis of respect for the\nsovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over its islands\nand respect for its territorial integrity, in keeping with the\nrelations of neighbourliness and the traditional ties existing\nbetween the two countries. These ties should be exploited\nto the benefit of the peoples of the Emirates and Iran and\nto achieve stability in the region.\nMorocco attaches special importance to the conflict\nbetween Libya and certain Western countries because of its\nrepercussions on international and regional relations. In this\nconnection, we regretfully note the implications of the\nmeasures imposed on Libya and their extensive damaging\neffects on the Libyan people and on the economies of\nneighbouring countries. The continuation of this situation\nhas been a source of concern.\nMorocco, which is interested in seeing this problem\nsettled amicably, calls for a favourable response to the\ninitiatives and efforts made by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,\nthe Arab League, the Non-Aligned Movement and the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference to find a solution to\nthis crisis.\nThe world has followed with very keen interest the\ninternational efforts aimed at restoring peace in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. These efforts have rekindled hope and\nprovided an opportunity to put an end to the conflict in the\nregion and to the crimes against humanity that have claimed\ntens of thousands of Bosnian lives. Morocco fully supports\nthe Bosnian people and their just cause, including the\npreservation of their sovereignty, territorial integrity and\nidentity, and has never hesitated, in its current capacity as\nChairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, to\nshoulder its responsibilities to help the Bosnian people\novercome their ordeal. Thus, we worked to set up a\ncoordination mechanism between the Islamic Contact Group\nand the International Contact Group, which contributed to\nbringing about the official signing, at the Paris Conference,\nof the Dayton Agreement, which aims at putting an end to\nthe bloodshed in the region, finding a comprehensive, just\nand lasting solution, instilling respect for international\nlegality, and contributing to stability in the region. My\ncountry has also met its international obligations through its\nparticipation in the Implementation Force, thereby\ncontributing to the establishment of security and stability\nin that region.\nWe are gratified to note the substantial progress\nmade in the implementation of the military aspects of the\nDayton Agreement and the launching of the construction\nof political institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We\nhope that the legislative elections held recently will\nconstitute yet another constructive step towards preserving\nthe territorial integrity and political unity of the Republic\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina and achieving harmony and\nconcord among the country\u2019s various constituents in order\nto secure its stability and development.\nThe current world economic situation clearly reveals\nthe wide gap between developed and developing\ncountries, as well as the increasing marginalization of the\nlatter in the international economic arena. This unbalanced\nsituation threatens to lead to conflicts among countries\narising out of economic and development considerations\nand could thus adversely affect world stability.\nGiven the staggering increase in external debt and its\nnegative repercussions on the economies of the\ndeveloping countries, there is an urgent need today to find\nadequate solutions to this situation, which is mortgaging\nthe future of the developing countries. Such solutions can\nbe achieved only through the creation of conditions more\nconducive to increasing equal opportunities among the\ncountries of the world and a genuine partnership that can\npave the way towards the achievement of balanced and\nlasting development.\nIn this context, we once again welcome the initiative\nof the United Nations Secretary-General in the \u201cAgenda\nfor Development\u201d. We hope that it will lead to positive\nresults, redress the imbalance and help to achieve the\neconomic development sought by the developing\ncountries.\nThe changes affecting the international economic\nscene following the crystallization of the concept of\neconomic globalization and the liberalization of trade-\nmandate corrective measures require that the existing\ndisproportion be corrected, particularly since the\nbehaviour of certain developed countries in trade\nliberalization is still marked by a selective approach.\nMoreover, protectionist measures and the institution of\ncovert barriers in the guise of various environmental and\nother considerations are inconsistent with the desirable\npolicy of liberalization of international trade.\n18\n\n\nWe hope that the task of redressing these imbalances\nwill feature prominently among the concerns of the World\nTrade Organization in the near future and that a balance\nmay be struck between freedom of trade and development\nrequirements.\nIf a solution is to be found, the role of international\nfinancial institutions must be extensively reassessed in view\nof the deep changes affecting the international scene.\nAccordingly, we call for the implementation of the\nprovisions of World Trade Organization agreements and for\ncareful thought to be given to defining the concepts of\nglobalization that now determine the very future of nations,\npeoples and, indeed, entire continents. This could be done\nby means of financial and economic transactions designed\nto close the gap between countries and to overcome the\nmarginalization from which many of them suffer,\nparticularly in Africa.\nWe keenly hope that the meeting of the World Trade\nOrganization at Singapore in December will provide an\nopportunity to assess the situation and to enter into a more\ncareful consideration of the consistency of economic,\nfinancial and monetary policies, for which Morocco has\nbeen calling for some time.\nThe deterioration in the situation on the African\ncontinent is most certainly at the forefront of issues\ndemanding a joint effort on the part of the international\ncommunity. Effective and practical solutions must be found\nfor the serious economic, social and humanitarian problems\nfacing African States, which have been compounded by\ntragedies such as civil war, the spread of epidemics and\ndeadly diseases, desertification, refugee problems and all\nthey entail.\nMorocco, as a country on the African continent that\nenjoys deep-rooted historical and other ties with other\nAfrican States, takes a keen interest in the continent\u2019s\nproblems. Bearing in mind those ancient ties and our\nspecial political relations, my country has contributed,\nwithin the means available to it, to the development of\nAfrica through the establishment of bilateral cultural and\ntechnical cooperation with the States of the continent.\nMorocco will therefore spare no effort to develop and\nconsolidate bilateral cooperation with African States to help\nthe African continent overcome its problems and emerge\nfrom marginalization.\nDuring the Marrakesh Ministerial Meeting of the\nUruguay Round in 1994, His Majesty King Hassan II was\nthe first to call for the introduction of a \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d\nfor Africa and to stress the need for greater international\nefforts to help African States develop their economies and\nbecome integrated into the world economy.\nIn this framework, we welcome the United Nations\nSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa. In our opinion,\nwe should do our utmost to help this Initiative succeed by\nensuring that both the United Nations and the\ninternational community provide the necessary financial\nand technical support.\nWith regard to what is known as the question of\nWestern Sahara, I would like to affirm, as I have done\nmany times before, Morocco\u2019s commitment and\nunswerving willingness to implement the United Nations\nSettlement Plan which guarantees the right of all people\nfrom the Sahara to express their will through a\nreferendum.\nIt has now become clear to everyone that since the\nend of last year, the United Nations Plan has reached a\ndeadlock. We hope that this stalemate will end as soon as\npossible so that the Settlement Plan can be carried out on\nthe basis of a referendum.\nAs the twenty-first century comes into view, the\nworld hopes that tomorrow will bring a brighter future\ncharacterized by peace, cooperation and brotherhood\namong peoples. As we stand on the threshold of a new\ncentury, we need to strengthen the United Nations and\nconsolidate its capabilities so that it can keep up with the\nchanges taking place and respond to people\u2019s desire for\nsecurity, justice and development.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to congratulate you, Mr. President, on\nyour well-deserved election to preside over the General\nAssembly at its fifty-first regular session. I also wish to\nconvey our appreciation to Ambassador Diogo Freitas do\nAmaral for the skill and efficiency with which he conducted\nthe work of the General Assembly in the course of its last\nregular session.\nWe are very close to the achievement of peace in my\ncountry. This can already be felt in the silence of the guns\nand the newly flourishing spirit of unity among brothers.\nIntolerance is giving way to awareness of the common\nchallenges we face. We now realize that, for example, if we\nare to combat corruption and impunity, we need to share\nvalues and principles, though not necessarily ideologies.\nUnited in diversity, we must discover our own\nmeans for building our future. Our country is healing its\ndeep wounds and revealing its true face, as a generous\nland that is the home to age-old cultures. Guatemala is\ncoming to terms with itself and, in so doing, is\nreconciling itself with the world.\nWe are once again speaking as a friendly nation\namong friendly nations. The peace process has enabled us\nto evolve our own agenda, which responds to the needs\nof our country without our having had to accept an\nagenda imposed by anyone else. To that end we have\nreceived the constant support of the international\ncommunity, and in particular of the United Nations\nsystem.\nToday, at a time when the reform of the system is\nthe subject of such intense discussion, our national\nexperience may perhaps be useful, as it is an example of\ncooperation that is at once respectful and dynamic, based\nfundamentally on internal efforts with appropriate external\nhelp. For us this approach is indispensable since, to a\nlarge extent, it has been possible to build peace, thanks to\nthe valuable and diverse forms of support received from\nagencies of the United Nations system.\nBut this has not been effected through the\nmechanical application of preconceived formulas, or of\nautomatic institutional moulds. On the contrary, what we\nhave here is a challenging and complex empirical\nlaboratory where all of us are learning step by step. It is,\nin fact, a constant exercise in discovery with living social\ntissues, an exercise in which we have all had to pool our\nbest efforts. The creativity of individuals, Governments,\nand various organizations \u2014 private and public, local and\nnational, regional and multilateral \u2014 has come together\nto produce a constant quest for the solutions we need. It\nhas been an exercise in international solidarity that,\ncomplementing internal endeavours, has made it possible\nfor us to forge ahead along the right path to recovery.\nBut the test tube is the life of our people, and for\nthat reason there is little margin for error. Errors increase\nthe suffering of my people. And Guatemala has suffered\ngreatly from authoritarian intervention and the imposition\nof alien patterns that once impaired a political and social\nmaturation process that sought to infuse its own life-\ngiving fluids with contemporary ideas of equity and\ndemocracy. Domestic injustices and imbalances were\naggravated by the tensions of the cold war that exploded\nwithin my country.\n3\n\n\nNow is the time for reconciliation. Now is the time\nonce again to take development in hand. Now is the time\nto search for effective formulas to link our villages with the\nWorld Trade Organization; to link the poverty afflicting the\nfamilies of our neighbourhoods with international financial\ninstitutions; and to link decisions independently taken at the\nlevel of our domestic communities with the large\ndevelopment agencies.\nWe are on the threshold of signing the peace. We look\nforward to this historic transition with hope and jubilation,\nand we foresee the complex stage of strengthening the\nfabric of society and production. From that stage we can\nlook hopefully to the future. Peace will come to Guatemala\nbecause we Guatemalans have striven for it and because the\ninternational community has helped us along the way.\nAs is well known, last week in Mexico City the\nparties signed the agreement on the last substantive item of\nthe agenda agreed upon in the peace talks, the one\nconcerning the strengthening of civilian power and the role\nof the army in a democratic society. We now have to deal\nwith the operational issues: demobilization, reinsertion into\ncivil society, the cease-fire and the timetable for the\nimplementation of the agreements. In the course of this year\nwe shall initial, God willing, the final agreement for a firm\nand lasting peace, which will put an end to an armed\nconflict that has lasted 36 years.\nIt is worth emphasizing then, that for the last five\nmonths there has been no armed confrontation, which has\nallowed the peace talks to progress without subjecting our\nnegotiators to the anguish and pressure of knowing that as\nthey are working Guatemalan blood is being shed. That is\nover. Far from deadening or delaying the dialogue, this\nstate of affairs has stimulated it, given the prospect of a\ndefinitive cessation of hostilities. This has also stimulated\nus to see clearly where we are going and to gain a more\nprofound understanding of what has happened.\nAs many of the representatives in this Assembly\nknow, the internal conflict caused great misfortune and\nsuffering for our people. I am referring primarily to the\nirreparable loss of thousands of lives. I also have in mind\nthe traumatic aftermath of the conflict, which is evident in\nthe faces of every cripple, orphan and widow, and in every\nsurviving family, a number of which were eye-witnesses to\nthe tragedies. I am also referring to the economic losses, in\nthe form of damage to infrastructure and lost opportunities\nfor productive development.\nI also wish to call to mind the set-backs caused by\nthe conflict. Let us recall the words of the singer-\nsongwriter who asked,\n\u201cWho will return to us the fatherland that could have\nbeen?\u201d\nWhile more difficult to pinpoint, and perhaps impossible\nto measure, these too are irreparable losses: all that we\ncould have done, but did not do; all the growth that could\nhave occurred, but did not occur; all we could have built,\nbut did not build.\nWhile others were progressing, we were stagnating,\nlocked in a cruel domestic struggle that included elements\nimported from the cold war, which arbitrarily kept in\ncheck for 40 years our political, social and economic\nevolution. While technological, commercial and political\nchanges were taking place in the rest of the world, and\nnations were discovering new opportunities in their\nrelations, we were plunged deeper into the violence of a\ndomestic conflict that took the lives of thousands and\nthousands of young people, who were unable to provide\ntheir country with the fruits of their talents and\nendeavours. While new international options for well-\nbeing were blossoming elsewhere, we continued to be\nconsumed internally by a dirty war that crushed entire\nvillages and compelled many people to flee.\nThere is a part of our country that never came into\nbeing, because Guatemalans were bogged down in\nfratricidal domestic struggle that we were not able to stop\nin time \u2014 an internal conflict that \u2014 it is true \u2014 was\nfuelled by our own injustice, but \u2014 it must be\nacknowledged \u2014 was also fanned from abroad. But such\nis history: hope springs up amid tragedy, and lessons are\ndrawn from mistakes. Our people has an extraordinary\ncapacity for recovery and learning.\nWe are nearing the end of this stage, and another\nhas already begun: one in which all of us \u2014 absolutely\nall \u2014 are responsible and committed. One of the\nconsequences of this deeply traumatic and protracted\nconflict is that never before have we found ourselves in\na situation so propitious for dialogue and reconciliation.\nNever before have we shared such a profound and keen\nawareness of our immense multi-ethnic, multilingual and\nmulticultural wealth, or of our environment, which is\nextraordinarily varied. Never before have we been so\nkeenly aware of our need for internal integration and for\nthe development of our own potential.\n4\n\n\nWe have within our grasp a unique opportunity, one\nthat will never recur, to transform this moment into a\nmoment for the future and for renovation. This is perhaps\nnot the appropriate occasion for detailing all the progress\nmade in recent months. Such details may be found in the\nvarious reports of United Nations Mission for the\nVerification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the\nCommitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human\nRights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) and other agencies of\nthe United Nations system. But it is worthwhile to stress\nthe enormous effort that has gone into fulfilling the\nagreements already signed, even before most of them have\ncome into force. In particular, we have had remarkable\nsuccesses in the field of human rights, as has been\nrecognized by various commissions and subcommissions\ndealing with the issue.\nAt this singular moment at the end of the century,\nwhen we are celebrating the International Decade of the\nWorld\u2019s Indigenous People, it is fitting to point out that\nGuatemala has recently ratified and deposited International\nLabour Organization Convention 169, the Indigenous and\nTribal Peoples Convention, which strengthens the rule of\nlaw in Guatemala by conferring benefits and guarantees on\nthe Mayan population with regard to property, conditions of\nemployment, training for professions, crafts and rural\nindustries, health, social security, education, the\nadministration of justice, the environment and the proper\nand rational use of natural resources.\nWe are very close to the signature of an Agreement on\na Firm and Lasting Peace. We now face the hardest part of\nour task, but also the most challenging part, replete with\npossibilities: that of creating peace, of building peace. We\nwould do well, therefore, to recall two fundamental points:\nfirst, the peace that we are striving to build has a specific\norientation; and, secondly, peace is not made only by those\nwho sign the agreements.\nWe seek a peace that is well oriented. We should not\nbe content with a precarious peace, or with political\naccommodations made for the occasion, with no sense of\ndirection or permanence. The accords signed so far, and\nthose that are to follow, express basic agreements that,\ntaken as a whole, constitute a specific agenda aimed at\ndeepening democracy and furthering development.\nFurthermore, peace is not made only by those who\nsign the agreements. Peace is made on a day-to-day basis,\nby the entire population, which takes seriously the need for\nreconciliation and realizes optimistically that it is possible\nto have fair opportunities to work, educate oneself, be\nproductive and improve one\u2019s situation.\nPeace is built by men and women of flesh and\nblood, with their differences, passions, interests and\nenmities. Peace is built day by day, in villages, hamlets,\nneighbourhoods and communities. Peace is built through\nordinary coexistence, with all Guatemalans, male or\nfemale, striving daily to make a living and to help their\nfamilies get ahead, seeking out better opportunities while\nenduring hardships in a country with so many limitations\nand so much distrust. That is where reconciliation must\ntake place and where we must identify the true enemies\nof peace: poverty, discrimination, exclusion and\nintolerance.\nWe live in a spirit of solidarity within a fragile\nshared space. Our mission is to care for it and improve it\nas a legacy for coming generations. That space, that\npossibility, does not belong to us; it is but a legacy of\nwhat former generations did or failed to do. Solidarity is\nnot limited to those who stand before us; there is a kind\nof solidarity that embraces even those who have not yet\nbeen born. What can we do to ensure that this solidarity\naccepts life as a primary, elementary and basic value,\nwhen we have lived for so long immersed in violence?\nWe will attain development when we become\ncapable of providing comprehensive security for all\nGuatemalans. The assurance that our children will not die\nbecause of negligence or lack of medical attention, the\nsecurity of a stable job, plans and facilities for the\nacquisition of housing, security of access to a competitive\neducational system allowing us to learn and to teach our\nchildren, the security of ample nutrition, security for our\npossessions and for our lives, access to and equal\ntreatment under impartial and timely systems of justice \u2014\nthese are the key aspects of comprehensive security.\nIn this regard, Central America has taken important\ndecisions to renew its agendas under the Alliance for\nSustainable Development, which it is taking decisive steps\nto implement, including through the Treaty on Democratic\nSecurity signed by the Presidents of the isthmus at San\nPedro Sula in December 1995. That broad set of\ncommitments prepares Central Americans to wage a\ncomprehensive fight against trafficking in drugs and in\nhuman beings.\nThere can be no stable democracy over the long\nterm if there are extreme inequalities in the distribution of\nwealth and of social opportunities. Democratic citizenship\n5\n\n\nposes the question of how we are to incorporate those who\nare unlikely to have access to public institutions; those who,\nbecause of poverty or discrimination, cannot invoke their\nrights or have them recognized. No democracy is possible\nwhen a significant percentage of the population is living in\nextreme poverty. Our democracy must generate economic\nconditions that permit the satisfaction of the basic needs of\nthe population.\nThe greatest challenge and the greatest opportunity for\nGuatemala resides in organized, realistic and coherent\nimplementation of the commitments derived from the\nagreements undertaken. That is why we must understand\nthem as a starting point that opens up a new page of\nchallenges and efforts for all the population.\nFor its part, the Government has taken on some very\ndaring and far-reaching commitments that encompass\nalmost all its institutions. They imply major legal reforms\nand major budgetary efforts. These commitments have\nmade it possible to reach the agreements, and stability and\nthe strengthening of peace and stability depend upon their\nfulfilment.\nBut to do all of this, we also need the understanding\nand firm support of the international community. We need\na real opening of markets and fair prices for our products,\nas well as foreign investment to add to the internal savings\nachieved through the generation of jobs and the stable\nimprovement of our productive capacity. We also need the\ncomplement of technical and financial cooperation, above\nall during the stage immediately following the signing of\nthe peace.\nFor all of these reasons, Guatemala appreciates the\nsupport and recognition of the international community. For\nthose same reasons, Guatemala also aspires to contribute,\nto the extent of its modest possibilities, to strengthening the\nmultilateral system and respectful understanding among\nnations.\nGuatemala attaches great importance to the principle\nof universality that must characterize the United Nations,\nand this leads us to express our conviction that the Republic\nof China on Taiwan must also be fully represented in our\nOrganization and must actively participate in the search for\nsolutions in this new global, interdependent world. In our\nopinion, and taking into account earlier positive\nexperiences, this in no way contradicts any effort at\nreunification.\nIt is often said that we are living in a time of\nchange. But it is much more than that: this is a change of\ntimes. We are living just on the bridge between two\ndifferent eras of world history, where we cannot yet make\nout the difference between what is ending and what is\nbeginning. There is an order that has gone into crisis, but\nthere is a new order that cannot yet be clearly perceived.\nAll institutions are being put to the test.\nWe view with appreciation and hope the fact that\nthis interaction between Guatemala\u2019s experience and the\nrespectful participation of Governments and multilateral\ninstitutions is yielding modest but valid solutions,\nenabling us to envisage a simple, competent and less\nbureaucratic form of institutional structures, and a kind of\ncooperation that does not undermine the precarious living\nconditions of the poor majorities in our countries and that\ncontributes ideas and technical skills with due respect for\nour population. Guatemala is becoming a laboratory for\ncooperation with respect, of partnership rather than\nimposition.\nIt is also becoming a broad and open horizon for\ndiscovery, an opportunity to search for ways to\nencompass the aspirations, proposals and initiatives of so\nmany people from inside and from abroad, and above all,\nto go on creating spaces for self-expression by the people\nand the communities of my country, which, with such\ncourage, endurance, valour and desire, have not\nsuccumbed to adversity.\nI wish to attest to the gratitude of my people and my\nGovernment to the Secretary-General and to all the\nofficials who in various capacities have contributed to\nadvancing the peace negotiations in my country, as well\nas to making a reality of the various complex efforts at\ndevelopment that we are undertaking. We wish especially\nto thank the Moderator appointed by the Secretary-\nGeneral for the negotiations between the Government of\nGuatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional\nGuatemalteca (URNG), the small but efficient Guatemala\nUnit of the Secretariat and all the members of the United\nNations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and\nof Compliance with the Commitments of the\nComprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in\nGuatemala (MINUGUA), as well as the other Secretariat\nofficials who, in one way or another, directly or\nindirectly, have contributed to the success of the peace\nprocess.\nOur deep gratitude goes also to the six countries that\nconstitute the Group of Friends of the peace process,\n6\n\n\nwhich have worked so doggedly for that long-sought\ngoal \u2014 Colombia, Mexico, Norway, Spain, the United\nStates of America and Venezuela.\nWe wish also to express our appreciation to other\nGovernments that, without being a formal part of this\nGroup, have substantially contributed to the advancement of\nour reconciliation and development. Many thanks to all\nthose persons of good will, committed to peace in my\ncountry.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset to express to Mr. Razali Ismail\nour sincere congratulations on his election as President of\nthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly. His rich\nexperience, wisdom and knowledge will definitely lead to\nthe success of our deliberations, which are taking place in\nvery delicate international circumstances. I assure him of\n15\n\n\nthe full support and assistance of my delegation in\ndischarging his task successfully.\nAllow me also to take this opportunity to express my\nsincere appreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Freitas\ndo Amaral, for his successful efforts in leading the work of\nthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\nThe international community had keenly hoped that\nthe post-cold-war era would result in an end to the tensions\nthat had characterized the international scene and to the\narms race and armed conflicts. All nations, particularly\nthose in the developing world, have aspirations to build a\nnew world order whose cornerstone would be equality\namong States, non-interference in their internal affairs,\ntransparency and respect for ideological, cultural and\nreligious diversity.\nAny observer of today\u2019s international scene would\nconclude that events are completely contrary to\nexpectations. Tensions have escalated, and political, military\nand economic threats are on the increase. Apparently,\nequality among States of sovereignty, rights and obligations\nno longer exists. Moreover, the nuclear threat still lingers\non, military conflicts have not ceased and ideological\nfanaticism and cultural hegemony have become the major\nfeatures of the new world order.\nThe Sudan is of the view that the structure of the\ninternational community, which is based on ideological,\npolitical and cultural diversity and pluralism, prompts us all\nto accept peaceful coexistence and dictates that harmony\nand diversity among nations become the vehicle for\ninteraction and dialogue within the framework of pursuing\nnational interests in the context of the international system.\nThe nations of the world expect the United Nations to\nbe a forum in which they can express their views and\npositions and an instrument for the continued pursuit of\nhumanity\u2019s aspirations to freedom, prosperity, peace and\nsecurity.\nIt is against that background that the call has sounded\nfor the reform of the United Nations system. True and\nsincere adherence to the spirit and letter of the Charter of\nthe United Nations, equality, respect for the sovereignty of\nMember States, non-interference in their internal affairs and\nrespect for their right to choose are the bases for\nstrengthening the United Nations and fostering its role,\ntransparency and democratization, so that it may meet the\nenormous challenges of maintaining international peace and\nsecurity and serving economic and social development.\nI should like to point out that my country has\nfollowed with satisfaction the positive reforms that have\nbeen undertaken by the Secretary-General. The Sudan\nsupports the position expressed by both the League of\nArab States and the Organization of African Unity\nendorsing the re-election of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali\nfor a second term.\nThe Sudan also welcomes General Assembly\nresolution 50/227 on the restructuring and revitalization of\nthe United Nations in the economic, social and related\nfields. On the other hand, it is imperative that a thorough\nreview of the Security Council take place to ensure its\ndemocratization and to allow for equitable representation\nby the developing countries, including permanent\nmembership. There is a strong need to review the work\nand procedures of the Security Council in order to\nachieve transparency and to enable all States to follow the\nformal and informal meetings of the Council. It is equally\nvital that the decision-making mechanism be corrected by\nestablishing just criteria to guide its policies and distance\nit from selectivity and double standards. In this context,\nthe veto concept must be reviewed and corrected so that\nthe principle of equality among Member States stipulated\nin the Charter of the United Nations may become a\nreality.\nFinally, the Security Council should discharge its\npolitical responsibilities without addressing legal issues,\nwhich fall within the jurisdiction of the International\nCourt of Justice, as stipulated in the Charter and the\nStatute of the Court. The Court must be enhanced to\nenable it to shoulder its responsibilities in handling legal\ndisputes among Member States.\nIn this connection, it is important to note the new\ntrend towards the imposition of sanctions against some\ncountries as a means of settling certain disputes, as has\nbeen witnessed recently. Such sanctions have adversely\naffected the people of those countries, particularly the\nvulnerable sectors of society, namely, women, children\nand the elderly, the very sectors that the United Nations\nhas pledged to protect and develop. It is therefore\nnecessary to reconsider the basis on which sanctions are\nimposed, the duration of such sanctions and the lifting of\nthem when the requirements have been met or when their\nimplications give rise to human suffering.\nThe ideal means for settling most recent conflicts is\nthrough strict compliance with the provisions for conflict\nresolution as stipulated in the Charter, the consolidation\nof cooperation among States, the encouragement of\n16\n\n\ndialogue and the fostering of international public opinion\nthrough common understanding. Therefore, my country\nwelcomes the endeavours designed to enhance preventive\ndiplomacy and its mechanisms in order to achieve these\ngoals.\nI wish now to touch upon some important international\nissues. We look forward to the success of the ongoing\nefforts of the countries of West Africa, under the leadership\nof our sister country, Nigeria, to ensure that the people of\nLiberia are able to achieve stability. We also hope that the\nefforts to end the conflict in Angola will stop the bloodshed\nand steer the country towards development. We also call on\nthe people of our sister country, Somalia, and the factions\nthere, to rise above their differences in order to preserve\nindependence and unity and resume their march towards\nprosperity and progress.\nWe also hope that Rwanda and Burundi will achieve\nstability, and that they will use diversity as an element of\nunity and strength. We call for the enhancement and\nsupport of the role of the Organization of African Unity in\nits efforts towards settlement of these conflicts. Africa, as\nthe continent of the future, needs the support of the\ninternational community so that it can achieve political\nstability and economic development, and contribute to\nestablishing a more just and stable international community.\nAs for the sanctions imposed on the Libyan people,\nwe fully support the Libyan initiatives, which are also\nsupported by the League of Arab States and the\nOrganization of African Unity, to put an end to the conflict\nbetween Libya and three Western countries. My country\nappeals to the international community to exert greater\nefforts to reach a final settlement to this dispute and to\nalleviate the suffering of the Libyan people by ending the\nembargo to which they are subjected.\nAs for the Middle East, Sudan believes that peace\nshould be built on the principles of justice and respect for\nthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the Arab\npeoples in the region, and that peace must also be based on\nthe commitments agreed to by the parties concerned. Any\nretreat from agreed obligations and commitments\ncontradicts a real desire to achieve peace.\nThe irresponsible practices of the occupying Power\nwill have serious repercussions for the peoples and\ncountries of the region, and will have a negative effect on\ninternational peace and security. Therefore, Sudan calls for\nthe immediate implementation of all relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions in order to achieve a just and\ncomprehensive peace on all tracks of the process. We\ndraw the attention of the international community to the\nprecarious situation in the region, the consequences of\ncontinued failure and the increasing possibilities of\nconfrontation, which make it necessary for the\ninternational community to be vigilant, dynamic and strict\nin implementing justice and the rule of law so as to save\nthe region from the potential scourge of war.\nWith regard to the Gulf region, we look forward to\nthe restoration of the peace and security that it enjoyed\nbefore to the war. The Sudan would like to reiterate the\nimportance of compliance with Security Council\nresolutions regarding the sovereignty and legitimate rights\nto existence of Kuwait, and the rights of its people and\nleadership with regard to security and stability. Similarly,\nwe reiterate the right of Iraq to sovereignty, territorial\nintegrity and independence. We call upon the international\ncommunity to lift the sanctions imposed on Iraq, which\nare causing suffering and starvation for the Iraqi people,\nand, in this respect, we call for the implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 986 (1995).\nWith regard to Europe, my country expresses its\nsatisfaction with the signing of the Dayton Agreement,\naimed at ending the suffering of the people of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. For several years their suffering caused\nanguish in the conscience of the international community.\nWe also express our heartfelt congratulations to President\nAlija Izetbegovic\u00b4 for gaining the people\u2019s confidence in\nhis leadership. We call upon the United Nations to work\nfor the full implementation of the Dayton Agreement, in\nparticular the prosecution of Serb leaders responsible for\nthe crimes of genocide, \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and other\nviolations of international law. We also call on the\ninternational community to provide the necessary\nassistance and resources for the reconstruction of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina.\nWith regard to Asia, we express our satisfaction with\nthe agreement reached between the Government of the\nPhilippines and the Moro National Liberation Front,\nwhich reflects the wisdom of both parties. In this context,\nwe commend the efforts of President Soeharto of\nIndonesia and his Foreign Minister, which culminated in\nthe agreement.\nSocial and economic development is the primary\nrequisite for political stability to deter the scourge of wars\nand conflicts. In this respect we express the deep concern\nof Africa, which calls for justice, an end to its\nmarginalization, and compensation for all the injustices\n17\n\n\ninflicted on it during the colonial era and for the inequities\nof the international economic order.\nThe majority of the least developed countries are in\nAfrica, and they need support and assistance. The debts of\nAfrican countries, which exceed $300 billion, have become\nthe main impediment to the ambitions of the continent to\nachieve development and to ensure the prosperity of its\npeoples. In most African countries debt-servicing costs\nexceed the gross national product and total export earnings.\nThe African countries have welcomed the World Bank\ninitiative to reduce the debt burden of the least developed\ncountries. Sudan believes that the effective solution of the\ndebt crisis requires agreement on a unified strategy, with\nthe aim of cancelling or reducing debts for all those\ncountries, without exception. We also call on the\ninternational community to provide the necessary financial\nsupport for the Secretary-General\u2019s Initiative for\ndevelopment in Africa.\nThe mid-term reviews of the Paris Programme of\nAction for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s and\nof the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\nAfrica in the 1990s have shown that pledges should be\nfollowed by action, not by more promises.\nIn the field of food security and the prevention of\nfamine, which are issues of primary concern to Africa and\nthe rest of the world, my country places high hopes on the\nforthcoming World Food Summit, which will take place at\nRome in November 1996, which will seek solutions for the\nproblem of food security throughout the world. Sudan,\nwhich is perceived to be one of the countries with the\npotential to play a considerable role in the production of\nfood, is ready to shoulder its responsibility, together with a\nserious contribution from the international community\ntowards that end.\nHuman rights issues have priority on the agenda of the\nUnited Nations. They receive the full support of my\ncountry, based on our conviction that human beings are the\nonly creatures that have been honoured and given\nresponsibility by Almighty God, and on our commitment to\nhuman rights covenants.\nHowever, we disagree with the growing tendency to\nexploit human rights issues to serve the political interests of\ncertain circles, in a manner that jeopardizes the principles\nof human rights. Selectivity does not serve the cause of\nhuman rights as well as objectivity and comprehensiveness;\nconfrontation and condemnation do not support human\nrights as well as cooperation, conviction and\nencouragement.\nIn line with this understanding, my country has\nestablished the Advisory Council for Human Rights, to\nprotect human rights and investigate all accusations and\ncomplaints in this regard. The Sudan also resumed its\ncooperation with the Special Rapporteur on human rights\nafter the causes of our withdrawal of cooperation had\nbeen removed. We reiterate here our commitment to\ncooperation on this matter, in accordance with the\nprinciples of objectivity, transparency and respect for\ncultural diversity and pluralism. This last principle\nprompts me to refer to the attack on Islam, which\nportrays it as barbaric and links it to terrorism. These\nmalicious allegations are unjust; Islam is completely\ninnocent. They contravene the principle of respect for all\nreligions without exception. Wrong practices do not\nconstitute evidence to justify negative judgements on the\nreligious beliefs of those who perpetrate them. Such\ntrends make all religions and philosophies susceptible to\ncondemnation, regardless of their sources or origins.\nIslam is the religion of tolerance and coexistence.\nWe therefore call upon the international community to\nstop this ferocious campaign targeting Islam, and call\nupon the United Nations to distance itself from it. We\nhope that the positive positions of a number of Western\nleaders towards Islam will be echoed by the communities\nin the West, their mass media and their justice systems.\nI deem it necessary, in addressing the Assembly, to\nshed light on some important political developments in\nmy country. I hope members will listen attentively to\nwhat I am about to say and will open their hearts while\nI touch on the circumstances that surrounded the adoption\nof Security Council resolutions 1044 (1996), 1054 (1996)\nand 1070 (1996), respectively, against my country.\nFirst, it has been proven that 11 Egyptians were the\norganizers and perpetrators of the attempt that was the\nsubject of these resolutions.\nSecond, prior to the incident the suspects had been\nmoving in a number of Arab, African and Asian\ncountries. The Sudan was but one of these countries.\nThird, the Security Council has based its resolutions\non the statement of the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management\nand Resolution, which called upon the Sudan to look for,\nlocate and extradite the suspects if \u2014 and I underline\n18\n\n\nif \u2014 they were found in the Sudan. This was stipulated in\nthe Mechanism\u2019s decision of 19 December 1995.\nFourth, those resolutions were based on the\nassumption that the three suspects, who are Egyptians, were\nin the Sudan at the time the other members of the group\nentered Addis Ababa from other countries, several months\nbefore the incident.\nFifth \u2014 and this I would underline \u2014 no evidence\nwas produced to prove that the suspects were in the Sudan\nat the time the incident took place or at the time the Sudan\nwas asked to hand over the suspects, which request was\nreceived more than a month after the incident.\nSixth, a secret trial was conducted for the three\nsuspects, who were sentenced to death. Concerned States\nand observers were never allowed to witness the trial.\nSeventh, the Sudan has unequivocally condemned this\nincident since day one, and it has expressed its readiness to\ncooperate with the concerned parties.\nEighth, the Sudan received the first request to arrest\nthe suspects 32 days after the incident. The request did not\nprovide sufficient information about the suspects.\nNinth, the competent Sudanese authorities conducted\nexhaustive and complete investigations, but these did not\nyield any information or prove the presence of the suspects\non Sudanese territory.\nTenth, though the Sudan has time and again requested\nthe cooperation of concerned countries and of the\nInternational Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) in\nthis regard, its efforts have been in vain.\nEleventh, it has been proven that the first suspect is in\nAfghanistan. An official document confirming that fact was\nsubmitted to the Security Council by the Afghan\nGovernment. Moreover, in statements to the press, the first\nsuspect claimed full responsibility for the incident and\nconfirmed that he has not entered the Sudan since 1994.\nTwelfth, the Sudan reiterates its full readiness to\ncooperate with all parties concerned, and it emphasizes that\nall available evidence indicates that the suspects are not\npresent on Sudanese territory.\nTo insist on imposing sanctions on the Sudan defies\nlogic and justice. This must be reconsidered in order to\nredress the injustice inflicted on my country and to alleviate\nthe negative impact of this recurrent series of sanctions,\nwhich could cause massive human suffering to innocent\npeople.\nAs we stated before the Assembly last year, we\nreiterate our condemnation of terrorism in all its forms\nand manifestations. We reaffirm our readiness to\ncooperate and to participate effectively in efforts to\ncombat terrorism. We are actively involved in this matter\nat regional levels, in particular within the framework of\nthe League of Arab States. We reiterate our commitment\nto contribute to the establishment of more secure, stable\nand just international relations.\nThe Sudan has witnessed a number of internal\npolitical developments this year. Parliamentary elections\nwere held, followed by a presidential election by direct\nballoting. All Sudanese citizens exercised their democratic\nright in a free and fair election monitored by\nrepresentatives of friendly countries and international and\nregional bodies.\nThe genuine efforts my Government has exerted\ntirelessly in recent years have culminated in the signing\nof a political charter between the Government and two\nimportant rebel factions. In response to the signing of the\npolitical charter, other rebel factions joined the peace\nprocess, most recently the SPLA, the Popular Movement\nfor Peace and the Popular Movement for the Liberation\nof the Sudan.\nWhile our charter affirms that shariah and are the\nmain sources of legislation in the country, it allows States\nto promulgate complementary legislation compatible with\ntheir needs. We in the Sudan recognize cultural diversity.\nIn accordance with our charter, freedom of religious\nbelief and the prohibition of forceful conversion to any\nreligion or faith are fully granted. We also recognize\npluralism. Accordingly, we guarantee the right to religion\nand belief. No one can be forced to accept any religious\nbelief.\nThe Charter ensures the fair distribution of resources\nand power-sharing among citizens. It also calls for the\nestablishment of a coordination council for the southern\nstates in order to contribute to the implementation of the\nprovisions stipulating the holding of a comprehensive\nreferendum among the citizens of southern Sudan after an\ninterim period, the length of which has yet to be\nnegotiated.\n19\n\n\nRelentless efforts are being made in order to reach a\nsettlement with the faction that has thus far remained\noutside of the peace process. Consultations and coordination\nare currently under way with the concerned parties, in\nparticular with the countries of the region represented in the\nInter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development\n(IGADD).\nThe Sudan welcomes and appreciates the contribution\nby friendly countries towards our sincere and genuine\nsearch for lasting peace in our country. I am pleased to\ninform members of the Khartoum agreement, signed\nbetween the Sudan and Uganda through the kind and much\nappreciated mediation of the Islamic Republic of Iran. This\nagreement was further strengthened by the conclusion in\nTehran last week of an agreement on a verification\nmechanism for the implementation of the agreement, with\nthe participation of Iran and Malawi.\nAt this juncture, as I speak of Sudan\u2019s greatest and\nmost urgent priority \u2014 peace \u2014 I wish to pay tribute to\nthe intensive intellectual efforts being exerted by the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO), within its specific mandate in the United\nNations system and by all ways and means available to it,\nto establish a culture of peace. This is based on the\nconstruction in the minds of men in defence of peace, as\nstipulated in the preamble of UNESCO\u2019s statute.\nMy Government has fully cooperated with UNESCO\nin the promotion of the noble objectives of this programme.\nWe did so notably through our contribution to the 1995\nBarcelona conference and to the follow-up seminar in the\nNetherlands in May 1996. We sincerely hope that such\ndialogue will continue, with a view to creating an\nenvironment conducive to achieving a comprehensive\npeace.\nFor more than three decades, my country has hosted\nover a million refugees from neighbouring countries as a\nresult of the unstable security situation in those countries.\nWe have provided them security and stability as well as\neducational, health and other essential services. In the\nframework of solving the refugee problem through\nvoluntary repatriation, the Sudan has cooperated with the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR) and other concerned countries, and has\nsigned tripartite agreements for the repatriation of the\nrefugees from some of those countries. We hope to reach\nsimilar agreements concerning the rest of the refugees, thus\nguaranteeing their repatriation in dignity.\nWe call upon the international community to share\nthis burden with the Government of the Sudan. As the\nSudan is experiencing severe economic difficulties, the\nresources allocated to refugee programmes have\ndiminished considerably. This has resulted in severe\npressures on Sudan\u2019s public sector, since the refugees\nshare food and services with Sudanese citizens.\nAware of its responsibilities towards its people, the\nSudan has sought to deliver food and other relief\nassistance to its war-affected populations throughout the\ncountry, including in areas controlled by the rebels.\nBased on this understanding, the Sudan initiated the\nidea of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) and has\nconsistently urged its implementation in cooperation with\nthe United Nations. A number of General Assembly\nresolutions have commended the full cooperation between\nthe Sudan and the United Nations in this Operation. The\npractical implementation of OLS has yielded a number of\nimportant observations, which we will submit to the\nreview meeting scheduled this month in the hope of an\nadequate response. We urge and hope that the next phase\nof OLS will see a fairer distribution of relief supplies and\nthat it will contribute further towards the development and\nrehabilitation process, thus promoting an environment\nconducive to peace and stability.\nIn spite of these observations, I should like to\nexpress the full commitment of the Government of the\nSudan to cooperation with the United Nations in the\nimplementation of the objectives of Operation Lifeline\nSudan in accordance with the principles of neutrality,\ntransparency and respect for the sovereignty of my\ncountry.\nAs mankind approaches the dawn of the new\ncentury, we hope that the United Nations will be its\nvehicle and bridge to a world in which hope, peace and\njustice will prevail. Let us unite our wills and harmonize\nour ideals towards the achievement of this noble\nobjective.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of my\ndelegation, and on my own behalf, I wish to congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your unanimous election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. I am convinced\nthat your qualities of a gifted diplomat devoted to the cause\nof peace and understanding among peoples will ensure a\nsuccessful outcome of our deliberations. I pledge my\ndelegation\u2019s full support as you discharge your noble\nresponsibilities.\nI would like to seize this opportunity to commend the\nbrilliant manner in which your predecessor, Mr. Freitas do\nAmaral of Portugal, presided over the proceedings of the\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly.\nLet me also pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for\nhis continued contribution and personal commitment to the\nideals of international peace and security.\nWe celebrate today the fourth anniversary of the\nestablishment of a peaceful Mozambique after a long period\nof uncertainty in our history. It has been a period of great\nchallenges and sacrifices, but also of great excitement for\nall Mozambicans. With peace, we are gradually healing the\nwounds caused by the war and our young multi-party\ndemocracy is flourishing and consolidating its roots. The\nAssembly of the Republic, our Parliament, has been\nmeeting regularly, symbolizing our collective desire to work\ntogether for the consolidation of peace, national\nreconstruction and democracy. Similarly, efforts are being\nmade to implement the Government\u2019s five-year programme,\nin which the reduction of absolute poverty, with emphasis\non education, health, rural development and job creation,\ncontinues to be our major objective.\nAt the same time, preparations are being made with\na view to beginning next year the holding of municipal\nelections, thus complementing the process initiated in\n1994 with the holding of the first multi-party general and\npresidential elections. In view of financial and other\nconstraints, the Government anticipates that municipal\nelections will take place on a gradual basis. However, the\nfinal decision will be made by the Assembly of the\nRepublic itself, following the completion of the ongoing\ndebate on the subject.\nWhat is important in our view is that elections take\nplace, for they represent an opportunity for the people to\nchoose their local representatives, identify and solve local\nproblems and define their own needs and priorities. The\nGovernment is also addressing, as a matter of urgency,\nthe establishment and strengthening of all the different\ntribunals envisaged in the Constitution, with a view to\nenabling the normal functioning of the judiciary system as\nan important step forward in the efforts to strengthen the\nrule of law, democracy and respect for individual rights\nand freedoms.\nFurthermore, we continue to be fully committed to\nensuring public safety and security. To this end, my\nGovernment has recently submitted to donor countries a\nproject proposal in order to begin the process of\nupgrading the technical capacity of the police, thus\nenabling that institution to deal more effectively with\ncrime prevention, control and other challenges. These\ninclude continuing the search for and destruction of arms\nthroughout the country and dealing with transnational\ncrimes, particularly drug trafficking and money\nlaundering.\nFurthermore, demining continues to be one of my\nGovernment\u2019s top priorities. For us, demining is not an\nend per se. Rather, it is a process which we regard as an\nintegral part of the overall national development process.\nWhere possible, it has been our policy to stimulate the\nlaunching of agricultural production and related activities\nonce demining is completed. However, given the\nmagnitude of the land-mine issue in Mozambique,\nresulting from many years of conflict, additional resources\nare needed effectively to address this problem in the years\nahead, in particular within the framework of strengthening\nthe national capacity for demining.\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to express my\ngratitude to all those countries and organizations which\nhave contributed to the demining programme in\nMozambique. We look forward to continuing work\n9\n\n\ntogether with a view to eliminating these horrible weapons\nnot only in Mozambique, but also in all countries affected\nby this evil. Accordingly, and in line with my last year\u2019s\nstatement before this Assembly, my Government reiterate\nsits full support to the call for an international agreement\nagainst the production, stockpiling and use of anti-personal\nland-mines.\nRecently, my Government and the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)\nconcluded the repatriation and resettlement of Mozambican\ncitizens who had sought refuge in neighbouring countries\nduring the armed conflict. This programme, initiated as a\nresult of a memorandum of understanding signed in March\n1993 with UNHCR and subsequent agreements, has been\nregarded as one of the biggest and most successful\nrepatriation programmes ever undertaken by UNHCR.\nThanks to this programme, around 1.7 million\nMozambicans have safely and voluntarily returned to their\nplaces of origin. We are now proud to say that there are no\nmore Mozambicans living abroad as refugees.\nHowever, the challenges before us are immense. We\nare aware of the difficulties facing this segment of our\npopulation and the long road still ahead before we can\ndeclare them economically safe and ready to live on their\nown. This is where the assistance of the international\ncommunity is most needed and appreciated.\nWith the end of the repatriation process and the\nresettlement of these populations, there has been significant\nprogress in agricultural production. As a matter of fact,\nrecorded agricultural output in certain areas of Mozambique\nthis year is the highest since independence. The main\nproblem we face now is that of the financial capacity to\nbuy and store adequately the surplus of this production. We\nneed support to build warehouses within the framework of\nthe food security programme.\nLike many other developing countries, Mozambique\nhas been undergoing a structural adjustment programme\nsince 1987. The core objectives of the programme were,\ninter alia, to create and adjust the country\u2019s macroeconomic\npolicy, ensure a correct legal and regulatory framework for\nthe development of a strong market economy, provide a\ntransparent and accountable policy framework aimed at\npromoting investment, allocate adequate budgetary\nresources for social programmes, create the necessary\nconditions for the establishment and consolidation of\ndemocratic institutions and support good governance and\npolitical stability.\nAfter almost 10 years of implementation of this\nprogramme under the most adverse conditions, some\nprogress has been achieved. Nevertheless, the overall\nobjectives, including specifically the upgrading of the\nliving standards of the population, are still far from being\nachieved. In some cases living standards of working\npeople have, in fact, deteriorated in recent years, which\nmay erode the political support needed for the\ncontinuation of the reforms.\nAs of next year, Mozambique will have to start\nmeeting its debt-servicing obligations to multilateral\ninstitutions, as this category of debt has not been eligible\nfor rescheduling so far. The debt burden, coupled with\nvery restrictive monetary policies and related measures\npursued in connection with the structural adjustment\nprogramme, will certainly have a serious negative impact\non the performance of the national economy. Unless\nmeasures are taken to address this situation, it will be\nvery difficult for the country to sustain the envisaged\npolitical, economic and social targets required to uplift the\nliving standards of the people. The situation of my\ncountry\u2019s indebtedness is a critical one, indeed, as it has\nincreased by about six per cent during the last two years.\nIn 1994, debt servicing alone absorbed about 93 per cent\nof the country\u2019s total export earnings and represented\nabout 28.6 per cent of gross domestic product. This\nscenario is likely to remain, under the prevailing\ncircumstances, for the next few years. Therefore, my\nGovernment supports the view that a comprehensive\neffort should be made to effectively address the external\nindebtedness of developing countries, in particular the\nleast developed countries undertaking painful structural\nadjustment programmes and whose growth prospects\ncontinue to be severely undermined by this burden.\nIn order to address official bilateral debt problems,\nthe Naples Terms, adopted by the Paris Club, in favour of\nthe poorest and most indebted countries should be\nexpeditiously implemented. At the same time, we believe\nnon-Paris Club creditors which have not done so should\nalso consider taking appropriate relief measures to\nalleviate the suffering of debtor nations. Measures\nannounced at the recently held Lyon Summit could not\nhave been more timely. We look forward to welcoming\ntheir early implementation.\nAs I speak on this subject, I would like to launch an\nemphatic appeal for a closer partnership between debtors\n10\n\n\nand creditors. We have recently been pleased to note that,\nat the political level, there appears to be a growing\nunderstanding of developing countries\u2019 concerns over the\nissue of the external debt crisis. We would therefore be\ndeeply appreciative if this understanding were translated\ninto tangible results and if the subsequent technical\ndiscussions held following political consultations were\nmuch more fruitful. Regrettably, this has not always been\nthe case. A comprehensive approach to assist least\ndeveloped countries through a flexible implementation of\nexisting instruments and through finding new mechanisms,\nis necessary. These include improvements in capital and\ninvestment flows and an increase in real terms of the\nofficial development assistance to least developed countries,\nparticularly in Africa.\nTo this end, we call upon donor countries,\ninternational financial institutions and United Nations\norgans and specialized agencies to effectively participate in\nthe implementation of the Programme of Action for the\nleast developed countries for the 1990s, the mid-term\nreview of which was held in September last year.\nSimilarly, my delegation welcomes the recently\nlaunched United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on\nAfrica, for it brings a new impetus to the international\ncommunity\u2019s awareness of the necessity to bring about a\nmeaningful solution to African problems. Additional efforts\nshould be made to prevent repetition of past experiences\nduring the implementation of similar important initiatives,\nby ensuring a successful implementation of this one. The\nrecent mid-term review of the United Nations New Agenda\nfor the Development of Africa has highlighted the positive\nchanges made in the right direction during the last few\nyears on the African continent. These trends should be\nsupported and encouraged by the international community.\nIn this regard, my Government hopes that the report\nbeing prepared by a group of experts led by Ms. Gra\u00e7a\nMachel, in conformity with the General Assembly\nresolution 48/157 of 20 December 1993, will contribute\nsignificantly to drawing the international community\u2019s\nattention on the fate of children victimized by armed\nconflicts in the world, particularly, in Africa.\nThe current session of the General Assembly offers a\nunique opportunity for a collective review of the issue of\nconflict resolution in many parts of the world. With respect\nto Angola, the recent summit of the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC) organ on politics,\ndefence and security has expressed concern over the slow\nprogress and apparent stalemate in the implementation of\nthe Lusaka Protocol. The summit expressed, inter alia,\ndeep regret over the absence of the Uni\u00e3o Nacional para\na Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola (UNITA) from the\nmeeting and made a strong appeal to UNITA to fulfil its\ncommitment within the deadline established by the\nLusaka Protocol and those of Security Council resolution\n864 (1993).\nMozambique, along with other SADC countries, is\nmaking its contribution to the smooth progress of this\ndelicate process. The settlement of the conflict in Angola\nwill contribute decisively to the materialization of\nstrategic goals set forth by SADC and allow our region to\nembark on the process of regional integration and to\ndedicate our efforts to the well-being of our peoples.\nWithin the recently created Lusophone Community,\nor Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, we are\nalso working hard to encourage the peace process in\nAngola. In doing so, we aim to consolidate the historic\nand cultural ties which unite the seven countries that have\nPortuguese as their official language, thus creating the\nnecessary conditions for a more fruitful cooperation\namong them.\nWe are encouraged by the recent progress in Sierra\nLeone and Rwanda and look forward to a positive\noutcome of the crises in those countries. However, we\nremain concerned at the prevailing volatile situations in\nBurundi, Liberia and Somalia. We welcome all initiatives\naimed at finding the needed political settlement of the\ncrises in these African countries.\nThe recurrence of such long-lasting conflicts remains\na serious challenge to the international community as a\nwhole and also to the efforts within the framework of the\nrecently established Organization of African Unity (OAU)\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\nResolution. My delegation wishes to commend all the\ncountries that have lent their support to the functioning of\nthe Mechanism, thus enabling Africans to take a much\nmore active role in searching for solutions to the conflicts\non their continent.\nThe recent outbreak of violence in the Middle East\nis a matter of grave concern to my delegation. This\nviolence, if not averted urgently, will be a serious setback\nto the commendable progress made in the quest for a\npolitical settlement to the long-standing conflict in that\nregion. We call upon all the parties concerned to exercise\nmaximum restraint and to display the needed political\nmaturity in the implementation of the mutually agreed\n\n\n\ncommitments in the interest of all the peoples of the region.\nIn this connection, we are encouraged by the dialogue\ninitiated in the recent summit in Washington between the\nPrime Minister of Israel and the President of the Palestinian\nAuthority with a view to putting an end to violence and\nresuming the peace process.\nWe have also followed the developments regarding the\nissue of East Timor. In making an assessment of the\nprogress made so far, one cannot fail to register\ndisappointment over the slow pace of talks between\nIndonesia and Portugal. Nevertheless, my delegation wishes\nto encourage both countries to assume their responsibilities\nwith more vigour, with a view to finding a just,\ncomprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to\nthis issue, bearing in mind the need to allow the people of\nEast Timor an opportunity to exercise their political rights,\nincluding the right to self-determination.\nTime and again, virtually all Member States have\nemphasized the critical need to undertake reforms within\nthe United Nations so as to ensure greater effectiveness in\nits work and to fulfil the sacrosanct principles enshrined in\nits Charter. The needed reforms within our Organization\nshould not be regarded as an end in themselves. They\nshould, inter alia, pave the way for the active and global\nparticipation of the developing countries, particularly the\nleast developed countries, in the work and procedures of the\nUnited Nations, including the Economic and Social Council,\nbearing in mind the shared responsibilities of these\ncountries in the economic and social challenges facing\ntoday\u2019s world.\nIn this reform process, the strengthening of the United\nNations system, which does not necessarily mean\ndownsizing, is of paramount importance. The revitalization\nof the role of the Economic and Social Council is long\noverdue to allow better coordination and effective and\nefficient management of the funds, programmes and\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations system. Reforms\nshould also reflect the dynamics of international relations\nand the growing need for enhanced democracy, equitable\ngeographic representation and the changes in the\ncomposition of its membership since the establishment of\nthe United Nations 51 years ago. Above all, they should\nensure the needed legitimacy, transparency and efficiency\nof its decisions.\nIn this connection, my delegation shares the\nfrustrations expressed by a number of delegations regarding\nthe lack of tangible progress within the Open-ended\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\nSecurity Council and other matters related to the Security\nCouncil. Since the beginning of its procedures, important\nand interesting ideas have been advanced in this regard.\nTherefore, nobody can deny the arguments calling for an\nexpansion of that body. Lack of progress on the\nenlargement of the Security Council will only undermine\nthe ability of the United Nations to discharge fully its\nobligations and limit the confidence of international\npublic opinion on the future of our Organization. It is\nonly by addressing the issue of enlargement and by each\none\u2019s fulfilling its financial obligations that we can\nreaffirm our commitment to the purposes and principles\nof the Charter and expect a well-functioning and dynamic\nUnited Nations ready to face the challenges of the next\ncentury. What is necessary is a genuine political will to\nchange the status quo, which has favoured a limited\nnumber of Member States to the detriment of the\nlegitimate interests of the vast majority of its membership.\nIn its 51 years of existence the United Nations,\ndespite numerous difficulties during this period, has been\nable to achieve its crucial objective of halting the\nemergence of a third world war. Therefore, it must be\nallowed to continue to preserve the gains already achieved\nand draw lessons from mistakes of the past so as to\nensure the feasibility of its mandate, as we approach the\ntwenty-first century, in the maintenance of international\npeace and security, in monitoring the implementation of\nimportant decisions taken in the economic, social and\nenvironmental fields and in playing a more dynamic role\nin the quest for the development of our countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt\ngives me pleasure, Sir, to extend to you our sincere\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. We are\nconfident that you will lead the work of the Assembly to\nsuccess. I cannot fail to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, for his\nleadership during the Assembly\u2019s historic fiftieth session.\nI would also like to express our appreciation to\nHis Excellency the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for his tireless efforts in the service of the\npurposes of the United Nations in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and the achievement of\nits lofty ideals.\nA series of internal conflicts and explosive situations\nhas threatened certain States. The world faces ethnic\nextremism and national conflicts caused by mass\nmigrations, flows of refugees, environment deterioration\nand natural disasters. Such problems have not been met\nwith the rapid economic and political changes that would\nform the cornerstone of the new international order to\nwhich the whole world aspires. A complete vision of that\norder, its rules and means, has not yet materialized. We\nshould all work towards an international system that is\njust, balanced and comprehensive.\nThe vital and effective role played by the United\nNations in dealing with international issues, in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security and in\nother areas, the value of which cannot be denied or\nunderestimated for the establishment of the principles of\nthat international system, requires reform of the United\nNations if we are to achieve the desired results. Reform\nshould begin with reactivating the General Assembly to\n\n\nenable it to act effectively in a manner that would enhance\nits credibility in the eyes of world public opinion.\nWe have also mentioned the need to reform the\nSecurity Council and increase its effectiveness in a manner\nthat would reflect the geographic, economic and political\nsituation of certain States, in a manner that would reflect\nthe new international order, and would equip the Council to\nbear its heavy responsibilities.\nThe task of maintaining international peace and\nsecurity is particularly important at a time of international\nchange; the international community should take steps to\ndeploy early preventive measures, since this is the best way\nto avoid the eruption and conflagration of conflicts, instead\nof resorting to political or military measures to end them,\nwhich can only lead to incomplete and unjust solutions.\nTherefore, it is important to reiterate the vital and effective\nrole that could be played by regional organizations in the\ncontext of the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter.\nCooperation between the United Nations and other\nregional organizations such as the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe, the Organization of African\nUnity, the League of Arab States and the Organization of\nthe Islamic Conference should be promoted, since\npreventive diplomacy and early warning are the best way to\nprevent conflicts from erupting and to find peaceful\nsolutions.\nThe question of disarmament is of great importance in\nterms of the establishment of international peace and\nsecurity. It can be achieved only by curbing the arms race\nand, in particular, the race in weapons of mass destruction.\nWe believe that the indefinite extension of the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) requires\nmore support and ratification by all States to give the\nTreaty a global character. The State of Qatar reaffirms the\nneed for Israel to join the NPT and to place its nuclear\nfacilities under the safeguards system of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency as an initial step towards\nestablishing a Middle East free from nuclear weapons and\nweapons of mass destruction. We believe that the interests\nof the stability and security of the region should compel\nIsrael to do this.\nThe State of Qatar, on the basis of the wise approach\nof His Royal Highness, Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-\nThani, reaffirms its regional and international commitments\nand undertakes to work through international and regional\norganizations to promote international peace and security.\nWe associate ourselves with our brothers in the Gulf\nCooperation Council and other friendly States in the quest\nto promote peace and security in the Gulf region, due to\nits vital importance to the whole world. We are also\nmaking tireless efforts to establish friendly and\nconstructive relations with all States of the region, based\non good-neighbourliness, mutual respect, non-interference\nin the internal affairs of other States, respect for\nlegitimacy and the solution of conflicts through dialogue,\nmediation or international law through the International\nCourt of Justice.\nOn the basis of this principle, we support the attempt\nto find such a solution to the dispute between the United\nArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran on the\nislands of Abu Musa and Lesser and Greater Tunb. We\nhave expressed our great satisfaction at the agreement\nsigned between the Republic of Yemen and Eritrea in\nParis last month regarding the peaceful settlement of the\ndispute over Greater Hanish through international\nmediation and arbitration, peacefully and in accordance\nwith the Charter of the United Nations and international\nlaw, in a manner that will serve the security and stability\nof the Red Sea region and promote bilateral relations,\ngood-neighbourliness and common interests between those\ntwo countries and bolster international peace and security.\nAt the same time, we would like to express our\nappreciation to the friendly Government of France for its\nefforts towards a peaceful settlement of this dispute.\nThe State of Qatar has expressed its brotherly\nfeelings and sympathy with the people of Iraq, who are\nliving under extremely difficult conditions due to the\nsanctions imposed on them. On the basis of that, we have\nwelcomed the oil-for-food agreement between Iraq and\nthe United Nations regarding the application of Security\nCouncil resolution 986 (1995), since this would mitigate\nthe suffering of the Iraqi people and enable them to meet\ntheir need for food and medication. We call upon the\nUnited Nations to create the conditions necessary for\nimplementation of that resolution.\nWe would also like to reaffirm our commitment to\nthe unity and territorial integrity of Iraq, and the principle\nof non-interference in its internal affairs. Yet at the same\ntime, Iraq is required fully to implement all Security\nCouncil resolutions, which should stay within the context\nof international legitimacy and the norms of international\nlaw.\nWe express our great concern at the suffering of the\npeople of Libya due to the sanctions imposed on them.\n2\n\n\nWe associate ourselves in this regard with many other\nMember States regarding the approach followed in the\nimplementation of the sanctions, and we call for the\ncreation of necessary guarantees for the equitable\napplication of the sanctions so that international interests\nare safeguarded and the suffering of the people as a result\nof the sanctions is alleviated.\nThe State of Qatar has worked to promote the\nachievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in\nthe Middle East. We therefore took part in the Arab\nSummit Conference in Cairo in June 1996, when Arab\nleaders reaffirmed that the achievement of peace requires\nfull Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Palestinian\nterritories, including Arab Jerusalem, conditions for the\nPalestinians to establish an independent State of its own\nwith Jerusalem as its capital, and the full and unconditional\nwithdrawal of Israeli forces from the Syrian Golan and\nsouthern Lebanon pursuant to Security Council resolutions\n242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1975) and in accordance\nwith the principle of land for peace accepted by the Arabs\nand by Israel as a serious basis for peace in the Middle\nEast.\nFrom this rostrum, we would like to call upon the new\nIsraeli Government to continue its efforts to ensure a\nsuccessful peace process in the Middle East and to take\naccount of United Nations resolutions, especially those that\nwere the background of the Madrid Conference, and the\nprinciple of land for peace, in accordance with agreements\nalready reached. We would like the Israeli Government to\nreconsider its position in order to give momentum to the\npeace process, to establish conditions conducive to\ncooperation among the peoples of the region and to achieve\na lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.\nWe call upon the two co-sponsors of the peace process\nand the international community in its entirety to support\nthe peace process while at the same time providing the\nnecessary economic and political assistance to the\nPalestinian people and the Palestinian Authority.\nThe State of Qatar expresses its deep concern at\nIsrael\u2019s continued confiscation of Palestinian territories, the\nestablishment of settlements in the occupied Arab territories\nand the bringing in of settlers in violation of international\ndecisions, the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention\nrelative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of\nWar and the provisions adopted at the Madrid Conference.\nThese settler activities in the Syrian Golan, the\noccupied Palestinian territories and Arab Jerusalem should\ncease without delay. We would also like to reiterate our\nrejection of any attempt to change the demographic\ncharacter of the Arab city of Jerusalem or its legal status,\nspecifically its geographic and geopolitical status before\n4 June 1967. We call upon the international community\nto guarantee Israel\u2019s implementation of binding\ninternational resolutions regarding Jerusalem, in particular\nSecurity Council resolution 252 (1968), since the\nestablishment of a comprehensive and just peace in the\nMiddle East cannot be achieved without solving the issue\nof Arab Jerusalem and the problems of the Palestinian\nrefugees, who should be granted the right to return in\naccordance with binding international decisions and the\nresolutions of the United Nations.\nQatar believes that the process of establishing\ncomprehensive and just peace in the region is the only\nstrategic option and that the decision of the Israeli\nGovernment to open a tunnel adjacent to Al-Aqsa Al-\nSharif is a violation and desecration of sacred Islamic\nsites and a provocation of Arabs and Muslims all over the\nworld. It runs counter to the peace process, is a violation\nof the Fourth Geneva Convention and threatens to freeze\nthe peace process and return the region to tension and\nviolence.\nFrom this rostrum, we call upon the co-sponsors of\nthe peace process and the international community to put\na speedy end to Israeli actions against the Palestinians in\nthe occupied territories in order to safeguard the rights of\nthe Palestinian people. We furthermore call upon all\nparties to continue negotiations and implement all the\nprovisions of the agreements reached so far. We look\nforward to a successful conclusion of the Washington\nmeeting and to tangible measures that would lead to the\npermanent closing of the tunnel and the immediate\nwithdrawal of Israeli forces from Palestinian areas.\nThe Middle East region and the whole world have\nsuffered greatly from terrorism. We condemn terrorism in\nall its forms and have always supported international\nefforts to deal with this phenomenon. We are committed\nto promoting all initiatives to convene an international\nconference on this problem. Our participation in the\nSharm el-Sheikh Conference was yet another testimony to\nour interest in this issue. However, we would like to\nreiterate that resisting occupation and aggression should\nnot be stigmatized as terrorism, since it is done in defence\nof international rights.\nWe pay tribute to the people of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, who have defended their entity and their\n3\n\n\nhonourable ideals of tolerance and justice through more\nthan four years of aggression and genocide. We reiterate\nour commitment to the unity of the territory of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, and to its sovereignty within its\ninternationally recognized borders. We likewise call upon\nall parties to completely implement the provisions of the\nDayton Agreement and make efforts to bring war criminals\nto justice.\nThe State of Qatar welcomes the agreement reached to\nput an end to the bloodshed in Chechnya, and we hope that\nthe parties concerned will work for the establishment of\npeace and security in that region.\nDevelopments in the world economy and the new\nprospects they offer, starting with the signing of the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO),\nrequire further measures to help fragile economies to\ndevelop and to give momentum to the global economy.\nIt is important therefore to reconsider the issues of\nthe cost of weapons and the settlement of disputes by\npeaceful means, such as preventive diplomacy and the\nprovision of the necessary material and human resources.\nThe costs saved in this manner must be rechannelled to\nassist developing countries to bolster their economies and\nraise the living standards of their citizens. Assistance from\ndeveloped and rich countries should be used to combat\npoverty and underdevelopment.\nThe issues of poverty, underdevelopment and\ndeprivation also threaten the environment. The\noverpopulation of our world has been a constant threat for\nmany years and can only lead to a deterioration of the\nenvironment and to the spread of poverty in many countries\nof the world. Huge resources are squandered on non-\nessentials that cannot help to bridge the gap between rich\nand poor countries. The situation is getting more serious\nevery day, and we should all be aware that a solution to\nthese problems requires a reconsideration of the\nsquandering of these resources in ways that do not alleviate\nhuman suffering or even meet human needs in poor\ncountries all over the world. Developed countries and\ninternational organizations should bear the responsibility in\nfinding the proper solutions to these problems to raise the\nstandard of living of poor peoples. The new world order\nshould not add to suffering and poverty in poor countries.\nWe reaffirm our confidence in the United Nations and\nour support for this unique international institution that\nbears the responsibility of dealing with grave humanitarian,\nsocial, economic and political problems and that attempts\nto find effective solutions to these problems in accordance\nwith the high ideals contained in the Charter for the\nestablishment of a peaceful, secure and prosperous world\nin which cooperation should prevail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThree years ago I had the honour\nof being the first American President born after the\nfounding of the United Nations to address the General\nAssembly. In its fifty-first year, the United Nations has not\nyet realized all its founders\u2019 aspirations. But the ideals of\nthe United Nations Charter \u2014 peace, freedom, tolerance\nand prosperity \u2014 now touch more people in more nations\nthan ever before.\nNow we find ourselves at a turning point in history\nwhen the blocs and barriers that long defined the world are\ngiving way to an age of remarkable possibility \u2014 a time\nwhen more of our children and more nations will be able to\nlive out their dreams than ever before. But this is also an\nage of new threats \u2014 threats from terrorists, from rogue\nStates that support them, threats from ethnic, religious,\nracial and tribal hatreds, threats from international\ncriminals and drug traffickers \u2014 all of whom will be\nmore dangerous if they gain access to weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nThe challenge before us, plainly, is twofold: to seize\nthe new opportunities for more people to enjoy peace and\nfreedom, security and prosperity and to move strongly\nand swiftly against the dangers that change has produced.\nThis week and in this place, we take a giant step\nforward. By overwhelming global consensus, we will\nmake a solemn commitment to end all nuclear tests for all\ntime.\nBefore entering this Hall, I had the great honour to\nbe the first leader to sign the Comprehensive Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT). I did so, with some pride, with this pen,\nfor this pen is the very one that President Kennedy used\nto help bring the limited test-ban Treaty to life 33 years\nago.\nThis Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty will help\nprevent the nuclear Powers from developing more\nadvanced and more dangerous weapons. It will limit the\nability of other States to acquire such devices themselves.\nIt points us towards a century in which the roles and risks\nof nuclear weapons can be further reduced and ultimately\neliminated.\nI want to thank all those who helped bring us to this\nday, especially the Chairman of the comprehensive test-\n\n\nban negotiating Committee, Netherlands Ambassador\nRamaker, and the Government of Australia, which took the\nlead at the United Nations.\nI thank the Secretary-General for the remarks he made\nthis morning in establishing the criteria and standards in\nsupport of the United Nations as the depository of the\nTreaty.\nThe signatures of the world\u2019s declared nuclear\nPowers \u2014 the United States, China, France, Russia and the\nUnited Kingdom \u2014 along with those of the vast majority\nof its nations, will immediately create an international norm\nagainst nuclear testing even before the Treaty formally\nenters into force.\nThe CTBT is the shared work of hard negotiation.\nSome have complained that it does not mandate total\nnuclear disarmament by a date certain. I would say to them:\n\u201cDo not forsake the benefits of this achievement by\nignoring the tremendous progress we have already made\ntowards that goal.\u201d Today there are no Russian missiles\npointed at America and no American missiles pointed at\nRussia.\nThrough the START Treaties we are cutting our\nnuclear arsenals by two thirds. Ukraine, Belarus and\nKazakstan are giving up the nuclear weapons left on their\nland after the Soviet Union dissolved.\nWe are working with the newly independent States to\nimprove security at nuclear facilities and to convert nuclear\nweapons to peaceful uses.\nThe United States and other nuclear-weapon States\nhave embraced the South Pacific and African nuclear-free\nzones. Now half the world\u2019s land area is nuclear free by\ninternational agreement. And the world community\nextended indefinitely the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT).\nYet some of the very changes that had made this\nprogress possible have also created new risks. The breakup\nof the Soviet Union left nuclear materials dispersed\nthroughout the newly independent States. As barriers have\ncome down around the world the danger of nuclear\nsmuggling has gone up. So even as we reduce the global\nstockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, we must also\nreduce the danger that lethal materials could wind up in the\nwrong hands, while developing effective defences for our\npeople if that should happen.\nThe United States has six priority goals to further lift\nthe threat of nuclear weapons destruction and the threat of\nweapons of mass destruction, and to limit their dangerous\nspread.\nFirst, we must protect our people from chemical\nattack and make it harder for rogue States and terrorists\nto brandish poison gas by bringing the chemical weapons\nConvention into force as soon as possible. I thank the\nnations here that have ratified the chemical weapons\nConvention. I deeply regret that the United States Senate\nhas not yet voted on the Convention, but I want to assure\nyou and people throughout the world that I will not let\nthis treaty die, and we will join the ranks of nation\ndetermined to prevent the spread of chemical weapons.\nSecondly, we must reduce the risk that an outlaw\nState or organization could build a nuclear device by\nnegotiating a treaty to freeze the production of fissile\nmaterials for use in nuclear weapons. The Conference on\nDisarmament should take up this challenge immediately.\nThe United States, Russia, France and the United\nKingdom already have halted production of fissile\nmaterials for weapons. I urge other nations to end the\nunsafeguarded production of these materials pending\ncompletion of the treaty.\nThirdly, we must continue to reduce our nuclear\narsenals. When Russia ratifies START II, President\nYeltsin and I are all ready to discuss the possibilities of\nfurther cuts, as well as limiting and monitoring nuclear\nwarheads and materials. This will help make deep\nreductions irreversible.\nFourthly, we must reinforce our efforts against the\nspread of nuclear weapons by strengthening the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We\nshould give the International Atomic Energy Agency a\nstronger role and sharper tools for conducting worldwide\ninspections. Our law enforcement and customs officials\nshould cooperate more in the fight against nuclear\nsmuggling. And I urge all nations that have not signed the\nNPT to do so without delay.\nFifthly, we must better protect our people from those\nwho would use disease as a weapon of war, by giving the\nbiological weapons Convention the means to strengthen\ncompliance, including on-site investigations when we\nbelieve such weapons may have been used or when\nsuspicious outbreaks of disease occur. We should aim to\ncomplete this task by 1998.\n2\n\nFinally, we must end the carnage caused by\nanti-personnel landmines, the hidden killers that murder and\nmaim more than 25,000 people a year. In May, I announced\na series of actions the United States would take towards\nthis goal. Today, I renew my appeal for the swift\nnegotiation of a worldwide ban on the use, stockpiling,\nproduction, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. Our\nchildren deserve to walk the Earth in safety.\nThirty-three years ago, at the height of the cold war,\nPresident Kennedy spoke at American University in\nWashington. Peace was the topic of his address, but not an\nabstract ideal of peace. Instead, he urged us to focus on\n\u201ca more practical, attainable peace \u2014 based not on a\nsudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual\nevolution in human institutions \u2014 on a series of\nconcrete actions and effective agreements which are in\nthe interests of all concerned.\u201d\nIt was in that same speech that he announced that talks\nwould shortly begin in Moscow on a comprehensive test-\nban treaty.\nPresident Kennedy\u2019s vision exceeded the possibilities\nof his time, but his words speak to us still. As we sign our\nnames to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty \u2014\nthe longest-sought, hardest-fought prize in arms control\nhistory \u2014 let us summon the confidence of earlier pioneers\nand set our sights on the challenges of the new century.\nOver the past three years we have moved in the right\ndirection in meeting those challenges. In Bosnia, where the\nwar is over and where just 10 days ago its people went to\nthe polls in peace, we have moved in the right direction.\nNow we must help Bosnia build a unified, democratic, and\npeaceful future.\nIn Haiti, where the dictators are gone, democracy is\nback and the exodus of refugees has ended, we have move\nin the right direction. Now we must help the Haitian people\nseize the full benefits of freedom and forge a more\nprosperous future. In the Middle East and in Northern\nIreland, there is progress towards lasting peace, and we are\nmoving in the right direction. Now we must support\ncontinued progress between Israel and Palestinians, and we\nmust broaden the circle of peace to include more of Israel\u2019s\nneighbours. We must help to give the children of Belfast\nthe chance to live out normal lives.\nIn the fact that democracy, open markets and peace\nare taking hold around the world, we are moving in the\nright direction. Here in the Americas, every nation but\none has raised freedom\u2019s flag. In Central Europe, in\nRussia, Ukraine and the other new independent States, the\nforces of reform have earned all our respect and will\ncontinue to have the support of the United States. Now\nwe must begin to welcome Europe\u2019s new democracies\ninto the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),\nstrengthen NATO\u2019s partnership with Russia and build a\nsecure and undivided Europe.\nIn Asia, South Korea, Japan, China and America\nworking together persuaded North Korea to freeze its\nnuclear programme under international monitoring. Now,\nin the wake of provocative actions by North Korea, we\nmust pursue a permanent peace for all the Korean people.\nOur planet is safer because of our common efforts to\nclose Chernobyl, to address the challenges of climate\nchange, to protect the world\u2019s forests and oceans. Now\nwe must uphold our duty as custodians of our\nenvironment so that our children will inherit an even\nhealthier planet.\nAll of us must continue our historic efforts to build\na better, more global trading system for the twenty-first\ncentury. We have made remarkable progress, but there is\nmore to do in opening markets, in creating millions of\nnew jobs for all our people.\nIn this time of challenge and change, the United\nNations is more important than ever before, because our\nworld is more interdependent than ever before. Most\nAmericans know this. Unfortunately, some Americans, in\ntheir longing to be free of the world\u2019s problems, and\nperhaps to focus more on our own problems, ignore what\nthe United Nations has done, ignore the benefits of\ncooperation. They ignore our own interdependence with\nall of you in charting a better future. They ignore all that\nthe United Nations is doing to lift the lives of millions by\npreserving the peace, vaccinating children, caring for\nrefugees, sharing the blessings of progress around the\nworld. They have made it difficult for the United States\nto meet its obligations to the United Nations. But let me\nreassure all of you: the vast majority of Americans\nsupport the United Nations, not only because it reflects\nour own ideals, but because it reinforces our interests. We\nmust continue to work to manifest the support that our\npeople feel. For the fifty-first year in a row, the United\nStates will be the largest financial contributor to the\nUnited Nations. We are paying our dues, and I am\ncommitted to paying off our accumulated obligations.\nHowever, we also support the process of reform, which\nhas done great work in reforming and streamlining the\n3\n\n\nbureaucracy and reining in the budget, and it should\ncontinue.\nWe also believe that all of us \u2014 the nations of the\nworld working together \u2014 must do more to fight terrorism.\nLast year I asked the nations assembled here to commit to\na goal of zero tolerance for aggression, terrorism and\nlawless behaviour. Frankly, we have not done that yet. Real\nzero tolerance means giving no aid and no quarter to\nterrorists who slaughter the innocent and drug traffickers\nwho poison our children, and doing everything we can to\nprevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the\nwrong hands. Real zero tolerance requires us to isolate\nStates that refuse to play by the rules we have all accepted\nfor civilized behaviour. As long as Iraq threatens its\nneighbours and its people, as long as Iran supports and\nprotects terrorists, as long as Libya refuses to give up the\npeople who blew up Pan Am 103, they should not become\nfull members of the family of nations.\nThe United States is pursuing a three-part strategy\nagainst terrorists: abroad, by working more closely than\never with like-minded nations; at home by giving our law\nenforcement the toughest counter-terrorism tools available,\nand by doing all we can to make our airports and the\naeroplanes that link us all together even safer. I have\nrequested more than $1 billion from our Congress to meet\nthese commitments, and we are implementing the United\nStates Vice President's aviation security plan to make those\ntravelling to, from and within the United States more\nsecure.\nThere are other steps we must take together. Last year,\nI urged that together we crack down on money laundering\nand front companies, shut down gray markets for guns,\nexplosives and false documents, open more law\nenforcement centres around the world and strengthen\nsafeguards on lethal materials. In each of these areas we\nhave made progress, through the United Nations, at the\nSummit of Peacemakers in Sharm el-Sheikh, at the Paris\nterrorism conference and individually.\nNow we should adopt the declaration on crime and\npublic security I proposed last year. It includes a no-\nsanctuary pledge, so that we can say with one voice to the\nterrorists, criminals and drug traffickers: \u201cYou have no\nplace to run, no place to hide.\u201d I call on every Member to\nratify 11 international conventions that would help prevent\nand punish terrorism and to criminalize the use of\nexplosives in terrorist attacks.\nTo every nation whose children fall prey to\ndrugs and every nation that makes those drugs: we must\ndo more to reduce demand and to take illegal drugs off\nthe market and off the streets. The United States will do\nits part. Next week, I will target more than $100-million\nworth of defence equipment, services and training to\nMexico, Colombia and other South American and\nCaribbean countries.\nThese resources will help our friends stop the flow\nof drugs at the source. Now I ask every nation that\nexports the chemicals needed to make illicit drugs to\ncreate an informal group whose members will work to\ndeny these chemicals to drug producers. We must not let\nmore drugs darken the dawn of the next century.\nOur duty to fight all these forces of destruction is\ndirectly linked to our efforts to reduce the threat of\nweapons of mass destruction. We all know we are not\nimmune from this. We saw it when our friends in Japan\nwere subject to the murderous power of a small vial of\nsarin gas unleashed in the Tokyo subway. We know a\nsmall lump of plutonium is enough to build a nuclear\nbomb. We know that more dangerous people have access\nto materials of mass destruction because of the rapid\nmovement and open borders of this age. The quest to\neliminate these problems from the world\u2019s arsenals and to\nstop them from spreading has taken on a new and\npowerful urgency for all of us.\nSo let us strengthen our determination to fight the\nrogue States, the terrorists and the criminals who menace\nour safety, our way of life and the potential of our\nchildren in the twenty-first century. Let us recommit\nourselves to prevent them from acquiring weapons of\nmass destruction. Let us work harder than ever to lift the\nnuclear backdrop that has darkened the world\u2019s stage for\ntoo long now. Let us make these solemn tasks our\ncommon obligation, our common commitment; if we do,\nthen together we will enter the twenty-first century\nmarching towards a better, safer world \u2014 the very better,\nsafer world the United Nations has sought to build for 51\nyears.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like first to extend\nwarm congratulations to Mr. Razali Ismail on his election\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\nsession. We have no doubt that the session will benefit\nfrom his known skills as he discharges his responsibilities.\nI should also like to commend Mr. Diogo Freitas\ndo Amaral for the excellent work done during his term of\noffice.\nI should also like to express to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our continued confidence in his\nguidance of the Organization.\nAllow me at the outset of this, my first opportunity to\nspeak before the General Assembly, to express the deep\ngratitude and appreciation of the people and Government of\nSouth Africa for the decision taken by the Assembly at the\nfiftieth session to relieve the new democratic Government\nof South Africa of the burden of the contribution to the\nUnited Nations budget accumulated over the period of two\ndecades when the apartheid regime was excluded from\nparticipating in the work of the General Assembly. We\nrecognize that that action involved considerable sacrifice,\nboth for the United Nations and for its Member States, and\nthat it was also consistent with the historic commitment of\nsupport for our struggle for democracy.\nSouth Africa remains committed to achieving a world\nfree of all weapons of mass destruction and to addressing\nthe issue of the proliferation of conventional weapons. We\ntherefore welcome the adoption of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which we signed\nyesterday.\nOur support for the CTBT as an instrument of\ndisarmament and non-proliferation is based upon the view\nthat this Treaty is an integral part of a process which will\nlead to the full implementation of the nuclear-disarmament\nobligations set out in article VI of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nAn important milestone along this road was the\nadoption of the Pelindaba Treaty creating the African\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. This Treaty will contribute\ngreatly to measures aimed at achieving a world free from\nnuclear weapons. Further steps are needed in the process to\nbring the world closer to the ultimate goal of the\nelimination of nuclear weapons. The next step is for\nAfrican States to cooperate with parties to the other\nnuclear-weapon-free-zones in the Pacific and Latin\nAmerican regions with a view to promoting a southern\nhemisphere-wide nuclear-weapon-free zone. We are\nheartened by the unprecedented step of four nuclear-\nweapon States\u2019 signing the relevant Protocols of the\nPelindaba Treaty simultaneously with African States in\nApril 1996, while the fifth has indicated that it will sign\nshortly. South Africa, as stated previously in other\nforums, will also work for the commencement next year\nof negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a\ntreaty banning the production of fissile material for\nnuclear weapons.\nSouth Africa also supports and will work for the\nestablishment of an ad hoc committee on nuclear\ndisarmament in the Conference on Disarmament. This\ncommittee can identify and negotiate the necessary steps\nby which we can achieve the ultimate goal of the eventual\nelimination of nuclear weapons. We also look forward to\nthe early ratification of the Chemical Weapons\nConvention by those States that have not yet done so.\nIt is not just the threat posed by all weapons of mass\ndestruction and their means of delivery that is of serious\nconcern to my Government, but also the build-up of\nconventional weapons beyond a level which can be\nconsidered legitimate for the purposes of self-defence.\nConventional weapons are, in fact, the cause of most of\nthe deaths and suffering of millions of people in conflicts\naround the world today.\nMy Government would therefore like to encourage\nall States Members of the United Nations to support and\nparticipate in the United Nations Register of Conventional\nArms, and lend active support to General Assembly\nresolution 50/70 B on small arms and its panel of\ngovernmental experts mandated to assist the Secretary-\nGeneral to prepare a report on small arms. We would also\nencourage Member States to support the worldwide\nefforts to secure the elimination of anti-personnel\nlandmines. In order to alleviate the suffering caused by\nlandmines, my Government is committed to reinforcing\ninternational cooperation. As a country with advanced\ndemining technology, we are pleased to be making a\nmodest contribution to international efforts to unearth\nlandmines.\nSouth Africa will continue to cooperate in the\nvarious international forums dedicated to the\nnon-proliferation of the technologies and equipment which\n17\n\n\ncould be used in the development of weapons of mass\ndestruction, and in discouraging any destabilizing build up\nof conventional weapons.\nOur harrowing experience under the tyranny of\napartheid has imposed a duty on us to place a high\npremium on the promotion of human rights. In this regard,\nour Constitution contains an entrenched and fully justiciable\nBill of Rights. In addition, plans are advanced for the\nestablishment of an office on the status of women to\nprovide a mechanism within the Government to act as a\nmonitor to ensure that a gender perspective is integrated\ninto all publicly-funded policies and programmes. The\nSouth African Government regards it as a priority to\ncontribute to the efforts of the international community to\ncombat the violation of human rights.\nIn South Africa, and in the region as a whole,\nprocesses of democratization have released a host of\nproductive human and political resources. This has, in many\nways, contributed to the achievement of peace, security and\nstability in our region.\nOur vision for southern Africa is one of the highest\npossible degree of economic cooperation, mutual assistance\nand the joint planning of regional development initiatives,\nleading to full economic integration.\nCivil conflicts have ravaged many parts of Africa. We\nwelcome the positive developments which have taken place\nin Rwanda and Sierra Leone. However, serious conflict\npersists in Liberia, Burundi and Somalia. The South African\nGovernment is committed to playing an active role in the\nongoing efforts of the international community to assist the\npeople of Burundi to bring about lasting peace and national\nreconciliation. President Mandela recently appointed a\nspecial representative for Burundi, who has been given the\ntask of searching for a viable solution in close coordination\nwith other special representatives and with countries in the\nregion. These efforts need to be supplemented by close\ncooperation between the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) and the United Nations.\nAt the same time, we are heartened by the progress,\nalbeit tentative so far, towards peace in Angola.\nRepresentatives of Member countries assembled here will\nagree that the people of Angola deserve peace at last as an\ninstrument for \u2014 or rather, as an important ingredient of \u2014\nembarking on the road to sustainable economic\ndevelopment and social advancement. Our Government\ncommends the efforts of the United Nations, and especially\nthose of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General\nfor Angola, Ma\u00eetre Alioune Blondin Beye, who has with\ntremendous patience and commitment guided the Angolan\npeace process to the stage where it is today. We owe it to\nthe people of Angola to see this process through to its\nlogical conclusion.\nThrough the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\nResolution, member States of the OAU are collectively\ncommitted to restoring peace and security on our\ncontinent. In support of the OAU mechanism, we are\npleased that the Southern African Development\nCommunity has recently created an organ on politics,\ndefence and security. These efforts reflect Africa\u2019s\nprimary concern with issues of preventive diplomacy and\nconflict resolution.\nSouth Africa welcomed the spirit of dialogue and\nrealism that had begun to characterize the relations\nbetween Israel and Palestine and was hopeful that this\npositive development would gradually replace the\ncenturies of conflict in the Middle East. That hope was\nfurther reinforced by the Declaration of Principles on\nInterim Self-Government Arrangements reached in Oslo.\nMy Government is concerned, however, that recent\ndevelopments in the Middle East are likely to reverse and\njeopardize the peace process. We therefore urge all the\nplayers in the Middle East to rise to the occasion and, in\na spirit of reconciliation, to move steadfastly towards a\nlasting peace in the region.\nWe are seriously concerned by the marginalization,\nparticularly of African countries among the least-\ndeveloped countries, from the process of globalization and\nliberalization. In this regard, closer attention should be\ngiven to the need to address the external debt burden of\nthe least-developed countries, especially those in Africa.\nProblems associated with the debt burden and its\nservicing still persist and frustrate the rate at which the\ncontinent can extricate itself from the vicious cycle of\npoverty.\nWe therefore welcome the Mid-term Review of the\nImplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s and recognize the\nimportance of the United Nations System-wide Special\nInitiative on Africa, as well as the need to underpin its\nsuccess through appropriate and adequate resources.\nIn this context we also welcome the designation of\n1996 as the International Year for the Eradication of\nPoverty. We hope that the international community will\n18\n\n\nrealize this objective in clear recognition of the challenges\nfacing it.\nWe welcome the World Food Summit, which is to\nconvene in Rome in November 1996 and which will afford\nthe international community the opportunity to demonstrate\nits commitment to ensuring that poverty eradication\nstrategies are fully integrated into all initiatives of the\nUnited Nations system.\nMy Government is encouraged by the outcome of the\nUnited Nations Conference on Human Settlements\n(HABITAT II). The results of the Conference represent the\ncollaborative efforts of the international community to\ndevelop a consensus view on the fundamental need to\nprovide access to adequate shelter and infrastructure for all\npeople. Continued support for initiatives at the national and\ninternational level to realize and implement the necessary\nfollow-up to HABITAT II should now receive priority\nattention.\nIt was an honour for South Africa to host the ninth\nsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) in April 1996. My Government\nbelieves that the sound basis for cooperation established by\nUNCTAD IX and the call for partnership for growth and\ndevelopment outlined in the Midrand Declaration must be\ncarried forward and implemented through the General\nAssembly and other forums. South Africa is particularly\nkeen to ensure that the framework which we adopted at\nMidrand for the reform of UNCTAD is translated into an\neffective facility for the developing world.\nSouth Africa also wishes to underscore the\nfundamental importance of international cooperation in the\nenvironmental and development fields. Sustained political\ncommitment through global partnership remains essential\nfor our continuing international cooperation efforts. It is for\nthis reason that we believe that the 1997 special session of\nthe General Assembly will provide an excellent opportunity\nto reaffirm the principles and objectives of the Rio\nDeclaration\u2019s Agenda 21.\nSouth Africa, a country with a long coastline, has\nconsiderable interest in matters relating to the law of the\nsea. We are thus pleased that the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea and its implementing\nAgreement have entered into force, and that the\nInternational Sea-Bed Authority and related structures, of\nwhich South Africa is proud to be a member, have been\nestablished.\nIn my statement to the General Assembly during the\nfiftieth session, I expressed the sincere hope that\nsignificant progress would be made in bringing about the\nestablishment of an international criminal court. It is\ntherefore gratifying to see that the Preparatory Committee\non the Establishment of an International Criminal Court,\nwhich was established during the fiftieth session, has\nmade much progress in bringing this idea to fruition.\nWhat is now needed is to take this process forward by\nholding as soon as possible a diplomatic conference\nwhere the statute of the proposed court can be finalized.\nIt is widely acknowledged that the favourable\nchanges in the international climate are conducive to the\nreform and modernization of the United Nations in order\nto prepare the Organization to respond effectively to the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\nI wish to recall that in his address on 23 October\n1995 at the Special Commemorative Meeting of the\nGeneral Assembly, President Mandela, said:\n\u201cIndeed the United Nations has to reassess its\nrole, redefine its profile and reshape its\nstructures. It should truly reflect the diversity\nof our universe and ensure equity among the\nnations in the exercise of power within the\nsystem of international relations in general, and\nthe Security Council in particular.\u201d (Official\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fiftieth\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 37th meeting, p. 6)\nIn this regard, my delegation wishes to register its\ndisappointment at the slow pace of advancement, with no\nend in sight to the deliberations of the Working Group on\nthe question of equitable representation and increase in\nthe membership of the Security Council and other matters\nrelating to the Security Council. In this regard we support\nthe recommendation in the report of the Working Group\nthat the Group should continue with its work. We would\nalso urge Member States to demonstrate flexibility and\naccommodation in their future deliberations and to display\nthe necessary political will in order to reach a common\nunderstanding.\nIn the declaration that the Heads of State and\nGovernment adopted on the occasion of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations on 24 October 1995, it\nwas noted that\n\u201cIn order to carry out its work effectively, the\nUnited Nations must have adequate resources.\n19\n\n\nMember States must meet, in full and on time, their\nobligation to bear the expenses of the Organization, as\napportioned by the General Assembly. That\napportionment should be established on the basis of\ncriteria agreed to and considered to be fair by Member\nStates.\u201d (A/50/48, para. 15)\nMy delegation has taken note of the progress of the\nWorking Group on the financial situation in highlighting the\nproblems facing the Organization, and urges all Member\nStates to pay what is legally due as soon as possible in\norder that we may direct our energies to the real problems\nfacing the world at this time. As we approach the twenty-\nfirst century, let us together resolve to redefine the role and\nshape of the United Nations and render this institution\nbetter equipped to carry out the important task of advancing\npeace and development in the world.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great\nhonour for me to extend to Mr. Razali Ismail our warmest\ncongratulations, on behalf of the delegation of Trinidad and\nTobago, on his election as President of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nAs the United Nations begins the second half-century\nof its existence, and as the international community seeks\nto renew and reshape the Organization to deal with the\nchallenges of the approaching millennium, the Trinidad and\nTobago delegation is particularly pleased to see the\nstewardship of the General Assembly in the hands of a\nleader and a friend of Mr. Razali\u2019s calibre.\nMy delegation would also like to express its deep\nappreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Diogo\nFreitas do Amaral of Portugal, for the able manner in which\nhe presided over the historic fiftieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nToday more than ever, we live in a global age, an\nage of immeasurable possibilities and opportunities\nengendered by advances in technology, the information\nrevolution and globalization; but it is also an age full of\nperil, one characterized by complex and myriad\nchallenges, many of which we have yet to understand\nfully or come to terms with.\nIn this age of globalization and fragmentation,\ntraditional national and international structures are\nbecoming increasingly inadequate to deal with current\nrealities. Nation States are also more frequently\nconfronting the need to find acceptable means by which\nto yield elements of their sovereignty through regional\nand multilateral action, in order to deal effectively with\nglobal forces that are invariably transnational in nature.\nIn this sea of change in international relations, the\nwhole concept of international security has increasingly\nmoved away from the bipolar view, concerned largely\nwith military security, to one which assigns a central role\nto sustainable development and the welfare of the\nindividual. The major actors in the international arena are\nno longer solely nation States, but also economic agents\nwith a global reach and non-governmental organizations\nwith a growing global influence.\nYet these powerful forces that are inexorably pulling\nus together are also simultaneously tearing us apart,\nengendering fragmentation, reactivating age-old conflicts,\nand threatening more than ever to marginalize and leave\nbehind large segments of humanity in the march to\nprogress. Among some of the more powerful and\nindustrialized countries, the fears of active integration and\nengagement are leading to temptations to look inward and\nto become more isolationist and more protectionist. In\naddition, the problems of persistent poverty, increasing\nunemployment, debilitating debt, declining levels of\nofficial development assistance, environmental\ndegradation, drug abuse and drug trafficking, crime,\nterrorism and social disintegration have combined to\npresent a formidable array of challenges, which, if left\nunaddressed, threaten to overwhelm us and further\nmarginalize the vulnerable and disadvantaged among us.\nIn this new global environment, we are at a critical\ncrossroads, and in many ways the decisions that confront\nus in the international community on the eve of the\n20\n\n\ntwenty-first century are no less important than those that\nconfronted us at the end of the war to end all wars.\nIn this evolving global society, the choices are clear.\nWill we allow the world to drift towards the dangerous\nanarchy of spheres of influence and unchecked\nconfrontation? Or will we commit ourselves to greater\ncooperation inherent in the call to global neighbourhood\naction? Will we allow ethnic conflicts and \u201cethnic\ncleansing\u201d to continue? Or will we resolutely resist the\nprimitive impulses by devising mechanisms to avoid\nrepetitions of these phenomena, wherever they occur?\nWill we grasp the new opportunity for global\nprosperity, or will we allow the common global enemies to\noverwhelm us? Will we help to alleviate the crisis in\nmultilateralism and give to the world of the twenty-first\ncentury a reformed United Nations, true to the ideals of the\nfounding fathers, or will we increasingly move in the\ndirection of unilateralism, seeking to use the United Nations\nfor narrow self-interest? Finally, will we give to the world\na new global order, true to the letter and spirit of the\nfiftieth anniversary Declaration, and based on the\nsustainable development agenda of the recent global\nconferences, or will we build a world of two societies, one\ngetting progressively richer and the other progressively\npoorer?\nWe must not be afraid of challenges. Trinidad and\nTobago, as a small developing island State, with all the\nconcomitant vulnerability and fragility, has embarked on an\naggressive, outward-oriented strategy of development. This\nstrategy has been informed by the need to optimize our\nability to participate in a global economy that is becoming\nincreasingly knowledge-based, fiercely competitive and\nvolatile. Our development strategy has as its basic objective\nthe attainment of broad-based economic growth with social\nequity. It assigns a special emphasis to trade, investment,\ntourism, agriculture, services and the environment, and it\nseeks, through a political process of inclusiveness and\nempowerment, to mobilize all of our human resources in\nthe task of building a sustainable democracy.\nIn November 1995, the new Government of Trinidad\nand Tobago, which I have the honour to lead, assumed\noffice through the medium of the ballot box. The peaceful\nand democratic transfer of power that took place at that\ntime was further ample testimony to the political maturity\nof our peoples, and the political stability that we in\nTrinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean have been fortunate\nto enjoy.\nIn any democracy, however, one must be eternally\nvigilant, constantly striving to enhance the democratic\ntradition and strengthen the democratic process. It is in\nthis context that I have sought to establish a Government\nof National Unity, committed to partnership-building at all\nlevels. Special emphasis has been placed on the\ndevolution of power from central to local government\nauthorities, so as to facilitate greater participation in the\ndemocratic process. A National Multipartite Commission,\ncomprising representatives of labour, business,\nGovernment, non-governmental organizations and the\nInter-Religious Organization, has been established and\nentrusted with the task of formulating a comprehensive\nplan of action to take us into the twenty-first century. The\naim of these and other measures is to build a truly\nparticipatory society, empowering all of our peoples.\nIn the social arena, we have sought to create a viable\nsocial pact among business, labour and Government, built\non consultation, partnership and consensus, so as to\nprovide stability, trust and transparency in industrial\nrelations. We have also sought, through our social\nprogrammes, to place special emphasis on the\ndisadvantaged and dispossessed, with a view to providing\nthem with the necessary support, training and skills for\neffective participation in our society. In this regard, a\nChange Management Unit for Poverty Eradication and\nEquity Building has been established under the authority\nof a senior Cabinet Minister. The unit is entrusted with\nthe responsibility of formulating an integrated, multi-\nsectoral and sustained approach to poverty eradication,\nand ensuring its implementation in all facets of the\nGovernment\u2019s economic and social policies. As a\ncomplement to this Unit, the Government of Trinidad and\nTobago will, on 24 October 1996 \u2014 United Nations\nDay \u2014 set up a National Social Development Council to\nmobilize national action to deal with the homeless and the\npoor. This innovative approach to poverty eradication is\nbeing implemented in close cooperation with the United\nNations Development Programme, which has provided\ntimely support in this, the International Year for the\nEradication of Poverty. In keeping with the spirit of\nBeijing and the Platform for Action of the Beijing\nConference, a vigorous policy and legislative agenda is\nbeing formulated and implemented through a consultative\nprocess, the objective being to optimize the role of\nwomen as equal partners in the development process.\nWith regard to the environment, a comprehensive\nlegislative and policy framework has been put in place to\nrespond to the demands of sustainable development. This\nnew environmental regime will serve to ensure a\n21\n\n\n\u201cgreening\u201d of the Government\u2019s own operations, while\nsimultaneously engaging the public and industry in a\npartnership for responsible management, protection and\nconservation of the environment.\nTrinidad and Tobago\u2019s economic programme places a\npremium on trade, with the private sector as the engine of\ngrowth in the economy. Some of the essential elements of\nthe strategy are the attraction of private investment flows,\ncreation of increased market access, and the implementation\nof an appropriate industrial policy. This is being achieved\nthrough the pursuit of a sound and stable macroeconomic\npolicy, supported by a prudent and disciplined fiscal and\nmonetary stance, and the delivery of an investor-friendly\ninstitutional legal framework.\nWe in Trinidad and Tobago are under no illusions. All\nof our national efforts will be in vain if we do not have a\nsupportive regional and international environment, as well\nas access to a fair, open and non-discriminatory\ninternational trading regime. Regional integration has\nalways been a fundamental component of the development\nstrategy of Trinidad and Tobago. Accordingly, our Republic\nhas built strategic alliances through the Caribbean\nCommunity, the Rio Group and, more recently, the\nAssociation of Caribbean States, comprising countries of\nthe wider Caribbean. We continue to be engaged actively\nin efforts to deepen and broaden the integration process\nwithin the region through initiatives that we hope will\nculminate in formal relationships with the Central American\nCommon Market, the Andean Pact and the Southern Cone\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR). Our vision for the future\nis a single free-trade area in the western hemisphere.\nFor small States like Trinidad and Tobago, greater\nregional integration and cooperation are imperative if we\nare to minimize the negative and pervasive effects of\nglobalization, while simultaneously laying the foundations\nfor our increased capacity to navigate the turbulent waters\nof the expanding global economy.\nRegionalism is a critical priority, but in today\u2019s world\nit must be conceived as a natural and essential complement\nto wider international cooperation. The common evils of the\ntwenty-first century will require a common approach, a\ncommon commitment. I can think of no other organization\nmore uniquely placed or more legitimate than the United\nNations to foster the global conscience, to fashion the\nnecessary understanding, to build the mutual partnerships,\nand to organize the global cooperative effort.\nIn the field of sustainable development, the\ncontinuum of global conferences, from Rio to Istanbul,\nhave laid down a global agenda, a development blueprint\nfor the twenty-first century. Yet as discussions on the\nAgenda for Development have shown, there is a crisis of\ncommitment, particularly on the part of the developed\ncountries, to provide the required resources. \u201cDonor\nfatigue\u201d and declining levels of official development\nassistance threaten to render meaningless the global\nunderstanding, consensus and Programmes of Action\nforged in respect of the major issues and problems of our\ntimes.\nThis negative mood imperils all of us, for it\nthreatens to subject some one fifth of the world\u2019s\npopulation, who live in poverty, to a life of perpetual\ndespair. But more than that, it ignores the fact that the\ngap between the haves and the have-nots continues to\ngrow alongside the growth in world trade. It forgets the\nmessage inherent in the common problems of our time:\nthat whether we like it or not, our progress, and\nincreasingly our security, is tied to that of our neighbours,\nno matter how poor or how distant they may be. Finally,\nit ignores the generally acknowledged fact that preventive\naction to deal with the root causes of conflict is less\ncostly and more effective than corrective action.\nTrinidad and Tobago also attaches the highest\npriority to the fight against drug abuse and drug\ntrafficking. We have intensified our coordination activities\nat the national level, and have systematically put in place\ncooperative mechanisms with other Caribbean and Latin\nAmerican countries, as well as with other States whose\ninvolvement is critical to the success of national and\nregional efforts. We believe that the violence, the\ncorruption and the human despair which this menace\nwreaks on societies in all corners of the globe, should\nleave no doubt as to the imperative need for the United\nNations to accord priority attention to this question.\nTrinidad and Tobago is therefore fully supportive of the\ncall for the convening in 1997 of an international\nconference on this subject. My delegation wishes to\ncommend in particular the United Nations International\nDrug Control Programme for its important contribution to\nthe multi-dimensional campaign against drug abuse and\nillicit drug trafficking being waged within our Republic\nand in the wider Caribbean and Latin American region.\nWe urge the Drug Control Programme to continue to\npursue a comprehensive and balanced approach to this\nworldwide campaign, endeavouring to address equitably\nthe problems of demand, production and trafficking.\n22\n\n\nIn the field of international law, we have over the past\ndecades seen a number of new agreements in virtually all\nbranches of human activity. Trinidad and Tobago is\nencouraged by the progress made during the fiftieth session\nof the General Assembly towards the establishment of an\ninternational criminal court. We look forward to a positive\nrecommendation for the completion of work during the\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly in order to\nrealize the goal of a diplomatic conference in 1998 to adopt\nthe statute and establish the court. We in the international\ncommunity have the responsibility to create this global\ninstitution with the requisite global jurisdiction, and to\nequip it with the necessary authority to make it an effective,\nimpartial body, with the broadest possible participation of\nStates from all geographical regions. Meanwhile, Trinidad\nand Tobago fully supports the activities of the International\nTribunals for the territories of the former Yugoslavia and\nof Rwanda.\nIn the field of nuclear disarmament, the international\ncommunity last year indefinitely extended the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and, earlier this\nmonth, the General Assembly adopted the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. These two developments have\nserved to promote non-proliferation and nuclear\ndisarmament. The international community must now,\nhowever, focus its attention on the emerging consensus that\nall nuclear explosions must be banned.\nA related environmental concern to which Trinidad\nand Tobago, the Caribbean and the Alliance of Small Island\nNations attach the greatest importance is that of the\ncontinued shipments of irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium\nand high-level radioactive wastes. At last year\u2019s Review\nConference on the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Trinidad and\nTobago and the Alliance of Small Island Nations was able,\nafter long and intensive negotiations, to obtain agreement\non specific language registering the concerns of small\nisland developing States and other coastal States on this\nissue.\nThe considerations which led us to pursue that\ninitiative then are still relevant now. These shipments\ncontinue to take place despite the potentially catastrophic\neffects on small island developing States, whose fragile and\nvulnerable economies are overwhelmingly dependent on\ntheir marine and coastal resources, and who possess neither\nthe resources nor the capability to deal with possible\naccidents of this nature. Trinidad and Tobago would\ntherefore like to reiterate the priority concern we attach to\nthis issue, and to urge the shipment countries to respect the\nwishes of small island developing States and other en-route\nStates, which have called for an end to these shipments\nthrough their archipelagic and territorial waters, as well as\ntheir exclusive economic zones.\nThe notions of shared responsibilities and collective\naction are the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations system.\nAs we prepare to face the new challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century, these notions assume a critical relevance.\nTrinidad and Tobago is convinced that the United Nations\nhas the capacity to reconcile these opposing forces of\nglobalization and fragmentation in the interests of us all.\nThe United Nations also has the strength and legitimacy\nto transform the fears and perils of the new age into a\nconstructive global partnership of cooperation and\nsolidarity. Trinidad and Tobago pledges to work with\nothers to harness this potential and to confront the\nchallenges which face the Organization and the\ninternational community as we move towards the new\nmillennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am delighted to extend\nto the President and his country, Malaysia, the sincere\ncongratulations of the Government and the people of\nBotswana on his assumption of the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. His record as\nan accomplished diplomat has the admiration of my\ndelegation. He can therefore count on the full support and\ncooperation of the delegation of Botswana in the\ndischarge of his demanding responsibilities.\nWe salute his predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for his successful\nstewardship of the fiftieth session and the Special\nCommemorative Meeting.\nThe last five years have been the most momentous\nin the history of the United Nations, imposing on the\nworld body enormous responsibilities, which the\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, and the Secretariat have carried out with a deep\nsense of commitment and dedication. We assure them that\nthey continue to enjoy the confidence and full support of\nBotswana in the execution of their duties.\nThe African continent continues to make\ncommendable progress in the consolidation of freedom\nand democracy. This year the continent witnessed the\nsuccessful holding of multi-party elections in Benin,\nSierra Leone and the United Republic of Tanzania.\nThe right of citizens to organize themselves and\nparticipate freely in the political processes of their\ncountries, and respect for human rights, form the basis for\nstability, democracy and development.\n23\n\n\nIndeed, the continent has increasingly embraced these\nuniversal values, which are an integral part of a democratic\nculture. Not only has Africa embraced political pluralism,\naccountability and good governance, it has also\ndemonstrated its readiness to defend these principles.\nA year ago we expected that the people of Angola\nwould by now have started a new chapter of peace in the\nhistory of their country. It is regrettable that to date the way\nforward remains unclear. We strongly call upon those who\nhave contributed to the current stalemate in Angola to see\nreason and show more commitment to the peace process.\nTwo days ago the Heads of State and Government of\nsouthern Africa met in Luanda, Angola, in an effort to\npersuade all concerned to ensure the speedy implementation\nof the Lusaka Protocol.\nWe are deeply concerned about the situation in\nBurundi. The country is wallowing in a quagmire of self-\ndestruction. No amount of reasoning and persuasion has\nthus far succeeded in drawing the political leaders in\nBurundi away from a path of mutual annihilation and to the\npath of accommodation and reconciliation.\nWe salute the efforts of the regional leaders and of the\ninternational community aimed at ensuring the restoration\nof democracy and constitutional order in Burundi. That\nsister country deserves some reprieve from the traumatic\nexperience it has recently gone through. Burundi needs\npeace and stability now, not tomorrow.\nWhile the situation in Rwanda remains tense, there are\nsome encouraging signs that the country is making steady\nprogress towards normalcy. Preparations for next year\u2019s\ngeneral elections seem to be well under way.\nWe urge the international community to spare no\neffort in encouraging that country towards national\nreconciliation. Key among the necessary measures to be\nundertaken is the safe return of refugees to their homeland.\nDespite all efforts by the international community, and\nby West Africa in particular, the political crisis in Liberia\nhas so far eluded solution. We call upon all the parties\nconcerned to ensure that elections are held in May 1997 as\nscheduled.\nIn our view, and in reality, Western Sahara poses a\nmajor political and moral problem. Botswana is committed\nto the holding of a free, fair and impartial referendum for\nthe people of Western Sahara, in accordance with the\nSettlement Plan. We are deeply concerned that the\nidentification process has been in a state of paralysis for\nseveral months now.\nSomalia continues to haunt the conscience of the\nworld. The situation in that country is a tragic\ndemonstration of how a disparate assortment of gunmen\ncan hijack and destroy a nation. The United Nations\nshould not consider Somalia a lost cause. We should\ntherefore persevere in the search for a comprehensive\nsettlement to the political crisis in that country.\nRecent developments in the Middle East are a matter\nof profound concern to Botswana. Starting in September\n1993 we were pleased to witness the dramatic unfolding\nof a promising peace process between Israel and the\nPalestinians, on the one hand, and between Israel and\nJordan, on the other. We looked forward to the\nresumption of negotiations between Israel and its Arab\nneighbours, Syria and Lebanon, which, hopefully, would\nhave ushered in a lasting solution to the conflict in the\nMiddle East.\nRecent events in the occupied Arab territories are a\nstark indicator of what can happen to the peace process if\nthings are allowed to drag on and on. We appeal to the\nGovernment of Israel to fulfil its obligations under the\nagreements it signed with the Palestinians.\nDevelopments on the Korean peninsula have also\nbeen a matter of grave concern. Botswana is committed\nto the peaceful reunification of Korea.\nBotswana follows developments in Cyprus with keen\ninterest. The continued division of Cyprus is a serious\nviolation of the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity\nof a Member State of the United Nations.\nLand-mines, particularly anti-personnel land-mines,\nare a major threat to humanity. Botswana strongly\nbelieves that the solution to the menace of anti-personnel\nland-mines lies in a total ban on production, stockpiling,\nexport and use. Existing protocols have provided only a\npartial solution to this problem. There is a glaring need\nfor a binding international legal instrument for the\nprogressive and ultimate elimination of these weapons.\nThe production, stockpiling and proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction, of which nuclear weapons\nare the most lethal, is also a matter of deep concern to\nmy delegation. For far too long, non-nuclear-weapon\nStates have been calling for an international legal\ninstrument to safeguard them against the threat or use of\n24\n\n\nthese weapons. The response of the nuclear Powers has\nbeen less than reassuring, to say the least. Unilateral\nstatements on security assurances, which have been\ntransmitted through a Security Council resolution, do not\nmeet the demands of the overwhelming majority of the\nmembership of this Organization.\nThe security of non-nuclear-weapon States from the\nthreat or use of these dangerous weapons can only be\nguaranteed by the institution of a legally binding\ninternational instrument. Botswana is committed to the early\nconclusion of such an instrument, and we hope that the\nnuclear-weapon States will demonstrate the necessary\ncommitment to meet the concerns of non-nuclear-weapon\nStates.\nArticle VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons commits parties, inter alia, to reach\nagreement\n\u201con a Treaty on general and complete disarmament\nunder strict and effective international control\u201d.\nUnfortunately, the nuclear-weapon States are resolutely\nopposed to the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Not\nonly are these States resistant to this noble ideal, but they\ncontinue to develop new types of weapons. What\nconclusions are we expected to draw from this state of\naffairs?\nIt is difficult for nuclear-weapon States to claim the\nmoral high ground to dissuade any State from acquiring the\nsame weapons for the defence of its supreme national\ninterests, while they themselves consider such weapons a\nreliable means of self-defence. Nuclear-weapon States\nshould accept their responsibility to enter into and conclude\nnegotiations for the elimination of these weapons.\nThe General Assembly has repeatedly called upon the\nConference on Disarmament to accelerate consideration of\nthe question of the expansion of its membership. We thus\ncall upon the Conference on Disarmament to address\nspeedily the question of its expansion to the satisfaction of\nthe general membership of the United Nations.\nFive years have passed since the United Nations New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s was\nadopted by the General Assembly. While we all applauded\nthe adoption of the New Agenda, it has to be accepted that\nthe necessary operational framework was never put in place\nto ensure effective mobilization and disbursement of the\ntarget resources.\nConcerned about the poor performance of the United\nNations New Agenda, in March this year the Secretary-\nGeneral launched the United Nations System-wide Special\nInitiative for Africa, which has the backing of the World\nBank, among others. The Initiative envisages an\nexpenditure of some $25 billion over a 10-year period to\naddress identified sectoral development priorities. This is\na laudable Initiative which should afford Africa the\nopportunity to address effectively the critical nexus of\nfood security, population and the environment.\nFor their part, most African countries have met their\nobligations as spelled out in national structural adjustment\nprogrammes, in addition to the efforts made in the fields\nof democracy, human rights and good governance.\nAlthough southern Africa today enjoys relative peace and\nstability, it will continue to need special assistance in\norder to address the problems of reconstruction and\ndevelopment of the economic, physical and social\ninfrastructures which were destroyed or adversely affected\nby many years of war and racial injustice. We have no\ndoubt that the international community will complement\nour efforts so that we can launch our region on a firm\nroad to regional integration and economic development.\nBotswana is a strong proponent of the reform and\nrestructuring of the United Nations. My President, who is\na member of the Secretary-General\u2019s United Nations\nPanel of High-level Personalities on African\nDevelopment, firmly believes in a more action-oriented\nand streamlined United Nations system that is able to\ndeliver. But we do not agree with those who advocate a\n\u201ccut-cut\u201d approach. There could be areas where additional\nstaff could be the catalyst to enhanced effectiveness and\nefficiency. What the world needs is a United Nations that\nhas the capacity to implement its programmes and\nprojects effectively and efficiently, a United Nations that\ncan put to better use the human and material resources at\nits disposal and one that can better guarantee international\npeace and security and promote international\nunderstanding.\nIt should be noted that the responsibility for the\nreform process, to a large extent, lies squarely with\nMember States and not with the Secretary-General,\nalthough he has a contribution to make in the whole\nprocess. Member States should therefore take full\nresponsibility for their inability to reach agreement on\nvarious aspects of the reform process and desist from\nseeking scapegoats for their failure to reach consensus on\na multifaceted international and structural reform of the\nOrganization.\n25\n\n\nBotswana and other countries in southern Africa have\nnot been spared the scourge of illicit drug trafficking and\nconsumption. The Heads of State or Government of the\nSouthern African Development Community recently signed,\namong other instruments, a protocol on illicit drug\ntrafficking. The aim is to pool our resources \u2014 such as\npolice forces, customs authorities and drug enforcement\nagencies \u2014 to fight drug trafficking and other cross-border\ncrimes effectively. We look forward to continued\ninternational cooperation in this regard. We are hopeful\nthat these efforts will be crowned with success and will\nreceive the full support and cooperation of the\ninternational community.\nThe human immunodeficiency virus and acquired\nimmune deficiency syndrome pandemic is another scourge\nof our time and a serious threat to humanity. The socio-\neconomic consequences of the disease are a matter of\ngrave concern, and the international community should\nmake concerted efforts to address this human tragedy \u2014\nwhich affects the young and the productive sectors of our\nsocieties in particular \u2014 before it is too late.\nTo conclude, my delegation reaffirms its total\nconfidence in the stewardship of the President of the\nGeneral Assembly and pledges its loyalty and\ncooperation. We reaffirm our commitment to work with\nother delegations towards the strengthening of the United\nNations. We reaffirm our confidence in the manner in\nwhich the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, manages the affairs of our Organization.\nWe salute him for his visionary leadership and untiring\ncommitment to duty."

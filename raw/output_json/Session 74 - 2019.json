        "file_text": "\u201cNever forget\u201d is a summons that has remained one of the most important watchwords of the international community since 1945. There is no question that the memory of the tens of millions of victims of the Second World War, the atrocities committed by the Nazis and their criminal policies of genocide enabled us to agree on a new world order that is still helping us to avoid another world war whose consequences would be disastrous for the entire planet. And yet today, unfortunately, we are closer than ever to crossing that dangerous line.\nThere can be no doubt that issues related to peace and security, sustainable development and climate change are some of the most pressing currently on humankind\u2019s agenda and it is they that are being discussed most actively in international forums. We are actively seeking joint solutions to the many challenges facing the international community, such as terrorism, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and illegal migration. At the same time, numerous new and emerging risks await the development of adequate and above all timely responses. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the capacities of individual or even groups of States are no longer sufficient to resolve these problems and save the world from disasters, whether military, economic or climatic.\nBelarus is a State that believes that all of those global challenges require effective joint solutions on a similarly global scale. The key elements in that approach are ensuring that all States Members of the United Nations, without exception, participate in implementing the measures that we agree to, that all the available political, economic and intellectual resources are mobilized and that given its universal composition and mandate, the United Nations fulfils its role as a leader in uniting and coordinating international efforts. Unfortunately, we are dealing increasingly with the fact that the multilateral mechanisms of the United Nations are either not working or have stalled, becoming hostage to biased approaches, mutual recriminations or excessive ambitions. Cases involving the implementation of measures that undermine the norms and principles of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, are increasing and doing serious damage to the multilateral approach.\nDozens of local conflicts are tearing the world apart, and many of them have the potential to ignite a new world war. We believe that both ongoing and frozen conflicts should be resolved through dialogue based solely on the fundamental principles of international law, including respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and for refraining from the use or threat of use of force. We now find ourselves in a situation of dangerous and conflicting realities. It is quite clear that we must find answers to our common challenges before those realities have catastrophic consequences. I think many will agree that this is not the way that the international community would like to celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations next year. The anniversary summit should give us a powerful incentive to find those answers and above all should help to enhance the role of the United Nations in strengthening peace and security, restoring dialogue and trust and, most importantly, preventing the threat of conflict on a global scale. Belarus urges the world leaders who will gather in this Hall next year to dedicate the meeting to those issues. If the anniversary summit becomes just another protocol event, all of us \u2014 the Organization and all its members \u2014 will lose. The dreadful spectre of a third world war could become a reality.\nIn the past few years, Belarus has been taking concrete steps by actively insisting on the importance of avoiding confrontation and resuming a broad dialogue on key issues of international security. That dialogue would enable all of us, and especially the great Powers, to agree on a path for maintaining peace and finding a concerted response to the ever-growing number of global challenges. The events of recent months have affirmed the rightness of the approach of States such as Belarus that have consistently supported launching a new negotiation process similar to the Helsinki process of the mid-1970s, aimed at stabilizing international relations, strengthening international dialogue and improving predictability.\nIn August, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, one of the pillars of the modern disarmament architecture and a symbol of the end of the Cold War, ceased to function, creating a real danger that the types of missiles it covered, with a flying time of a few minutes, could be deployed in various regions of the world, including Europe. That will inevitably lead to a further increase in tensions and a new spiral of political and military confrontation, making the risk of a nuclear apocalypse more likely. That is why we support immediate concerted action to preserve the Treaty\u2019s achievements in our shared home, the European continent. At the High-level Conference of Heads of Counter-Terrorism Agencies of Member States, held on 3 September in Minsk with the theme \u201cCountering terrorism through innovative approaches and the use of new and emerging technologies\u201d, President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus declared that Belarus, as a full- fledged signatory to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, has not withdrawn from it and does not intend to produce or deploy such missiles unless its security threatened.\nPresident Lukashenko has called for an initiative to develop a declaration on the part of responsible countries on the non-deployment of intermediate- and short-range missiles in Europe. We propose starting work on preparing a draft declaration as soon as possible and call on all States on both sides of the Atlantic that care about the fate of humankind to support us in that initiative. The United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe could be suitable platforms for that work. In our view, a key element of the declaration would be clear and firm commitments on the part of States to refraining from producing or deploying intermediate- and short-range missiles on their territory. We realize that implementing this initiative will require political will and a difficult negotiation process. But as a Latin saying has it, viam supervadet vadens \u2014 that is, to get to the end of the road, one has to keep walking \u2014 because, after all, there was a time when treaties banning chemical and biological weapons or reducing nuclear and conventional arsenals also seemed an impossible dream.\nEvery year we hear, including from this rostrum, more and more about the growing role of technology in the modern world. On the one hand, new technologies are emerging that open up unprecedented opportunities for progress in many areas of human life. On the other, there is the risk that technologies and resources could be used for criminal purposes. The recent drone attacks on infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, which only further destabilize the situation in the Middle East and in the Gulf region in particular, are a clear example of that. Belarus firmly condemns such acts, regardless of their perpetrators. The great Albert Einstein once said, very appositely, that \u201ctechnological progress is ... like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal.\u201d\nThe fact is, we are at the beginning of a long-term global process that people are already calling a technological arms race. The danger is that forces of evil are just as likely to exploit that race as forces of good, and it is our job to do everything possible to ensure that evil has no chance whatever to dominate. In the current context of tensions and growing competition between countries, cyberspace is increasingly becoming an arena of confrontation. We are constantly hearing about destructive hacker attacks. That all speaks to the scale of the threats in that area, and also to how crucial it is that we expand inter-State digital cooperation and improve mutual trust in the information arena.\nSpeaking in Minsk at the Conference of Counter-Terrorism Agencies, President Lukashenko proposed the establishment of a linked digital neighbourhood based on concluding bilateral and multilateral agreements for ensuring international information security. The key elements in the agreements could be the notions of digital sovereignty and neutrality, as well as the non-interference of countries in one another\u2019s information resources. Digital sovereignty should guarantee a State\u2019s ability to control its information space, prevent and block cyberattacks, and reliably protect its critical digital infrastructure. Digital neutrality would imply that countries would undertake no actions in cyberspace that would be detrimental to other States\u2019 security. Such agreements could ultimately lay the groundwork for developing international rules for responsible conduct in cyberspace. Through these agreements, as President Lukashenko put it, waves of digital security could be launched, strengthening ties between countries and enhancing the effectiveness of concerted action against terrorist threats in cyberspace. Belarus is ready to develop cooperation and strengthen ties in the area of international information security with every country in the world, and especially its neighbours.\nThe global economy has also been affected by the turbulence in today\u2019s world, becoming increasingly feverish as the scope of digital trade and financial flows grows ever greater. Economic cooperation at the regional level is growing and people\u2019s welfare is improving in many parts of the world. Significant regional integration initiatives are being implemented. There are also many problems in this area, however. Political differences between countries are taking the form of protectionism and sanctions. Speculation in financial markets continues. Artificial barriers have been created to prevent a number of countries from joining the World Trade Organization. The world\u2019s leading economies are engaged in a full-scale trade war, which only makes it harder to solve problems and increases the risk of real war. The language of unilateral coercive measures, which has no place in the United Nations, remains a reality in relations with a number of countries, including freedom-loving Cuba.\nAll of that leads to another acute problem, which is the inequitable nature of economic globalization. In the opinion of many, it has not turned out to be the rising tide that lifts all boats. What actually happens is that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The potential for cooperation between regional economic blocs is not being fulfilled. That issue deserves special attention. Some analysts predict that the future global order will be a world built around regions rather than major Powers. Indeed, life has shown us that wherever regional integration is successful, the chances of political fragmentation diminish.\nWe firmly believe that regional processes must cooperate effectively with one another. Belarus is an actively participant in various regional integration blocs. Moreover, for a number of years we have consistently worked to establish partnerships and cooperation among integrating alliances. In Minsk in 2020, as President of the Eurasian Economic Union, Belarus plans to host its first forum on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in cooperation with the Eurasian Economic Commission. That will not only help the countries that our partners in the Eurasian bloc to synchronize watches and share their experiences on issues related to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, it will also enable the Eurasian Economic Union region to speak with its own unique voice in the global debates on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, raise common issues and help to highlight our States\u2019 diversity. As a matter of principle, Belarus believes that regional economic organizations must be actively involved as effectively as possible in efforts to implement the SDGs, in order to help coordinate the economic policies of regional blocs\u2019 member States. That can create a multiplier effect for national economies, which are the backbone of the entire system of regional and global sustainability. Progress in that direction, along with Belarus\u2019s proposal for a comprehensive dialogue on security, could be an important contribution to overcoming our geopolitical uncertainty.\nI would like to focus on one more important topic. Against the backdrop of the world\u2019s ever-increasing population and the resulting growth in the exploitation of the Earth\u2019s limited resources, we can see that the problem of climate change is becoming more acute. We are probably very close to a point of no return if we do not take decisive action. The efforts of the international community to reduce emissions are so far clearly lagging behind the devastating processes of climate change. The Climate Action Summit, which was recently held at the United Nations Headquarters, offers hope for consolidating the international community\u2019s efforts and implementing meaningful initiatives to reduce emissions. As a responsible participant in the collective efforts to combat climate change, Belarus intends to make an unconditional commitment to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by a minimum of 35 per cent of its 1990 levels by 2030 and will exclusively use its own resources to do so. Launching an incentivizing mechanism for the transfer of advanced knowledge and technologies to developing countries, along with climate investments, would be a powerful driver for the transition to a low-carbon economy.\nToday, on the eve of its anniversary, the United Nations and the whole world are facing their next important frontier. We will be able to cross that symbolic boundary if we can succeed in finding the right answers to our existing and emerging challenges on the politics, economy and technology fronts. To that end, it is more crucial than ever that we restore confidence in relations between States at the global and regional levels. We must learn once again how to be good neighbours and solve problems together in our home, our planet. Belarus is ready to continue to contribute in that regard, in every format and on various platforms, including in Minsk. The important thing is that we work to make our world a calmer, fairer and cleaner place and to give our peoples hope for peace and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "Building a rules based world, promoting dignity and universal values, surmounting the climate challenge and launching humankind on the path to sustainable development \u2014 those are the commitments that should bring us together.\nEach country and nation has its own history and benchmarks, but every human being carries within themselves a spark of freedom, a thirst for emancipation and those universal values that nothing and no one should be able to undermine. That is the meaning of the Charter of the United Nations that unites us.\nIn a changing world, to use the words of Jacques Chirac, there is no greater risk than standing still. Multilateralism is about movement and continuous dialogue, first to better understand each other and even more to respect each other and build a foundation of trust. Of course, there will be many differences of opinion, people will often refuse to compromise and misunderstandings are possible. History always shows, however, that progress comes from cooperation. To be patriotic is to love one\u2019s own and wish the best not only for them but also for others \u2014 that is the very essence of our Organization. It is not a matter of opposing, dividing or regressing; on the contrary, it is a question of connecting, bringing together, strengthening and better committing oneself with the strongest of bonds \u2014 universal values and the rule of law.\nThree global challenges are today testing humankind: climate change, sustainable development, and peace and security. We know that those three challenges are intrinsically linked. Tireless determination, innovation and intelligence are more necessary than ever. We need multilateralism that is bold, brave and enterprising.\nBack in the nineteenth century, Victor Hugo already understood that \u201cNature speaks and humankind does not listen\u201d. Our Secretary-General just a few days ago, in words as apt as urgent, perfectly expressed the urgent need to take action on the climate challenge. In my view, there is no room to be paralysed by fear or anger, which are always bad advisers. It is on the contrary a question of translating the appeals to our conscience into positive and irreversible forces, seeking the remedy with a clear mind and taking bold action.\nThe impact of climate change becomes more evident and destructive by the day. The most recent estimates show that change is accelerating and that the efforts made to date are not enough. In that regard, the vast majority of European States have committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050. I also welcome the Chilean initiative to achieve climate neutrality in keeping with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nSafeguarding our biodiversity, forests and oceans must also be at the heart of our joint actions. Climate change is having a structural impact on food security, migration and even stability in many countries. But it is our responsibility not to fall into the fearful trap of catastrophism \u2014 the transition to carbon neutrality can and must offer positive opportunities for the development and improving our way of life.\nInnovation, technology, initiative and freedom of enterprise are more crucial than ever and governments, businesses, start-ups, non-governmental organizations and citizens all share responsibility. My message is an optimistic one \u2014 we can and will succeed.\nMy country, Belgium, together with its European partners, is determined to do its part in our global effort, all the more since the reduction of the climate threat must be achieved by strengthening our capacity to attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which constitute the keystone of personal dignity and our collective security.\nIn discharging her duties as SDG Advocate with all of her heart, Queen Mathilde is demonstrating the sincere commitment of my country in the service of those noble objectives. Undeniable progress has been made on several fronts. Extreme poverty has reached its lowest level since records began. Infant mortality and infectious diseases are decreasing and access to drinking water, schooling and education are on the rise. The gains are real, but we know we still have an extremely long way to go. Every 11 seconds, a pregnant woman or newborn child dies somewhere in the world. Hundreds of millions of people do not currently have regular access to drinking water. Too many children do not have access to school and suffer every day from malnutrition.\nWe must continue to innovate and work towards progress. The private sector can play a major role in reducing poverty. We must promote free trade with reciprocal rules and ambitious social and environmental standards. Investments in basic infrastructure and technological innovation must also be expanded. New technologies, artificial intelligence and the data economy must, however, be better regulated and aligned with personal freedoms, respect for our private lives, and the protection of democratic values against any arbitrary intrusion into our freedom of conscience and expression.\nThe most recent report of the Secretary-General rightly shows that gender equality is central for overcoming development challenges. I am proud that the Deputy Prime Minister of Belgium, Alexander de Croo, makes a powerful appeal in that regard in his book The Age of Women. I share the belief that feminism is a matter for men as well.\nWe must change mindsets \u2014 a prosperous society depends on the talents of all its people. For that reason, all forms of discrimination must be fought \u2014 racism, antisemitism, homophobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia, hate speech are always devastatingly toxic, insidious, brutal and undignified forms of violence. In the words of Nelson Mandela, \u201cto be free is not merely to cast off one\u2019s chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others\u201d.\nWithout progress, peace is not possible; without peace, progress is not possible. For the sixth time in its history, my country, Belgium, is a non-permanent member of the Security Council. We contribute to the prevention and resolution of crises on a daily basis. We endeavour to make the protection of civilians, especially women and children, the top priority. Every peacekeeping operation, with its particular challenges, is necessary. Mandates must be more specific and better targeted. Effectiveness must be a constant requirement.\nWe also wish to pay attention to areas of tension and the seeds of conflict \u2014 situations not yet in the spotlight but which could quickly take centre stage should they deteriorate. We must detect the warning signs, tackle the root causes, invest in political dialogue, strengthen mediation, promote democratic values, encourage links among different groups, fight hate speech and stop impunity.\nThe world is changing. We want a better world that is more predictable. The multiplication of tensions and crises, if not defused swiftly enough, can spiral out of control, seriously threatening peace and security. In the Gulf region, an atmosphere of escalation is growing stronger, threatening not only regional but also global stability. Oil facilities in the Strait of Hormuz are strategically important for the global economy. We call on all actors concerned to refrain from any unilateral measures likely to inflame tensions. We must avoid any incident liable to trigger ever worse consequences. We call for restraint and dialogue to open the way towards a more stable and secure future in the Gulf region.\nA divergence of views on the nuclear deal with Iran generated the current tensions. We continue to support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. We call for discussions to resume on all subjects of concern \u2014 the nuclear question, Iran\u2019s role in the region and its ballistic missile programme. We therefore express out full support to the mediation efforts under way at the initiative of France.\nThe situation in Syria also remains cause for concern. We are worried by the escalation of violence in and around Idlib. In the Security Council we have taken, together with Germany and Kuwait, a position against the escalating violence, proposing a humanitarian draft resolution last week aiming to achieve a ceasefire and protect the millions of civilians living that area. We regret that, despite broad support, the draft resolution was subject to a double veto. The bombing of civilian populations, schools and hospitals in no way advances the fight against terrorism; rather, it likely helps fuel terrorism.\nWe will not abandon the Syrian people. There is no military solution to that conflict. Only a political process under the auspices United Nations will make it possible to bring it to an end. The establishment of the Constitutional Committee is a step in the right direction.\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been on the agenda of the General Assembly for decades, yet today peace seems a more remote possibility than ever. The situation on the ground is deteriorating, violence and mistrust are reinforcing each other and settlements are actively continuing. Nonetheless, we must promote the emergence of a just and lasting peace in the interests of both the Palestinians and Israelis and of the region as a whole.\nThe parameters for a just and lasting peace are well recognized. International law is the cornerstone of the multilateral order and any initiative seeking to circumvent it only fuels further injustice and conflict. The aim must remain to create an independent sovereign, democratic and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its neighbours. Israel must enjoy peace and security within secure and internationally recognized borders.\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Belgium\u2019s leading international cooperation partner, we continue to work side by side with the population. The first steps towards the expansion of political space, such as the release of political prisoners, are heartening, although immense challenges remain to better meet the legitimate expectations and aspirations of the population. We will support all positive forces seeking to contribute to forging a better future for that great country at the heart of Central Africa.\nTurning to the Sahel, the security situation is deteriorating despite the actions of the States of the region and the efforts of the international community. Insecurity is spreading and inter-ethnic conflict, fanned by the proliferation of militias, is being capitalized upon by terrorist groups, which are steadily extending their murderous reach beyond the Group of Five for the Sahel countries to threaten neighbouring countries as well. Flows of displaced persons are intensifying, cultures are in danger and the humanitarian situation is overwhelming the region\u2019s populations. We need to mobilize side by side with the States of the Sahel and we must uphold our commitments to them.\nWe are not rid of terrorism. The fall of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria does not signal the end of its deadly criminal ideology. Da\u2019esh continues its indoctrination and threatens innocent and vulnerable targets as well as law enforcement, seeking to spark radicalization with an absolute cynicism and relentlessly stirring up hatred and anxiety.\nMy country, like many others, has been directly afflicted by the cowardice of terrorism. We must be tireless and fearless in our fight against violent extremism. Prevention and suppression must be more effective. International cooperation will be crucial here, too, to eradicate the scourge that inflicts such sorrow on our world.\nThe shared dream we must all work to realize is that of a world that is more stable, more predictable and more just. To our children and their children in turn, we wish to leave a planet that is healthier, better living standards, rights and freedoms. No border can interrupt that universal dream.\nEradicating the climate threat, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and working tirelessly for peace and security will require broad and unwavering determination. Preventing conflicts at an early stage and defusing them, dealing peacefully with disputes, weaving the fabric of dialogue and nurturing the bonds of trust, that is what we believe is necessary to live up to the Charter of the United Nations, which obliges us to enact those binding universal values and, above all, to live up to the humanity that resides in the heart and soul of everyone one of us.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I wish to assure you, Mr. President, of Armenia\u2019s full support for your leadership during this seventy-fourth session. I also want to express our profound gratitude to Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, for her effective leadership and important legacy.\nThis is my second opportunity to represent my country in this Hall as Prime Minister of Armenia. Momentous changes have been taking place in our country since my previous appearance at the General Assembly (see A/73/PV.7). Parliamentary elections were held in Armenia last December. For the first time in about 25 years, those elections and their results were fully accepted by our public and not contested by any political party. They received the best possible assessment from international observers, who hailed them as free, fair and transparent. That was a major achievement of the Armenian people\u2019s non-violent velvet revolution of 2018.\nArmenia\u2019s peaceful revolution received praise and recognition from the international community. International media groups acknowledged Armenia\u2019s role in the global democratic surge as providing hope for global democracy. In recognition of our democratic achievements, The Economist magazine proclaimed Armenia \u201ccountry of the year\u201d in 2018. Our determination to advance democracy and reforms is solid, uncompromising and unwavering. It is based on the strong mandate of our people, to whom we are accountable in delivering reforms, securing justice, improving economic and social conditions and developing our nation.\nOur democratic transformation and zero-tolerance policy on corruption are not without resistance from corrupted former elites, whose vast financial resources are directed at escaping justice. Our Government has not pursued a single case of property redistribution. At the same time, our resolve to press forward with reforms and ensuring justice is unwavering. Our mass media are completely free of Government control or interference. However, some are not free from meddling and control by the same old circles in the former Government and are fabricating fake news and spreading mistrust in the public domain about the origins and purposes of the velvet revolution.\nDespite such challenges, our resolve to promote and protect the freedom of the media is unrelenting. We have witnessed plenty of suspicion about the nature and purposes of our revolution. Some believe that the revolution was instigated by global competitors in our region. Others have asked, \u201cif they are not behind this revolution, who else could have done it?\u201d. From this rostrum, I would like to firmly state once again that the velvet revolution in Armenia was carried out by its proud citizens in a manifestation of their will to reject corruption and the abuse and monopolization of power, as well as the consistent falsification of elections and political fraud.\nThere is absolutely no need to reproach the free expression of will of the Armenian people, who are their country\u2019s ultimate sovereign in the sight of the international community. The political transformations in Armenia represent the fulfilment of a dream to have a free, democratic and happy country \u2014 a dream that was born in the late 1980s, at the end of the Cold War, and that led our people to independence.\nArmenia\u2019s non-violent people\u2019s velvet revolution is proof of the potential of democratic change in the contemporary world. Yet the revolution was just the beginning of our mission and probably the easiest part of it. We are currently in a new, more important and difficult stage of our mission. We would like to prove that democratic transformation in Armenia is sustainable. We are proud to have already delivered some concrete results. Our economy is growing steadily and quite rapidly, thanks to a very important ideological transformation that has occurred in our country.\nThe individual effort of every citizen does matter. That principle is the most important driving force of our economic revolution, and the most important mission of our Government is to inspire and convince our citizens to trust their talent and ability to make real changes. Individual efforts have been the main driver of the success of our political revolution. Before the revolution, only a small group of people believed that individual efforts could bring about political changes in our country, but today that is a commanding idea for the overwhelming majority of Armenian citizens. Our overall goal is therefore to accomplish an economic revolution in exactly the same way that the political revolution was achieved earlier.\nThe reform and strengthening of institutions are the most powerful instruments we possess in addressing the challenges that democratic Armenia is facing today. Immediately after coming to power, we initiated a package of drastic measures to establish the democratic institutions that never previously existed in our country, such as efforts to establish an independent judiciary, anti-corruption bodies and a level playing field for all economic and political players. The empowerment of women is another area in which we have taken bold steps to register visible results.\nThe most important part of our institutional reforms is education. We believe that only through promoting education can we make our democracy irreversible and achieve sustainable economic growth. Our vision is to make lifelong education a nationwide activity for all layers of our society, from children to adults. The Armenian Government is determined to continue its institutional reforms, but we also count on the support of the international community to stand with the young Armenian democracy to address its challenges. We need to have access to international best practices to save time and resources. We need to avoid the mistakes previously made by other democracies in order to make our democratic reforms more fruitful and efficient.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all our international partners who are fully committed to assisting our reform agenda. In particular, we are grateful to the United Nations and its programmes and agencies, as well as regional partners such as the European Union and the Council of Europe. As I mention the United Nations, our global Organization embracing the whole of the international community, I hope that all members of that international community would like the Armenian democracy to succeed.\nUnfortunately, the world has not become a safer place for all of us this year. It is difficult to find any region in the world that has not been destabilized or affected by tensions in its neighbourhood. Two of the four international borders of Armenia, including the border with Turkey, have been closed for almost three decades. By refusing to establish diplomatic relations with Armenia, overtly assisting Azerbaijan against Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh, Turkey remains a serious security threat to Armenia and the Armenian people, who have experienced the deep tragedy of genocide and continue to face the fierce denial of truth and justice.\nThe various degrees of tension existing in relations among our neighbours and strategic partners create very challenging circumstances for us. Russia is our key strategic partner and ally, while Georgia and Iran are our strategic neighbours, and we have a strategically significant agenda and partnership with the United States, the European Union and its Member States. We observe with concern the various disagreements among our friends, strategic partners and allies.\nThose realities present us with significant challenges because we face the persistent risk of not being correctly understood by some of our friends \u2014 or even worse, by any of them. We are doing our best to remain a reliable partner and a good friend to all of them without damaging our relations with any of them, without promoting relations with one partner at the expense of another. We will continue to invest every effort into making our region\u2019s geopolitical environment safer.\nThe peaceful settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict is of crucial importance to the stability and security of our region. Since my very first day in office I have been taking steps in that context, and I publicly stated that any solution to the Nagorno Karabakh conflict must be acceptable to the peoples of Armenia, Nagorno Karabakh and Azerbaijan. It is noteworthy that I was the first Armenian leader to voice such a position about the settlement of the conflict. I was heavily criticized in my country for proposing such a formula to resolve the conflict, which places the three parties of the conflict on an equal footing.\nNevertheless, I strongly believe that this is the only way to achieve a peaceful and lasting settlement of the conflict because it offers a possibility for compromise, mutual respect and balance. I introduced the formula not only publicly but also within the negotiations being conducted under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group co-chairmanship.\nIn order to enable us to move forward, I expected a similar statement from Azerbaijan. However, Azerbaijan\u2019s highest authorities have maintained their position, which is based on a solution to the Nagorno Karabakh conflict that is acceptable only to the people of Azerbaijan. What does that really mean? It means that the Azerbaijani authorities have no intention of resolving the conflict.\nInstead, they want to defeat the people of Nagorno Karabakh. They do not want to seek any compromise. What they aim at is revenge for their unsuccessful attempted aggressions against the people of Nagorno Karabakh in the 1990s and in 2016. That is why they are inflaming anti-Armenian sentiments among their people and spending enormous resources on armaments, and why anti-Armenian hate speech has become official policy in Azerbaijan.\nIn fact, the Azerbaijani authorities want to bring back the Soviet-era status of Nagorno Karabakh, but that is a futile effort because the people of the Soviet-era Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Region declared their independence and exercised their right to self-determination, as did Azerbaijan in seceding from the Soviet Union. That position of Azerbaijan is tantamount to claiming the restoration of the former Soviet Union.\nThe Azerbaijani Government presents the Nagorno Karabakh conflict as a territorial dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. We totally disagree with such an interpretation of the conflict. It is not a dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It is not about territorial claims. It is about people, about real men and women and their right to live in their homeland as their ancestors lived over many centuries. Unfortunately, the Azerbaijani authorities do not want to talk to those people or negotiate with them because they want to have the territories but not the people. To be more precise, they want the territories without the people.\nIt is very important to explain the reason why I am referring to that part of the story. Do the members of the Assembly think that I want to contribute to the tension in our region? Of course not. On the contrary, I want to make it clear that the conflict of Nagorno Karabakh is a very complicated and painful issue for the peoples of the region and that it is impossible to settle it without hard and consistent work \u2014 without a compromise, mutual respect and balance. I therefore wish to invite my Azerbaijani counterpart, President Ilham Aliyev, to accept the formula that will create the conditions for a breakthrough in the peace process. Any solution to the Nagorno Karabakh conflict must be acceptable to the people of Armenia, the people of Nagorno Karabakh and the people of Azerbaijan. We need to work together to translate this formula into reality.\nA few days ago, we celebrated Armenia\u2019s Independence Day. Twenty-eight years ago, Armenia became a full member of the international community as a sovereign nation, regaining its place and role in the global arena. We are benefactors of international cooperation and contributors to fulfilling its security, development and human rights agenda. We greatly value effective multilateralism. We work with all our partners, both at the international and regional levels, to advance global security, fight against international terrorism and champion non-proliferation, nuclear security and peacekeeping operations. Armenia participates in international peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, Mali, Kosovo and Afghanistan, and has been conducting a humanitarian mission in Syria delivering medical assistance and providing humanitarian mine clearance for the benefit of the civilian populations affected by the crisis.\nThe benefits of effective multilateralism are strongly reflected in our global efforts aimed at advancing cooperation in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In Armenia, the process of incorporating the SDGs into our national plans complements the launch of an ambitious transformational national strategy for 2050, which involves 16 megagoals that embrace all the SDGs.\nThe priorities of advancing education, innovation, smart development and an inclusive and participatory political and economic environment illustrate the interlinkages that exist between development and human rights. Further advancing the role of women and youth is also of critical importance for Armenia. We will continue to focus on all these issues in both our domestic and international agendas.\nEnhancing our integration of economic and environmental policies is very important. Having registered a 1.3\u00b0C average annual temperature increase, Armenia is already confronting the negative effects of climate change. To address this global challenge, we have been working to develop an innovative climate-finance mechanism, which is part of Armenia\u2019s national pledge for the United Nations Climate Action Summit.\nPromoting sustainable development and human rights should be an inclusive process. Sustainable development should be made accessible to everyone, regardless of political status or geographical location. No one should be left behind, including the people of Nagorno Karabakh, who should have access to the same tools of sustainable development that are available to others. Nagorno Karabakh should be able to benefit from international financial and technical assistance, so as to strengthen human rights, eradicate poverty, improve education, respond to climate change and build an inclusive society.\nAs a democratic country and a reliable member of the international community, Armenia will continue to make its contribution to international cooperation in order to maintain global peace and security, promote sustainable development and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms. We are committed to maintaining a constructive dialogue with all international partners to address common challenges and bring progress and prosperity to our nations. We are against dividing lines and the policy of confrontation. We are against closed borders, which in the twenty-first century are considered redundant and unacceptable and yet still continue to exist in our region.\nAs a nation that has experienced the horrors of genocide in the past, we stand for promoting mutual understanding and peace in our volatile region. Escalation and arms-race policies based on illusory hopes for military superiority have no future in the South Caucasus. The peoples of our region deserve to live in peace and prosperity, freely exercise their human rights and freedoms, and build a brighter future for themselves and their children.\n"

        "file_text": "Today, the General Assembly will adopt the Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting to Review Progress Made in Addressing the Priorities of Small Island Developing States through the Implementation of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway (resolution 74/3). Its value is to hasten the attainment of the sustainable development agenda of small island developing States (SIDS) agreed in Samoa five years ago.\nEndorsing the Political Declaration is the easy part. Claiming ownership of it takes courage. Delivering on promises and making good on undertakings pledged to fully implement the SAMOA Pathway by 2024 is the seal of true leaders.\nThe themes of our high-level meetings this week are well and truly intertwined. Issues from addressing a climate emergency to providing rights-based universal health coverage and calling for increased resources to fast track collective action, underpinned by a desire for a peaceful and secure world, are the pillars of the SAMOA Pathway, the blueprint for the sustainable development of small island developing States.\nAs a Pacific island leader, today my main message will again be, as it has consistently been for the past 21 consecutive years that I have attended the general debate in this Hall, on climate change \u2014 the embodiment of Samoa\u2019s realities, aspirations and priority policy concern now and well into the future.\nWhen SIDS first told the world that their coastlines were eroding, the sea level was rising and climate change was humanly induced, some Member States scorned the notion and did not take our concerns seriously. Instead, they wanted scientific evidence to back up our claim, probably as a cover to stall and frustrate our resolve. Yet when the world\u2019s top scientists \u2014 including some of their own nationals \u2014 scientifically validated our concerns, including in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on the imperative of keeping global warming below 1.5 \u00b0C, some countries refused to accept the evidence and continue to use every opportunity to discredit such reports.\nScience has spoken. The message is loud and clear. We cannot use it selectively or only when it suits a specific agenda. Climate change is real. Climate change is here. It is having an impact on us with far greater frequency and severity. It is a security risk of far greater proportions than many people are willing to admit. Sadly, it could lead to the demise of some sovereign nations that are low-lying atolls and small island States. There is a misguided notion that portrays climate change as a concern only of the small island developing States; nothing could be further from the truth. Climate change crosses borders uninvited and does not discriminate by size or economic status. It has an impact on every country, although it affects some \u2014 such as small island developing States \u2014 more extensively than others, owing to their particular and unique vulnerabilities.\nTimes are changing. The world has witnessed epic occurrences of horrific natural disasters in recent times, on a scale unprecedented in the 74-year history of our Organization. Tsunamis, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding, bush fires and droughts have resulted in the loss of countless lives and untold suffering, setting back the development of some countries by years. Climate change will impact all of us sooner or later. Climate change is a global problem requiring a decisive response from the world community. It should unite rather than divide us. The challenges posed by and solutions to climate change are already common knowledge, yet we have failed to deliver the ambitious global actions that are necessary to address the root causes of climate change through compromise. We must accept basic climate logic. We need to shift the focus in the climate change relationship from a donor-victim to a partnership approach. Owing to the universality of climate change, partnerships should provide the impetus to finding solutions in a decisive manner.\nApportioning blame for past wrongs will not restore our environment to its early, pristine state. Our focus should always be on today and tomorrow, and not on yesterday and what should have been. Entrenched positions that are devoid of today\u2019s realities and in pursuit of unrelated agendas do not have a role in our collective effort. No one should stay detached from and unconcerned by our common plight. We must work together with a sense of urgency and commitment in order to address climate change now. It should not be the science alone that recommends what we should do, but also our conscience and the political will to follow through.\nThe United Nations remains our last and best hope to provide the political will and commitment necessary to turn the tide against climate change. Nations in leadership roles are called to account in doing the right thing for our global family. We want leaders who view the world as a single constituency in which everyone must work together within the limits of their capacity and capability to be part of the total solution. Leadership is calling. True leaders should lead from the front, all the time. The cooperation of every country will be necessary if we are to win the climate change battle.\nWe must be innovative and listen to the voices of our young people. Their voices ring of boldness, passion and honesty. Their advocacy is untainted by ulterior motives or hidden agendas. They are determined to do the heavy lifting and prepared to go the extra mile in order to ensure that we do not irreversibly ruin the future of the planet that rightly belongs to them. They deserve nothing less.\nSamoa is thankful to the United Nations for the vital role it has played during our journey as a mandated territory and independent State. As a small island State with no defence force and an unarmed police service, our membership of the United Nations is grounded on the promise of peace, the rule of law, equality and justice, which the United Nations offers to all of its States Members. The dynamics of the new global agenda continue to test the resolve of our Organization. Unity for the common good is needed now more than ever so that nations and peoples can live in peace and advance towards a common prosperity. Only through cooperation and multilateral joint effort can we hope to guarantee human rights, achieve peace and security and effectively pursue sustainable development. The United Nations remains uniquely suited to the pursuit and coordination of global initiatives to attain those objectives, including efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion, as highlighted in the theme of this year\u2019s session.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s visit to the Pacific this year was timely, given his leadership in calling for ambitious and transformational climate action. The visit allowed him to see and experience first-hand the scale of the challenges facing Pacific small island countries, and we commend his determination to share the messages of the Pacific peoples through the recently concluded Climate Action Summit. The Secretariat and agencies of the United Nations are key partners for the blue Pacific continent in addressing some of our regional priorities, such as climate change, resilience, oceans, fisheries, gender equality, human rights, SIDS and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe Pacific Resilience Facility is a game-changing regional initiative for the blue Pacific and its peoples. Its key purpose is to provide predictable, sustainable, accessible and accountable grant funding for disaster-risk preparedness to ensure that Pacific communities are safe and resilient. It fills a critical financing gap in the Pacific, as the Facility focuses on small-scale and low-quantum disaster-risk preparedness projects that are not widely supported or financed by major development partners, including multilateral development banks. It also complements the existing priorities and efforts of national Governments and development partners in building the resilience of Pacific countries and communities. There is room for support from the international community. Furthermore, during this week we have heard of the importance of deepening dialogue to find solutions to the challenges of the practice of de-risking, considered to be an existential threat to small island States by putting them at risk of losing access to the global financial system and by enhancing vulnerability.\nWe welcome the recommendation for the establishment of a United Nations multi-country office in the northern Pacific. That is an important delivery of the promise for better engagement, presence and United Nations system support for the Pacific region. It is also a tangible contribution to some of the asks of the SAMOA Pathway.\nOn the United Nations development system reform, we welcome the support extended to the United Nations Resident Coordinators in their new role, with real additional human resources on the ground to implement other aspects of the reform. The United Nations should deliver as one, both in rhetoric and in practice, to avoid duplication of responsibilities and a clear definition of roles against diminishing resources. We hope that the Resident Coordinator reform will provide a harmonized, effective and efficient response to the priority needs of Member States. Close collaboration with the Pacific regional organizations is critical.\nI wish to re-emphasize the importance of the multi-country office based in Samoa given our firm commitment to the partnership with the United Nations and our confidence in what we can also contribute to the United Nations agenda for Samoa\u2019s people, as well as for the Pacific, SIDS and the United Nations family.\nDevelopment, security and human rights are mutually reinforcing pillars of the United Nations. Equal progress on all three fronts should be the norm, not the exception. As the Secretary-General rightly put it during his opening statement this week, every measure to uphold human rights helps to deliver sustainable development and peace (see A/74/PV.3).\nThe sector-wide approach that Samoa has adopted in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) allows us to enforce the three pillars of sustainable development. That will be an important part of our preparations for our second voluntary national review in 2020 given our commitment to adopting a human rights approach to the implementation of the SDGs. Aligning the reporting and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and the SAMOA Pathway with the Universal Periodic Review under the Human Rights Council and the other human rights conventions will be a challenge. However, this will not be insurmountable. If successful, it will be an important development in meeting our international obligations and in utilizing our limited resources efficiently.\nWe believe in embracing inclusiveness and ensuring citizens\u2019 rights to development, including through the proper engagement of the key vulnerable groups, such as women, girls, children, the elderly and persons with disabilities. Transparency and accountability are also crucial to the implementation process. In Samoa, our audit office has therefore recently prepared a performance audit of the preparedness for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals for our country. Building on synergies and addressing gaps to ensure better prioritization will definitely help to galvanize support for implementing the SDGs, thereby addressing poverty eradication, supporting quality education, mobilizing climate action and leading to more effective inclusion.\nIn addition to the climate crisis, we see continued conflicts, rising terrorism, disrupted peace processes, mass displacements, trade wars and growing tensions worldwide. Even our usually peaceful Pacific region was not spared from the reaches of terrorism, as witnessed in the Christchurch terrorist attacks. No country can win the war against terrorism on its own and only by pooling our resources and working collaboratively do we stand a chance of defeating that senseless menace.\nWe continue to look to the United Nations to bring Member States together to be part of the solution to make it an agent of change and an assurance of hope during these challenging times. All contributions matter and are very important. We take pride in our police peacekeepers deployed to the Sudan and South Sudan, including our active engagement in the disarmament agenda. We continue to advocate for respect for the rule of law and we recently co-hosted the women, peace and security summit for the Pacific. That was to support the promotion and implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on the United Nations women and peace and security agenda. The Pacific highlighted the importance of heeding the call of the Pacific Islands Forum leaders to ensure that traditional and cultural norms be acknowledged and considered as an underpinning imperative of all security initiatives under the regional security plan.\nIn addition, we hosted the second Pacific Islands round table on international humanitarian law, which looked at ways to promote the principles of the Geneva Conventions, as well as encouraging the region to ratify key weapons treaties, such as the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and the Arms Trade Treaty.\nThis year we ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, bringing to six the number of core human rights conventions to which we are a State party. We are endeavouring to meet our commitment to ratifying all nine core human rights conventions before our next Universal Periodic Review and will continue to advocate for the importance of our Samoan culture and the role of the churches in promoting human rights for all in Samoa.\nLet me conclude by again referring to the SAMOA Pathway, with which I started my address. I am very pleased that five years since its adoption through resolution 69/15, there has been positive progress and concrete developments in terms of not only the United Nations system response to SIDS issues but also the dedicated attention of the international community to SIDS priorities. While there is still more to be done, I am confident that, in the spirit of genuine and durable partnerships, exciting developments are taking place to further assist SIDS in the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals, as encapsulated in the SAMOA Pathway.\n"

        "file_text": "Ghana presents its compliments to the President, a worthy representative of our great neighbour the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and congratulates him heartily on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. We also want to express our appreciation to the President of the seventy-third session for her work and to commend the brave theme that has been selected for our consideration during this session.\nI note that there is a United Nations-accepted definition of poverty, which, like everything undertaken by our Organization, tries to find a form of words that is acceptable to all of us. However, it is probably fair to say that those of us who live in States generally referred to as developing countries are somewhat bemused by arguments and complicated definitions of poverty. For us, poverty is a daily reality that we live with and feel, for far too many of our people are burdened with it, and it robs us of the dignity that should be the inherent right of every human being. We know that our performance as Governments will be judged by how successful we are in reducing and eventually eradicating poverty in our countries. As individual sovereign countries, the responsibility is ours not only to aim at reducing poverty but to actually create prosperity for all our citizens. We in Ghana are certainly engaged in fighting to eradicate poverty from our country. If the world wants to marshal all its undoubted energies to support that fight, there can be no better way to start than an acknowledgement and a consensus among the nations of the world that poverty anywhere degrades us all, whether in the developed or developing world.\nLuckily for us, technological advances are short- circuiting the path that leads us out of poverty, and it is no longer the long and tortuous road it used to be. A mere 20 years ago, mobile phones were a rarity that some feared would become a developed-world status symbol and another sign of the technology gap between rich and poor. Today the poorest person in the most inaccessible place in the poorest country has a mobile phone \u2014 often a smartphone. In many ways, that has transformed our lives. In the year 2000 in Ghana, there were 90,000 mobile-phone subscribers; today there are more than 41 million. That has led to a remarkable change in the communications within our country and with the outside world. A sizeable and growing proportion of the population has been and continues to be brought into the formal banking sector by the mobile phone.\nThe application of technology can be the tool to set us on the road to prosperity. The modernization of agriculture through the application of technology could well turn out to be the fastest way to make the turnaround we seek. The young people of the world, especially in Ghana and Africa, have demonstrated their ingenuity and innovative prowess, and we need to enlist them fully in the fight. It would of course be an easier battle if trade practices were seen to be fairer and more equitable. The question still remains whether the rich nations are prepared for an equitable and fair trade order. It appears that they are not, and we must therefore continue to fight for a fairer world economic order.\nIt should not be lost on anyone that the minerals on which the world depends to move industry and manufacturing are mostly available in Africa, and yet we who own those fundamental resources by birthright have remained poor, while our minerals have brought vast wealth to nations and peoples outside our continent. It is also worth pointing out that not only do we not get a fair share of the wealth once it is extracted, our lands, environment and oceans are often left devastated by the process, and the competition to gain control over those minerals has often led to insecurity in our countries. I do not seek to blame outsiders for our problems, but since we are being urged to find multilateral solutions, I believe it is worth pointing out that unfairness in the economic order undermines the fight against poverty. Indeed, the flight of capital is continuing the foreign exploitation of Africa, represented by colonialism and imperialism. The report of the High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa, chaired by a highly respected former President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, has raised the lid on what many had always suspected but did not have the figures to support. According to that report, Africa is losing more than $50 billion annually through illicit financial outflows. Collaboration is certainly needed among the nations of the world to stop that rape of Africa.\nThe African Continental Free Trade Area, which recently came into effect and whose secretariat Ghana has the honour of hosting, is a major collective effort by Africa to get to grips with mastering its own development. It will be the world\u2019s largest free-trade area since the formation of the World Trade Organization, and will provide us with a vehicle to improve our trade among ourselves and an opportunity to exploit our abundant wealth and resources for the benefit of our peoples, as well as giving us protection in dealing with other trading blocs.\nThe fight to eradicate poverty is intrinsically linked to quality education, the second of the issues identified for special attention in the theme of this General Assembly session. Wherever quality education is available, there is usually prosperity. Throughout the ages, education has been the most equitable source of opportunities and has provided the fastest and most reliable route out of poverty. We in Ghana acknowledge that we need an educated and skilled population to be able to compete effectively in the world economy. We are therefore taking the courageous step of spending a substantial part of our national revenue \u2014 indeed, a third of our nation\u2019s budget \u2014 on education.\nWe can and should also employ technology to accelerate the provision of quality education to as many people as possible. Very soon, we might not have to enter classrooms or even the hallowed grounds of famous universities to gain access to the knowledge that used to be exclusively available in those institutions. It is possible now for our young people to listen to lectures and watch experiments by famous scientists and scholars on their smartphones and laptops, without ever setting eyes on or physically entering an Ivy League university. But to be able to benefit from these opportunities made possible by technology, we have to raise our infrastructure to a basic minimum level. We must provide reliable electricity and Internet services to the people in our towns and villages, so that they will truly be able to reap the benefits of the technology that brings quality education to all. We can then have a realistic expectation of a prosperous future.\nThe general debate of the General Assembly of the United Nations is usually convened at a time of year when extremes of nature are on display around the world. Maybe we are being urged to take notice, as well as \u2014 hopefully \u2014 to take practical and proactive steps to curb the human activities that are endangering our planet. Our world is enriched by its diversity of cultures, religions and beliefs, which add spice to our lives, but there are scientific and mathematical truths that do not change with space or time. We would all do well to uphold those truths. Now that the scientists have spoken on the realities of climate change, I believe it is time to direct our energies to what we can and should do to counteract the danger and end unnecessary arguments. Nature has been brutal this year, demonstrating to us that our climate is changing and that we are probably pushing our world towards destruction. The devastation wreaked by Cyclone Idai, Hurricane Dorian and the extreme summer temperatures across Europe surely provides the evidence, if any were still needed, that it is time to take action to bring our world back from the precipice.\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the historic landing on the moon, a seminal event that celebrated scientific achievement and humankind\u2019s triumph. The image that has stayed with me since I was 25 years old, and that still brings me true awe and wonder, is that picture of the Earth taken from the vantage point of the astronauts, clearly showing the truth of the one world that we inhabit. We may try to delineate our borders more clearly or make clearer distinctions on the basis of colour, race, language and creed, but that picture tells us that the natural path is to be inclusive.\nIn no way is this meant to paper over the many difficulties in our part of the world that we must work to overcome, or to suggest that because some parts of the world are developed and prosperous we can pretend that all is well with us, too. In my part of the world, we do not argue over what constitutes poverty. We know it, live with it and feel it because it is a daily reality. As the old saying goes, birds sing not because they have answers but because they have songs. There might not be any one answer to the theme of this seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly, but the hope is that the discussions will point us towards the possibility of a new world, in which collaboration between nations and peoples is on such a scale that we can dream of a sustainably prosperous world and achieve it too.\n"

        "file_text": "The international community stands at a crossroads. The decade starting in 2020 will either be remembered in history as a turning point or as the moment when multilateralism lost its way. Fortunately, the path forward is clear. Never before have we had such well-defined road maps for joint action on development, climate change and global health. I therefore congratulate the Secretary-General and his team, as well as the President of the General Assembly, for the relevance of this week\u2019s high-level events.\nThe transformational potential of universal health coverage is now at the top of the global health agenda, thanks to the outstanding leadership of the World Health Organization and many other stakeholders. In Rwanda, more than 90 per cent of the population have insurance coverage, which has contributed to significant improvements in health outcomes, showing that it is possible for countries at every income level to make health care affordable and accessible for all. We must also commit to replenish the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization. Those are not things that should or can be done on Africa\u2019s behalf.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are also Africa\u2019s goals. Africa has the means and the responsibility to fulfil them, which is why the African Union continues to strengthen its capabilities and effectiveness. Next July, for example, trading will commence under the African Continental Free Trade Area \u2014 the largest of its kind in the world.\nHowever, Africa continues to lag behind other regions on the Sustainable Development Goals despite the fact that our continent is home to several of the fastest growing economies in the world. Growth must be fully inclusive so that inequality within countries continues to diminish. The fundamentals needed to unlock that transformation are already in place. With a concerted push involving our partners, including in the private sector, it is indeed possible to make up for lost time and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Closer cooperation between the African Union and the United Nations is streamlining the implementation and measurement process and that good partnership will continue to grow stronger.\nAll around us we see the urgency of fulfilling our commitments to slow the pace of global warming and adapt our infrastructure to a changing climate. One key lesson of yesterday\u2019s Climate Action Summit was that innovative technologies and approaches are allowing us to act without slowing economic growth. Perhaps the most effective action that countries can take is to ratify and fully implement the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Security and sustainability are the prerequisites for rapid progress towards a more equitable and prosperous world.\nIt is essential for Africa and the rest of the international community to work closely together on peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts with mutual respect. In the coming weeks, Rwanda is preparing to receive and protect a number of refugees and asylum-seekers from detention camps in Libya. The support of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the African Union is greatly appreciated. We call on every Member of the United Nations to uphold their legal obligations in a spirit of solidarity.\nThose partnerships are a clear sign that we can cooperate to address complex problems. Africa itself is also a source of solutions. There is no doubt that the challenge of global inequality can be addressed only by working together. Rwanda stands ready to do its part, including by guaranteeing the rights and opportunities of women and girls. I therefore take this opportunity to invite Members to Kigali in November for the Global Gender Summit.\n"

        "file_text": "Under your presidency, Mr. President, the United Nations will commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of its founding. On this occasion, I ask everyone to recall, Sir, that my country, Japan, in upholding the principles of the United Nations, has walked a steadfast path, always intending to realize the goals of the Organization.\nFor the United Nations, which has now seen three quarters of a century since its founding, structural reform, especially of the Security Council, is absolutely imperative. We aim for the early realization of such reform. In addition, Japan is running in the 2022 election for a non-permanent seat in the Council. By once again receiving the support of numerous countries, we wish to serve as a non-permanent member of the Security Council and make our best efforts towards further realizing the principles of the United Nations. I ask the Member States for their ardent support to this end.\nIn Japan, a new Emperor has acceded to the imperial throne, and the ceremony at which His Majesty will declare this fact to both domestic and international audiences will soon take place, on 22 October. Heads of State and Government and major leaders from approximately 200 nations and international organizations will attend, and there is no greater joy than that of the well-wishing extended to us at the beginning of the Emperor\u2019s new era. The Japanese people consider this as an unparalleled opportunity, and they will once again turn their thoughts to the role that Japan is playing in the world.\nIn my country, the period during which a long-standing economic slump caused people to become inward-looking is now a thing of the past. Dates that are raising awareness of our strong bonds with the world and of our people\u2019s eyes turned outward and to the future \u2014 the Rugby World Cup, the fierce contests of which continue to be played out at this very moment; the Olympic and Paralympic Games that will be held next year in Tokyo; and World Expo 2025 that Osaka and the surrounding region will host \u2014 are written large on Japan\u2019s calendar as landmark events. In this context, there is a new generation of Japanese, one that is reliable and willing to carry forth the United Nations ideals, we can safely say.\nI would also like to remind the General Assembly of the meeting to be held in Japan in April 2020. The fourteenth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, commonly known as the United Nations Crime Congress, will convene in Kyoto. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime holds the meeting once every five years. Fifty years will have passed since 1970, when Japan hosted the same meeting, which was the first United Nations Crime Congress to be held outside Europe. At the peak of cherry blossom season, Kyoto will be welcoming visiting experts in law enforcement.\nMy remarks make it clear that the value Japan seeks to uphold in its engagement with the world is education, for the country\u2019s primary objective is to empower every single individual. To continue to do so has been and remains the very essence of what Japan can contribute to the rest of the world.\nAs for the gathering of law enforcement experts in Kyoto next spring, Japan has long sought to play a role in following up on thematic meetings. As early as 1962, with the expansion of knowledge in the area of crime prevention as its primary objective, Japan established in Tokyo the United Nations first specialized institute in that field, namely, the United Nations Asia and Far East Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders. The Institute was founded by the late Norval Morris, a renowned criminologist, who was its first Director. By the end of September, it will have produced a large number of alumni, totalling more than 5,900 people, including 2,949 from Asia and 678 from Africa.\nIn March, Malala Yousafzai visited Tokyo. She looked me straight in the eye and said that as many as 100 million girls lack the skills they need to have a good command of modern technology, for they do not undergo a minimum education of 12 years. She said that if all girls completed secondary school, they could contribute up to $30 trillion to the global economy. I had invited Malala to Japan before the Osaka summit of the Group of 20 (G-20), over which I would preside in June, hoping to highlight policies that empower women and girls.\nIf women were able to demonstrate the potential they hold, the world would sparkle even more, but that is obvious, is it not? In Japan, where the labour-participation rate for women has seen a marked rise, we are witnessing that self-evident fact on a daily basis. I am delighted that we were able to include what Malala is advocating in both the G-20 Leaders\u2019 Declaration and another outcome document in its annex. We pledged to promote inclusive quality education for all girls and women. Japan wishes to run at all times at the very front of the pack with respect to such efforts.\nNow, let me share an example from Tanzania. Around the time I was turning 30 years old, there was a Tanzanian marathon runner, Juma Ikangaa, who was often a front-runner in the Tokyo Marathon. After he returned to Tanzania, Mr. Ikangaa, who considers Japan to be his second home, became a goodwill public-relations ambassador for Japan through the local office of the Japan International Cooperation Agency. Also assigned to that office was an energetic Japanese national, Miwa Ito.\nMs. Ito and Mr. Ikingaa combined forces. She obtained sponsorship funding from 13 Japanese companies, and he searched for girls who could become future Olympians. Their efforts culminated in Tanzania\u2019s first-ever women\u2019s track meet, which was held in November 2017. A thousand elementary and junior high school-level girls living nearby were invited as spectators. However, they were not only there as onlookers; at the event educational materials on avoiding teenage pregnancy were distributed so that the girls could read them.\nIn Arusha, Tanzania, an area that the Maasai and others call home, where the high peak of Mount Kilimanjaro can be seen in the east and north-east, the Sakura All-Girls Secondary School opened in January 2016 through the efforts of a group of Japanese people. The school is entirely residential, in order to provide its students with absolute security and safety. The number of students has grown from 24 at the beginning to 162 this past spring. The Japanese Government supports the school financially, but it is run by non-governmental organizations, both Japanese and local. The school teaches science, technology, engineering and mathematics, as well as how to avoid unwanted pregnancies.\nIn Cambodia, a Japanese entrepreneur has been working to improve education there \u2014 a project that is entirely his own brainchild. His initiative is to send Japanese teachers \u2014 seasoned veterans in math and science \u2014 to Cambodia, where they coach young men and women who are on track to become teachers. The initiative is called Teachers Without Borders. I find it very heart-warming to see people in Japan\u2019s private sector devoting themselves voluntarily in this way to the education of young people, especially girls in Tanzania and Cambodia, purely on their own initiative, without seeking external validation.\nOver the next three years, the Government of Japan will provide enriched education to a minimum of 9 million children and young people in sub-Saharan African and Asian nations. We plan to expand e-learning for primary school children in Sri Lanka, as well as Internet-based mathematics and science education in Rwanda. I must say, however, that these endeavours have largely been inspired by the efforts undertaken by individuals in the private sector.\nThis is my seventh consecutive year to deliver a statement in the general debate at the General Assembly. Over these years, I have consistently emphasized the importance of empowering women and girls and the value of making health care universally available. This year, too, I have addressed these two issues at separate meetings on the sidelines. At the same time, I wish to emphasize that the essence of Japan\u2019s international engagement lies in the fact that we earnestly value education, as evidenced in Japan\u2019s aforementioned contributions. Japan aspires to be a foster Power, that is, one that fosters human capacity.\nAs I near the end of my remarks, I will briefly address three points.\nFirst, with regard to North Korea, Japan supports the approach President Trump has taken, which has allowed the two leaders to talk candidly with each other and try to work out the issues at hand, while looking ahead to a bright future. Such an approach has changed the dynamics with respect to North Korea. I myself am determined to meet Chairman Kim Jong-un face to face, without any conditions. Japan\u2019s steadfast objective is to normalize relations with North Korea by comprehensively resolving the outstanding issues of concern with the country, including abductions, nuclear and missile issues, and settling the unfortunate past.\nSecondly, Japan shares the concerns regarding the situation in the Middle East. The attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s crude-oil facilities was a contemptible crime that holds the international economic order hostage. I consider precious the pronouncement made to me directly by Supreme Leader Khamenei of Iran that he issued as a fatwa three repudiations regarding nuclear weapons, namely, not to possess, produce or use them, and has ensured the thorough implementation of that fatwa. This morning, too, I held a summit meeting with President Rouhani, our ninth in total. My own unchanging role is to call on Iran to take actions as a major Power that are grounded in the wisdom derived from its rich history.\nThirdly and finally, Japan will make use of multilateral frameworks and globalism to, inter alia, reduce disparities. On the heels of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Japan-European Union Economic Partnership Agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership is now poised to reach agreement, with Japan\u2019s contribution serving as its impetus. The world will become more connected, leading to more people being lifted from poverty.\nIn recent years, I have presided over summits of the Group of Seven and the G-20, and I have led the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) three times, demonstrating repeatedly that multilateral frameworks do indeed play a levelling role. As a result, the terms \u201cquality infrastructure\u201d and \u201ca free and open Indo-Pacific\u201d have entered the lexicon of the international community, of which I would like the Assembly to take note.\nThe seventh TICAD, held earlier this year, was reborn as the New TICAD, because the words used to talk about Africa should from now on, by all means, tell a story of investment and growth. In fact, the business forum held at the same time as TICAD was jam-packed with businessmen and women from Africa and Japan and electric with eager enthusiasm. I also left the forum with a sense that new investment proposals and new projects were quickly materializing.\nChanges in Africa encourage us. The world does indeed change. We are able to change it through the efforts that we make. And that confidence will be reaffirmed right here in this great Hall. With that, I conclude my statement.\n"

        "file_text": "I bring to President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande fraternal greetings on behalf of his Excellency David Arthur Granger, President of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana. I wish also to extend warm congratulations to him on behalf of the Government and the people of Guyana on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly, the importance of which is accentuated by the salience of the theme that he has chosen for our general debate. We assure him of the full support of Guyana in the discharge of the weighty responsibilities of his office.\nAllow me also to record our gratitude to your predecessor, Her Excellency Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her prudent and pragmatic stewardship of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. At the same time, we commend Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his continued sterling leadership of the Organization, including the timely convening of the Climate Action Summit. We express our thanks for the report on the work of the Organization (A/74/1) before us, which offers intriguing insights into the achievements within the last year and equally of the significant undertakings still ahead.\nIn that context, we cannot but reflect on the increasingly challenging international situation, marked by diverse crises, shifting global power dynamics and reversals of long-standing commitments and obligations. Together these aspects require an intrepid interrogation concerning the extant global order, including many of the principles and understandings made sacrosanct by the harsh experiences and lessons of many generations, which have given meaning and purpose to the establishment of the United Nations.\nAccordingly, it is evident that, while we have not succeeded sufficiently or satisfactorily in fully achieving the world envisaged at the birth of the United Nations in 1945, the centrality, vision and work of the United Nations have assumed increased, rather than diminished, importance in pursuit of the noble ideals enshrined in its Charter. Purposeful action must be embraced at the national and global levels on a range of urgent imperatives to withstand scepticism and preserve faith in our United Nations.\nWithin that context, Guyana is pursuing transformative action to secure its advance as a modern, cohesive and prosperous State, including through the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We have incorporated the 2030 Agenda into our national development strategy \u2014 the Green State Development Strategy: Vision 2040. This development strategy is Guyana\u2019s road map to becoming a green State. It emphasizes protecting our environment, enhancing prosperity and social cohesion and laying the foundation for the involvement of every citizen in sustaining a low-carbon trajectory of inclusive, diversified and climate-resilient growth.\nAs a low-lying coastal State, Guyana is particularly vulnerable to climate impacts. Indeed, Guyana understands well the risks posed by climate change, as we see daily evidence of damage to the coastal zone, frequency of flooding in the hinterland areas and extreme meteorological events. Guyana ranks high among the countries most vulnerable to natural disasters, which compels urgency on our part to institute adaptation and disaster-risk-reduction measures.\nHowever, beyond merely responding as an affected country, Guyana has long committed itself to exercising leadership in pursuing actions to help mitigate anthropogenic climate change. Guyana has established the importance of global environment services provided both using our natural resources and under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We have taken ambitious national action, particularly in partnership with Norway, which we trust will continue to resonate positively and globally. These actions include the creation of a greenhouse-gas inventory, the integration of climate change into academic curricula, and the Green Towns initiative.\nThe science is clear, and the recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has reaffirmed that the agreed goals for carbon emissions set out in the Paris Agreement are not sufficient to slow the rate of global warming, and that additional reductions are now required to slow and reverse the impacts of climate change. I take this opportunity to underscore that the existential threat posed by climate change demands the urgent effort of all actors. We therefore applaud the fruitful discussions and positive momentum generated by the Climate Action Summit held last Monday.\nOur experience has shown that whether in combating climate impacts, expanding economic benefits or consolidating democratic norms, extreme vigilance is required to safeguard hard-earned and cherished gains. Indeed, they must be attended to with great care to avoid reversals. For instance, while Guyana\u2019s consistent economic growth has been among the highest in our region for several years, resulting in the nation now being classified as a high middle-income country, graduation has not caused many of the persistent difficulties to disappear.\nIn the face of greater constraints in access to concessional resources, our growth has instead reinforced the need for fiscal prudence and stability to achieve our core national objectives, including the continued reduction of the burden of poverty and the provision of increased and equitable access to all basic social services, particularly with respect to education and health for all our citizens. This reality constrains us to be very studied in our approaches, and we reiterate the call for vulnerability to be taken into account as a valid criterion in determining development progress.\nIn the political realm, Guyana\u2019s strong record of achievements at the national and international levels is compelling. Much progress has been made in consolidating democratic norms and the rule of law. The rights and freedoms of all citizens are respected. In this regard, it is also evident that considerable progress realized under the coalition Government cannot be taken for granted. Since coming to office, local and regional elections, which had been held in abeyance for more than two decades, have been held twice within four years.\nGuyana has responded generously to the influx of men, women and children who have left our western neighbour, Venezuela, in recent times, as well as those from States of the Caribbean Community that have been affected by unprecedented natural disasters.\nLast July, Guyana submitted its inaugural voluntary national review to the 2019 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, held under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council. We reported significant progress, particularly with respect to several goals and reaffirmed our commitment to enhanced emphasis on quality education as a key entry point to developing synergies across the agenda as a whole, as well as the need for capacity support and partnership, especially in the area of data collection and management.\nIn addition, in response to the interplay of developments in the democratic exercise of the parliamentary and legislative arms of the Government, President David Arthur Granger has announced that national and regional elections will be held on 2 March 2020 to assure the democratic renewal of governance in Guyana.\nGuyana is on the verge of becoming a new oil- producing nation, with its attendant significant opportunities and challenges. Extensive preparation is under way to guarantee the responsible management of the new resources. A future of considerable promise for all the peoples of Guyana therefore beckons, and it is they who will determine the course, outcome and legacy that we will bequeath to succeeding generations.\nTo that end, President Granger has declared a decade of development for all Guyanese that will focus on ensuring that all of us can enjoy the good life, especially through enhanced educational outcomes at all levels and the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women, which includes addressing the challenge of domestic violence. Guyana\u2019s focus on education is rooted in the conviction that our people are our greatest asset, and as leaders we have an obligation to develop the capacity of our human resources in an inclusive manner. We should therefore urge greater collaboration among Member States to devise strategies to achieve quality education for all, and we simultaneously call upon developed countries, traditional and emerging donors and international financing mechanisms to increase funding for education and to support programmes according to the needs, priorities and circumstances of countries.\nWe are persuaded that the health of our peoples is just as important as education. Guyana has therefore welcomed the convening of the High-level Meeting on Universal Health Coverage, with the profound theme, \u201cMoving together to build a healthier world\u201d. The importance of enhanced access to essential health services, including a skilled health workforce and access to safe, quality, effective and affordable medicines and vaccines is key to having a healthy world population, where all can enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. This is self-evident. In this regard, the political declaration of the high-level meeting on universal health coverage (resolution 74/2) represents an important global consensus on accelerating efforts at all levels to improve health outcomes.\nGuyana has introduced its integrated health- service delivery network, which enables a more holistic primary health-care delivery mechanism by addressing the social determinants of health, while promoting the health of the individual. It places priority on the availability of preventive measures and health- care services at the level of primary health care. The Government of Guyana is committed to ensuring that all Guyanese, regardless of their location, have access to health services, and the Government is implementing its plan to establish health outposts and centres in all communities to reduce the need to travel long distances to access health-care services.\nAs at the domestic level, the maintenance of international peace and security requires respect by all stakeholders for the effective operation of international law and the institutions that underpin the international peace and security architecture created by the Charter. Foremost among these institutions is the Security Council, on which the Charter confers primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\nHowever, this year marks the seventy-fourth anniversary of the signing of the Charter in San Francisco, and the world has changed dramatically since 1945. The number of States Members of the United Nations has quadrupled with the emergence of new independent States in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. The institutions of our Organization must therefore evolve with the times in order to reflect a new global dispensation. The Security Council is no exception. Guyana therefore looks forward to the successful conclusion of the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform undertaken to ensure greater effectiveness, representation and legitimacy.\nOn some cardinal principles, the United Nations are indeed united. The sovereign equality of all States, respect for the territorial integrity of every State, the peaceful resolution of disputes between all States, respect for international rule of law \u2014 these are among the most effective guarantees of a world at peace. Last year, from this rostrum, Guyana updated the world on the disregard for these principles that our neighbour, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, continued to show in its controversy with Guyana (see A/73/PV.12). We showed how six months earlier, in March of last year, Guyana had acted on the decision of the Secretary-General to refer the controversy between our States to the International Court of Justice pursuant to the Geneva Agreement of 1966, to which Venezuela is a party. His decision was binding on Venezuela, and we warned of Venezuela\u2019s unwillingness to participate in the proceedings. A year later, our warning has been fulfilled. As we heard yesterday, Venezuela\u2019s unwillingness to be involved in the judicial resolution of the controversy has hardened into a refusal to pursue the path of peace through respect for the rule of law (see A/74/PV.10). Guyana has placed its faith in the world\u2019s highest Court, and it will continue to do so.\nIn like manner, we wish to recall our disappointment at the limited progress towards a two-State solution to the generational conflict between the people of the State of Israel and the State of Palestine that would allow the people of Israel to live within secure and internationally recognized borders and the people of Palestine to live in dignity in their own State, free from the yoke of foreign occupation. Similarly, we deplore the events in Myanmar that have led to the displacement and suffering of the Rohingya people. The international community must take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of the affected populations and a minimum of respect for their human rights. We applaud the efforts of Bangladesh within its capacity to provide, with the assistance of international agencies, a place of safety for the refugee population pending their return.\nIn our own region, we again join the overwhelming majority of members of the international community in calling for the removal of the trade and economic embargo against our sister Caribbean nation of Cuba, which is a serious impediment to the legitimate aspirations of the Cuban people for improvement in their material well-being and to their achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nI take this opportunity to reaffirm Guyana\u2019s commitment to the disarmament agenda of the United Nations as central to the Organization\u2019s efforts to achieve a stable, secure and peaceful world order. In recent times, we have witnessed a worrying departure from commitments to disarmament objectives by some actors. In this regard, I wish to emphasize that no State can afford to shy away from the shared responsibility devolving upon us as States Members of the United Nations. For its part, Guyana continues to be a principled actor on questions of disarmament and is a State party to the major legal instruments constituting the disarmament regime.\nThe landmark Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is among those instruments that Guyana has ratified, and we remain supportive of all efforts that would lead to its timely entry into force. To this end, and with a view to encouraging the embrace of this Treaty by other States, Guyana recently hosted the Caribbean Regional Forum on the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\nMy Government believes that our development efforts can best be maximized in societies that are safe and secure. For this reason, we also support the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, another scourge that affects the Caribbean and Latin American region.\nAs is clear, Guyana undoubtedly remains a firm believer in the value of multilateralism, and, as a small, vulnerable developing State, we see the United Nations, in its ideals and practices, as its greatest expression. It is through multilateralism that we can collectively find lasting solutions to the multifaceted and complex global challenges of our world. It is through multilateral approaches that we can advance the development, human rights and security pillars of the United Nations. It is multilateralism that offers us the best hope of advancing the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the SDGs.\nFor that reason, I take this opportunity and occasion to reaffirm the unequivocal commitment of Guyana to doing its part to strengthen multilateralism as the best path towards achieving the purposes and principles of the United Nations. We commit to strong and principled national action on behalf of all our peoples. The challenges are many, but not insurmountable, in the face of our collective will and unremitting effort. A solemn obligation therefore devolves upon us all, as Member States, to do the best we can to ensure continued progress.\nAs I conclude, permit me to quote the words attributed to Mahatma Gandhi: \u201cYou may never know what results come from your action. But if you do nothing, there will be no result.\u201d I therefore encourage all of us not only to find words but to take fruitful action, and I assure the Assembly that Guyana will not be found wanting in this endeavour. In this regard, the very recent opening of a United Nations House, as the face of the United Nations in Guyana, and within the context of the reform and repositioning of the United Nations development system, embodies both rich symbolism and concrete evidence of the strong and evolving partnership between Guyana and the Organization for the development of our country."

        "file_text": "Over the past five years, I have had the honour of representing the European Union (EU) as the President of the European Council, which comprises the Heads of State and Government of its member States. I have also come to the United Nations in that capacity.\nPlease allow me, in my address today, my last one in this Hall, not to elaborate on the details of our challenges, but to start with a more general reflection inspired by words that were spoken here two days ago, words suggesting an immanent conflict between patriotism and globalism. I do not agree with this assessment. It is false and dangerous, even if it has many followers and powerful propagators.\nThe very idea of the United Nations, just like that of the European Union, is a de facto heroic attempt to overcome such thinking. The patriotism of the twenty-first century must also have a global dimension, if it is to avoid becoming, as has been the case many times, a common national egoism. The history of our nations shows how easy it is to transform the love of one\u2019s homeland into a hatred towards one\u2019s neighbours; to transform the pride for one\u2019s own culture into contempt for the culture of strangers; and to use the slogans of one\u2019s own sovereignty against the sovereignty of others.\nI know that the word \u201cglobalism\u201d does not sound attractive. Personally, I prefer the word \u201csolidarity\u201d, which is so important to me and to my nation. In my political vocabulary, globalism and solidarity mean the same thing. I am not talking about some naive ideology or abstract linguistics but about concrete challenges and the opportunity for pragmatic solutions.\nI love Gdansk, the town I come from. I love Poland, my country, and I love Europe. But even if we live in the most beautiful and most modern European city, our life can become hell if we do not find, here at the United Nations, adequate solutions to global threats, such as armed conflict, terrorism, nuclear proliferation and the destruction of our environment. Without the readiness to establish rules at the global level, and subsequently to consistently respect them, local communities, nations, States and even continents will remain helpless in the face of such threats.\nLet us focus briefly on one of those threats \u2014 the destruction of our environment, which has been at the centre of attention in recent days here in New York. I have no doubt that we are in an environmental crisis. Microplastics are spreading in our oceans. Up to 200 species become extinct every day. I myself have witnessed the collapse of ice walls in Greenland and the melting glaciers in the Pamir mountains in Tajikistan. We have just discussed here the crisis in Amazonia, as we have done for the past few decades, unfortunately with limited results. We are fast approaching a point beyond which we will be able only to mitigate climate change rather than reverse it.\nThe European Union will continue doing everything possible to confront that threat. Europe is showing leadership in implementing the Paris Agreement, and we hope to win the race to become the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral continent. In 2017 alone, the EU and its member States spent f\u20ac20 billion helping developing countries tackle and adapt to climate change.\nHowever, the natural environment of man, which requires protection, is not only the oceans, the air and the forests. It is also the truth in public life, freedom, the rule of law and international solidarity. To protect the truth, it is not enough to accuse others of promoting fake news. Frankly speaking, it would be enough to simply stop lying. Today, too many politicians use lies as a permanent method to maintain power.\nTo protect freedom, it is not enough to talk about it in speeches. One must defend the rights of an individual everywhere and every day. One must defend the freedom of speech and a free press. And one must stop flirting with dictators and authoritarian regimes.\nTo protect the rule of law, one must really accept that the law should be above power, not at its beck and call. If one wants to follow the principles of international solidarity, one must always help the weaker if they are attacked by the stronger and the ruthless, as in the case of Ukraine, for example. If the powerful of our world do not understand that, they will go down in history not as leaders but as fake leaders, and rightly so.\n"

        "file_name": "LBY_74_2019.txt",
        "file_text": "I would like to begin by taking this opportunity to congratulate President Muhammad-Bande on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I wish him every success in leading the work of the Assembly. I also want to express my thanks and appreciation to Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her exceptional work during her presidency of the previous session. And I thank Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his ongoing efforts to achieve the goals and purposes of the United Nations \u2014 maintaining international peace and security, supporting stability, advancing development and promoting human rights.\nI have come to address the Assembly regarding my country\u2019s cause. Libya is experiencing an extraordinary situation and an extremely serious crisis resulting from damaging foreign interference that has led to institutional and political division. The crisis has been exacerbated to such an extent that the capital and its suburbs have been under military attack that has external funding and support, with serious negative consequences for our citizens\u2019 security, safety and welfare.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the quest for security, stability and civil peace in Libya is a critical issue not just for our country but for the stability of the region and the world. The assault on the capital and its suburbs was led by a rebel soldier, the self-styled Khalifa Haftar, in what he says was a holy jihad. It took place on 4 April, the same day that the Secretary-General visited Tripoli, and at a time when the country was excitedly and hopefully preparing to hold an inclusive national conference aimed at finding a political solution to the problem of Libya. Just days before the conference, Khalifa Haftar destroyed the aspirations of the Libyan people \u2014 and the efforts of the international community \u2014 with his attempt at a coup, incidentally not his first, against the legitimate Government. In February 2014, via a television transmission, he declared that he had suspended Parliament, the Government and the Constitutional Declaration. However, the coup failed, and now Haftar is once again trying desperately to militarize the country and block our path to building a modern civilian State, mocking the Libyan people\u2019s revolution and the sacrifices they have made to free the country from dictatorship and the rule of one individual.\nThis war criminal has been encouraged to carry out his aggression with military and financial support that he has received from certain States over the years in flagrant violation of the Security Council resolutions banning the importation of arms into Libya. This support deluded him into believing that he could enter the capital in two days. However, his delusions were dashed, and the world has begun to realize that he claims falsely that he is strong and leading a bloody militia seeking power.\nThanks to our brave army\u2019s repeated victories and other supportive forces, we have defeated his aggression and have seen a change in the attitude of some countries, which supported us once Haftar\u2019s intentions and lies were revealed and his failure was confirmed. Unfortunately, however, there are other countries that continue to interfere directly in our affairs and support the aggression, such as the United Arab Emirates, whose media recently allowed Haftar to freely broadcast his hate speech and incitement to kill Libyans. Furthermore, French Javelin missiles were found after the liberation of the city of Gharyan, the aggressor\u2019s base of operations. We are also puzzled by the positions of some other States, particularly our neighbour Egypt, which interferes in our affairs and lectures Libyans on democracy, the civilian State, the economy and wealth distribution. We denounce attitudes such as these that lend support to the war criminal and the plotters of his coup, in flagrant violation of relevant Security Council resolutions.\nWe affirm that we will continue to deter the aggressor and defeat him, despite any support he may receive. We consider his supporters morally and legally responsible and will strive to prevent anyone from shedding Libyan blood. Our army and other supportive forces, through the Volcano of Rage operation, are bravely registering one victory after another. We want to pay tribute to all our brave heroes and pray that the souls of our martyrs will rest in peace. Despite the pain, their heroic epics will remain alive in the memory of our homeland and its future generations.\nThe aggressor\u2019s plans are clearly apparent in the areas under his control by force. His human rights violations include extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances \u2014 such as that of Ms. Siham Sergiwa, a member of Parliament, and other national figures \u2014 the suppression of opinions and elimination of political opposition. The aggression has resulted in fatal casualties among young Libyans, numbering some 3,000 so far, and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of others. The aggression forces have committed serious violations that have been documented and that qualify as war crimes under international law, including actions in Tripoli and its suburbs and in the city of Murzuq. There have been random bombings of civilian neighbourhoods and attacks targeting civilian airports, hospitals, ambulances and infrastructure as well as practices such as child recruitment. The list goes on.\nBehind all of this is the war criminal himself and everyone who supports him with financing and weapons. We therefore reiterate our request that Khalifa Haftar\u2019s name be put on the international sanctions list and his supporters held legally responsible and accountable for their killings and destruction. In that context, we are asking the United Nations to quickly dispatch a fact-finding mission to investigate and document these flagrant violations, just as we have asked the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to speed up her investigations in that regard.\nThe aggressor has tried to sway public opinion by saying that he is fighting terrorism. That is a false claim. It is the forces of the Government of National Accord, as part of the international coalition to combat terrorism, that have fought and defeated the terrorist organization Da\u2019esh and liberated Sirte from its elements. We continue to cooperate strategically with the United States and to work together to root out the remnants of terrorism, wherever they are. We will keep fighting until we eradicate all the terrorists and terrorism. Our soldiers who fought that terrorist group are the ones who are now pushing back the treacherous aggression against the Libyan capital and other regions.\nIn the face of his failing allegations, the aggressor is trying to promote the idea that the war is between eastern and western Libya. This is based on a totally false premise, because there are no disputes in Libya in terms of social and religious infrastructure. The war is actually between the advocates for a civilian State and those who want to militarize it. It is therefore high time that the country\u2019s eastern region was represented by an elite group of intellectuals, politicians and effective social elements who can work with the representatives of other regions in order to achieve a consensus political solution that guarantees rights and a peaceful transfer of power within the framework of a modern civilian State.\nWe want peace and accord. We have repeatedly stressed that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Libya. Neither can it have a winner. There is one loser in this conflict, and that is Libya. We are ready to prevent bloodshed for all Libyans, and I want to take this opportunity to urge all the young people who have been persuaded to participate in a war without a cause, a war waged on behalf of one person who is obsessed with power, to lay down their arms, return safely to their homes and stand with their homeland.\nWe want to live in peace and connect with other States of the world in cooperation and mutual respect. We reject all interference in our domestic affairs. In that regard, we welcomed the adoption on 12 September of Security Council resolution 2486 (2019), extending the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, which affirmed its continued commitment to the Libyan Political Agreement and to ensuring that Member States stop dealing with parallel institutions. It also stressed the importance of completing the constitutional process and holding elections. We are firmly committed to dialogue and the political process within the framework of new mechanisms that take account of the consequences of the 4 April aggression. We reiterate that we will not sit down again with Haftar. He is a war criminal, not a partner for peace.\nIn June, I proposed an initiative for holding a national conference to include representatives of all Libyans who support a democratic civilian State, which would culminate in the holding of legislative and presidential elections based on a legal foundation established by the conference. There can be no place at the dialogue table for anyone wanting to militarize the State and to consign us to years of underdevelopment and terrorism. In that regard, we have held a series of national consultations that have included all sectors of Libyan society, including representatives of the political, social and cultural sectors as well as women, young people and military leaders. We will continue to hold such meetings to bring together representatives of every region, and we will include civil society in order to consolidate a comprehensive national vision for ending the crisis. At this critical time we therefore welcome the position of the members of the parliamentary session held in Tripoli and of the State Council, which holds them responsible for rolling back the enemy, establishing democracy and fostering a modern civilian State.\nResolution 2486 (2019) has a number of positive aspects, in particular its reference in paragraph 1 to the consolidation of the Government of National Accord\u2019s governance and security arrangements, and including support for the economic reforms that we adopted in September of last year. In that context, we should point out that we have taken steps to implement decentralization by transferring responsibility for many services to elected municipal councils, thereby providing such services directly to our citizens.\nDespite the claims of some to the contrary, we want to emphasize that the national budget is being disbursed in a fair and balanced way to all areas of Libya, without exception, distinction or marginalization. The salaries of all public service workers are being paid from the budget. In that regard, I would like to point to the serious financial violations on the part of some illegal parallel institutions and to warn the world that they deal in coinage outside legal channels. I also want to issue a warning against selling Libyan oil outside the legitimate framework. Our oil belongs to all Libyans, and its management is the responsibility of Libya\u2019s National Oil Corporation alone. The Government of National Accord is the only authority entitled to oversee the State\u2019s financial and economic institutions. We therefore renew our call for the speedy establishment under the supervision of the United Nations of a technical committee from the specialized international institutions to review the operations of the Central Bank in Tripoli and its branch in A1 Bayda.\nAs we all know, security and a prosperous economy are linked. They are two sides of the same coin. We have therefore been eager to complement our economic reforms with reform of the security sector by implementing security arrangements aimed at establishing an overall system based on security forces and a regular police force that function according to professional criteria. Before the aggression we had made positive steps in that regard, which led to a considerable improvement in the security situation and the return of several diplomatic missions to Tripoli. We were also able to contain all the armed groups, launch a programme and mechanisms for collecting weapons and integrating former militants into our national security and military institutions, and to provide work opportunities and rehabilitation to those who want to reintegrate into civilian life. We will not surrender the State\u2019s monopoly on weapons, and we do not accept the existence of armed groups within our civilian State.\nIn the midst of this crisis, my country is facing another critical challenge, that of illegal migration and the considerable flow of irregular migrants through Libya in their quest to reach Europe via the Mediterranean Sea. This dangerous situation has major repercussions for us, including on the economic, security and social fronts. The aggression has only exacerbated the problem, and has resulted in many deaths because people have either been drowned at sea or lost in the desert. Migrants have become easy prey for terrorist organizations and human traffickers. The aggressor militias worsened this tragedy when they bombed a migrant shelter centre, killing and wounding dozens, including women and children. The international community met it with silence and evaded any direct condemnation of the perpetrator of that ugly crime.\nThis issue of migration is one of great concern for both Libyans and Europeans, but we are its victims, not its cause. In that regard, we have continued to cooperate with migrants\u2019 destination countries and with all regional and international efforts to address the problem. It is essential that all countries work together, whether they are countries of origin, transit or destination. We must focus not just on the security dimension but also on migration\u2019s many other aspects, as well as fostering development in countries of origin in order to eliminate poverty and unemployment while encouraging stability and survival.\nAs a transit country for migrants, Libya is in urgent need of political support commensurate with the challenges and dangers we are dealing with so that we can establish the institutions required to control borders, limit the problem and minimize its impact, and I am appealing for that support. What we have received is completely disproportionate to what has been provided to other States facing migration-related problems that are far less intense than Libya\u2019s. In that regard, we highly appreciate the efforts by the Coast Guards who continue to help save the lives of thousands of migrants at sea despite limited capacities and the embargo imposed on us. In our opinion, the solution still lies in efforts to support my country\u2019s stability. A stable Libya will be able to secure its borders and provide job opportunities to hundreds of thousands of legal workers, in accordance with Libyan labour law.\nHuman rights and the rule of law are critical issues to which my country attaches great importance. The changes that have taken place since 2011 have created the conditions for achieving comprehensive reforms in that regard, and several measures and decisions promoting human rights have been adopted. The Government of National Accord is also coordinating with the judiciary to create an environment conducive to its critical and important role, ensuring the principle of impunity and empowering law-enforcement agencies to do their job as required. In that regard, we look forward to cooperating with the relevant specialized United Nations agencies and receiving their technical support in that area.\nDespite the difficult circumstances, we are keeping track of everything taking place around us. We are contributing everything we can in support of every possible positive measure that serves peoples\u2019 interests and the cause of peace. In that context, we want to express our concern about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons, which constitutes a threat to international peace and security.\nMy country supports reform of the Security Council and an increase in the numbers of its permanent and non-permanent members, as well as promoting the rights of non-member States that are directly affected by the issues on the Council\u2019s agenda, including the right to participate directly in the Council\u2019s activities. My country also stresses the importance of recognizing the right of the countries of the African continent to permanent representation on the Council.\nThe issue of peace in the Middle East is extremely important. In the face of the many crises afflicting the region, we have spared no effort in supporting the Palestinian people and their right to establish an independent State with East Jerusalem as its capital, in line with the Arab Peace Initiative on the settlement of the Palestinian question. My country also supports all efforts aimed at finding a peaceful solution to the situations in our brother countries of Syria and Yemen, in order to protect them from the dangers of disintegration and division as a result of destructive conflict and to realize their peoples\u2019 aspiration to live in dignity under a democratic system that respects the law and preserves human rights.\nIn conclusion, I want to take this opportunity to appeal from this international rostrum to every State concerned about Libya\u2019s stability to cooperate with our Government of National Accord and with the United Nations initiatives. We urge them to uphold international law and help the Libyan people on their path to peace, security and consensus. It is time for our country to achieve stability and for our people to enjoy security and begin the process of reconstruction. There has been enough bloodshed and enough wasted money and time.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I thank God for my life, for the mission of presiding over Brazil and for the opportunity to re-establish truth, which is a good thing for all of us.\nI come before the General Assembly today to introduce a new Brazil, a country that is re-emerging from the brink of socialism \u2014 a country being rebuilt on the basis of the yearnings and ideals of its people. Under my Administration, Brazil has been working to regain the world\u2019s trust and reduce unemployment, violence and the risk for business activities by streamlining bureaucracy, pursuing deregulation and, above all, leading by example.\nMy country came very close to socialism, which led to a situation of widespread corruption, serious economic recession, high crime rates and endless attacks on the family and religious values that underpin our traditions. In 2013, an agreement between the former Workers Party Government and the Cuban dictatorship brought to Brazil 10,000 physicians who had no evidence of professional training. They were prevented from bringing their spouses and children, had 75 per cent of their wages confiscated by the Cuban regime and were denied basic freedoms, such as that of coming and going. Their situation was tantamount to slave labour \u2014 believe me \u2014 and it was supported by human rights entities of both Brazil and the United Nations alike.\nBefore I took office, almost 90 per cent of those Cuban citizens left Brazil due to unilateral action by the Cuban regime. Those who decided to stay in Brazil will be subject to proper technical eligibility criteria in order to exercise the medical profession. Brazil has thus stopped supporting the Cuban dictatorship by no longer sending $300 million to Havana every year, as was the case previously.\nHistory taught us that, as early as the 1960s, Cuban agents were sent to several countries to help establish dictatorships across the region. A few decades ago they tried to change the Brazilian regime and the systems in place in other Latin American countries. They were defeated. Brazilian civilians and military personnel were killed and many others had their reputations utterly destroyed. Nonetheless, we ultimately won the war and prevailed in safeguarding our freedom.\nAgents of the Cuban regime made their way likewise into Venezuela thanks to Hugo Chavez. Today around 60,000 Cuban agents control and interfere with every area of Venezuelan society, especially intelligence and defence. Once a vibrant democratic country, Venezuela is today experiencing the cruelty of socialism. It is fair to say that, yes, socialism is working in Venezuela: everyone is poor and deprived of freedom.\nBrazil has also felt the impact of the Venezuelan dictatorship. Of the more than 4 million citizens who fled the hunger and violence in Venezuela, a sizeable proportion migrated to Brazil. We have done our part to assist them, through Operation Welcome \u2014 an operation conducted by the Brazilian army that has earned praise worldwide.\nWe have also worked with other countries, including the United States of America, to ensure that democracy is restored in Venezuela. We have devoted concerted efforts to ensure that no other South American country will experience this nefarious scourge. The Sao Paulo Forum, a criminal organization established in 1990 by Fidel Castro, Lula da Silva and Hugo Chavez to spread and implement socialism throughout Latin America, remains alive and must be fought.\nIn the quest for prosperity, we have put in place policies to bring us closer to other countries that have achieved development and consolidated their democracy. There can be no political freedom without economic freedom, and vice versa. A free market, concession projects and privatization opportunities are already a visible part of today\u2019s Brazil. The Brazilian economy is recovering from the distortions and chains of more than two decades of fiscal irresponsibility, ideological manipulation of the State apparatus and widespread corruption. Economic openness, capable governmental management and enhanced productivity are immediate goals for our Administration. We are opening up our economy and becoming an integral part of global value chains. In only eight months, we have successfully concluded the two most significant trade agreements in the history of my country: between the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) and the European Union; and between MERCOSUR and the European Free Trade Association. We will enter into further such agreements in the months ahead.\nWe also stand ready to begin the process of accession to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We are well on our way in that effort, having adopted the world\u2019s highest standards and best practices in all areas, ranging from financial regulation to environmental protection.\nI note the presence here of indigenous leader and spokesperson Ms. Ysani Kalapalo. I shall now turn to the Amazon.\nFirst of all, I wish to say that my Administration is solemnly committed to environmental preservation and sustainable development, to the benefit of Brazil and the world at large. Brazil is one of the richest countries in the world in terms of biodiversity and mineral resources. Our Amazon region is larger than all of Western Europe combined and remains virtually pristine and untouched. That is evidence of the fact that Brazil is a leader when it comes to environmental protection.\nAt this time of the year, dry weather and winds favour both spontaneous forest fires and criminal blazes. It is important to note that indigenous peoples and local populations also use forest fires as part of their culture and means of livelihood.\nWe all know that all countries have problems. However, the sensationalist attacks we suffered from much of the international media following the outbreak of fires in Amazonia stirred our patriotic sentiment. It is a fallacy to say that the Amazon is the heritage of humankind, and a misconception, scientists confirm, to say that our Amazonian forests are the lungs of the world. In resorting to those fallacies, certain countries, instead of helping, have amplified media lies, behaved disrespectfully and shown their true colonialist colours. They have even called into questioned that which we hold most dear: our sovereignty.\nOne of those countries, during the most recent Group of Seven meeting, dared to suggest imposing sanctions against Brazil without even consulting with or listening to Brazil. I am grateful to those countries that refused to proceed with that absurd proposal. I thank President Donald Trump in particular, who very aptly summarized the spirit that should prevail among States Members of the United Nations, that is, respect for the national sovereignty and freedom of each of us.\nToday 14 per cent of Brazilian territory is officially demarcated as indigenous land, but we must understand that our native peoples are human beings like all the rest of us. They want and deserve to enjoy the same rights as all of us. I want to make it clear: Brazil will not increase the area officially demarcated as indigenous lands to 20 per cent, as some Heads of State would like to see.\nThere are 225 different indigenous peoples in Brazil, in addition to about 70 tribes living in isolated locations throughout the country. Each people or tribe has its own chief, culture, traditions, customs and, above all, its own way of seeing the world. The views of one indigenous leader do not represent those of the entire Brazilian indigenous population. Some of those leaders, such as tribal chief Raoni, have often been used as pawns by foreign Governments as part of their information warfare to advance their interests in the Amazon. Unfortunately, some people, both inside and outside Brazil, with the support of non-governmental organizations, have stubbornly insisted on treating our indigenous peoples as cavemen.\nBrazil now has a President who cares about those who were on our territory before the Portuguese arrived in the 1500s. Indigenous people do not want to be poor landowners sitting on rich lands, some of which, such as the Yanomami and Raposa Serra do Sol reserves, are the richest lands in the world. Those reserves are home to vast deposits of gold, diamonds, uranium, niobium and rare earth elements, among other resources. And those territories are huge. The Yanomami reserve alone is approximately 95,000 square kilometres, the size of Portugal or Hungary, although only 15,000 indigenous persons live there. That shows clearly that those who attack us are not concerned with indigenous peoples as human beings, but, rather, with the mineral wealth and biodiversity in those areas.\nAs evidence of the fact that there is no single authority among the indigenous peoples, I wish to read out an open letter by, and representing a substantial portion of, the indigenous communities in Brazil, addressed to the General Assembly.\n\u201cThe Indigenous Farmers Group of Brazil, composed of various ethnic groups with representatives in all states of the Brazilian Federation, who inhabit an area of over 30 million hectares of the Brazilian territory, respectfully addresses Brazilian society to express is full, unconditional support for indigenous spokesperson and representative Ysani Kalapalo, of the Xingu indigenous park in the state of Mato Grosso, so that she may explain to the United Nations General Assembly, in New York, the reality of the indigenous peoples of Brazil, as well as shed light on the lies disseminated by the national and international media, which insist on keeping the indigenous peoples of Brazil as an endless market reserve, serving the interests of foreign countries that still see Brazil as a colony without rules or sovereignty.\n\u201cFourteen per cent of Brazil\u2019s national territory has been officially established as indigenous land, and many communities are thirsty and eager for the development of this part of the country to finally take place, without ideological constraints, which will, in turn, improve quality of life and the standard of entrepreneurship, health care and education. A new indigenous policy in Brazil is needed. Time is of the essence. Bold measures can and should be encouraged in the pursuit of autonomy and economic empowerment for indigenous peoples. Certainly, if a series of decisions is taken to that effect, we can envision a new model for the Brazilian indigenous agenda.\n\u201cA new chapter of hope is needed for indigenous communities. The situation of extreme poverty in which we find ourselves, surviving only on the family stipend and basic food supply, has never brought dignity or development. Radical environmentalism and outdated approaches to indigenous issues are out of sync with what indigenous peoples truly want and are tantamount to backwardness, marginalization and utter absence of civic rights.\n\u201cThat reality requires world leaders attending the United Nations General Assembly to become familiar with our wishes and aspirations through the voice of indigenous spokesperson Ysani Kalapalo, who will convey the real situation of Brazilian indigenous communities and the environment. Therefore, Ysani Kalapalo enjoys the trust and prestige of indigenous leaders interested in furthering development and empowerment and in attaining a higher profile and greater role and voice, and is in a position to represent the 52 ethnic groups listed in the annex to this letter. The monopoly of tribal chief Raoni is over.\u201d\nThe United Nations has played a key role in overcoming colonialism and cannot possibly accept that this type of mindset be allowed to return to its halls and corridors under any pretext.\nWe must not forget that the world needs to be fed. France and Germany, for example, use more than 50 per cent of their territories for agriculture. By contrast, Brazil uses no more than 8 per cent of its land for food production; 61 per cent of our territory is preserved. Ours is a zero-tolerance policy for crime, including environmental crimes. I wish once again to affirm my stance in that regard. Any initiative to help or support the preservation of the Amazon rainforest, or other biomes, must fully respect the sovereignty of Brazil. Moreover, we reject attempts to exploit and instrumentalize environmental issues or indigenous policy in order to further foreign political and economic interests, especially attempts disguised as good intentions. We stand ready to work in partnership to exploit our resources with a view to developing all of our potential in a sustainable manner.\nBrazil reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the highest standards of human rights and to the promotion of democracy and freedom, including the freedoms of expression, religion and the press. That commitment goes hand in hand with our efforts to fight corruption and crime \u2014 an urgent demand of Brazilian society. We will continue to contribute, in and outside the United Nations, to building a world free from impunity, with no safe havens for criminals or corrupt individuals. Under my Administration, Italian terrorist Cesare Battisti fled Brazil and was later arrested in Bolivia and extradited to Italy. Three other terrorists from Paraguay and one from Chile, who until recently lived in Brazil as political refugees, have also been repatriated to their countries of origin. Terrorists, under the guise of politically persecuted persons, will no longer find refuge in Brazil.\nNot long ago, socialist Presidents who came before me embezzled hundreds of billions of dollars to buy off part of the media and our Parliament, all in a bid to attain absolute power. They have been tried and punished thanks to the patriotism, perseverance and bravery of a judge who has become an icon in my country, Mr. Sergio Moro, our current Minister of Justice and Public Security. Those Presidents also transferred a considerable amount of funds to third countries with the aim of promoting and realizing similar power-grabbing objectives throughout the region. That source of funds has now dried up. The same top-ranking Government officials came here, year after year, and made blithe statements about issues that never served Brazil\u2019s real interests or contributed to world stability. Still, they were all applauded.\nIn my country, we had to do something about the nearly 70,000 murders and countless violent crimes that tore apart Brazilian society each year. Life, after all, is the most basic human right. Our military police officers were the preferred target of crime. In 2017 alone, around 400 military police officers were brutally murdered.\nThat is changing. Measures were taken and we managed to reduce murder rates by more than 20 per cent in the first six months of my Government. The seizure of cocaine and other drugs has reached a record high. Today Brazil is safer and even more welcoming. We have just extended visa exemptions to countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia and Canada. We are currently considering the adoption of similar measures for China and India, among others. With greater safety and ease, we want everyone to be able to visit Brazil, particularly our Amazon rainforest, with all its vastness and natural beauty. The Amazon is not being destroyed or consumed by fire, as the media misleadingly says. Each Member State can verify what I am saying. Do not hesitate to visit Brazil. It is very different to the country portrayed in many newspapers and television programmes.\nReligious persecution is a scourge against which we must tirelessly fight. In recent years, in various regions we have witnessed cowardly attacks that victimized the faithful gathered in churches, synagogues and mosques. Brazil strongly condemns all such acts. It is ready to cooperate with other countries to protect those who are oppressed because of their faith.\nThe Brazilian people are particularly concerned about the growing persecution, discrimination and violence against missionaries and religious minorities in different regions of the world. That is why we supported the establishment of the International Day Commemorating the Victims of Acts of Violence Based on Religion or Belief. On that day every year we will remember those who have suffered the harmful consequences of religious persecution. It is unacceptable that in the twenty-first century, with so many instruments, treaties and organizations whose aim is to safeguard all kinds of rights, there are still millions of Christians and people of other religions that lose their lives or their freedom because of their faith.\nBrazil\u2019s devotion to the cause of peace is evidenced by its strong history of contributing to United Nations missions. For 70 years, Brazil has effectively contributed to United Nations peacekeeping operations. We support all efforts to make peacekeeping missions more effective, bringing real and tangible contributions to the host countries.\nIn diverse contexts, whether in Haiti, Lebanon or the Democratic Republic of Congo, our troops are acknowledged for their outstanding work and their respect for local communities, human rights and the principles that guide peacekeeping operations. I reaffirm our willingness to continue our tangible contributions to United Nations peacekeeping missions, including through training and capacity-building, areas where we have recognized experience.\nThroughout this year, we have established a broad international agenda to restore Brazil\u2019s role on the world stage, as well as to re-establish relations with key partners. In January, we were in Davos, where we presented our ambitious reform programme for investors from all around the world. In March, we went to Washington, D.C., where we launched a comprehensive and bold partnership with the Government of the United States in all areas, particularly political cooperation and economic and military collaboration. Also in March, we visited Chile, where the Forum for the Progress and Development of South America was launched, an important initiative to ensure that South America is consolidated as an area of democracy and freedom.\nWe then visited Israel, where we identified numerous opportunities for cooperation, especially in the area of technology and security. I thank Israel for its support in combating recent disasters in my country.\nWe also visited one of our major partners in the Southern Cone: Argentina. With President Mauricio Macri and our partners from Uruguay and Paraguay, we have moved away from the ideology of the Common Market of the Southern Cone and achieved important trade advantages in terms of international trade by concluding negotiations that had been ongoing for decades.\nLater this year, we will visit key partners, both in the Middle East and in East Asia. Those visits will strengthen friendship and deepen relations with Japan, China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. We hope to follow the same path with the entire Arab world and Asia. We are also looking forward to visiting our partners and friends in Africa, Oceania and Europe.\nAs can be seen, Brazil is open to the world and eager to establish partnerships with all those interested in working for prosperity, peace and freedom.\nThe Brazil that I represent is a country that is recovering and rising again, reinforcing its partnerships and regaining its political and economic confidence. We are ready to take on our responsibilities in the international system.\nOver the past few decades, without realizing we let ourselves be seduced by ideologies that sought not the truth but absolute power. Ideology has taken root in the areas of culture, education and the media, dominating means of communication, universities and schools. Ideology has invaded our homes and sought to dismantle the cellular mater \u2014 mainstay \u2014 of any healthy society: the family.\nIt has also tried to destroy the innocence of our children, distorting even their most basic and elementary identity: biology itself. Political correctness came to dominate the public debate, expelling rationality and replacing it with manipulation, recurring cliches and slogans. Ideology has invaded the human soul itself to expel from it God and the dignity with which He has endowed us.\nWith such methods, ideology has always left a trail of death, ignorance and misery wherever it went. I am a living proof of that. I was cowardly stabbed by a leftist militant and survived only by a miracle. Once again, I thank God for my life.\nThe United Nations can help to overcome the materialistic and ideological environment that undermines some basic principles of human dignity. The Organization was established to promote peace among sovereign nations and social progress in freedom, in accordance with the Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations.\nWith regard to issues such as climate, democracy, human rights, equal rights and duties of men and women and many others, all we need to do is to behold the truth: \u201cAnd ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\u201d (The Holy Bible, John 8:32)\nAll our means, both national and international, should ultimately be directed towards that goal.\nWe are not here to erase nationalities and sovereignties in the name of an abstract global interest. This is not the global interests organization; this is the United Nations Organization, and so it must remain. With humility and confidence in the liberating power of truth, I reassure the United Nations that it can count on the new Brazil that I have presented to the Assembly today. By the grace and glory of God, I thank everyone.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour for me to participate in this new session of the General Assembly and to address this illustrious Hall on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Danilo Medina Sanchez, President of the Dominican Republic.\nSince the founding of the United Nations 74 years ago, my country has been deeply committed to the Organization\u2019s mission of cooperation for peace, security and the development of peoples. This year, that commitment was renewed when we assumed a non-permanent seat on its Security Council for the first time, despite being founders of the United Nations. That is, of course, a responsibility that honours and binds us. That is why, we have done our utmost since January to ensure that our contribution to the Council always involves the search for broad consensus, which facilitates decision-making and efficiency.\nAs part of that work, at the beginning of the year, when we assumed the presidency, we organized an open debate on the impacts of climate-related disasters and their negative effects on international peace and security (see S/PV.8451). That debate takes on new meaning in the current context, following the wave of fires in the Amazon and the recent passage of Hurricane Dorian, which left behind a trail of shocking damage and many victims.\nIt should be noted that for us and our Caribbean region, the effects of climate change are real, visible and devastating, and threaten the very existence of our countries. In that regard, we are encouraged by the fact that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres convened the Climate Action Summit to address climate action within the broader framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which we were very honoured to attend. We agree with him that climate change is the defining issue of our time and a direct existential threat. We have also been particularly attentive to the regional agenda in matters such as humanitarian aid for Venezuela or the preparation of the new support mission to Haiti.\nWe have little more than a decade left to make a reality of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), established by this very Assembly. Therefore, it is the duty of every country to take stock of their achievements, verify progress, monitor remaining challenges and, of course, immediately take the necessary actions to ensure success for each one of the Goals.\nI must note that, in the case of the Dominican Republic, the 2030 Agenda was immediately integrated into our daily activity because, from day one, our Government has shared the same focus \u2014 putting people\u2019s needs first. Like the SDGs, our first priority as a Government has always been to fight poverty and hunger, which we have approached from all angles, from the implementation of social policies to guaranteeing access to credit and, of course, promoting the development of our rural areas, which, as the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization explains in its latest reports, is the locus of the highest levels of poverty in our region.\nThis multidimensional strategy, to which President Danilo Medina Sanchez himself has dedicated great effort, as in the case of the surprise visits he has carried out, has enabled us to obtain good results. The extreme poverty rate in our country fell from 9.9 per cent in 2012 to 2.9 per cent in 2018, representing a tremendous achievement. Overall poverty decreased from 39.7 per cent to 23 per cent in the same period. The greatest decrease was in the countryside, where rural poverty fell from 49.3 per cent in 2012 to 25.6 per cent in 2018 thanks to the continuous support that the Government has been offering to our agricultural producers.\nIn addition, over the past decade, our country has had more success in reducing hunger than any other country in Latin America. We are one of only four countries in which that trend has remained stable over the past two years, while many neighbouring countries have, unfortunately, seen their progress slow.\nWe have also made great strides in the indicators for Goal 4, because inclusive and quality education is also a central goal of our Government. That goal has translated into the allocation of 4 per cent of our gross domestic product to education and the implementation of the greatest educational transformation that our country has experienced in its history. We have also made significant progress in other important areas, such as health, water conservation, gender equality, access to energy and sustainable economic growth, among others.\nOf course, we still have a lot of work to do and we know that there are no shortcuts to reaching the Goals, which can be achieved only through effort and persistence. It fills us with optimism to know that, a year after the end of the current term of office, under the wise leadership of President Medina, alliances have been established with all sectors of our society. What that means is that regardless of our political future, the development agenda, which already belongs to all citizens, will be able to follow its course at a steady pace. We trust that the Dominican Republic will continue to advance, alongside our brother countries of the region, in order to overcome the great and urgent challenges that lie ahead, such as climate change.\nOn the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which we are a signatory, we note that the Dominican Republic is fully resolved to honour its global commitment to guaranteeing the rights of every child. We reiterate that commitment today and will redouble our efforts in that regard. We are the first country in our region that, after having reached consensus within society, created a national road map for the prevention of violence against children and adolescents and care for its victims. In that connection, we will continue to work in all areas, from inclusive education to the reduction of neonatal deaths, the promotion of timely birth registration and the eradication of child labour. All our actions are guided by the goal of ensuring full, safe and happy lives for all children and adolescents in the Dominican Republic.\nWith those children and their future in mind, reducing inequalities is undoubtedly one of the priorities of the United Nations system. It is important to bridge the gap between the countries spearheading the development agenda and those with the greatest difficulties. However, it is important to note that the nature of those gaps and the challenges we face in overcoming them change. When we talk about inclusion, we can no longer talk only about meeting basic needs. In a few years, the new marginalized, the new poor, may no longer be those who have no food or shelter. In fact, soon, we will hopefully succeed in resolving that problem once and for all.\nHowever, it is possible that the newly excluded are those who do not have access to knowledge, the Internet and new technologies, and will therefore increasingly face difficulties in entering the labour market. If we want to talk about inclusion, development and opportunities, we must talk about decent employment and decent incomes. It is certain that technological changes, according to some studies, could eliminate 50 per cent of jobs in the next 20 years \u2014 50 per cent. That could jeopardize all the progress made by the Dominican Government.\nTechnology is already transforming the way we relate to the world today and, in this new era, establishing great differences among countries that are most plugged in and those that are not. I offer a single fact \u2014 only 20 per cent of people in the least developed countries have access to the Internet compared to 80 per cent of people in the most developed countries. To them I ask: What possibilities do those least developed countries have of competing in the new economy of the fourth industrial revolution? That includes countries like the Dominican Republic, where there is much greater Internet penetration. How will we be able to integrate populations in the most isolated areas that still live with technology from the first industrial revolution and dedicate themselves, perhaps, to subsistence agriculture? Therefore, the most urgent question we must ask ourselves now is: Will the transformation, already under way, contribute to closing the gaps of inclusion or will it contrarily further widen the gap between rich and poor?\nPresently, the truth is that the outlook is far from promising. Most experts seem to agree that, at least in its present form, the technological revolution will not contribute to reducing inequality. In its current state, the gap is widening among those who are prepared to occupy the jobs of the future and those who are not, irrespective of whether the technological revolution leads to the creation or disappearance of jobs. That is why we are making an urgent appeal to the General Assembly to avoid a course towards the inequality that the model for technological development seems to be taking. To that end, initiatives are of great importance. Such initiatives include the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation, which helps us in the search for solutions to the problem of digital security, equity and the fulfilment of rights in cyberspace, and the efforts made by the United Nations Development Programme to reduce inequalities and promote the progress and welfare of humankind through new technologies.\nOf course, that connects with the fact that we must also work together to increase investment in research and development if we want to move towards the next stage of growth. Unfortunately, that is an area in which our countries are lagging behind. On the list of the 10 most innovative countries in the world, headed by South Korea, Germany and Finland, there is not a single Latin American country. We consider it an urgent priority to efficiently and continuously implement instruments, such as knowledge exchange, skills building, access to technology and cooperation in science and innovation. Accordingly, the Government of the Dominican Republic takes this opportunity to ask those leading countries in the transformation of knowledge and skills to accompany us in that process.\nIn the experience of the Dominican Government, it is just as important to give answers to present problems as it is to be able to anticipate future needs. As leaders, it is our responsibility to continuously act under both perspectives. A vision for the future must include those who have not yet been able to meet their basic needs and a short-term vision must consider the consequences that our actions may have on future generations. That is why it is pressing now, more than ever, to deal with the present without looking away from the future. Only if we achieve that challenging balance will we be helping to unite our societies at both ends, closing gaps and healing wounds. Only in that way will we be building a more just, prosperous and sustainable future for all.\nThe Dominican Government invites the General Assembly to explore new ways of cooperation and to advance the present urgent agenda and the needs of the future. We have no time to lose. The time is here \u2014 the time is now. Only with commitment, with determination and with a vision focused on the interests of our peoples will we emerge victorious from the multiple challenges that are testing developing countries. The United Nations can always count on the Dominican Republic to work actively for the well-being of present and future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "We are facing unprecedented challenges. Climate change is real and poses a real threat to progress, and even to our survival, forcing us to shift resources away from development. Threats to global peace and security are multiplying. Geopolitical and trade tensions, arms races, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, violent extremism, poverty and income inequality are all global challenges that require global solutions. Committing to multilateralism has never been more urgently needed. The theme of this year\u2019s general debate could not be more appropriate.\nSince Ethiopia\u2019s political transition in April 2018, we have launched major political, legal and economic reforms. We have enlarged the political space, releasing jailed political prisoners and journalists; inviting exiled political parties to return home and pursue their peaceful struggle; revising electoral, counter-terrorism and civil society laws; and ending the 20-year conflict with Eritrea.\nAs we look forward to next year\u2019s elections, those reforms, particularly the expansion of the political space, have built a solid foundation for a lasting democratic order. We have also initiated the liberalization of our economy, building on a decade of sustained growth. We recently launched the homegrown economic reform agenda aimed at addressing emerging macroeconomic imbalances, resolving structural bottlenecks, including the ease of doing business to stimulate private sector growth, and creating new opportunities.\nInclusivity has been a core element of our policy, and we have made job creation for young people the epicentre of reforms. We are taking firm steps towards institutionalizing those reforms, while addressing the huge gap in gender parity, including at the highest levels of Government.\nIf members were to close their eyes and think of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, who among them would have thought that a woman from Africa would be standing here to address the Assembly? It has not been easy, but we have laid down a firm foundation for development in Ethiopia and durable peace and stability in the Horn of Africa. The rapprochement with Eritrea was a clear demonstration of the capacity of Africans to solve their problems through constructive dialogue. We are working to transform the whole region into an inclusive zone of peace and prosperity, and we are confident that the international community will support us.\nIn the Sudan, the formation of a Government of National Unity based on last month\u2019s political agreement is a very encouraging development. The negotiating parties showed faith in the mediation efforts of Ethiopia and the African Union. The new leadership deserves the full backing of the international community in its efforts to revive the country\u2019s economy. We strongly support the lifting of all economic and financial sanctions on the Sudan, including removing the Sudan from the list of countries sponsoring terrorism.\nSomalia has come a long way in recent years and is now consolidating State institutions, with elections scheduled for 2020. At the same time, Al-Shabaab remains a serious danger to Somalia and to the wider region. Any reversal of the progress made through the enormous sacrifices of the African Union Mission in the Sudan (AMISOM) and the Somali national forces must be prevented. In this regard, sustainable financing and support for AMISOM remains critical. Our partners must recognize this and reaffirm their commitments.\nWith the recent meeting between President Kiir and Mr. Machar, the South Sudanese parties have taken encouraging steps towards the implementation of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan. The parties should continue to show a strong commitment to increase the momentum for the full implementation of all the pre-transition objectives set forth in the agreement. We hope that the international community will redouble its efforts to deliver on the support pledged.\nEthiopia has been resolute in defending global peace and security through our contributions to United Nations peacekeeping operations for 70 years. I am proud to say that Ethiopia is now the leading troop- contributing country to United Nations peacekeeping. Our troops discharge their responsibilities with the highest levels of professionalism, dedication and courage. We are currently working to strengthen the efficiency and accountability of peacekeepers, increase the role of women in peace and security activities, implement the global and regional security architecture and ensure sustainable financing for African-led peace-support operations.\nIn that context, let me also underline our support for Security Council reform. Africa must be permanently represented in the Security Council.\nEthiopia has started to register some encouraging initial results on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We are investing in our people, our human resources, to improve their well-being. We are expanding manufacturing and infrastructure to attract an increasing amount of domestic and foreign investment. To create jobs for our youth, we are privatizing State-owned enterprises. To finance our national projects, we are mobilizing domestic resources and integrating pro-poor policies. To reduce poverty and enhance the quality of life, we are sustaining rapid and inclusive economic growth. Ethiopia is expected to be the fastest-growing economy this year. We are in the process of mainstreaming the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into upcoming five-year national development plans and into a long-term-perspective development plan for the next decade.\nEnsuring access to quality education means less child labour, less exploitation and fewer child marriages. Indeed, we have just launched the Ethiopian education development road map. Building on our significant progress over two decades, the road map focuses on out-of-school children. Many of those children are from pastoralist or disadvantaged areas, groups with special needs or the physically disabled. The road map provides for strengthening alternative modes of delivery. It also focuses on girls, as they are still less likely to complete primary education, and on equality, addressing the barriers to education in the classroom or at home. We are increasing education spending significantly; we hope that donors live up to their commitments and target and deliver aid more effectively.\nMy country, with more than 100 million people, is perpetually affected by climate-induced drought. It is high time to act, urgently and decisively. That is why Ethiopia has agreed to co-lead the energy transition workstream for the Climate Action Summit.\nWe in Ethiopia are working on afforestation, with a 10-year forest-sector development programme, a master plan to promote sustainable and productive forestry for green economic growth. This includes plans to plant 4 billion seedlings within a year and a half, under the theme \u201c40 Trees per Head for New Ethiopia\u201d, a project launched in May by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Last month we broke the world record, planting more than 350 million trees in a single day.\nEthiopia\u2019s main aspiration is to lift our people out of poverty. We are striving to provide a dignified life for all our citizens. The central element of our vision for sustainable development includes building infrastructure and harnessing our national resources. However, the grim reality today is that nearly 65 million Ethiopians do not have access to electricity. The construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile is merely to generate hydroelectric power to offer our people the opportunity to at least to have supper with a light on.\nThe Nile basin countries enjoy one of the oldest relationships in human history. We are inseparably linked by civilizations and this great and noble river. The seeds of our common development were planted thousands of years ago. Our time-tested links through the Nile, which provides us with life, truth and faith, can deliver a new level of energy and commitment for the betterment of our peoples. The use of the Nile waters also offers a unique opportunity for transboundary cooperation among the sisterly countries of the region. It should never be an object of competition or mistrust. Ethiopia strongly believes that the use of the Nile River should be based on the principles of international law, namely, the principles of the equitable and reasonable use of natural resources and the importance of causing no significant harm.\nWe have always been eager and committed to the establishment of a multilateral legal regime on the basin-wide use of the river. The Nile River Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement, signed in May 2010 after 13 years of negotiations, was our first and only truly inclusive multilateral treaty in this area. The consultations, negotiations, and signing of the Declaration of Principles on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam are a testament to Ethiopia\u2019s commitment to cooperation, in line with the Cooperative Framework Agreement.\nThe remaining technical matters regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam should be left to our experts. In this regard, the technical ministries of Ethiopia, the Sudan and Egypt met earlier this month in Cairo and will reconvene at the end of September and early October in Khartoum. We should encourage and give our fullest support to the technical experts to produce a scientific- and evidence-based recommendation. As we have always said, combined efforts in the Nile Basin are not an option but a necessity for win-win cooperation and successful mutual interdependence among the Nile Basin countries.\nWe are fully committed to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. From our own experience, we know that maintaining peace and security, reducing poverty and achieving prosperity are attainable. The world has the resources, capabilities and capacity to preserve our planet, but time is truly running out. We must accelerate the processes to implement and deliver on commitments, avoid leaving anyone behind and provide the policies needed for employment, development, peace and security. Above all, we must work towards a multinational global environment in which all our concerns and interests are taken into account and we can move forward together to achieve our goal of collective security and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Turkish nation and on my own behalf, I salute the General Assembly with the most heartfelt emotion.\nI would like to thank Ms. Espinosa Garces for her successful work over the past year. I also wholeheartedly congratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad Bande, who has taken up the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I hope and pray that this session of the Assembly will bring peace and prosperity to the whole world and humankind.\nOur world today faces many challenges and much pain resulting from injustice on a global scale. The great scholar of our civilization, Rumi, once defined justice as \u201cappropriately sharing rights and obligations among the people and allocating to them what they are entitled to\u201d.\nIt is obvious that today neither people\u2019s rights nor their responsibilities are shared appropriately. At the same time, injustice generates instability, power struggles, crises, waste and extravagance. Yet the Organization in whose Hall we are gathered today was established in the aftermath of the Second World War with the ultimate purpose of eradicating injustice.\nIndeed, the international community is gradually losing its ability to find lasting solutions to such challenges as terrorism, hunger, misery and climate change, all of which threaten the future of all of us. We have no doubt that the theme for the seventy- fourth session of the General Assembly is fitting in that regard: \u201c Galvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d.\nBut what is more important than that is to understand what we can achieve together. It is unacceptable to see that one part of the world lives in luxury and enjoys the benefits of prosperity while people in other parts of the world suffer at the hands of poverty, misery and illiteracy. It is painful to see that, while a fortunate minority in the world is discussing such issues as digital technology, robotics, artificial intelligence and obesity, more than 2 billion people are living under the poverty line and 1 billion people are suffering from hunger. We cannot turn our backs on the reality that, until all of us are safe, none of us will be safe.\nFor many years I have been saying from this rostrum that we cannot leave the fate of humankind to the discretion of a handful of countries. Today I would like to reiterate once again that the world is greater than five countries. It is high time that we change our current mentality, our institutions, organizations and rules. The inequality between nuclear-weapon States and non-nuclear-weapon States is by itself enough to undermine global stability. It bothers us, like everyone else, that weapons of mass destruction, instead of being totally eliminated, are used as leverage in every crisis. The possession of nuclear power should either be forbidden for all or permissible for everyone. For the sake of a peaceful future for all humankind, let us solve that problem as soon as possible on the basis of justice.\nAt a time when 13 people lose their lives every minute owing to air pollution and when global warming threatens our very future, we cannot afford to remain indifferent. First and foremost, we need to strengthen the capacity and efficiency of the United Nations. In particular, we should immediately carry out much- needed fundamental reforms of the Security Council, in line with the principles of justice and equality.\nWith a proactive and humane foreign policy, Turkey embraces the rest of the world and strives to find justice-based solutions to our problems. It is not without reason that Turkey has earned distinction as the most generous country in terms of humanitarian aid and the country hosting the largest number of displaced persons in the world.\nThe third African Union-Turkey Partnership summit, to be held in Turkey in 2020, is another concrete example of our dedication and our proactive humanitarian policy. I invite all the countries present in this Hall to support our policies and initiatives, which we have formulated on the basis of justice, ethics and conscience.\nSyria today has become a wound in the collective conscience of humankind and a symbol of global injustice. Since 2011 the regime and terrorist organizations, as well as the forces encouraging them, have been pursuing a policy of perpetual crisis. Almost 1 million people have been killed and 12 million people have been displaced, while half of the population has been forced to live elsewhere. The Syrian crisis needs to be ended once and for all.\nTurkey is the country most affected by the threat of Da\u2019esh, the terrorist organization that has threatened our borders and targeted the very heart of surrounding cities with suicide bombings, killing hundreds of Turkish citizens. Turkey is the country that has inflicted the most important and heaviest blow against the presence of Da\u2019esh in Syria. Through Operation Euphrates Shield, we have neutralized approximately 3,500 Da\u2019esh terrorists and paved the way for that terrorist organization\u2019s downfall in Syria. We are also at the forefront of international efforts to identify the terrorists and foreign fighters who come from all over the world to join Da\u2019esh, by imposing entry bans and deportations to and from our country.\nAt the same time, Turkey is the most generous country today in terms of humanitarian aid and in terms of the ratio between official humanitarian assistance and gross domestic product. We are currently hosting 5 million asylum seekers who are fleeing conflict, starvation and persecution. In other words, there are more asylum-seekers in Turkey than in the combined population of 29 states of the United States, and 3.6 million of them are from Syria. In fact, the number of Syrian brothers and sisters we are currently hosting on our soil is well over half the population of New York City.\nWe have devoted $40 billion to the asylum seekers over the past eight years. But have we in Turkey received anything? I will tell the Assembly. To date we have received no more than \u20ac3 billion from the European Union, not as direct contributions into our national budget but through international organizations. That amount was allocated to the Disaster Relief Agency of Turkey and the Turkish Red Crescent.\nOf the asylum seekers who have fled to our country, 365,000 have safely returned to areas that we have secured within Syria, including the city of Jarablus. Nearly half the Syrian asylum seekers in Turkey are under the age of 18. The number of Syrian children born on our territory has reached 500,000. We provide them not only housing but also with essential services, such as education and health care.\nUnfortunately, the international community has been too quick to forget the journey of survival that they have made, ending either in the dark waters of the Mediterranean Sea or confronted by the security fences stretching along the borders that they are trying to flee. As the Assembly can see, this is the picture of baby Aylan, whose lifeless body washed ashore not so long ago but has already been forgotten. We should never forget that that could happen to any of us. There are many baby Aylans. There are millions of baby Aylans. And we need to take action for them. It is a responsibility to which we must rise.\nIn the first eight months of this year alone, we saved 32,000 irregular migrants from drowning at sea and sent 58,000 irregular migrants, excluding Syrians, back to their countries. Together with those fleeing other parts of the world, Turkey currently hosts 5 million oppressed and victimized people on its soil. Unfortunately, we have been abandoned in our selfless sacrifice to benefit asylum-seekers.\nGenuine return has not been possible to the regions in Syria controlled by the regime and terrorist organizations such as the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party- Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (PKK-YPG) and Da\u2019esh. Syrians who fled their country for their lives have been able to return only to those areas liberated and secured by Turkey. Today we face three important issues that must be dealt with as we seek to resolve the humanitarian crisis in Syria.\nThe first is the territorial integrity and political unity of Syria, which depends greatly on an effectively functioning constitutional committee. We met with our Russian and Iranian counterparts in Ankara early last week and, through the Russian summit memorandum, have managed to accomplish most of our goals. When a permanent political solution is reached in Syria, territorial integrity will be restored.\nThe second important issue is that we must do everything possible to prevent a possible massacre in the city of Idlib and a wave of migration 4 million strong. Despite some setbacks, the agreement we reached with Russia in Sochi on that issue remains valid. Turkey cannot withstand another influx of migration. We therefore expect all countries around the world to support Turkey\u2019s efforts to ensure security and stability in Idlib.\nThe third important issue is the elimination of the PKK-YPG terrorist organization east of the Euphrates, where it occupies one quarter of Syria and seeks to legitimize itself as the so-called Syrian democratic forces. We will not be able to find a permanent solution to the issue of Syria if we fail to deal with all terrorist organizations in the same way.\nWe remain engaged in talks with the United States with a view to establishing a safe zone within Syria. We intend to establish a peace corridor in Syria, 30 kilometres wide by 480 kilometres long, where we hope, with the support of the international community, to facilitate the settlement of 2 million Syrians.\nI would like to show the Assembly a map illustrating our plans \u2014 the border with Turkey and the proposed safe zone below. If such a safe zone can be established, we could confidently resettle between 1 million and 2 million refugees. Achieving that goal is within our reach. By working together \u2014 with the United States, the coalition forces, Russia and Iran \u2014 we could resettle the refugees, thereby saving them from tent camps or container camps. We can take the necessary steps by working together. The Republic of Turkey cannot bear that burden alone. We need to take the necessary measures as soon as possible.\nIf the region can be extended to the Deir ez-Zor/Raqqa line, we could increase to 3 million the number of Syrians who will return from Turkey, Europe and other parts of the world. We are resolutely committed to implementing that plan and have already begun the necessary preparations.\nWe are also laying the groundwork for the holding of an international conference with the participation of Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. We also attach great importance to the success of the Global Refugee Forum, which we will co-chair in Geneva in December. In our view, a donor conference should be convened under the auspices of the United Nations to support returns to safe areas. There is also a need for worldwide implementation of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and the global compact on refugees, as adopted and affirmed at the United Nations last year.\nIf we succeed in establishing an environment of trust and stability on the basis of the principles of legitimacy and justice in Syria, we will also help to alleviate the situation in neighbouring Iraq that has been generated by the presence of Da\u2019esh and the PKK. I take this opportunity to call on the entire United Nations family to engage in initiatives and support our ongoing efforts to stop the humanitarian crisis in Syria.\nThe Mediterranean basin, in addition to the tragedies triggered by the Syrian crisis, such as illegal migration, faces further problems owing to developments in the eastern Mediterranean. Despite negotiations over more than five decades, the Cyprus question has yet to be resolved because of the uncompromising position of the Greek Cypriots.\nThe Greek Cypriot side has been pursuing an inequitable and unjust policy of imposition and refuses to share political power and prosperity with the Turkish Cypriots. Turkey is the international treaty-based guarantor of the Turkish Cypriot people, with whom it has deep historical and cultural bonds. Similarly, Greece is a guarantor, as well the United Kingdom. It is clear that those who claim to be working towards solving the Cyprus problem with zero security and zero guarantee have had ill-intentions from the outset.\nFor its part, Turkey will continue its efforts until a solution that guarantees the security and rights of the Turkish Cypriot people is reached. We believe that the energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean constitute an important opportunity for cooperation if we all adopt a win-win approach. Unfortunately, however, despite our reasonable approach, some countries in the region, through unilateral action, are trying to turn the issue of energy resources into a conflict.\nIn the eastern Mediterranean, we are determined to protect the legitimate rights and interests of both Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot people until the very end. We will continue to be open minded to all proposals based on cooperation and equitable sharing.\nLibya is another critical area of the Mediterranean. We endeavour to ensure security and stability in the country by establishing a democratic Administration based on the free will of the people. The political and economic empowerment of Libya will provide relief for both North Africa and Europe. The solution in that country can be reached only by respecting the choices and the free will of the Libyan people.\nInterventions in Yemen and Qatar have had serious consequences in both humanitarian and economic terms. We should all seek an immediate settlement to that crisis in the region, which has re-emerged as a result of the attacks on oil production facilities.\nWe will continue to follow the developments relating to the demise of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was brutally murdered last year and on whose case the courts have yet to reach a verdict, because we are steadfast in our commitment in that regard.\nAnother issue that we are heavily invested in is that Egypt\u2019s first democratically elected President, Mohamed Morsi, suspiciously lost his life in a court room and his family was not allowed to give him a proper burial. That remains a bleeding wound in our hearts. They have both become a profound symbol of the need for justice and equality in the region.\nWe also hope that the discussions about Iran\u2019s activities, as well as the related threats to that country, will be resolved in a rational manner.\nThe Palestinian territories today under Israeli occupation have become one of the most striking places of injustice. If the images of an innocent Palestinian woman who was heinously murdered by Israeli security forces on the street just a few days ago will not awaken the global conscience, then we have reached a point where words no longer suffice.\nI am quite curious about this map of Israel. Where does the land of Israel begin and end? Look at this map. Where was Israel in 1947 and where is Israel now? Where was Israel between the years of 1949 and 1967 in particular, and where is it now? Look. This is 1947, the land of Palestine. There is almost no Israeli presence in those lands; the entire territory belongs to the Palestinians, as the map suggests.\nHowever, in 1947, the distribution plan took place and was ratified, Palestinian lands began to shrink and Israel started expanding. From 1947 to 1967 Israel continued to expand and Palestine continued to shrink. In the current situation there is seemingly no Palestinian presence and the entire land belongs to Israel. But is that enough for Israel? No, Israel remains intent on taking over the remaining territories.\nWhat about the Security Council, the United Nations and their resolutions? Are those resolutions being activated, implemented and enforced? No, they are not. We must therefore ask ourselves, what purpose does the United Nations serve? Under this roof we adopt resolutions that effect no change. When and where, then, can justice prevail? That is the origin of our suffering and pain. The current Israeli Government, together with their murders and atrocities, is busy intervening in and attacking the historical legal status of Jerusalem and its holy sacred sites and artefacts.\nWe as Turkey have a clear stance on that issue \u2014 the immediate establishment of an independent Palestinian State, with homogeneous territories on the basis of the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital, is the only solution. Any other peace plan, apart from that, will never stand a chance at being fair, just and implemented.\nNow, from the rostrum of the General Assembly, I ask those present, where are the borders of the State of Israel? Are they the 1947 borders, the 1967 borders or is there another border of which we must be informed? How can the Golan Heights and the West Bank settlements be seized, just like other occupied Palestinian territories, before the eyes of the world if they do not fall within the official borders of that State? Is the aim of the initiative promoted as the deal of the century to entirely eliminate the presence of the State and the people of Palestine? Is there a thirst for more bloodshed?\nAll the actors of the international community, in particular the United Nations, should provide concrete support to the Palestinian people beyond mere promises. It is very important in that regard for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East to continue its activities effectively. Turkey will continue to stand by the oppressed people of Palestine, as it has always done.\nIt is also very important for the South Caucasus to cease to be one of the areas of conflict and tension in the world, with a view to achieving a fair and peaceful future. It is unacceptable that Nagorno Karabakh and its surrounding areas, which are Azerbaijani territories, are still occupied despite all the resolutions that have been adopted in that regard.\nOne of the problems to which the international community has failed to devote enough attention is the Kashmir conflict, which has been awaiting a solution for 72 years. The stability and prosperity of South Asia cannot be separated from the Kashmir issue. Despite the resolutions that the Security Council has adopted, Kashmir remains besieged and 8 million people are still stuck in Kashmir; they cannot leave. In order for the Kashmiri people to look towards a safe future with their Pakistani and Indian neighbours, it is imperative to solve the problem with dialogue and on the basis of justice and equality, instead of with conflict.\nAnother issue to which the world appears to remain indifferent is the humanitarian tragedy faced by Rohingya Muslims. The independent commission of inquiry, established under the auspices of the United Nations, has recorded the existence of a genocidal intent behind the events perpetrated in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state. Turkey will continue to carry out initiatives to ensure the security and fundamental rights of the Rohingya people, as well as the humanitarian relief activities it has undertaken since day one.\nThe invasions, conflicts and terrorist activities that have continued uninterrupted in Afghanistan for almost four decades have also raised challenges at the global level. It is high time for peace and security to be restored. It is up to us to assume that responsibility and to take action.\nToday, one of the biggest threats to global peace and stability is the rise in racist, xenophobic, discriminatory and anti-Islamic rhetoric. Muslims are the primary targets of hate speech, discrimination and defamation against their sacred values. The most striking recent example was the terrorist attack perpetrated last March in Christchurch, New Zealand.\nJust as the terrorist attack targeting Muslims in New Zealand was wrong and unacceptable, acts of terrorism targeting Christians in Sri Lanka and Jewish communities in the United States are equally wrong and unacceptable. We are responsible for turning that disease into a raging insanity. Populist politicians seeking votes by provoking such tendencies, as well as the communities that normalize hate speech under the pretext of freedom of expression, are primarily the ones to blame.\nPrejudice, ignorance and bigotry, as well as attempts to marginalize migrants, in particular Muslims, have paved the way for the rise in such morbid tendencies, which can be defeated only by our common will and efforts. As statesmen and stateswomen, it is our fundamental duty to adopt inclusive and tolerant public rhetoric to eradicate the scourge of terrorism once and for all.\nThe Secretary-General recently introduced the Plan of Action to Safeguard Religious Sites, a United Nations initiative in the establishment of which Turkey played a lead political role within the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations. We hope it will help raise awareness on the issue. I hereby request the designation of 15 March by the United Nations \u2014 the date the Christchurch attack was carried out \u2014 as the International Day for Solidarity against Islamophobia. I also invite the Islamic world to start a thorough assessment of all issues, in particular the Sunni-Shia divide, which have fuelled its internal conflicts and political power struggles to date, and to settle their disputes once and for all.\nTurkey is a rightful successor to the collective heritage of both Eastern and Western civilizations, owing to its geographical location at the centre of the ancient world. Therefore, we are obliged to take the necessary steps, assume responsibility and rise to the occasion. We will continue to fulfil our responsibilities to humankind because we are deeply affected, directly and indirectly, by the crises that besiege our region.\nA United Nations \u2014 and especially a Security Council \u2014 that is reformed on the basis of justice, moral values and conscience will again give hope and aspirations to humankind. Turkey stands ready to support all endeavours and initiatives in that regard. With that understanding, we are willing to assume the presidency of the General Assembly at it seventy-fifth session We have therefore nominated to that important post Ambassador Volkan Bozkir, former Minister of European Union Affairs and current Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. We have full confidence that Mr. Bozkir, a seasoned diplomat and politician, will shoulder that responsibility very successfully. I trust that the Assembly will give him its full support.\nIstanbul, the biggest city in Turkey, currently hosts various United Nations regional agencies and we would like to turn Istanbul into a bigger regional and global hub for the United Nations. The United Nations Technology Bank for the Least Developed Countries became operational last year in Istanbul. We also appreciate the positive and encouraging reactions we have received to date to our proposal to host a United Nations youth centre in Istanbul, which I announced last year from this very rostrum (see A/73/PV.6).\nThere are now 59 members of the Group of Friends of Mediation, which we co-chair. We have carried that United Nations initiative into the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. I believe that it is within our reach to find fair, equitable and conscientious solutions to all the global challenges we face.\nI would like to conclude my remarks with the following wishes: freedom for all, peace for all, prosperity for all, justice for all and a peaceful and safe future for all. I wish every success for the work of the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly. On behalf of my people, I extend greetings to all members with the most heartfelt love and respect.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate the President, Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of Nigeria, on his election to lead the General Assembly at this session. I also thank Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his pivotal role in galvanizing the world to fight climate change and in addressing the challenges of our global community. I have the distinct honour and special pleasure of addressing the Assembly on behalf of the people of the Federated States of Micronesia, from whom I bring warm greetings. As a sovereign State, my country greatly values this opportunity to be able to reach out to every peace-loving nation in the world represented here today.\nWe are at a critical crossroads. The challenges we are collectively facing as a global community are unprecedented. The Assembly, as the main deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations, must be innovative and ready to adapt to the emerging realities and issues confronting us. For Micronesia \u2014 and this may be the case for most Member States \u2014 further strengthening the role of the United Nations in international relations is imperative and indispensable. The role of the United Nations in maintaining peace and stability throughout the world is more crucial than ever, as the world increasingly finds itself dealing with conflicts, wars, fleeing refugees and closing borders. Many States are turning inwards in the mistaken belief that global unity undermines national sovereignty. Tragically, the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable communities are often at the mercy of those who could have made constructive and progressive changes. Meanwhile, record-breaking heatwaves, wildfires, king tides and bewildering natural disasters have become prevalent in many parts of the world. Environmental crises in particular have reached a scale and magnitude unprecedented in human history. Our world is becoming complex, our environment is changing and our challenges are becoming more and more daunting.\nMicronesia remains committed to extending to others what we seek from every country \u2014 peace, cooperation, friendship and love in our common human experience. We are resolute in our belief that there is no greater strength than respect and empathy for other human beings. It is through that resolve that we are committed to global unity in the United Nations, and I appeal to everyone here to show that we are united in our response to our challenges.\nAs we all know, 22 years have passed since the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol and four since the adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Those agreements appeal strongly to us, the small island developing States (SIDS), as a matter of common sense and survival. For us, climate change and its far-reaching effects and threats to the future of small island developing States are intolerable. Those of us who are from low-lying atolls and coastal areas across the Pacific are living the reality of climate change. That reality has become our nightmare. The chorus of appeals and pleas from this rostrum, particularly from leaders from small island developing States, demonstrates the extent to which our peoples, on the front lines of climate change, are alarmed by its impact on our planet and on the fate of our present and future generations. I believe that actions speak louder than words, and I have told my citizens that our actions today are critical to our country\u2019s prosperity tomorrow. In the same way, the world\u2019s actions today are critical to our global prosperity tomorrow. Climate change is real, and we must all take the necessary action to ensure our survival.\nAs Micronesia is addressing the existential threat of climate change, we want to point out that it is impossible to tackle it without protecting the ocean, the world\u2019s largest carbon sink. We have partnered with the Blue Prosperity Coalition to create a comprehensive, climate-smart marine spatial plan for our exclusive economic zone. That partnership will further enhance our national capacity to conserve marine resources and ecosystems, including by establishing marine protected areas in at least 30 per cent of our exclusive economic zone. That marine-protected-area coverage will become one of the world\u2019s largest. Micronesia is also committed to strengthening the monitoring and control of fishing activities through the Technology for Tuna Transparency Challenge, in partnership with the Nature Conservancy. The initiative implements electronic monitoring in tuna fisheries to reach the goal of 100 per cent transparency and coverage by 2023.\nA few years ago, Micronesia enacted a national law that made it mandatory for all sectors in the national Government to mainstream climate change in all their policies and action plans. That ongoing mainstreaming effort is a first for Pacific island countries and underscores our commitment to addressing climate change in all its aspects. One of the consequences is that extensive solarization has begun in various public and economic sectors throughout Micronesia. Additionally, it was Micronesia that championed the negotiation and adoption of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons. Scientists tell us that implementation of the Amendment could lead preventing as much as .5\u00b0C of global warming, which is crucial in the light of the recent findings in Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0 C, the special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The Amendment entered into force in January, and we encourage the international community to put that crucial component of the fight against climate change into action.\nMoreover, through State legislation we are putting in place a ban on most forms of plastic, thereby reducing our carbon footprint, with a proposed national bill aimed at banning imported plastics on a country-wide scale. Micronesia is also in the process of updating its nationally determined contribution to greenhouse-gas reduction for submission next year. Those are just a few of the initiatives that our country is engaged in to take action today for our world\u2019s environmental prosperity tomorrow. We encourage our partners to join us in those efforts, including by providing the necessary support.\nI urge the United Nations system, including, and perhaps most importantly, the Security Council, to step up to address climate change as an integral part of its work. The Council must transcend its traditional mandates and address the security implications of climate change, which is the single greatest security issue facing the world at present, and it affects each and every one of us. The General Assembly recently adopted resolution 73/332, calling for greater support and cooperation with the Pacific island countries, and I want to take that a step further. The United Nations was formed to prevent the onslaught of a possible third world war or some other man-made calamity. We are presently in a war against climate change, and it is a war that humankind can win if we first acknowledge the existential threat it poses and if the Security Council treats it as such, because it is in fact a security threat.\nWe must be radical in combating climate change. It may be very difficult for us, and very painful to make the transition from one lifestyle to another, but we owe it to our future generations across the globe \u2014 those who are protesting outside on our streets, the young people who joined the Secretary-General during the Climate Action Summit and all people who depend on us to genuinely and legitimately speak for them \u2014 to do what must be done.\nA recent United States Department of Defense report stated that the effects of climate change are a national security issue with potential effects on the Department\u2019s missions, operational plans and installations. The United States provides for the overall defence of the vast airspace and ocean space of our Freely Associated States, that is, Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands. While the United States, Australia and Japan collectively provide for the overall peace, safety and freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific region, there is no greater security issue for our Blue Pacific continent than climate change. It is an existential threat to our countries.\nNo one is immune to climate change, even the most developed countries \u2014 such as, for example, the United States. In order to adapt to or minimize the adverse effects of climate change, the United States has invested billions of dollars in coastal areas such as Florida, California, New York and Hawaii, to name only a few. Large countries are vulnerable, too. I have faith in the willingness of the citizens of the United States to keep pushing their Government to embrace renewable energy and become more sympathetic to the\nBlue Pacific narrative. We encourage the United States and other leading developed countries to champion the fight against climate change. The United States and its citizens are our true friends and closest ally in our enduring relationship. The meeting of the Presidents of Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands with President Trump in May, and Secretary of State Pompeo\u2019s visit to the Federated States of Micronesia in August, demonstrate that our relationship is enduring, special, perpetual and sincere. We look forward to beginning and completing the negotiations on the expiring provisions of our Compact of Free Association.\nWhile it is gratifying to see the United Nations embrace the value of universal membership to address global issues, the realities of the twenty-first century are not adequately addressed by the Security Council\u2019s current set-up. In order to improve the Council and ensure that it can respond effectively to the new challenges of a new era, we must work together to reform it. The time has come for that reform to move forward.\nAs we gather here at the United Nations, it is truly regrettable that we are once again witnessing the far-reaching and apocalyptic effects of climate change, such as the recent devastation inflicted by a hurricane on our sister small island developing State of the Bahamas. It only lends credence to what small island developing States have warned about many for years. It is clear that the ambitious actions on the climate that Member States so urgently require can save the most vulnerable among us. My heart goes out to the Government and the people of the Bahamas during this time of national crisis, and I offer them Micronesia\u2019s solidarity and condolences.\nI want to take this opportunity to express my personal appreciation to Secretary-General Guterres for his visit to the Pacific region this year, as he is only the second Secretary-General to visit the Pacific small island developing States in the nearly 75-year history of the United Nations. His momentous visit put a spotlight on the climate crisis and the deepening threats to the ocean. I also commend him for leading the Climate Action Summit to raise ambitions and increase action on climate, an issue that is front and centre for all small island developing States and indeed the entire world. The climate disaster, crisis, emergency, threat or whatever one chooses to call it is not just a problem for the small island developing States, Europe or America. It is a problem for all humankind. Together we will save ourselves or together we will all perish.\nBeyond the significant importance of close cooperation with our development partners, there are also complementary and significant steps that we are engaging in through South-South cooperation in order to fully realize and implement the Sustainable Development Goals, including with regard to climate change and the ocean.\nAs a big-ocean State, Micronesia commands a major part of the Pacific Ocean, and we have delineated our maritime zones according to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It would be a travesty, however, if our maritime zones and our right to them were challenged or reduced because of sea-level rise, to which we are among those who contribute the least. In that regard, we welcome the International Law Commission\u2019s decision earlier this year to study the topic of sea-level rise. I urge the international community to develop State practices that respect the permanence of maritime baselines and zones, irrespective of sea-level rise.\nMicronesia is actively participating in the negotiations for a an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. We look forward to concluding those negotiations in 2020 with a durable and practical agreement in place that among other things takes into account the special circumstances of small island developing States and the relevant traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples and local communities, and that prevents a disproportionate burden of the conservation and management of resources from falling on small island developing States.\nAs a big-ocean State, a key concern for my small island country is rightly that of a healthy ocean. The conservation and sustainable use of our ocean is a key driver of our country\u2019s sustainable economic development, prosperity, and stability. In that connection, as responsible stewards of the blue Pacific, our leaders have welcomed and committed to the efforts to eliminate marine litter and emphasized the urgency of implementing the Pacific Marine Litter Action Plan, launched last year, which will make a real difference to our ocean\u2019s sustainability.\nWe are a big-ocean State. Our exclusive economic zone constitutes nearly 3 million square kilometres, or one third of the area of Australia. The ocean provides Micronesia\u2019s wealth, whether through our fisheries or our traditional culture of navigating by the stars. As part of the blue Pacific continent, Micronesia is committed by the declaration of the Pacific Island Forum leaders to ensuring the long-term sustainability and viability of the region\u2019s fisheries resources, recognizing their centrality to the well-being of our communities and economies. However, the types of challenges that confront our Pacific region require international cooperation to address their stark realities. They include large-scale illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities that ravage healthy fish stocks and undermine our prosperity and economic development. IUU fishing blatantly disregards our national laws, the relevant United Nations resolutions and the region\u2019s resolve to sustainably manage and conserve our marine resources. It poses a grave threat to regional security.\nEarlier this year, in his report on United Nations development system reform (A/74/73), the Secretary-General expressed his support for the North Pacific, recommending that we establish a dedicated multi-country office to attend to the needs of the five Micronesian countries. A new approach to meeting the challenges of our vast region of the Pacific is clearly of major importance to us in our efforts to implement the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Decisions such as these are hugely important to the greater Micronesian region, and in that regard I would like to emphasize the important role that an on-the-ground multi-country office would play. I also want to express my gratitude to our Secretary-General for his foresight in considering Micronesia a region that deserves greater focus.\nWe need a United Nations that can meet the challenges of the twenty-first century, dedicated to acting with bold decisions in order to tackle the security threats posed by climate change, to eradicating poverty and resolving armed conflicts, to leading the poor out of poverty and bringing sustainable development to all \u2014 in short, a United Nations that leaves no one behind. In the final analysis, the success of the United Nations rests on the collective will of all 193 members of the Assembly. I thank the President of the General Assembly and leaders around the world for giving me the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Government and the people of the Federated States of Micronesia. God bless us all.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by congratulating His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on becoming President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I applaud his emphasis on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Palau looks forward to working further with him on that important priority.\nLet me also express my thanks to his predecessor, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her leadership over the past year.\nI also want to express my deep condolences to the people of the Bahamas and all the victims of Hurricane Dorian. They must know that, as fellow islanders, the people of Palau stand in solidarity with them.\nI would like to recall the words of my predecessor in his first address to the General Assembly 25 years ago, after Palau was formally admitted as the 185th member of the United Nations. He said, \u201cMy country, with approximately 20,000 citizens, will be one of the smallest Members of this Organization, but we are large in the things that count: a strong cultural heritage; a commitment to human rights and a democratic Government; resources \u2014 both human and marine \u2014 which we are particularly proud of; and, most of all, the support and friendship of our brothers and sisters in the international family of nations.\u201d (A/49/PV.89, p.5)\nOn the eve of our twenty-fifth anniversary of independence, those words still ring true. To my predecessor\u2019s list, I would add only that Palau is also large in its sense of responsibility for protecting the marine environment and the climate system. As a large ocean State, we strongly believe that our small island nation has much to contribute to those global efforts, and that important work must begin at home. In that regard, my Government had the pleasure to present its first voluntary national review to the High-level Political Forum of the Economic and Social Council.\nThe voluntary national review recognized our important achievements, such as universal education, ending hunger and establishing our protected area network. Palau has proclaimed 2019 as the Year of Innovative Learning and Excellence, in recognition of the fact that our people are our greatest resource. Improving education and developing our human capital is necessary to thrive in a globalized world.\nPalau has made recent progress in achieving near- universal health coverage, but challenges remain in the area of improving the quality of health care and the durability of health-care systems in the face of the climate crisis. However, our voluntary national review also identified areas requiring greater attention, including improving nutrition, transitioning to a low- carbon energy system and building the resilience of our public infrastructure and essential public services.\nIn my address last year (see A/73/PV.9), I highlighted the prevalence of non-communicable diseases in Palau, which has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world. One step since then has been a directive that I signed for all Government food service systems to serve pelagic fish as a way of encouraging traditional, healthier diets. However, that issue deserves much greater attention at the United Nations.\nSustainable marine protection has been a tradition in Palau that extends back thousands of years. For most of our history, the greatest threat has come from overfishing. When fisheries started to decline, the elders would declare a bul, or prohibition, and all fishing in that area would cease. Knowing when to exercise restraint has been key to the sustainable management of our marine environment.\nPalau has some of the most well-preserved coral reef ecosystems in the world. However, we face many challenges brought on by a globalized world. Local fisherman are not the only ones trawling our waters today, and the climate crisis threatens to render island lives and livelihoods untenable. Therefore, like our ancestors, Palau has once again declared a bul against fishing \u2014 but this time on a scale the world has rarely seen.\nIn just a few months from now, on 1 January 2020, the Palau National Marine Sanctuary will enter its implementation phase. Eighty per cent of our exclusive economic zone (EEZ), approximately 500,000 square kilometres of ocean, will be protected as a no-take area. The remaining 25 per cent will be open to artisanal fishing, where we also intend to develop our domestic fishing industry. Our ocean is a precious resource. We need to safeguard its health so that future generations can continue to benefit from its abundance.\nWe also look forward to hosting the seventh Our Ocean Conference in August 2020. We aim to galvanize further momentum on ocean action, as well as to take stock of what we have achieved so far and what remains to be done for the protection of our oceans.\nAs co-Chair of the High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, I am working with 13 other serving Heads of State to rebalance humankind\u2019s contract with the ocean. As the Panel continues to develop its recommendations for achieving a sustainable ocean economy ahead of the 2020 United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 \u2014 conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development \u2014 to be held in Lisbon, we reiterate our invitation to industry and the private sector to join us in that effort.\nWe also look forward to the successful conclusion of negotiations and the adoption of a new treaty on high seas biodiversity that will set the multilateral framework for us to effectively protect the high seas and complement our national efforts.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) today presented its Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. Its warnings about the impacts of the climate crisis on the ocean paint a picture of ocean neglect and of warming and acidifying seas that threaten fish life cycles and coral reefs. For a country like Palau, whose economy, culture and way of life are dependent on the ocean, that is of existential concern, but the IPCC\u2019s report also tells us that the health of the ocean should concern all countries.\nIf we are going to slow and stop the worst effects of the climate crisis, we cannot do so without turning to the ocean. The High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy also issued a call this week for ocean- based climate action to support the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Investing in nature-based solutions, decarbonizing ocean industries and securing sustainable food are solutions that we can all take collectively.\nI would like to thank the Secretary-General for his leadership in convening this week\u2019s Climate Action Summit. Palau is honoured to have been a member of the energy transition track for the Summit and to have presented and developed the small island developing States (SIDS) sustainable energy package, which is part of the commitment by SIDS to systematically and ambitiously transition to low-carbon economies. The package seeks to build the partnerships that generate action on the ground by scaling up the SIDS Lighthouses Initiative; SIDS will be empowered to develop ambitious and achievable plans for renewable energy and to attract new investment.\nIn Palau we are about to begin the task of installing the world\u2019s largest microgrid, which will enable us to meet our nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement well ahead of 2025. The formation of a public-private partnership has been critical to that endeavour. It is also vital that we see an ambitious response by our developed country brothers and sisters to replenish the United Nations Green Climate Fund. We thank those that have recently announced new commitments this week, including Denmark, Sweden, Monaco and South Korea, and we look forward to others coming forward to also increase their pledges of support.\nThe seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations next year has been identified as an important opportunity to reduce the trust deficit among nations. As part of the work to revitalize multilateralism, our United Nations institutions must be fit for purpose. The reform of the Security Council remains an urgent task in that regard. We urge the President of the General Assembly, together with the Secretary-General, to undertake consultations to advance the reform process and ensure that the Security Council better reflects the geopolitical realities of the world today.\nThe Security Council must also be prepared to take on the most pressing security challenges of our generation. We therefore reiterate the call of Pacific islands for the Secretary-General to appoint a special representative on climate and security.\nOur pathway to realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is enabled by a strong multilateral system. The political declaration adopted by the High-level Political Forum on sustainable\ndevelopment reminds us that accelerated action depends on accessible means of implementation. While Palau has made considerable gains in some key areas, progress can be greatly accelerated by durable partnerships and greater multilateral cooperation that take into consideration the needs of SIDS.\nThe mid-term review of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway also reiterates the special needs and circumstances of SIDS and emphasizes the importance of scaling up financing modalities. In particular, we welcome its recognition of the limitations of an income-only measure of development and its call to deepen and enhance partnership with SIDS. As was made tragically clear in the Bahamas, our vulnerabilities as SIDS to disasters and climate impacts are unique and threaten to undermine all our sustainable development efforts.\nImplementing the\tSecretary-General\u2019s recommendations for reform of the United Nations development system also remains an essential objective to ensure that no country is left behind. I therefore look forward to the establishment of a United Nations multi-country office in the North Pacific. As affirmed at the Micronesian Presidents Summit earlier this year, basing a multi-country office in one of the North Pacific countries will bring greater coherence to development support in the region and enhance the efforts of Micronesian SIDS to achieve the SDGs.\nOur collective commitment to leave no country behind also demands that we end our exclusion of Taiwan and its 23 million people, not only here in the General Assembly but also in the range of international bodies that are essential to establishing effective multilateralism, such as the World Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We know from our partnership with Taiwan about the strength of its commitment to the SDGs; its equal and dignified participation in 2030 Agenda processes will only strengthen our global effort to realize the Agenda.\nThe United States has been our friend for the longest time \u2014 our histories are deeply intertwined. We share its commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. We are proud of our close relationship through our Compact of Free Association and look forward to beginning discussions on its renewal.\nOne early step in our national journey was the development of our maritime capabilities to secure our large EEZ. Australia stepped forward to support that step by donating a patrol boat in 1996. We are delighted that Australia has extended its commitment to the Pacific patrol boat programme and will be replacing the PSS Remeliik with a new patrol boat in 2020. Australia\u2019s long record of support for capacity-building of marine law enforcement has been especially important in preparation for the implementation of the Palau National Marine Sanctuary.\nThe Government of India has been a growing partner in health and other fields by supporting our health-care system and diffusing small-scale solar technology through Palauans who have now been trained under the Solar Mamas project.\nWe view with concern North Korea\u2019s recent ballistic missile launches that violate Security Council resolutions. They threaten peace and stability in our region and around the world. Weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles of all ranges must be dismantled and the cooperation of all States is essential to fully implement relevant Security Council resolutions.\nIt seems like the last 25 years have passed in the blink of an eye. The first generation of Palauans born to an independent republic are already coming of age. Now our second generation of independent Palauans are just starting school. I am very confident that they can look forward to another 25 years in a country that is large in the things that count \u2014 large in its commitment to friendship and solidarity with this great family of nations.\nI am hopeful that they will live in a world that has seized this critical moment in history to avert the worst effects of the climate crisis; a world that has rebalanced its relationship with the land, the atmosphere and the oceans; a world that works with nature and not against her. This family is what gives me hope. It is what gives the people of Palau hope.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I firmly believe that he will skilfully lead our session to success.\nMay I express my appreciation to Her Excellency Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, for her important contributions to the work of the Assembly, as well as to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his work and dedication over the past year.\nEighty years ago, the Second World War broke out and became the deadliest chapter in the history of humankind. That global conflict took the lives of tens of millions and destroyed economies and societies. It witnessed horrendous crimes and the emergence of new weapons and means of warfare with unparalleled destructive power. By the close of that chapter, nations had come to realize the importance of a collective security system based on multilateral cooperation and international law as the foundation of a post-war global order. That has proved to be a wise choice.\nFor the past 75 years, multilateralism, with the United Nations at its heart, has become indispensable. Multilateral institutions provide the forums for States to deliberate and to establish common policies in all aspects of global governance, from the overarching themes of peace, security, economy, trade, development and human rights to specialized areas of cooperation in the maritime, aviation, postal and telecommunication spheres. They also generate ideas, set standards and strategies to coordinate the efforts of States to address traditional and non-traditional security challenges, and improve the quality of life.\nWe are at the threshold of the third decade of the twenty-first century. We can pride ourselves on a world of peace, cooperation and development. We can rejoice at the achievements of peace efforts in various regions, from Mali to Liberia and from South Sudan to Cote d\u2019Ivoire. Viet Nam welcomes all efforts to settle disputes by dialogue and peaceful means, including the dialogue process between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United States.\nWe have also seen significant achievements in global development. Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. The universalization of primary education has been achieved in many nations. Maternal and child mortality rates have been considerably reduced. Together, we have established important strategies and frameworks for global development efforts, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nYet multilateralism is facing acute challenges. It is alarming that narrowly interpreted national interests are chosen over common values and that big Power politics, coercion, competition and confrontation are favoured over cooperation, dialogue and respect for international law. The consequential reduction in political commitment and resources has impacted the efficiency and effectiveness of multilateral cooperation.\nAll that is happening at a time when the challenges we face are greater in magnitude and more complex in nature. No nation is immune to the immediate and long-term impacts of climate change, environmental degradation or pandemics. Conflicts are protracted in many areas, especially in the Middle East and Africa, while the risk of conflicts looms large in other regions. Battlegrounds are no longer confined within designated war zones but have spread to densely populated cities and villages.\nThe global arms control and non-proliferation regime is becoming more fragile. The development of science and technology has brought about new means and methods of warfare. Global military spending is at its highest. In the words of the Secretary-General, the world is on the verge of a new Cold War.\nIn that context, we welcome the timely theme set by the President for this session \u2014 \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d.\nMultilateral cooperation has a special place in Viet Nam\u2019s foreign policy. Our history of reform, development and international integration are closely associated with our participation in global and regional multilateral institutions. The assistance of the United Nations and other international organizations helped Viet Nam to rebuild the country after decades of war.\nSolid policy and legal frameworks have allowed Viet Nam to further advance integration and socioeconomic development and better implement global development goals. The United Nations and multilateral forums have provided Viet Nam with important political and legal platforms to expand our cooperation with nations of the world.\nViet Nam has been an active and constructive partner in multilateral processes. We are working with other States members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to enhance ASEAN\u2019s centrality in promoting peace, security and prosperity in Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region.\nIn the United Nations, members of the Viet Nam People\u2019s Army have joined the Organization\u2019s peacekeeping operations. Our diplomats and experts have contributed substantively to the development of United Nations agendas and policies on sustainable development, oceans and seas, and human rights, inter alia. Viet Nam is strongly committed to the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and in particular is taking concrete steps to put an end to single-use plastics by 2025. Viet Nam is honoured to have been elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. On behalf of the Government and the people of Viet Nam, I wish to extend to the Assembly our most sincere gratitude for once again entrusting us with that important position. As a member of the Council, Viet Nam will do its level best to work with the broader United Nations membership towards the ultimate goals of sustainable peace and development.\nGiven today\u2019s daunting challenges, it is critical that we all work to revitalize multilateralism and strengthen the United Nations. I would like to offer some thoughts on how that can be achieved.\nFirst, we must all reaffirm the fundamental importance of international law and the Charter of the United Nations in international relations and multilateral cooperation. International law is the foundation of equal relations among States. Our actions must be in line with and guided by respect for international law. Viet Nam believes that respect for international law is the most effective means of preventing conflicts and seeking sustainable solutions to disputes. We support all efforts aimed at the settlement of disputes by peaceful means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law, including through negotiation, conciliation and judicial settlement.\nWe call for the immediate lifting of the unilateral embargoes imposed against Cuba, which contravene international law. We urge the relevant parties in the South China Sea to respect international law, especially the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) of 1982, which is appropriately referred to as the constitution for the oceans and seas. Linking the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the South China Sea is strategically important to peace, security and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. The efforts of the relevant States have yielded positive outcomes in settling differences and disputes. However, Viet Nam has on many occasions voiced its concerns over the recent complicated developments in the South China Sea, including serious incidents that infringe upon Viet Nam\u2019s sovereign rights and jurisdiction in our maritime zones, as defined by UNCLOS. The relevant States should exercise self-restraint and refrain from conducting unilateral acts that may complicate the situation or escalate tensions at sea, and disputes should be settled by peaceful means, in accordance with international law, including UNCLOS.\nSecondly, it is important to enhance global and regional synergies. Global actions can be effective only if adapted to the particular historical, socioeconomic, political, cultural and geographical conditions of each region and State. Regional organizations could play a critical role in supporting United Nations efforts. Viet Nam welcomes the cooperation between the United Nations \u2014 especially the Security Council \u2014 and the African Union, the European Union and the League of Arab States in addressing security challenges in Africa and the Middle East.\nIn the South-East Asia region, ASEAN is a regional institution that is based on shared commitments and collective responsibility in enhancing regional peace, security and prosperity. In the more than 50 years since its founding, ASEAN has become an embodiment of the vision of regional Governments and peoples of a politically, economically and socially connected community. ASEAN has proved its centrality in the regional rules-based security architecture and provided a forum for States of the region and elsewhere to cooperate on matters pertaining to sustainable development and peace and stability in the region and around the world.\nIn 2020, Viet Nam will assume the chairmanship of ASEAN, at the same time as serving on the Security Council. We will endeavour to enhance cooperation and complementarity between the Council and regional organizations, particularly in the area of conflict prevention and sustainable peace efforts.\nThirdly, multilateral efforts need to put people at their heart. Lasting peace is a prerequisite for sustainable development and can be achieved only when the basic safety and living conditions of people are ensured. Viet Nam deplores all attacks against civilians and the infrastructure critical to their survival. We support and are committed to the advancement of United Nations agendas on women, peace and stability and children and armed conflicts. Viet Nam has endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration with a view to joining efforts to protect children\u2019s right to education under all circumstances. We will promote post-conflict reconstruction efforts, particularly mine action, for the safety of people and the socioeconomic recovery and development of States.\nFourthly, multilateral institutions must be reformed in order to meet new requirements and better serve the interests of Member States, especially developing States in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Viet Nam welcomes all efforts to reform the United Nations development system in order to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness. We underline the need to increase Government ownership and to garner the contributions of non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders and communities. Viet Nam will work with Member States to actively contribute to reforming the working methods of the Security Council in order to enhance its transparency, democracy and effectiveness.\nFinally, the political commitment of world leaders is indispensable to any efforts aimed at revitalizing multilateralism. The United Nations and the multilateral system can be empowered only if all countries commit to the greater good of the international community instead of narrowly defined interests and invest their will and resources. Only when such commitment is guaranteed can we enter a new, brighter chapter in the history of humankind \u2014 a chapter of cooperation and dialogue; a chapter of sustainable peace and development."

        "file_text": "At the beginning of my statement, my delegation would first like to thank Almighty God, who has enabled for us to gather in this fine General Assembly Hall to discuss frankly the issues that we hold dear to our hearts in the name of humankind. We thank the host country and city for the kindness and well-known hospitality towards us since our arrival in this magnificent city of New York, Headquarters of the Organization. My delegation would also like to convey to Member States the warmest greetings and wishes for success at this meeting of the people of Burundi and His Excellency Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the Republic of Burundi, who honoured me with the task of representing him today.\nAllow me to extend my warm congratulations to His Excellency Ambassador Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on his excellent election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth ordinary session. The great qualities and skills that we all recognize in him are undoubtedly a guarantee of the success of the work of this session, whose central theme \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d pragmatically deals with the key challenges facing the world today. The President can of course count on Burundi\u2019s full cooperation in the accomplishment of his noble and laudable task.\nAt the same time, my delegation would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, the fourth woman President of the General Assembly since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945, not only for her admirable professional and personal qualities but also for the extremely professional way in which she presided over the seventy-third session that we have just successfully concluded. We also pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, and his courageous action under way to reform our common Organization in order to increase its effectiveness and credibility and make it an institution that is close to its constituents.\nBefore continuing the substantive part of its statement, on behalf of the Government of Burundi, my delegation would also like to express its most heartfelt condolences and its solidarity with the peoples and Governments of the Republic of Zimbabwe and the Republic of Tunisia, as well as the French Republic, following the deaths of His Excellency Comrade Robert Gabriel Mugabe, former President and father of Zimbabwe\u2019s independence, His Excellency Beji Caid Essebsi, former President of Tunisia, and His Excellency Jacques Chirac, former President of the French Republic, respectively.\nWith regard to domestic policy, the preparations for the 2020 elections are well advanced both in terms of organization and budget. National mechanisms for the preparation of the elections are already in place, while calming measures to promote a climate conducive to the holding of free, transparent and peaceful elections are steadily increasing. Without being exhaustive, I would particularly mention, first, the adoption, following extensive consultations within the Burundian political class, of the Kayanza road map, laying the foundation for peaceful elections in 2020; secondly, the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI), which is already operational; thirdly, the adoption of the revised electoral code by Parliament in April 2019 by 105 votes in favour out of 108 votes; fourthly, the decision to fund the entire operational electoral budget without resorting to external resources, which are often unpredictable and conditional; and, fifthly, the publication by CENI of the electoral calendar for all elections scheduled for 2020.\nIn accordance with that timetable, the presidential, parliamentary and municipal elections will be held concurrently on 20 May 2020. The election campaign is to be held from 27 April to 17 May. The Senate election will take place on 20 July 2020 and the last election \u2014 the cantonal elections \u2014 is scheduled for 24 August 2020.\nIt is worth pointing out that the electoral process in Burundi, as elsewhere in the world, is an internal matter that is exclusively an issue of national sovereignty. Any support for the process must be provided at the request of the Government of Burundi, in line with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. If there is support, it must not sanction any acts of blatant interference.\nAny attempt to create a new role or redefine an existing role within the United Nations at the instigation of certain States to conduct the elections in Burundi in place of the Burundians would be an attack on national sovereignty and a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations, which stipulates in Article 2, paragraph 7: \u201cNothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter[.]\u201c\nWith regard to the calming measures to foster a climate conducive to peaceful and inclusive elections, I would mention, among other measures, first, the expansion of the political space in the country through the approval of new political parties and the promotion of freedom of expression: secondly, the decision of the President of the Republic to voluntarily waive his constitutional right to stand in the 2020 presidential elections, which is an act of great political and democratic value that could serve as an example throughout the continent and beyond; thirdly, the return and integration of refugees and political exiles returning in large numbers; fourthly, the promotion of political dialogue within the Permanent Forum of Political Parties; and, fifthly, the release at the beginning of the year of more than 2,000 prisoners, including the young rioters and insurgents of 2015.\nIn Burundi the dialogue between political parties towards holding peaceful elections in 2020 is proceeding smoothly in a spirit of openness and political tolerance. My delegation recalls that it was this almost continuous and effective dialogue that led to the adoption of the Kayanza road map for peaceful elections in 2020, the establishment of the CENI, the adoption of the electoral code by Parliament and the return to the country of several political leaders who had fled in 2015.\nForeign actors who apparently want to take the dialogue issue away from Burundi seek three things: first, to destabilize Burundi on the eve of the 2020 elections; secondly, to encourage the rebels of 2015 who are now on the run, sheltered, fed and protected by the same actors who have been diplomatically and politically attacking Burundi since 2015; and, thirdly, divert the attention of Burundians from the most essential, namely, the holding of the 2020 elections and implementing the national development plan.\nAll those external actors will have to face up to their responsibility in due course for all the consequences of their interference in matters falling within Burundi\u2019s sovereignty. Burundians and the world are watching them. For their part, the Burundian people will remain opposed, as a matter of principle, at all times, in all places and under all circumstances, to any attempt at foreign interference in handling issues within the national jurisdiction, whether by a State or a regional or international organization.\nMy delegation would like to remind this gathering that the effectiveness of the United Nations depends on its ability to preserve the ideals that led to its establishment in 1945 in the aftermath of a deadly war. We cannot make the United Nations an organization for all if the bold interference of certain Governments in the internal affairs of other sovereign countries is dangerously tolerated in violation of the Charter that is the very foundation of our Organization.\nOn the security front, the situation in Burundi is stable, calm and fully under control throughout the country. From north to south, west to east and in the centre, day and night Burundian citizens enjoy their civil and political rights in complete peace of mind. In order to preserve the hard-won peace, on 10 September His Excellency Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the Republic of Burundi, launched the thirteenth peace caravan, which travelled through the country\u2019s 18 provinces, supporting at every stage the citizen-led community development projects in the areas visited.\nWith regard to the humanitarian situation, we welcome the massive and voluntary return of the Burundian refugees who fled the country in 2015. In addition to the several thousand Burundians who are returning of their own accord, without the assistance of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, between 1 August 2017 and 23 September 77,080 refugees, comprising 25,666 households, were voluntarily repatriated to Burundi from Tanzania, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That massive voluntary return movement clearly demonstrates the restoration of peace, tranquillity, trust and stability in the country despite the comments of some foreign actors who continue to deliberately exaggerate the number of refugees still in exile in order to keep Burundi in the state of a protracted crisis.\nWith regard to Burundi\u2019s presence on the Security Council\u2019s agenda, we have always said that Burundi is on the Security Council\u2019s agenda for political reasons and external interests that have nothing to do with the well-being of the Burundian people. The current political and security situation in the country does not constitute any threat to international peace and security so as to justify its arbitrary retention on the Security Council\u2019s agenda.\nThe successive meetings on Burundi that are not driven by the reality on the ground destabilize the country rather than promote peace and tranquillity.\nSuch inappropriate meetings indirectly assist the 2015 rebels who fled the country and are sought by Burundian justice. We therefore reiterate our legitimate call for Burundi\u2019s removal from the Security Council\u2019s agenda. The precious time devoted to Burundi can be allocated to the many other areas of tension. The situation in Burundi should be a matter for the United Nations agencies and programmes dealing with socioeconomic development in support of national efforts to implement the national development plan and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nWe firmly condemn the unjustified political and diplomatic aggression against Burundi and its people by foreign Governments, some of which were known to have attempted regime change in 2015 through unconstitutional means. Power diplomacy must give way to mutually beneficial and respectful cooperation. Such double standards and disproportionate and unjust pressure will bring us to our knees again 57 years after the end of colonization in our country, a terrifying period from which the Burundian people are still trying to recover today. The stubbornness of some countries to abandon their neocolonial logic causes them to behave as teachers of lessons, more than half a century after the attaining of independence of almost all African countries. The bitter fact of the matter is that interference in the internal affairs of States is becoming more and more commonplace, in contradiction of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The nature of relations between Africa and countries with a colonialist past should be redefined in order to transform the painful history of colonization into opportunities, through mutually beneficial and respectful cooperation.\nIt is time for foreign actors to stop infantilizing the Burundian people. Burundians are a proud and dignified people, very much committed to their political independence and values of ubuntu. We are mature enough to deal with our own affairs without any foreign interference, whether from countries close to or far from our borders. Any attempt to meddle in our internal affairs without first being invited to do so will always be met by an outburst of Burundian patriotism, as was the case during the regime-change conspiracy in 2015. We are aware that the 2015 conspiracy plot is not dead and buried \u2014 some are seeking to revive it by subtle means that are difficult to detect at first sight but will not escape the vigilance of the Burundian people.\nWith regard to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in addition to integrating the SDGs into our national development plans and programmes and aligning them with our national frameworks, the Government of Burundi has undertaken other practices to localize the SDGs by initiating a process of integrating them into our communes\u2019 plans for community development, as well as through monitoring the community dynamics observed in the implementation of the SDGs. Furthermore, given that the very heart of sustainable development is at the community level, all 119 communes in Burundi are currently in the process of drawing up or reviewing their plans for community development by integrating the objectives set forth in the SDGs and our national development plan.\nLike other countries committed to sustainable development, Burundi has made every effort to produce a regular follow-up report on the implementation of the SDGs and our national development plan. To illustrate the path we have taken in implementing the SDGs, including our successes, current and emerging challenges and lessons learned, Burundi has already announced to the Economic and Social Council its intention to submit to the voluntary national review mechanism in 2020. We believe that in order for the SDGs that we all adopted in 2015 to become a reality, we need greater commitment, ambition, action and above all more resources.\nWith regard to global issues, the current session of the General Assembly provides an excellent opportunity for States Members of the United Nations to reflect on how our Organization should address new and emerging challenges. The world we live in today needs a consensual approach, now more than ever before, in order to confront such major challenges as climate change, terrorism, the peaceful settlement of conflicts, peacekeeping around the world, the reform of the Security Council, threats to multilateralism and the issue of migration.\nIn terms of climate, we reiterate that the planet on which we live and on which future generations will live is facing a climate crisis that is worsening day by day, with the dramatic rise of climate-sceptic leaders. The climate crisis is threatening to reverse decades of progress and undermines all projects undertaken to build inclusive and sustainable development. Meanwhile the clock continues to tick, and it will not stop and wait for us. The green and sustainable development that we want \u2014 we want it now; waiting for tomorrow would be too late.\nWith regard to the fight against terrorism, we strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Burundi believes that terrorism cannot and should not be treated as an issue tied to any one religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic origin. It is a borderless threat that requires a global solution by tackling the root causes of the greatest evils of our times, including poverty, illiteracy, inequalities within and among States, ignorance, exclusion, humiliation and many others. Aware of the magnitude of the threat posed by terrorism today, Burundi will continue to make substantial contributions to combating terrorism in Somalia, where my country has already deployed more than 5,000 troops.\nWith regard to the issue of migration, the sobering fact is that forced mass population displacements are a global crisis, requiring collective action from the international community. It is now more likely than ever before that refugees and migrants will attempt to cross international borders to flee conflict, persecution, poverty and other life-threatening situations, in search of better life opportunities elsewhere. Their journeys involve considerable risks. Those who do reach their destination are frequently subjected to hostility and intolerance. The best solution to the migrant issue would be to strengthen cooperation and better distribute responsibilities.\nMoving on to the reform of the Security Council \u2014 a topic that has been the subject of negotiations for more than a quarter of a century \u2014 Burundi remains firmly committed to the Common African Position as contained in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. The Common African Position aims to correct the notorious injustice suffered by Africa, which is the only continent not represented on the Security Council in the category of permanent membership, and which is also underrepresented in the non-permanent category. For several years, Africa has repeatedly denounced that historical injustice, which continues to deprive more than 1.2 billion people of their legitimate right to be represented in the Security Council, with a permanent member enjoying the same privileges as current permanent members.\nMultilateralism is currently under threat, and Burundi, like the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations, rejects the growing trend of seeking to use certain United Nations bodies, as well as political and military interventionism and unilateral coercive measures, to regulate geopolitics around the world by unconstitutional means that contradict international law and the Charter of the United Nations.\nWith regard to peace operations around the world, although they are far from perfect and despite the challenges we continue to face in this area, they remain very useful for ensuring the maintenance and consolidation of peace around the world. Accordingly, we advocate adequate, sustainable, predictable and flexible funding, including through mandatory United Nations contributions, in order to enable such Security Council-mandated peacekeeping missions of the United Nations and the African Union as the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) to carry out their missions correctly. Any disengagement must imperatively take into account the degree of threat on the ground, rather than withdrawing or reducing the number of troops solely on the basis of artificial durations and mathematical calculations. With more than 6,000 troops currently deployed in peacekeeping missions, Burundi wishes to reiterate, from this rostrum, its commitment to continuing to make substantial contributions to peace operations around the world. We make this commitment as a way of giving back because Burundi benefited from the support of other nations during the most difficult periods of its history, before the definitive restoration of peace and stability in the country.\nAt the continental level, Burundi fully supports the African Union initiative to silence the guns in Africa by 2020, which the Security Council supported in its resolution 2457 (2019). In this regard, we are encouraged by the new positive developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, the Sudan and South Sudan, as well as the new wind of hope blowing across the Horn of Africa, and not forgetting AMISOM\u2019s performance in restoring peace to the brotherly country of Somalia.\nIn conclusion, my country has never wavered in its belief in international solidarity, multilateralism and the rejection of muscular diplomacy. From this rostrum, Burundi reaffirms its commitment to playing its full part in building a new world order based on the rule of law and a world that is peaceful, fair, prosperous and respectful of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "We are gathered here at the General Assembly at a time when the Secretary-General has chosen the very important theme of climate \u2014 we met on the subject yesterday \u2014 when impatience is being expressed everywhere and when everything in the world around us \u2014 or at least many things \u2014 could lead us to be pessimistic. We are not meeting our own expectations \u2014 the objectives that we have set for ourselves \u2014 in the fight against global warming and in the fight for biodiversity. The many tensions are at an unprecedented level in some parts of the world. Take, for example, what happened recently in the Gulf, or the challenges many of our friends in this Hall are confronting \u2014 our friends from the Sahel in particular, whose friendly faces I see here, and from many other regions.\nThese conflicts are increasingly harsh, cruel to civilians, humanitarian workers and human rights defenders. As David Miliband says, we have entered an age of impunity. Commercial tensions are increasing, and concerns are growing about technological changes and their consequences. I do not want to paint a pessimistic picture here \u2014 and I know how tired delegations are of listening to the many speeches that have been given since this morning; indeed, I wish to spare us the litany of all the reasons for despair. Nevertheless, we have everything we need to meet these challenges, everything, and in a new way.\nFirst, we have knowledge. Never before in the history of the world has science been brought together in such a way as to be able to describe the challenges we face and provide the means to address them, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, to the point where we are building upon technological revolutions. It has been described thus: every year we know a little bit more.\nWe have the funding, which is not lacking across the globe. We have an unrivalled capacity for innovation, which, on many of the subjects I have cited, is also a means of responding to these challenges: in the fight against poverty and in efforts to foster stability and respond to the major changes I have just mentioned. We have an unprecedented awareness of these contemporary evils. We have our youth, who are weighing in on the climate and freedoms. And we have, I must say, public opinion, which is more informed than ever before. And we have a framework, which is operative in this Hall today: the framework of free States that recognize each other and are supposed to work for the common good and prepare for the future of humankind, responding to these contemporary crises. We also have multilateral regional frameworks on many subjects and thematic frameworks on such topics as trade and economic cooperation.\nSo what are we missing? What is it that makes us give speeches that make our peoples feel we cannot respond to their fears?\nOn reflection, as I prepared to speak today, I was reminded of a text that has often been with me, namely, the Harvard commencement address given by Alexandr Solzhenitsyn in 1978 on the decline of courage. We lack courage, spectacularly and often. Basically, today I just wanted to tell the General Assembly that the appeal I would like to make would be on the revival of courage \u2014 on two subjects to begin with: the courage to know how to build peace and the courage to take responsibility.\nThe courage to know how to build peace is important because, first of all, it takes courage to do so and because building peace always involves taking a risk, which consists in not simply defending one\u2019s primary interests or one\u2019s positions that have sometimes led to escalation or tensions. In all regions of the world, building peace is about taking the risk \u2014 the risk of dialogue, compromise, rebuilding trust \u2014 and in so many regions, that is what we need. That is what the Middle East needs today. That is what the Gulf region needs. Courage is not tensions, provocation, ripostes. It is a demanding consultation that is carried out in a transparent manner.\nFrom the very first time I addressed the General Assembly (see A/72/PV.4) I expressed my strong belief with respect to Iran that the strategy of applying pressure on the Iranian nuclear issue could lead only to an increase in tensions in the region if, basically and above all, it did not have clear prospects for achieving a diplomatic solution. In 2018, after the United States withdrew from the 2015 Vienna Agreement, I proposed a comprehensive framework to preserve the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA) and complement it with a broader approach to address the issues raised by Iran\u2019s post-2025 nuclear programme, the country\u2019s role in regional crises and its ballistic programme. Where are we today?\nIn response to the American strategy and the European, Russian and Chinese desire to preserve the 2015 Vienna Agreement, Iran has responded with a strategy of maximum pressure on its regional environment. In that context, the increase in tensions was constant in recent months, and the 14 September attacks on Saudi Arabia have changed the situation. From that point on, the risk of a flare-up based on a calculation error or a disproportionate response has become greater today. Peace is at the mercy of an incident that is getting out of hand, and the consequences for the whole region and beyond would be too serious for us to accept living on the brink of disaster.\nSo what can we do? More than ever, I believe very deeply, the time has come to resume negotiations among the United States of America, Iran, the signatories to the JCPOA and the Powers in the region that are primarily concerned with the region\u2019s security and stability.\nWhat should be the terms and objectives of those negotiations? First, there must be complete certainty that Iran will never acquire nuclear weapons. Secondly, there must be an end to the crisis in Yemen. Thirdly, a regional security plan integrating the other crises in the region and the security of maritime transit flows must be drawn up. Finally, economic sanctions must be lifted.\nI am in no way naive, nor do I believe in miracles. I believe in the courage to build peace, and I know that the United States of America, Iran and all the signatories to this agreement have that courage. It is with the same conviction that we will continue our work on Syria, Libya and the Sahel, which has been discussed at length in recent weeks and, in particular, at the Group of Seven Summit in Biarritz.\nWith regard to Syria, I would like to welcome the encouraging announcements made yesterday by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and a decisive step forward with respect to the constitution, at last, by the long-awaited Constitutional Committee. We all look at the humanitarian situation in Idlib with vigilance and high standards. We are all committed to Syria\u2019s stability, throughout all its regions, and to the protection of all its people. We will continue to work towards a sustainable and inclusive political solution in Syria, which entails the work of the constitutional committee and securing Syrian territory so as to enable the voluntary and safe return of all refugees. It further requires a free electoral process that will include all Syrian citizens.\nWith respect to Libya, the Group of Seven (G-7) summit recalled our objectives and convictions. I believe very strongly that we currently need a robust inter-Libyan reconciliation conference and a firm commitment from the African Union, alongside the United Nations, to achieve that. Many initiatives have been undertaken. I welcome the commitment of Germany and all stakeholders who want to build peace. Lasting peace, however, can be built only on the basis of reconciliation among the Libyans themselves.\nIn the Sahel, France\u2019s commitment is well known, ongoing and reaffirmed. There too, the future lies in building lasting cooperation in the region among the five States members of the Group of Five for the Sahel, securing the commitment of our armies, involving the United Nations, changing the mandate of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and fully integrating our objectives of fighting terrorism and entrenching sustainable security in the Sahel into the missions that we have deployed. It is essential to transfer MINUSMA\u2019s mandate to Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, continue to involve all the armies in the region, re-engage all the region\u2019s security forces in the fight against terrorism and commit our energy to development and stabilization. Those are all situations in which engaging in dialogue and crafting political solutions are the key to success.\nThat courage to build peace is something we have seen in recent months at work in an unforeseen and unexpected way in the Sudan thanks to the strength of the Sudanese people, the capacity for dialogue between the army and the people, the work of the African Union and the role of Ethiopia, whose foresight and commitment to the whole region I want to salute here.\nIt is that same courage to build peace that is now required in Ukraine. President Zelenskyi has taken the first steps, President Putin has been able to respond to him and progress has been made in recent weeks. We see our horizon and know that the next steps are implementing the Minsk agreements and, ultimately, building a lasting peace on the ground. In the coming weeks, we will convene a summit in the Normandy format at the level of Heads of State and Government.\nOn each of those subjects, the question that is always asked is how to recreate an effective framework for cooperation among States. I believe that that it is possible. I do not believe that the problems that we face today can be solved by diluting responsibilities or by a globalism that, in a way, neglects the people. In that regard, I agree with what President Trump said this morning. I also do not believe that the crises that we are experiencing would be best resolved by national withdrawal. I believe very deeply in patriotism so long as it incarnates both love of country and the aspiration to the universal. I believe very deeply in sovereignty so long as it represents both autonomy for oneself and the need for cooperation.\nWhat we need today is to reinvent what I defined when I last addressed the Assembly in speaking of robust multilateralism (see A/73/PV.6). That is not to say that our multilateralism is worn out, that we no longer listen to ourselves or that we are no longer effective. Rather, it is in acknowledgement that there is no solution to be found in national withdrawal or without cooperation. That cooperation must, however, produce concrete results and engage new actors. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of such robust, contemporary multilateralism.\nI believe that we achieved that on the issue of climate when, after the American decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, we launched the One Planet Summit, together with the United Nations and the World Bank, which allowed us to maintain cohesion and engage new actors, investors and companies, as we saw again yesterday at the summit organized by the United Nations. We must engage new actors, create momentum and resist disintegration.\nIn that regard, Russia\u2019s ratification of the Paris Agreement, announced yesterday, is a sign of the success of that approach, in addition to what we have been able to undertake on many coalition issues. That is the same highly pragmatic multilateralism that we adopted to fight terrorism on the Internet through the Aqaba process and in the Christchurch Call to Action Summit, held on 15 May in Paris. I pay tribute here to the commitment of the King of Jordan and the Prime Minister of New Zealand.\nYesterday, we made a breakthrough when 50 countries joined that initiative and platforms were committed to set operational protocols and remove terrorist content. We will go even further, but we now have a concrete, real answer. We must continue to move forward, innovate and respond to contemporary challenges in a spirit of partnership, information and democracy. We must now innovate in the same spirit to secure our safety and security.\nThe major challenge for us today is that we are no longer capable of ensuring stability in an increasingly conflict-ridden world, having left behind the bipolar world in which we lived for decades. We no longer really have the last-resort guarantors of our deep-seated balances. As such, disorders have set in and things are often slow to be resolved effectively. I believe very strongly that the courage to build peace requires the reaffirmation of our values \u2014 those of human rights and the dignity of human beings, which must not be subject any form of contemporary relativism. It calls for practical re-engagement in all areas of operation that I mentioned earlier, with a view to building peace and stability and proposing tangible solutions to the people.\nI would refer, too, to the courage to take responsibility for our manifold challenges. When we talk about contemporary common goods, the climate, education and inequalities, we can say that we understand and see things for what they are. Today, we have an array of experts who are telling us about and describing in unprecedented detail the situation of our world. If we have weakened, it is because we have too often decided to question the truth, contest the facts, favour the short term and sometimes protect certain interests, and the loss of meaning has taken hold. But the reality is there.\nInequalities have again increased in our world among countries and within our countries. Our contemporary capitalism has become dysfunctional, leading to an unparalleled level of inequality. We are no longer capable of solving abject poverty and new forms of inequality, such as inequalities of opportunity and gender, as well as in access to education in the poorest regions, access to health care and necessary treatments, and climate, when it comes to the most vulnerable countries or the poorest regions that are hit even harder by global warming or the increasing scarcity of biodiversity.\nOn all those subjects, I presented the proposed the G-7 agenda last year and the desire to place the fight against inequality at its very core. I would like to briefly comment on that. I believe that we can collectively contribute to that subject in order for a response to begin to materialize, with a view to supporting the collective commitment already made to the Sustainable Development Goals. It is a way out of the short term; it is a decision to change our system. We have collectively committed, first and foremost, to a very proactive agenda for Africa and for the Sahel, its security, stability and development and, more broadly, to draft an agenda for Africa based on genuine security, development and reciprocity. In that context, we will host an Africa-France summit in France next June, based on economic partnerships and the involvement of civil societies in a spirit of deep reciprocity.\nIt is an agenda for equality between women and men. In Biarritz, we launched the \u20ac251-million Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa initiative to support women entrepreneurs in Africa, and we will work with Angelique Kidjo to ensure that projects are quickly launched. That initiative was proposed by African women and operated by the African Development Bank, and for which the major economic Powers have decided support through investment.\nWe have supported Dr. Mukwege\u2019s fund for the protection of victims of sexual violence and launched the Gender Equality Advisory Council, which we have expanded in conjunction with this session of the General Assembly and which, for the States that join it, consists of implementing at least one measure at the national level on women\u2019s rights, based on best practices around the world.\nThe fight for gender equality is crucial, because we have not won it within our societies, as evidenced by the persistence of feminicide in France and many other countries. We must give it legal status and build effective action to eradicate it. We must do even more than we have done before, because we are seeing in numerous States a decline in equality between women and men and a questioning of women\u2019s rights to control their bodies and the achievements of past decades. We must act because wherever inequality between women and men takes root, it leads to a decline in civilization, a rise in obscurantism, a growth in terrorism and a downturn in education. It also leads to diminished growth, because it means depriving each of those countries of half of its potential wealth.\nThat is also why we strongly support the United Nations on that agenda. On the three principles of action \u2014 namely, emancipate, protect and ensure real equality \u2014 we will act in view of the Generation Equality Forum, to be held in Paris in July 2020, 25 years after the Beijing Declaration, which marked the history of our Organization. There is no turning back now. We must move forward into a new era.\nWe must also fight that battle and have the courage to assume responsibility for our health. Here too, we have seen even today too many setbacks and difficulty of access to treatment in some regions, despite our efforts. The sixth replenishment conference of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria will be held on 10 October in Lyon, France. From this rostrum in 2002, Kofi Annan called for the creation of a global fund to fight inequalities in the face of the possibility of curing deadly diseases. The Fund was then established, with the support of the Group of Eight at the time, and 32 million lives have been saved as a result.\nI insist that the eradication of major pandemics is within the reach of our action. We can save 16 million lives in the coming years. We must simply recognize that no one can understand any longer how, for reasons of finance and inequality, it is impossible today to access treatments to prevent or cure such diseases or to slow their resurgence. That is why we need $14 billion in Lyon. We have three weeks, and we will put all our energy into making sure that a new global fund meets our ambition.\nLastly, the issue of climate is also a fight against inequalities and one of the subjects on which the courage of responsibility must be exemplified. Essentially, there is an ongoing paradox in climate matters, to which we are collectively being inured. We have basically given our impatient young people a boilerplate response. We give them the opportunity to express themselves and we tell them that we can hear them and that they are doing great; and then, all too often, we go on doing just as we did before. That will not hold up.\nI welcome the commitment of the Secretary- General and say that, in the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss, we must undertake even stronger action and fundamentally change our collective Organization, the system itself, and seek not to offset, but rather to correct and change it ourselves with all our investors, companies and societies.\nFirst, we must broaden our ambitions. That is crucial if we are to have a chance at limiting the rise in temperatures to below 2\u00b0C by the end of the century. To that end, we must act in 2020. In Europe, we must make the necessary decisions in 2020 in that regard, particularly on carbon taxation, with a real, higher minimum price and border taxation. If we have not convinced some partners to follow that agenda, those courageous decisions are needed, and the time is now.\nWe need to engage all countries more broadly in a carbon neutrality strategy by 2050. Several have joined that coalition. President Pi\u00f1era Echenique has just presented it to the Assembly. We must continue to convince stakeholders and participate in that essential strategy. India has just expressed its willingness to join that agenda and coalition. I am aware of China\u2019s proactive approach to climate change, which has been so important in recent years.\nI know that together, if we commit to carbon neutrality, we can make a significant difference in achieving our objectives. As such, the twenty-fifth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Chile, and the twenty-sixth session, to be held in Europe, will be defining events.\nSecondly, we must bring our agendas and actions back into line. I said this yesterday, but we cannot claim to be doing everything perfectly well and call for calm while we continue to be dependent on coal, as is the case in too many countries. Everyone, within their own limitations and with the help of the international community, the right funding and respect for each component of our societies, needs to commit to a strategy to wean ourselves of coal.\nThe major countries of the world must also stop financing new polluting facilities in developing countries. We continue to this day to export financing and projects in various countries financed by developed countries, which consist of launching new polluting structures and telling developing countries, the poorest countries, in not so many words that climate change is not for them. They can go on polluting; everything\u2019s fine where you are. That is inconsistent and irresponsible. Let us be honest with ourselves. We must commit all our development banks, as we began to do on Sunday, towards a reorientation of financing towards renewable energies everywhere, because in Africa, Asia, the Americas and the Pacific, the future of energy production is also about getting out of coal and no longer being coal-dependent.\nIn the same way, we must build a climate fund commensurate with these ambitions. In a few weeks, the first Green Climate Fund pledging conference will take place in Paris and I call on our major partners on this issue to provide crucial financing. There are many of us that have already doubled our commitments and I urge others to do the same, as such contributions will be most decisive.\nOn the matter of coherence, as I said yesterday, we can no longer have open, free-trade commercial strategies that do not include the climate question in their own agendas. The two must be combined. I believe in openness and free trade, but only to the extent that they are well thought out and able to integrate the objectives of zero carbon and zero deforestation. This means that, at each stage, we must build compatible solutions and find measures for compensation. However, we cannot force certain countries to make efforts and then continue to trade with those that do not, and we cannot continue to make statements from this rostrum and continue importing products that contradict them.\nNothing is going to change overnight. France, on its part, is too often an importer of products that lead to deforestation. This will involve deep-rooted changes and partnership strategies with countries of origin, with our businesses and our financial backers. I am not saying that everything is going well in France and that we are doing everything right; that is far from the truth. But if we are not collectively responsible and transparent and if we do not accept the fact that we must practice what we preach when it comes to our commercial policies and climate agendas, we will never achieve it. It will take some years, but we must start now.\nThere are two climate-related topics that I wish to underscore here before concluding. If we want to succeed in the war on climate change, we must look to save our forests and our oceans. These two battles are essential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and preserve our biodiversity balance. We are currently losing the battle on these two global issues. Yesterday, I believe that the commitment demonstrated by all marked an important step forward in defending the Amazon rainforest and the African forest \u2014 that is, the primary forest reserves of our planet.\nWe have countries that have committed to this cause \u2014 France is one of them \u2014 but here I wish to highlight in particular the efforts of Germany and Norway. We were joined by major countries, international organizations, non-governmental organizations and the majority of the countries affected by Amazonia, to speak diplomatically. I encourage all those who wish to join the fight to join it, but we need to move forward. By the time the United Nations Climate Change Conference takes place in Santiago, we will have met extremely effective and pragmatic criteria so as to invest more closely on the ground and find useful solutions to promote reforestation, biodiversity and agroecology protection and all economic development projects concerning Amazonia and the African forest in the Congo basin. This will promote economic development and forest preservation, and thus our fight for biodiversity and against global warming.\nThe fight for biodiversity, too, will be the focus of major meetings in 2020, with the International Union for Conservation of Nature World Conservation Congress in France and the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Beijing. We need clear actions to be taken by 2020. When it comes to our oceans, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C is utterly devastating. We have been confronted with the naked, stubborn truth and we are losing the battle. At the recent G-7 Summit in Biarritz, we began building coalitions with major transporters, which committed to reducing speeds. This is just the beginning \u2014 we are far from having won \u2014 and I hope that we will commit, as we are doing for the forests, to the fight for the oceans with the funding and concrete actions needed to win this battle.\nRight now, it is all about our initial changes and our initial actions. I cannot stress enough that what we are collectively trying to do is vital. It is about working together to try to change our collective political, economic, social organizations to reduce inequalities and, better still, to prevent them. I do not believe that the right response to growing contemporary inequalities in the areas of climate, opportunities and education lies in the fiscal agenda of each individual country. I believe that the answer lies in education, access to health care and policies to prevent inequality in each individual country, but above all in stronger international cooperation and a robust agenda to combat such inequalities.\nBut on a fundamental level, this requires an agenda of reconciliation. What we are seeing in front of us is, on the one hand, a constant rhetoric of condemnation. I hear it, and it pushes us to act, but words of condemnation are no longer enough. We know that we cannot go on simply condemning. Our predecessors condemned 20 years ago, which allowed groups of experts to be established. But alongside this rhetoric of condemnation, for some, there is comfort in inaction, a habit of cynicism. In the middle of it all, there is a rather haphazard, somewhat clumsy group of people trying to take action.\nLet us take this challenge in our stride; let us build this agenda of reconciliation with our public opinion, with our youth, with our companies, with our investors and with Governments of good faith. We have the facts; let us continue to establish them and, from now on, change our habits. We must change our consumer habits, our production habits, our investment habits, our governance and civic habits in order to collectively engage in this agenda for change. Remaining in this tandem of condemnation and inaction will lead to nothing.\nI firmly believe that the courage to assume responsibility means facing the facts, to accept that there are things we can do right now and others that will take time, because in all of our countries there are producers depending on certain products that are harmful; there are people who live in poorly constructed housing and continue to pollute even as they move on. We cannot point the finger at them. Rather, we must help them to change and we must offer solutions through technological innovation, investment and a real agenda to fight social and climate-related inequalities. That agenda of reconciliation is what we need and that is what I want to do in France, what we need to implement in Europe and what we must build right here.\nThat is what I wanted to say today. I believe in this courage to take responsibility and, more broadly, I believe that this courage will return. In any case, I believe we have no other choice. We must work together. Our grammars have changed; they are no doubt more complex than they were in the past and they certainly engage us more. We know that when it comes to security, inequality, health and climate change, we will all be accountable. But I no longer believe in the easy way out of pessimism. I no longer believe in division. I believe in our ability to propose ideas, to reflect and to act together to build this agenda for reconciliation that will enable everyone, everywhere, to see the light in our future.\n"

        "file_text": "I feel honoured to represent my country at today\u2019s forum of world leaders, where we have a chance to discuss the problems that the world is facing. I want to talk about many problems, but I will focus on just four today. I came to this forum despite the difficulties in my country and the challenges facing it. Indeed, I would not have come at all, but I feel that there are some very urgent problems that the world must address.\nI will first talk about climate change. So many leaders have already discussed it, but I feel that there is a lack of seriousness. Perhaps some world leaders who could do a lot do not realize the urgency of the situation. We have many ideas, but, as someone has said, ideas without funding are mere hallucinations.\nI will start with my own country, Pakistan. Our country is among the 10 nations of the world most affected by climate change. As we are primarily an agricultural country, we depend on our rivers, and 80 per cent of the water in our rivers comes from glaciers \u2014 glaciers that are in India as well as in Pakistan. Eighty per cent of the water in the Ganges and other Indian rivers comes from the Himalayan, Karakoram and Hindu Kush glaciers, which are melting at quite a rapid pace. We have already detected 5,000 glacial lakes in our mountains. If that continues and nothing is done, we fear that humans will face a huge catastrophe. In my country, when my party came to power, we planted 1 billion trees over five years in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. We have now set ourselves a target of reaching 10 billion trees in Pakistan, with the goal of helping to counter the effects of global warming.\nHowever, one country cannot do everything. This has to be a combined global effort. My optimism comes from the fact that the Almighty has endowed humans with great powers. We can do anything, provided that our survival instinct is stirred up. I really hope that the United Nations can take the lead and put more emphasis on this issue. Richer countries, the countries that are mainly responsible for greenhouse-gas emissions, must be pushed to do more, because our country contributes a minuscule amount to greenhouse gas emissions. The United Nations must lead on this issue.\nThe second issue I wish to mention is even more critical. Every year, billions of dollars leave poor countries for rich countries. Billions of dollars are siphoned off by the developing world\u2019s ruling elite and find their way into Western bank accounts, offshore accounts, tax havens and expensive properties hidden behind companies bought in Western capitals. That is devastating the developing world and causing further poverty and death. It is impoverishing the developing world. The divide between rich and poor countries is growing because of it. Money-laundering that results from money leaving poor countries for rich countries is not treated the same way that drug money and terror financing are, for instance. Terror financing and drug money are taken more seriously than the fact that poor countries are being plundered by their elites.\nI took charge of our Government one year ago. In the 10 years preceding that, my country\u2019s total debt quadrupled. The debt we had accumulated in 60 years quadrupled in just 10 years. As a result, half of the total revenue that we collected in one year went into debt servicing. How are we going to spend money on our 220 million citizens when half of our money is going into debt servicing as a result of our country being plundered by a ruling elite who could easily withdraw that money? Moreover, when we do locate properties in Western capitals that have been bought with money made through corruption and money-laundering by corrupt leaders, those finances are nearly impossible to retrieve. If we retrieved that money it could be spent on our citizens, but it is very difficult.\nLaws protect those criminals. We do not have millions of dollars to spend on expensive lawyers. We need help from rich countries, and it is critical that such countries show political will. They cannot allow this to happen. How can poor countries spend money on human development, which the United Nations calls for as part of the Sustainable Development Goals? How will we do that when our countries are so easily drained of finances?\nSo unless rich countries intend to build walls to stop economic refugees, as we are currently seeing, they must take action now. There must be a deterrent. The corrupt ruling elite should not be able to easily take money from us and park it in foreign bank accounts and properties abroad. I have also never understood how tax havens are allowed to exist. Why should rich people not pay taxes? Why are secret accounts in tax havens legal? The world is changing and its population is growing. Sooner or later there will be a crisis if the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. That is my second point, and I hope that the United Nations takes the lead on that matter by involving the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Those institutions must find a way to stop the plunder of the developing world.\nMy third point is Islamophobia. There are 1.3 billion Muslims in the world, and millions of Muslims live in European countries and the United States as minorities. Since 9/11, Islamophobia has grown at an alarming pace. Human communities live together and should foster understanding among one another, but Islamophobia is creating a division. Muslim women who wear hijabs are now seen as an issue in some countries, with the hijab being depicted as a weapon.\nWomen are permitted to take off their clothes in some countries, but are not allowed to put on more. How can that happen? The reason is Islamophobia, which started after 9/11, because certain Western leaders equated terrorism with Islam, talking of Islamic terrorism and radical Islam. What is radical Islam? There is only one Islam, the Islam we follow of the Prophet Muhammad. There is no other Islam.\nWhat message do the terms \u201cradical Islam\u201d and \u201cIslamic terrorism\u201d send to people in the West, and why does Islamophobia exist? How can people in New York, the Midwestern United States and European capitals distinguish between moderate and radical Muslims? Terrorism has nothing to do with any religion. The terms \u201cIslamic terrorism\u201d and \u201cIslamic radicalism\u201d, which are used by leaders, sadly, are the main reasons for Islamophobia and have caused pain among Muslims. We in Muslim countries experience Islamophobia when travelling abroad, and it is getting worse. May I also say that Islamophobia is marginalizing Muslim communities in European countries, and we all know that marginalization leads to radicalization. Some of the people who became militants in Syria and other countries were from marginalized Muslim communities. My point here is that we must address the issue.\nI am sad to say that we Muslim leaders have not addressed the issue either. After 9/11, when the war against radical Islam began, leaders did not try to explain to the West that there was no such thing as radical Islam. There are radicals, moderates and liberals in all human communities \u2014 whether they are Christian, Jewish or anything else \u2014 but Islam itself is not radical. Neither is Judaism nor Christianity nor Hinduism. No religion preaches radicalism. The bases of all religions are compassion and justice, which differentiate us from the animal kingdom. However, unfortunately, the Muslim leadership was so scared of being called radical Muslims that leaders all labelled themselves as moderates. Pakistan was in the eye of the storm, and our Government coined the phrase \u201cenlightened moderation\u201d. No one knew what it meant, but everyone started wearing Western suits, calling themselves moderates and speaking English, even if they were barely proficient. No one had a clue what it meant, because we in the Muslim world did not explain to the West that there is no such thing as radical Islam.\nOne of the reasons that Islam was supposed to be equated with terrorism following 9/11 was suicide attacks. All sorts of theories appeared, because the 9/11 bombers were suicide attackers. One such theory was that Muslims carried out such attacks because they would be greeted by virgins in heaven. What about female suicide attackers? It was bizarre, and no one explained the truth. As a result, suicide attacks became associated with Islam. No one pointed out that before 9/11, the majority of suicide attacks in the world were perpetrated by the Tamil Tigers, who were Hindus. No one blamed Hinduism, and quite rightly. What has Hinduism got to do with what desperate people were doing in Sri Lanka? We have all seen films about the Japanese kamikaze pilots who carried out suicide attacks towards the end of the Second World War, and we did not blame their religion. Nevertheless, here we were trying to prove that we were moderates instead of explaining the truth to the West.\nThe most important thing I want to say here today with regard to Islamophobia is this. I know how the misunderstanding about Islam came about, because I have spent a lot of time in England playing sport professionally. I therefore know how the Western mind works and how the West views religion. One of the reasons for Islamophobia was a book published in 1989 that maligned, insulted and ridiculed our Prophet Muhammad, and there was a reaction in the Muslim world. The West could not understand what the problem was, because, in the West \u2014 and I know this, because I have spent so much time there \u2014 religion is perceived completely differently. Westerners do not view religion as we do. Islam was labelled as an intolerant religion that was against freedom of expression, and it took a real beating. That happened 30 years ago, and I still remember it as a watershed. Every two or three years, someone would malign our Prophet \u2014 may peace be upon him \u2014 and Muslims would react, which led to Islam being labelled an intolerant religion.\nIn more recent years, I again blame a certain group of people in the West who deliberately provoked the current phenomenon, while being aware of the impact it would have. However, the majority of Westerners did not understand. Again, that is where the Muslim leadership let Muslims down. We should have explained to them what our Prophet means to us, which I will now try to explain in the space of one minute.\nOur Prophet was the witness to the divine book, the holy Qur\u2019an. The holy Qur\u2019an is the book of guidance for Muslims and the Prophet\u2019s life was the perfect example of the Qur\u2019an\u2019s guidance. He therefore represents the ideal that we all wish to attain. The Prophet created the first Islamic State in Medina, which was the basis for the Muslim civilization that would become the predominant civilization for the next 700 years.\nWhat was that State? I hear such strange things about Islam \u2014 for example, that it is against women and minorities. The first State of Islam, in Medina, was the first welfare State. It took responsibility for the weak, widows, orphans, the poor and the handicapped. It taxed the rich and spent the money on the poor. The State announced that all human beings were children of Adam and hence equal, whatever the colour of their skin. The whole system depended on slavery, as Western societies did for many years, and the Prophet announced that one of the greatest deeds was to free a slave. However, because society was so dependent on slavery, he declared that they must at least be treated as equal members of the family. As a result, something occurred in the Muslim world that has yet to occur in any other civilization: slave dynasties appeared and slaves became kings. Mamluk slaves ruled Egypt and there were slave dynasties in India.\nThe Assembly has heard that Islam is supposedly against minorities, so let me just make this issue clear. The Prophet announced that all were free to practice their religion. It was a sacred duty to protect the places of worship of all religions. He declared that every person was equal in the eyes of the law, regardless of their religion or colour. I always quote the incredible case of the fourth Caliph, the Head of State of Medina, who lost a court case to a Jewish citizen, which demonstrates that first, no one was above the law, and secondly, that a Jewish citizen was regarded as an equal citizen. When a Muslim society is unjust to its minorities it is therefore going against the religion of Islam and our Prophet.\nIt is important to understand that the Prophet lives in our hearts. When he is ridiculed or insulted, we feel that pain. As human beings, we understand one thing, which is that the pain of the heart is far more hurtful than physical pain. That is why Muslims react to such allegations. I have always thought that, if I ever stood at this rostrum, I would try to explain that concept to the international community, in particular the Western community. Having lived in the Western community, I saw that Westerners were not aware of that fact. When I first went to England as a teenager, I learned of a comedy film about Jesus Christ. Such a thing would be unthinkable in a Muslim society. Human communities must therefore be sensitive towards the causes of each other\u2019s pain. In the West, the Holocaust is quite rightly treated with sensitivity, because it causes the Jewish community pain. All we ask is that freedom of speech not be used to insult the holy Prophet and cause us pain.\nMy fourth point is the most critical and the reason why I came here. It is about what is happening in Kashmir. Before I continue, I wish to make one thing clear. When we came to power, my first priority was to make Pakistan a country that would do its best to foster peace. We joined the United States\u2019 war on terror after 2001, and Pakistan experienced one of its worst periods, in which 70,000 Pakistanis died and our economy shrank by more than $150 billion. I opposed the war, because Pakistan had joined Western countries in the 1980s in Afghanistan\u2019s struggle for freedom against the Soviets. The mujahidin groups involved in guerrilla warfare were trained by the Pakistani army and funded by Western countries, particularly the United States. Those groups waged a struggle for freedom in Afghanistan. The Soviets called them terrorists, but we called them freedom fighters. In 1989, the Soviets retreated, the Americans packed up and left, and those groups remained in Pakistan.\nCome 9/11, Pakistan joined the United States in the war on terror. I opposed joining the war because we had repeatedly told the West that \u201cjihad\u201d meant fighting for freedom against foreign occupation. Having joined forces with the United States, which had occupied Afghanistan, we were then supposed to declare that jihad did not signify a struggle for freedom but that it should instead be equated with terrorism. I therefore tried to tell the Government of the time to remain neutral, in order to enable it to keep the upper hand and remain in control. I told the Government that if it joined the United States, it would become an accomplice and be attacked, which is what happened. They turned against us. We lived through a nightmare. Seventy thousand people were killed in a war that we had nothing to do with. No Pakistani was involved in 9/11. The Taliban and Al-Qaida were in Afghanistan. We had nothing to do with it, but we lost 70,000 Pakistanis.\nWhen we came to power, we therefore decided to disband what was left of those groups, a decision taken not just by us but by all Pakistani political parties. Unfortunately, the decision was not implemented until we came to power and dismantled whatever was left of those groups. I know that India continues to make accusations that such groups remain active. I would like the United Nations to send observers to see for themselves what we have done. No Pakistani Government would have dared to do that because it would have created strife. But we decided that there would be no militant organizations in Pakistan. All of that background is necessary for what I will go on to explain.\nMy Government also started to mend fences. I invited the Afghan President to our country and we have developed a relationship with Afghanistan. We had problems with Iran; we mended fences there. That brings me to India. Allow me to give some background about my relationship with India. Cricket is a passion of our subcontinent and, thanks to the sport, I had a great following in India, I have friends in India and I love going to India.\nTherefore, when my party came to power, the first thing we did was to immediately reach out to India. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi and told him that our countries had similar problems \u2014 climate change and poverty. I told him that we should get together, resolve our differences through trade and build a relationship based on trust. Mr. Modi told me that Pakistan had perpetrated terrorist attacks in India. I replied that we too had problems with terrorist attacks instigated by India in Balochistan, having caught a spy, Kulbhushan Jadhav, who admitted to the sabotage going on in Karachi and Balochistan. We asked India to leave that behind us and let us move forward, saying that our main priority should be our people, given that the highest number of poor people in the world live on the Indian subcontinent.\nUnfortunately, we made no headway. Our Foreign Ministers were supposed to meet to discuss the issue at last year\u2019s session of the General Assembly, but India cancelled the meeting. We understood that their election was coming up and so believed that the ultranationalist party did not wish to cosy up to Pakistan. We therefore decided to wait until the elections were over. Meanwhile, a 20-year-old Kashmiri man \u2014 who, according to his father, was radicalized by the security forces in Kashmir \u2014 blew himself up on an Indian convoy. India immediately blamed us. I spoke to the Indian public on television and said that if the country gave us any proof, we would immediately take action, as we had clamped down on such groups. Rather than send us proof, they sent jets to bomb us. We retaliated; two of their planes were shot down and one pilot bailed out in Pakistan. We immediately returned the pilot, saying that we did not want any escalation.\nRather than take that as a peace gesture, Mr. Modi\u2019s election campaign focused almost entirely on how he had taught Pakistan a lesson by killing 350 of its terrorists, which is a complete lie. All that India killed was approximately 10 of our trees, which was indeed quite painful, given our reforestation efforts. In his election campaign, Mr. Modi used phrases such as \u201cThis is just a trailer; the movie is about to start\u201d, and \u201cI went to Pakistan and taught them a lesson\u201d. That was his election campaign.\nWe acknowledged the fact that we politicians make such statements to win elections and we would be able to resume normal relations after the elections. The moment the elections ended, we approached India and received no response. However, we then discovered that it was trying to put us on the Financial Action Task Force blacklist as a way of bankrupting us. That is when we realized that India had an agenda, which became clear on 5 August when it breached 11 Security Council resolutions stating that Kashmir is a disputed territory and that the people of Kashmir have a right to self-determination. It also breached a similar accord on resolving differences bilaterally and revoked article 370 of the Indian Constitution, giving Kashmir special status. It also deployed a further 180,000 troops in the region, with the total number of security forces in Kashmir now at 900,000. Moreover, it imposed a curfew on the 8 million people of Kashmir.\nI want to briefly help the Assembly understand how anyone can do something like that. To do that, however, I must explain Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Mr. Narendra Modi is a lifetime member of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, an organization inspired by Adolf Hitler and Mussolini that was founded in 1925 based on a belief in racial purity and racial superiority. Like the Nazis, its members believed they were an Aryan race. All of that can be verified. We live in an information revolution, so anyone can google what I am saying. It is very important for me, however, to explain this to Assembly members so that they know what is happening in India. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh believed in the ethnic cleansing of Muslims in India. At one point, it believed that the Hindu race was racially superior. It also harboured hatred for Muslims and Christians because it believed that the golden age of the Hindu civilization had come to an end as a result of Muslim rule centuries back, and subsequently of British rule in India. It therefore harboured feelings of racial superiority and a hatred of Muslims and Christians.\nThat was all openly stated. All one needs to do is google the founding fathers of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Golwalkar and Savarkar, and they will find out the truth. That ideology of hatred is what murdered the great Mahatma Gandhi in 1948. It was that ideology of hatred that inspired Narendra Modi to film a programme in 2002 against Muslims in Gujarat, where he was Chief Minister. He allowed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh goons \u2014 who are inspired by Hitler\u2019s Brown Shirts and actually wear brown shirts \u2014 to carry out a three-day assault. The Congress Home Minister declared in a statement that terrorists were being trained in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh camps. Those terrorists butchered 2,000 Muslims and rendered 150,000 homeless. For that reason, Narendra Modi was not allowed to travel to the United States.\nIt is essential that the Assembly understand that background before I explain what sort of mind would lay siege to 8 million people with 900,000 troops. Women, children and sick people are locked up like animals. In fact, from what I know about England, if 8 million animals were locked up, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals would have made a lot of noise about it. However, those individuals are human beings.\nWhat comes with the illusion of a superior Aryan race and racial superiority is arrogance. The two go together. It is arrogance that leads people to make mistakes and do stupid things \u2014 cruel things like those perpetrated by Narendra Modi. That is sheer arrogance. It is arrogance that has blinded him to what will happen when the curfew is lifted. Has he thought about that? It has not been thought through. What is he going to do when he lifts the curfew? Does he think that the people of Kashmir will quietly accept the status quo because India has changed the Constitution and stripped them of their special status? Will they accept that?\nIn the past 30 years 100,000 Kashmiris have died because they were denied the right to self-determination bestowed on them by the United Nations. One hundred thousand have died and 11,000 women have been raped. There are two United Nations human rights reports on this. The world has done nothing, because India is a huge market of 1.2 billion people. Sadly, the material world prevails over human life. But that has serious consequences. I again repeat, that is why I am here. What is going to happen when the curfew is lifted will be a bloodbath. People will come out onto the street and be greeted by 900,000 troops, who are not there, as Narendra Modi says, for the prosperity and development of Kashmir. What will those 900,000 troops do when people come out of their homes? There will be a bloodbath. Has he thought through what he will do then?\nHas anyone thought about what to do when a bloodbath occurs? What kind of impact will that have on the people of Kashmir? What will they think after being boxed away in their houses and treated worse than animals? They have no rights. All of their political leaders have been arrested and taken out of Kashmir; even pro-India Kashmiri leaders have been removed. Thirteen thousand boys have been picked up and taken to unspecified locations. What will the people of Kashmir do when the curfew is lifted? They will pour out onto the streets. And what will the soldiers do? They will shoot them. They have already used pellet guns to blind young boys during the past five years of oppression in Kashmir. Kashmiris will therefore become further radicalized.\nThere will be another Pulwama. When it happens \u2014 guess what? \u2014 India will blame us. It is already blaming us. It is saying that everything is happening because of Pakistan. Its Army Chief of Staff said that there were 500 terrorists lined up on the border ready to cross. Why would Pakistan send 500 terrorists when there are 900,000 troops there? What impact are they going to make? What would they do? Do we not know that the moment a terrorist attack occurs, all that will happen is further cruelty and oppression for the people of Kashmir? The 900,000 troops would simply have a reason to further crush the people of Kashmir. The Indian Government would have an excuse to say that Pakistan is a terrorist State and to invoke the mantra of \u201cIslamic terrorism\u201d.\nThe moment the catchphrase \u201cIslamic terrorism\u201d is used, the whole world turns away, no one talks about human rights and people are given licence to do whatever they want. That is what is happening in Kashmir because the phrase \u201cIslamic terrorism\u201d keeps being used. That is what is happening right now. What benefit do we gain from further increasing the cruelty inflicted on the people of Kashmir? Why would we want that? Yet there is no other narrative left for India because, no matter what happens when the curfew is lifted, Pakistan will be blamed. There is always the danger of another Pulwama. They might come and bomb us again, and then another cycle will start.\nWhat does Narendra Modi think? What are the 180 million Muslims in India thinking right now? Are they not watching the Kashmiris, stuck inside for 55 days now? Are they not watching? What do my fellow members of the General Assembly think? Do members not think that Muslims will be radicalized in India? I am talking about 180 million people. When they get radicalized, somewhere down the line there will be an incident in India and we will be blamed again. I am warning everybody present right now that, again, we will be blamed.\nWhat about the 1.3 billion Muslims who are watching? They know that what is happening in Kashmir is only happening because there are Kashmiri Muslims. It is not happening to Kashmiri Hindus. Muslims know that what is happening is because of their religion. So what do my fellow leaders think they are thinking? What would the Jewish community think if 8,000 Jews \u2014 let alone 8 million \u2014 were stuck in the same way? What would Europeans think? What do we think? What do we think any human community, whose members are stuck in the way Kashmiris are, would think? Are we children of a lesser God? Does such a situation not cause us pain? This is what will happen next \u2014 someone among the 1.3 billion Muslims will pick up arms.\nI know we have been brought up watching western films \u2014 seeing the classic narrative of the good, decent guy who does not get justice, and so decides to pick up a gun and start seeking justice himself. For example, there is one particularly famous film set in New York called Death Wish. The main character gets mugged and his wife is killed. He cannot get justice, so he picks up a gun and goes around shooting muggers, and the whole cinema cheers him on. With that in mind, what do members of the Assembly think Muslims are thinking right now? If there is a bloodbath, Muslims will become radicalized \u2014 not because of Islam, but because they will see that there is no justice when it comes to Muslims. In Myanmar, almost a million Rohingya Muslims were wiped out as a result of ethnic cleansing. What was the response of the world community? So what do members of the Assembly think would be the response of the 1.3 billion Muslims?\nI picture myself in Kashmir. I have been in lockdown for 55 days. I have heard about the rapes and about the Indian army soldiers going into homes. Would I want to live through such humiliation? Would I want to live like that? I would pick up a gun. The situation is forcing people into radicalization. When people lose the will to live, what is there to live for? That is the crux of the issue. If the international community can let that happen to human beings, it is actually radicalizing people.\nI therefore repeat that now is one of the most critical times. There will be a reaction. Pakistan will be blamed. Two nuclear-armed countries will come face to face, as they did in February. Yet the United Nations has a responsibility to stop us from heading in that direction. That is precisely why the United Nations came into being in 1945. It is supposed to stop such things from happening. I feel as if we are back in the Munich of 1939 and Czechoslovakia has just been taken \u2014 annexed. What is the world community going to do? Is it going to appease a market of 1.35 billion? Or is it going to stand up for justice and humanity? If things go wrong, the world will hope for the best, but it should be prepared for the worst. If a conventional war breaks out between the two countries, anything could happen.\nBut let us suppose a country seven times smaller than its neighbour is faced with the choice of either surrendering or fighting to the death for its freedom \u2014 what will we do? I ask myself that question, and my belief is that there is no God but God. We will fight. And when a nuclear-armed country fights to the end, there will be consequences that reach far beyond its borders. There will be consequences for the world, which is why I repeat that I am here to send out a warning. It is not a threat. It is a reasonable concern about where we are headed.\nI have come here to tell the United Nations that it must act. This is a test for the United Nations. It was the United Nations that guaranteed the people of Kashmir the right to self-determination. They are suffering because of that right and now is the time to do something. Unlike 1939, it is not the time to appease. It is the time to take action. The number one action must be for India to lift the inhumane curfew that has lasted for 55 days. It must free all political prisoners, especially those 13,000 boys who have been detained. Their parents do not know where they have been disappeared to. Then, the world community must give the people of Kashmir the right to self-determination.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, as I take the floor before the General Assembly, it is my duty to convey the fraternal and cordial greetings of the people of Mali, from Kayes to Kidal, from Taoudenni to Sikasso. I also extend my most heartfelt congratulations and wish every success to Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, who has been elected as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, and to assure him of Mali\u2019s full cooperation. I would also like to commend Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces of Ecuador for having led the General Assembly at its seventy-third session with remarkable aplomb. Finally, I would be remiss if I forgot to mention my dear friend Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, whose commitment to the ideals of peace, security, development and respect for human rights continues to shine brightly.\nAmong other highlights, our current session will be marked by the celebration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. No commemoration could represent a better opportunity for Mali to reaffirm its commitment to the values and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and our conviction that only collective and concerted action will enable us to meet the many challenges of our times, achieve our ideal of peace and meet our shared goals of security and development for all. This is particularly true with regard to the theme of the seventy-fourth session of the Assembly, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d. Nothing is more urgent than stepping up our work in all these areas if we are to address the root causes of instability in some of our countries.\nThere is no nation in history whose trajectory has not been affected by trying times. Mali is undergoing that painful experience today, given that since January 2012 it has been facing a daily terrorist threat that aims at nothing less than shaking its deepest foundations. We must believe in the saying that bad times show us who our true friends are, as Mali is in no way lacking in that area. The multifaceted political, diplomatic and military support of the international community for Mali attests to the truth of that adage more than anything else. Whether with regard to containing the terrorist groups, combating their barbarism or rebuilding our sundered unity, there has been no shortage of support, and I welcome it. To a large extent, it is owing to that support that we achieved the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali, emanating from the Algiers process, to which I remain particularly committed.\nOne of the major achievements brought about by the Agreement is the absence of clashes between the Malian defence and security forces and the signatory groups, as well as the gradual restoration of trust among the Malian parties. In addition, we have already reintegrated more than 2,000 former combatants, 1,000 of whom have been trained, into our reconfigured forces in anticipation of the establishment of the new Malian national army.\nWithin the framework of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) process we have made progress with its activation, which was established through our own deliberations and is now referred to as the \u201caccelerated DDR\u201d. We welcome that, since it is clearly a prerequisite for the restoration of State authority over the entire national territory, but we cannot ignore the fact that there is still a long way to go to achieve lasting peace and reconciliation in our country.\nTo that end, we must implement the political and institutional reforms provided for in the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali. In this regard, I am pleased to underscore that after two unsuccessful attempts, in 2017 and 2018, Mali is actively preparing for the timely holding of an inclusive national dialogue leading to national reconciliation and the entrenchment of democracy in our country. At the same time, in order to ensure the normal functioning and stability of institutions, for which I hold primary responsibility, we considered it appropriate to extend the terms of office of the deputies in the National Assembly until 2 May 2020 so as to enable them to adopt a set of political and institutional reforms to be recommended during the national inclusive dialogue.\nOn 24 July, with a view to a achieving peace and national reconciliation, I promulgated the Loi d\u2019entente nationale. While it exempts those who committed or were complicit in crimes during the painful events in Mali dating back to January 2012 from criminal prosecution, the law does not apply to war crimes, crimes against humanity, rape and crimes not subject to a statute of limitations. Moreover, it stipulates measures providing for the acknowledgement of and reparation for victims who were directly or indirectly affected by the painful experience that our people underwent, building on the remarkable work accomplished by Mali\u2019s Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission, which has enabled the voices of more than 14,000 people in our country to be heard.\nIt is with the same level of concern for achieving national reconciliation and therefore reducing inequality, which undermines national cohesion, that the National Assembly adopted legislation this year establishing a northern development zone in Mali, as provided for by the Algiers Agreement, and that subsequently the Government created a sustainable development fund, endowed with $72 million, as the financial instrument for implementing the regional development strategy in northern Mali. To date, $20 million has already been disbursed to finance urgent priorities in the regions of Kidal, Menaka, Timbuktu and Gao.\nWhile such diverse progress has been made possible through the common will of all the Malian parties to the Agreement, it has also been possible thanks to the support and guidance of partners from the international community. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the vital work of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), which operates in an environment that I know is particularly complex and difficult. The Mission has paid a very high price in Mali, and I would like to pay tribute to the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of MINUSMA, as well as of the other international forces deployed in Mali, to whom, on behalf of the people of Mali, I want to say that we owe a particularly heartfelt tribute for their contribution to the maintenance of peace and international security in our region, and not just in Mali.\nNevertheless, within the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel), we are fully aware that security alone cannot bring about the lasting peace that we seek. Many challenges remain, including, unfortunately, the implementation process of the Agreement. These challenges include the extremely volatile security environment, marked by a resurgence of attacks by terrorist groups, violent extremists and drug traffickers on our civilian populations, the Malian defence and security forces and those of our international partners. But they also include the persistent challenges linked to our development. That is why, in parallel with the security component, we are working together to implement the Priority Investment Programme, which includes 40 projects in the areas of defence, security, governance, infrastructure and human development, in order to appropriately address the root causes of instability, while creating economic, social and development opportunities for our people, in particular our young people.\nAnother equally important challenge involves the availability of adequate financial resources for the implementation of the Agreement. That is why, while I am grateful to our partners for the efforts already made, I must still urge them to honour their pledges made at the international conference for the economic recovery and development of Mali, held in Paris, in October 2015, under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and at the G-5 Sahel partners and donors coordination conference for the financing of the G-5 Sahel Priority Investment Programme, held in Nouakchott on 6 December 2018.\nI also take this opportunity to welcome the Alliance for the Sahel, which aims to federate and coordinate the commitment of our partners in six priority areas of action \u2014 youth employment, rural development and food security, energy and climate, governance and decentralization, access to basic social services, and security \u2014 which will cost \u20ac6 billion over the period from 2018 to 2022.\nNotwithstanding the efforts made to stabilize and develop the regions of northern Mali, I cannot ignore the worrying situation in the centre of our country. Quite the contrary, in fact, and I want to point out that the two major challenges facing Mali today are inextricably linked. After having succeeded in destabilizing our northern regions, terrorists and other criminal groups have tried to extend their areas of influence and illicit activities to the centre, by exploiting disputes between human groups that had hitherto been able to manage them in a non-violent manner, in accordance with our civilizational values.\nIt is also worth stressing that the motives of those terrorist groups have little to do with religion and even less with development. I note that Mali has been Islamized since the eleventh century. Their goal is to create spaces to expand their criminal activities, including trafficking in drugs, arms, human beings and illicit goods, taking advantage of the State\u2019s weak presence, particularly the defence and security services, in the regions concerned. The clashes, too hastily dubbed \u201cintercommunal tensions\u201d, that have, alas, afflicted the regions of Segou and Mopti, have affected the entire Malian nation, beyond these areas. I have therefore instructed the Government to take a series of political, security, regulatory and judicial measures to restore order and security in the affected areas.\nAs part of those efforts, security measures in the field have been strengthened and new security outposts set up in strategic areas, and several hundred local youth have joined a special programme to reduce intercommunal violence. The efforts also include the recovery of many weapons, the ongoing disarmament of militias, development actions and the provision of basic social services to the populations. All these operations are designed to better meet our governance and security challenges. With a view to coordinating all the efforts and to involving all national stakeholders, including political, traditional and religious leaders and regional managers, in their implementation, in June I appointed Dioncounda Traore, the former Acting President of Mali during the transition, as my High Representative for Central Mali.\nThe crises in the northern and central regions of Mali have caused massive movements of thousands of our compatriots. Whether they are refugees in neighbouring countries or internally displaced persons, their return in safety and dignity to their places of origin is a major concern of my Government, which has undertaken the implementation of major programmes aimed at the long-term improvement of the living conditions of Mali\u2019s entire population. Health care, through supplementary health insurance schemes, is one such programme. The International Organization for Migration, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs are helping us in our efforts through regional emergency-response plans for the Timbuktu, Gao, Kidal and Mopti regions. The same can be said of our membership in the African Risk Capacity Insurance Company Limited, whose treaty Mali ratified in 2016, and which has enabled us, for the past four seasons of insurance contracts, to deal with the consequences of climate hazards.\nIn addition to these specific measures, which are born of emergency, I am tempted to say, other, more structural measures are being taken, first among them regarding youth employment. Because I believe in the young people of Mali, I have decided to devote my second term to promoting youth, as our hope for today and certainly the architects of our future. Similarly, I believe deeply in the women of Mali and their invaluable contributions to our country\u2019s stabilization and development processes. I will continue to appoint them in large numbers to senior decision-making posts, in keeping with the 2015 law on the promotion of gender in decision-making bodies in Mali.\nIn the light of the importance of inclusive and sustainable development in the theme of the current session, I should not overlook the allocation in 2018 of funds to build approximately 3,000 social housing units for middle- and low-income people. The Malian diaspora is also always on my mind. Furthermore, I want to highlight the positive efforts of the African Development Bank (AfDB), to whose Desert to Power initiative we recently subscribed in Ouagadougou, and which will ensure greater energy availability to meet our industrial-building needs. When we consider that a country such as Mali, which grows a large quantity of cotton, produces only 2 percent of its own energy, the importance of energy generation is clear, especially for our textile industry. This AfDB initiative is therefore very welcome.\nDespite the national and regional challenges I have just mentioned, the people and the Government of Mali remain very attentive to the situation in Africa and the rest of the world. We continue to be deeply concerned about the situation in Libya, which is still having a negative impact on the entire Sahel region. I call on all Libyan stakeholders to prioritize dialogue and peaceful solutions with a view to finding a lasting and rapid resolution to the crisis. Similarly, Mali is following with concern the situation in the Middle East, particularly in the occupied Palestinian territories. The Malian people reaffirm their full support for to our brother Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle for self-determination. The Government of Mali calls for a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in order to achieve a solution where two States live side by side, as many have urged today, in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions and within secure, internationally recognized borders. Furthermore, Mali calls for an end to the deadly violence that unfortunately continues to afflict the brother peoples of Syria and Yemen and to cause humanitarian disasters.\nOn international migration issues, Mali, as a country of origin, transit and destination for migrants, reiterates its commitment to multilateral cooperation and international solidarity. In this regard, I would like to make a strong call for respect for the rights of migrants, in accordance with the relevant provisions of international conventions, in particular the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular migration (resolution 73/195), adopted in December 2018 in Marrakech, and the global compact on refugees.\nMali reiterates its call for reforming the Security Council to make it more representative and inclusive, which is a matter of simple justice. Through me, Mali reaffirms its commitment to the common African position on the reform, in accordance with the Ezulwini Consensus.\nAs a country of the Sahel mainly engaged in agriculture, livestock and fisheries, Mali remains deeply concerned about climate change, one of the major challenges to the survival and development of humankind. My country is suffering the full brunt of the effects of climate change, characterized by the spread of desertification and its impact on fauna and flora, the drying up of our rivers and streams, hotter weather and repeated floods. That is why I would like to reaffirm Mali\u2019s commitment to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. To that end, and in the context of the Secretary-General\u2019s Climate Action Summit, we will submit to him and the co-leaders of his Climate Finance coalition, France, Jamaica and Qatar, a concrete proposal to trigger and accelerate a wave of low-carbon investment by redirecting global savings towards infrastructure and industrial and agricultural production processes in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Additionally, Mali will work within the African Union to systematically integrate climate change into the cooperation between the continent and each of its strategic partners.\nMali welcomes the processes under way in the Sudan, in particular the formation of a Government of national unity resulting from the agreement between the military and opposition leaders, which has also led to the establishment of a Sovereign Council to lead the transition in that sister country.\nIn conclusion, I want to emphasize strongly that 75 years after its creation, the United Nations continues to demonstrate its relevance to our common quest to save future generations from the scourge of war and its collective efforts aimed at achieving that end. In so doing, I would like to remind the Assembly that peace is priceless. We must therefore cherish it, because without it there can be no humanity or coexistence. These are the values and attitudes that should give meaning to our existence and enable individuals and human communities to see the light in our future, as President Emmanuel Macron of France put it yesterday (see A/74/PV.3).\nWe must therefore make the quest for peace not a religion but a culture, with all of the connotations that possesses in terms of respect for diversity, recognition of the other, empathy, solidarity and, in a word, brotherhood \u2014 brotherhood, which we need more than ever in order to give meaning to our human condition.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a matter of great pride for Africa to see Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande presiding over the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. We wish him a very successful tenure and assure him of the full support of Mauritius as he steers the work of the Assembly. We also extend our congratulations to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, on their leadership, hard work and dedication during the past year.\nWe commend the judicious choice of the theme \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d for this year\u2019s session. This is indeed a critical year for sustainable development and climate action. Climate change continues to disrupt national economies and affect lives; economic growth is slow and uneven; income inequality is on the rise; achieving quality education is still beyond our reach; and official development assistance and humanitarian aid to those most in need, especially in the least developed countries and small island developing States (SIDS), are on the decline. No substantial progress has been achieved in building peace, justice and strong institutions.\nTo compound an already troubling situation, emerging issues \u2014 such as new conflicts, rising tensions among major global Powers, the rise of extremism, the migration and refugee crisis and the flip side of technology \u2014 are further undermining our ability to live up to our pledge and make significant progress in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. The devastating effects of Cyclone Idai in Southern Africa and Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, the desolation left in the wake of wildfires in California, the sweltering heat of the hottest months that we have recently recorded on all continents and the latest ice cap melts in Greenland all point to an alarmingly dangerous and desolate future for our planet.\nWhile the poor and vulnerable are the hardest hit, no single country is immune from the devastation and havoc that rising temperatures and global warming are creating in the lives and livelihoods of communities. Millions of people are already at risk of being pushed into poverty by 2030 as a direct consequence of climate change. In its latest report, Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gives us an apocalyptic picture that compels us to act now. Last week\u2019s worldwide demonstrations by young people calling for action now cannot fall on deaf ears. We must renew and strengthen our commitment to limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. To that end, we need to considerably increase the financial resources we allocate to it and live up to the Paris pledges.\nIn Mauritius, the Government has embarked on the development of low-carbon-emission transport and will soon be launching a light rail transit system, in addition to implementing a massive greening programme to enhance our carbon-sinking capacity. We also intend to double our use of renewable energy by 2030.\nSmall island developing States are particularly threatened by the dangerously intensifying impacts of climate change. The mid-term review of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway has clearly demonstrated that its implementation faces similar hurdles to those confronting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the most important of which are funding and means of implementation.\nMore responsive and targeted partnerships are essential to addressing the specific problems that SIDS face in achieving tangible and measurable outcomes. SIDS like Mauritius that through their own efforts have reached middle-income-country status now face new challenges in accessing concessionary financing and grants. To make that situation worse, our efforts to diversify our economy and develop our international competitiveness in areas such as financial services are often frustrated by an uneven playing field in which we have to deal with arbitrary classifications, despite our strict adherence to international rules and norms. Unsurprisingly, unless we address those issues upfront, countries like Mauritius will fall victim to the middle-income-country trap.\nBeyond goodwill and expressions of support, we need focused action to achieve the targets set in the 2030 Agenda for ensuring inclusion and opportunities for all so that no one is left behind. Despite our limitations, Mauritius is very much on track to achieve most of the targets of the 2030 Agenda, particularly in the areas of poverty eradication, gender equality and quality education.\nExclusion in all its forms hinders development and often sets countries on unsustainable paths of development, plagued by social and economic instability. Global economic growth is uneven and often fails to reach the regions that need it most, which conceals the stark reality that inequality within and among States is widening. We need to urgently address those challenges and overcome perceptions that economic benefits are unfairly distributed. We must provide a level playing field across borders. Developed and developing countries alike must address the deep-rooted causes of inequalities among States, such as the dynamic of financial flows among them, their uneven exposure to climate change and the very unequal way that they stand to benefit from technology.\nThe health of our oceans continues to deteriorate at an alarming rate. Progress towards the conservation of the world\u2019s oceans has been too slow. Ocean acidification and unsustainable fishing pose major threats to our oceans and marine resources. Mauritius is committed to making its contribution by enforcing a ban on plastics, instituting sustainable fishery policies and other related measures. We are also deeply committed to the process towards the development of an international legally binding instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction.\nPiracy, drug smuggling, human trafficking, marine pollution and the pillaging of marine resources remain issues of serious concern in our part of the Indian Ocean. Those threats have reached alarming proportions and, if left unattended, pose serious security risks to the stability of the region and beyond. As Chair of the Indian Ocean Commission, Mauritius has convened ministerial-level meetings over the past two years to reflect on ways and means to collectively address the growing maritime threats in the region. This year we also hosted the meeting of the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, which is at the forefront of combating piracy in the Indian Ocean. Maritime security in the western Indian Ocean is not only a regional challenge, it also has far wider ramifications that require national and regional commitment, together with the support of the international community. Mauritius continues to be engaged with the countries of the region and the international community in that regard.\nFighting radicalism, violent extremism and terrorism by developing effective counter-narratives requires cooperation and proper coordination among all Member States. That can be achieved only through multilateralism. The interdependence of the work of countering terrorism and promoting sustainable development is increasingly recognized. Terrorism and extremism feed on grievances and exploit development challenges such as inequality, poverty and marginalization. By building resilient and inclusive societies, we can withstand terrorist ideologies and those who espouse them. The Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force has an extremely important role to play in providing technical assistance and capacity-building to Member States in order to strengthen their ability to prevent and counter terrorism.\nGlobal security has not been as fragile as it is now since the end of the Cold War. The potential for violent conflict is palpable amid rising tensions in many regions, particularly in the Middle East. The escalation of tensions on economic and trade issues, withdrawal from international treaties, the increased weaponization of outer space and cyberspace and the proliferation of arms have further accentuated the risks to global security. This new normal threatens the world\u2019s ability to find global solutions to problems at a time when the world most needs unity and collective action.\nOur continent, Africa, has made considerable strides in the areas of governance, peace and security, which are prerequisites for sustainable development. A peaceful and secure Africa is fundamental to a peaceful and secure world. The launch of the African Continental Free Trade Area in July represented a major step towards the realization of a vision for an integrated, prosperous and people-centred Africa. The success of that project can be guaranteed only by addressing the causes of conflict in the region. We therefore appeal to the international community to step up its efforts in that regard.\nThe Israeli-Palestinian peace process is agonizingly stalled. The prospects for realizing the legitimate Palestinian aspirations for sovereignty and statehood are becoming more distant. The suffering of the Palestinian people is further exacerbated by the expansion of settlements, the demolition of their houses, the closure of key crossings and a decrease in humanitarian aid. Yet giving up hope for a resolution to that protracted conflict should never be an option. A peaceful future in the Middle East rests on the possibility of a two-State solution. We appeal to the United Nations and other major players to step up their efforts in supporting a negotiated, just, comprehensive and long-lasting two-State solution.\nWe welcome the progress achieved in intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform, which have laid the foundations for fulfilling their mandate. We call for redoubled efforts in intergovernmental negotiations to advance reform of the Security Council and make it more representative and reflective of the realities of our time.\nThe General Assembly has always played a central role in addressing decolonization. It is to its credit that a large number of colonies gained their independence as a result of its continued action. Regrettably, however, that work is not complete. Some remnants of colonization that need to end still persist.\nOne such example is Mauritius, which suffered an unlawful excision of its territory before its independence in 1968. In an advisory opinion on Legal consequences of the separation of the Chagos archipelago from Mauritius in 1965 (A/73/773) rendered pursuant to the request of the General Assembly in resolution 71/292, the International Court of Justice found that the Chagos archipelago was an integral part of Mauritius at the time of its detachment and that in view of its unlawful excision, the decolonization process of Mauritius was not lawfully completed upon its accession to independence. The Court also concluded that the United Kingdom\u2019s administration of the Chagos archipelago is an unlawful act of a continuing character and should be brought to an end as rapidly as possible.\nThe General Assembly promptly adopted resolution 73/295 on 22 May by an overwhelming majority. It gives practical effect to the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice and demands that the United Kingdom withdraw its colonial administration from the Chagos archipelago unconditionally within a period of no more than six months. The resolution also recognizes the right of return of the former inhabitants of the Chagos archipelago, who were forcibly removed by the United Kingdom, a point to which Mauritius is strongly committed.\nWe therefore expect that given its commitment to the rule of law and respect for the International Court of Justice and the United Nations, the United Kingdom will give effect to the findings of the advisory opinion and withdraw its administration from the Chagos archipelago unconditionally by 22 November, as requested by the General Assembly. We also look forward to the report of the Secretary-General on the overall implementation of resolution 73/295.\nMauritius is deeply grateful to all Member States for the overwhelming support they gave to the resolution. It is testimony to the great importance that Member States attach to the need to complete the decolonization of Mauritius and their respect for international institutions, including the International Court of Justice, and for the rule of law in international relations. We look forward to Member States\u2019 continued support and cooperation with the United Nations so that our decolonization can be rapidly completed and a programme for the resettlement in the Chagos archipelago of Mauritian nationals, in particular those of Chagossian origin, can be implemented by Mauritius.\nWith regard to the island of Tromelin, which also forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius, we call for a speedy resolution of the dispute over the island, in the spirit of friendship that has always characterized the relationship between Mauritius and France.\nWe are living in an increasingly complex environment. The challenges confronting humankind require greater collaboration, coordination and commitment. A principled and effective multilateral system offers a unique platform for tackling global and local challenges that seem to be growing in scale and complexity. The celebration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations next year should be an opportunity for us to reaffirm our strong commitment to the United Nations ideals and the entrenched principles of the Charter of the United Nations of sovereign equality, respect for the territorial integrity of States and non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States.\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that we all have a role to play. Young people, women, the private sector, civil society and developed and developing countries alike must come together to address our common concerns.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to express my warmest congratulations to the President on his outstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. It is eloquent testimony to the great esteem in which the international community holds his great country, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, a friend and brother of mine. I also see it as the well-deserved culmination of his exemplary academic and diplomatic career, which confirms my belief that he will successfully carry out his difficult mission. I assure him that the delegation of the Niger is willing to provide him and the other members of the Bureau with every possible support in fulfilling his mandate.\nI would also like to pay a deserved tribute to Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, the outgoing President, for the exemplary manner in which she led the work of the seventy-third session.\nTo Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, I would like to express our appreciation for the tireless work he has done to strengthen the effectiveness of our Organization\u2019s action, not just through his implementation of various reforms but also thanks to his personal commitment to certain causes, such as the climate, security in the Sahel, migration and humanitarian issues, among others. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to him and my wishes for his continued success.\nOn 7 June, here in this Hall, Member States overwhelmingly supported the Niger\u2019s candidacy, put forward by Africa, for non-permanent membership in the Security Council (see A/73/PV.89). I feel it appropriate here to express my sincere thanks for that mark of confidence in and esteem for my country. For my part, I am fully cognizant of our responsibility and I can assure the Assembly that the Niger will assume it with commitment and conviction and with a view to helping to find solutions to the various challenges facing the international community.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s session, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, is pertinent for several reasons. First, it rightly continues the theme of our previous session on our shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. It is also an opportunity for us to recall that to date, multilateralism has made progress only in the wake of bloody conflicts, as was the case with the treaties of Westphalia, in 1648, and the Treaty of Vienna, which founded the European orders that succeeded the Thirty Years\u2019 War, the Eighty Years\u2019 War and the Napoleonic wars, respectively. The same was true of the attempt to establish the League of Nations after the First World War, and the creation of the United Nations following the Second World War. Each time, the objective was to create rules and institutions capable of establishing an order that was conducive to peaceful international relations and governed by the rule of law, and that could enable us to emerge out of a state of nature in which every State had absolute freedom to resort to force.\nThe preamble to the Charter of the United Nations states, among other things, that its aim is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. We must therefore not forget the lessons of history. The increasing complexity of international relations means that multilateralism is more necessary than ever in an increasingly globalized world, where the interdependence of States and nations is also ever increasing. The world must engage in win-win cooperation, not zero-sum relationships, as the theory of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma shows. The world needs regulatory institutions. While it is true that national interests govern politics, national interests are better defended through cooperation rather than confrontation.\nThe theme of this session is also relevant given the challenges facing the international community today. In the international arena we see countries returning to the arms race, trade tensions, rising populism and xenophobia, growing inequalities, huge increases in migratory flows, the spread of terrorist and criminal organizations and the effects of climate change. We live in a world where some are dying of obesity and others of starvation. We live in a world where the number of refugees and displaced persons in 2018 driven by problems related to poverty, climate and insecurity was estimated at more than 70 million, 300,000 of whom we are hosting in the Niger. We live in a world where 800 million are estimated to be in poverty, while the top 1 per cent of the world\u2019s richest people enjoy twice as much income growth as 50 per cent of the poorest. Inequality has been increasing in almost every country for the past 40 years or so.\nIf we are to effectively address those challenges, we must reform the current multilateral system. To galvanize multilateral efforts, we must give special attention to reform measures that have been under way for several years and are still struggling to succeed. Reform packages will remain incomplete without significant progress on reforming the Security Council both in terms of its equitable representation and its working methods and functioning. In that regard, my country remains committed to the common African position, as expressed through the Ezulwini Consensus.\nAlongside reform of the Security Council, we must also carry out the revitalization of the General Assembly, our representative body par excellence, and the Economic and Social Council, the guarantor of the establishment of a new global economic order. Reform should not be limited to global political governance but should also include economic governance and institutions, including the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Without that it will be difficult to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, especially Goal 1, on the eradication of poverty. Without that, it will be equally difficult to meet the aspirations of the African peoples outlined in the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063. The theme of our session is of course an opportunity to take stock of the progress we have made in eradicating poverty through the implementation of those agendas.\nFour years have already passed since the adoption of the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The conclusion that emerged from the work of the latest High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, held in July, is that despite the progress we have made, we are not on track to achieve the Agenda\u2019s goals and targets in the desired time frame. That is why we must raise the level of our ambition and renew our commitment through concrete actions that can have an impact on several SDGs at once, giving us hope that we can win the battle against poverty and ensure inclusive economic growth that takes into account the aspirations that our peoples have for a better quality of life.\nThe SDG Summit, which is taking place on the margins of this session, will give us an opportunity to renew our commitment and a fresh impetus to catch up and achieve our goals by 2030 through concrete development actions. That leap forward can be effective only through the genuine mobilization of financial resources, including in the private sector. I should point out that Africa needs $600 billion a year if it is to achieve the SDGs. In that regard, I welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s successful initiative in convening the High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development. I personally believe that it will enable us to identify new avenues for bridging the current funding gap and directing resources to productive sectors and structural projects linked to the SDGs. In that regard, I want to emphasize health education, especially for young girls, including on reproductive health and reducing maternal and infant mortality. I am appealing for vaccinations in particular, not only regarding the restoration of funding for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization for the period from 2021 to 2025 but also the development of vaccines for diseases such as malaria, cancer, diabetes and the Ebola virus.\nIn that same spirit, regional integration could serve as a catalyst by creating markets and facilitating trade. Alongside the SDGs, our continent must implement Agenda 2063, operationalize the African Continental Free Trade Area, promote industrialization by transforming its vast resources into raw materials, build road, rail, port, airport, energy and telecommunication infrastructure, develop human capital by promoting education and health so as to turn our demographic potential into economic dividends, develop agriculture to feed our population, create jobs for our young people and put an end to the tragedy of illegal migration. We can achieve those goals only by boldly reforming global economic and financial governance. I am pleased to be able to inform the Assembly that we initiated the operational phase of the African Continental Free Trade Area in Niamey on 7 July. That initiative, which I have had the honour of spearheading since 2017 on behalf of my African peers, will enable Africa to strengthen integration and pave the way for the continent\u2019s transformation by establishing the conditions for prosperity through the implementation of our agreement and Agenda 2063, including by creating jobs for young people.\nIt is now clear that the countries of the Sahel and the Lake Chad basin have become a theatre of operations for terrorist and criminal organizations. That threat is one of the issues that particularly require multilateral action. The fact is that security is a global public good, which the international community has shown that it has fully grasped in its forging of strong coalitions to fight terrorism in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. It is regrettable that such is not the case in the Sahel and the Lake Chad basin, where the threat of terrorist and criminal organizations has been amplified by the Libyan crisis, for which the international community bears a serious responsibility. As I have emphasized on numerous occasions, the international community must not turn its back on those regions, whose populations, particularly women and children, have undergone indescribable suffering. Their peoples have become refugees or been displaced and their schools have been closed, sacrificing generations of young people who no longer have the opportunity to learn.\nIn order to tackle this situation, the international community must work urgently to find a solution to the Libyan crisis, including by appointing a joint African Union-United Nations special envoy, helping to strengthen the operational and intelligence capabilities of Member States\u2019 defence and security forces and of the Multinational Joint Task Force fighting Boko Haram in the Lake Chad basin and the Joint Force of the Group of Five for the Sahel, which we would like to see operating under Chapter VII of our Charter. The terrorist groups\u2019 new strategy aimed at creating intercommunal conflict, and the spread of insecurity to countries that have been spared until now, are also reasons that demand that we act in concert against such groups.\nThat is why on 14 September in Ouagadougou we held an Extraordinary Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) specifically devoted to regional security and to examining ways and means of addressing it collectively. The Summit reflected the strong commitment of the leaders of our region to addressing this problem and also reinforced the idea of pooling our resources in the face of an increasingly organized common enemy with a proven military capacity. I am pleased that ECOWAS took firm decisions about this at the Summit. To that we can add other equally decisive measures, such as the request for changing the mandate of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and extending it beyond Mali\u2019s territory, in accordance with Security Council resolution 2480 (2019), and the adoption of a plan of action for the period from 2020 to 2024, with an initial funding from ECOWAS member countries of $1 billion. As Chair of ECOWAS, I urge the international community, particularly the United Nations, to take account of the Summit\u2019s conclusions, given their relevance.\nI would like to take this opportunity to welcome the joint initiative of President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on implementing a partnership for security and stability in the Sahel. I hope it will enable our peoples to see the interest that the international community has in us. I want to sincerely thank all the partners who have been supporting us, including through the Alliance for the Sahel, with a view to backing our States in their development efforts and thereby contributing to the stability of our region. We believe those various partners\u2019 actions should be harmonized if we are to achieve better results. It is always worth remembering that defeating terrorism ultimately depends on economic and social development.\nThe issue of the effects of climate change transcends borders and is part of the international community\u2019s remit. As the situation in the Sahel and the Lake Chad basin illustrates, poverty, terrorism and climate change are closely linked. That is why I want to call on all Member States to ensure that the conclusions of the Climate Action Summit, held yesterday, on 23 September, are implemented. The fact is that all of us here today recognize the desperate need to pool our strengths and resources in order to find acceptable and sustainable solutions to protect our planet and enable future generations to inherit a world worth living in. We do not have a planet B. Our immediate commitments will have an impact on the survival of humankind. We in the Niger are aware of that. That is why we have emphasized climate change resilience in our sectoral policies and strategies for health, transport, agricultural and pastoral production and for local and regional land planning and development. We have also taken steps to integrate the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions into our national programme for access to energy services and to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of our agriculture and water sectors. Lastly, the Niger has decided to implement a long-term national adaptation plan by establishing its determined contribution at the national level, among other things.\nIn that regard, I would like to highlight the importance of the Sahel\u2019s climate investment plan for the period from 2018 to 2030 and its priority programme, important strategic instruments that were formulated under the Niger\u2019s leadership in its capacity as Chair of the Climate Commission for the Sahel. On behalf of the other members of the Commission, I would like to reiterate our appeal to the international community to give the conclusions of the round table on financing the plan and the climate agenda for the Sahel the attention they deserve, because continued poverty, climate change, terrorism and organized crime have immediate negative consequences for our States\u2019 efforts to achieve the SDGs.\nThe vast increase in migratory flows is another issue characteristic of our time. It cannot be addressed by one country alone. It is the responsibility of the international community. In that regard, I welcomed the adoption of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in December 2018. That first commitment on the part of our Organization on this subject constitutes a first step in addressing the matter in its entirety through the 23 identified objectives. As the Assembly is already aware, I am personally committed to that fight, owing partly to the security problems that illegal migration creates for us, but also because we are horrified by the intolerable spectacle of the tragedies that the migrants endure across deserts and oceans. The Niger is therefore truly motivated to participate in the 2022 forum for examining the Global Compact\u2019s implementation, with a view to sharing our own experiences and being enriched by other countries\u2019 positive experiences. I hope that between now and then, bold decisions will have been taken to address the underlying causes of migration, including poverty, climate change and insecurity.\nThe world has undergone rapid and profound changes in recent years. If we are to respond to the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of the world, we must adapt our strategies to that new context. More than ever, the international community needs a strong United Nations if it is to achieve the ambitious goals of its Charter. We must therefore give the Secretary-General our unwavering support in his efforts to reform the Organization, strengthen its role and equip it with the means to adequately fulfil its missions.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my call for a new global political and economic governance. The instruments put in place in the aftermath of the Second World War are no longer sufficient as they stand. That is a sine qua non for addressing the challenges I have mentioned \u2014 poverty, climate change, terrorism and organized crime and migration.\n"

        "file_text": "Gathering as we are on the eve of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, undertaking a range of summits on addressing climate action, financing for development, health, the Sustainable Development Goals and the immediate challenges facing small island developing States, we can be in no doubt not only as to the complexity and interdependence of the world that we inhabit today but also about the interacting crises now facing us that cannot be avoided \u2014 an ecological crisis affecting our very existence and a global crisis of deepening inequality and a loss of social cohesion that creates a crisis of institutional credibility. These crises all have their origin in a global failure in relation to inclusively meeting global human needs.\nOn occasions such as this, we all are challenged to ask ourselves at the deepest level if we are being true to the values and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Are those values and principles informing our practices as States Members of the United Nations? Are they being invoked to face the challenges that we are debating this week?\nFor so many, such questions evoke life-and- death realities. As we meet, the United Nations and its agencies are under attack, whether through underfunding or withdrawal of support, and now so often by the explicit promotion of the narrowest version of a theory of interests by some of the most powerful, which is the very antithesis of the multilateralism that the Charter demands.\nIreland believes in the United Nations, supports its aims and is anxious to become ever more involved in its work. We must therefore not be hesitant in speaking of how over the years the United Nations and multilateralism have driven major advances for people across the world, building programmes for poverty alleviation, better health care and education, women\u2019s empowerment and freedom from violence.\nIt is multilateralism, too, that has enabled us to develop mechanisms for conflict resolution, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. The progress made in the development of international law is a testament to the significant steps for humankind that we can take when the international community works in harmony. This week we must therefore defend, reinforce and advocate for the strengthening of multilateralism.\nFor us in my country, Ireland, the United Nations anchors our foreign policy. Its Charter, institutions and personnel constitute a prism through which we view our situation in the world and how we wish our practices to be perceived and judged in the world. We view the United Nations as that special institution where newly free nations have found a home after their struggles for independence and their emergence from the shadows, legacies and distortions of imperialism. We see the United Nations as a forum that has been provided to give a voice to the voiceless, the marginalized and those lacking power and wealth. For so many, it is the only such forum available to them \u2014 and it is all the more important for that.\nFor Ireland, too, the United Nations is also a great peace project, one that strives for fair and sustainable global development, for the resolution of conflicts, both ancient and new, and for the support of the many fleeing war, persecution, famine and natural disasters. I suggest that for all of us the United Nations must be a house of hope. It is a house where words have sought to matter, where words must carry hope. We must think of what hope was felt, for example, in the galleries of those who came in their early days of independence to the United Nations.\nRemembering this legacy, I could not speak here today in good faith or with authenticity in relation to the Charter without acknowledging that the international order is now again under grave pressure. The very idea of a rules-based order is being called into question and undermined. The international institutions \u2014 admittedly flawed and imperfect \u2014 that have been nurtured since 1945 and have brought much benefit to our peoples are the subject of questioning, withdrawal of support and even attack.\nThe partnership, cooperation, mutual trust and respect that are at the heart of multilateralism are embedded in the rule of law and in values that aim to protect all individuals on this planet and their rights, aspirations and dignity, values that do not have a single origin in time, culture or belief system. Multilateralism is, of course, in its best practice, a system that acknowledges its foundation on a principle of compromise, of shared vision, of finding the capacity to put oneself in the language, thoughts, culture and concerns of \u201cthe other\u201d. It allows the large and small, the powerful and weak, to coexist in shared concern and joint prospect for the betterment of a shared world.\nHowever, throughout the ages, as history has shown us, too many times the error that lay in the thinking of those who suggested that individual action, aggression or, as some might see it, adventurism was a better way forward than the cooperative world multilateralism offers. The call to more closely align our perspectives has never been more apposite. Our challenges have never been of such a global and momentous nature, and never more than today have the challenges and, frankly, the threats the world faces called out for us to recognize our collective responsibilities, including those of intergenerational justice.\nTo choose not to address those risks and challenges globally and multilaterally would be reckless. To reject the norms of collective, mutually respectful action taken together in favour of aggressive individual action, or to retreat to an old, false rhetoric of war, promises misery in the form of a continuity of instability, imbalance, social inequality and exploitation in every aspect of a potential shared life. It offers chaos and, almost inevitably, further conflict.\nIreland does not believe that conflict is endemic to any region of the world, to any people, class of values or belief system. We believe there are no conflicts that cannot be resolved when a real commitment is made to an understanding of the other, and when this understanding of the other is based on mutual work on agreement on post-conflict opportunities, the acceptance of alternative narratives of shared values, and, of course, the institutional support that gives continuity of peace processes. This is what informs our view of conflicts in the Middle East region, including the Israel-Palestine conflict. Ireland has experience of prolonged and at times seemingly intractable conflict and of the painstaking work and compromises that pave the way for a peace settlement. For this reason, the Israel-Palestine conflict resonates deeply with the Irish people.\nFrom our own experiences, we have a deep sense of the centrality of national identity and a sense of belonging and how that persists through decades and centuries. Such a reality cannot be ignored, suppressed or circumvented. Peace processes have to find a way for different identities and narratives to coexist by creating a space where they no longer have to compete in a zero-sum game and by finding a way, through peace processes, to address historic and contemporary injustices. In the case of Israel and Palestine, we are more than ever convinced that the needs of both peoples can be fully achieved only through two independent, secure and sovereign States, coexisting side by side, in mutual recognition and peace.\nBoth peoples have so much to gain from this aspiration to creating a new and stable equilibrium. We do not say this lightly. We know from our own experience that it will be an immensely challenging task to achieve, requiring enormous courage and difficult compromises. No peace process is ever simple, linear or without cost. But the only way to achieve lasting peace is through negotiations between parties. Ireland and our European Union partners have made consistently clear that we will not recognize any changes to the pre-1967 borders, including those with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties. We, as an international community, must again ask the leaders on both sides of this conflict to sit down, face to face, without delay. We must restate that a negotiated peace agreement, based on two States, will command unprecedented support, goodwill and an international determination to assist and protect and defend that peace with all the means at our disposal.\nIn the absence of progress on the ground, we in this Hall have a collective responsibility to bring forward ideas drawing on our own experience to try to create and maintain momentum. On our own island, well before the negotiations that led to the Good Friday Agreement, we established a permanent secretariat to sit in continuous session, and it still sits today. Such structures can allow for the continuity of even the smallest achievements, the transcendence, too, of what might appear to be impossible differences, and the emergence of original proposals.\nThe challenges facing the international community today, interconnected and truly global as they are, are numerous, but none is more urgent than climate action. The devastating impact of Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas tells us that the need for action is staring us in the face. We must show solidarity and support for the Bahamas and all countries on the front lines of the climate emergency that we are now experiencing. Climate change is moving so much faster than the efforts we are expending or enlisting to address it. Climate action is essential, of course, if we are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. The cost of inaction is catastrophic, far greater than what it will cost us to set out on a truly meaningful, corrective path. With the Paris Agreement, we have both the framework and the foundations to move forward.\nThe debate on climate action in some respects has not only continued to provide hope for those of us who place our faith in the multilateral system. It has been revelatory in demonstrating how global issues can be inclusive and how the voices of the small and less powerful can hold sway and provide such a powerful lead. In this regard, the role being played by, for example, small island developing States (SIDS) is exemplary. Drawing on their expertise and their stark experience, small island developing States have led the debate on climate change. As President of Ireland, I say to the representatives of small island developing States that they are challenging the status quo with very good reason, because their cultures and their very existence are at risk. They have a unique moral authority to speak out, for they are paying an immediate and intolerable price for a problem they did not create.\nThe international community must recognize vulnerability and value it as a driver for action. The commitments set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are collective commitments. That is where the strength of the United Nations lies. But our greatest challenge is in delivering the consciousness and the will to realize that the damaging, dysfunctional connection with which we have lived for four decades now between ecology, economy and society has brought us to the edge of a precipice. We need a paradigm shift in our thinking as to how we will combine ecology, economy and social life so as to be able to meet the greatest of human needs.\nThat connection with which we have lived for so long has not only been exploitive, it has failed on its own terms. We must embrace the paradigm shift that is necessary if we are to achieve the sustainability to which we committed in 2015 here in New York. We must see and promote the connection between the measures needed to respond to climate change, measures that will end the exclusions of global poverty and also meet the sufficiency needs of a global community in terms of food, nutrition, education, health and housing.\nWe will need to work together to muster the moral, intellectual and political courage to prevail in that to which we have committed to achieving, in the full knowledge that we will be opposed, at times divided, and that attempts to undermine us will be made by powerful, heavily resourced interests that cannot be held to account and that can purchase media space, interests that have often stolen concepts and language itself and that will seek to do so again.\nWe must all, both North and South on our shared vulnerable planet, muster the courage to take action. After all, even allowing for scientific innovations and improvements, we will have to make radical changes in the way we live, particularly those of us in the North. We cannot go on consuming as we are doing now, in which we are being consumed by our insatiable consumption.\nThere are grounds for hope for our making an appropriate response, I suggest. In many respects, and in so many places, the people have been giving public leadership in their response to assessments of the seriousness of the situation facing the global environment. Young people in particular have shown courage, innovation and resolve.\nI agree with Secretary-General Guterres when he says that schoolchildren have grasped the urgency of climate action better than some global leaders. Having accepted the science, with which they are now more familiar than older generations, and understanding the consequences of our present models, they see not just the prospect of their futures but the ways of life and the biodiversity on which our planet\u2019s life depends disappearing due to inaction and short-term thinking.\nYoung people and citizens of all generations are asking us now for more than a reassuring verbal response to climate change. They are seeking that authenticity that is revealed when words are turned into action. The citizens made aware are our allies for hope, responsibility and change. It is wrong to ask the United Nations as an institution to carry alone the burden of an authenticity that is the responsibility of us all. That responsibility is on all of us as leaders and citizens to encourage those with whom we share this fragile planet to create a yearning for that \u201cvast and endless sea\u201d of which the French writer Saint-Exupery spoke \u2014 a yearning for peace, justice and freedom for all from fear.\nThe challenges are enormous. So many young people worldwide are not allowed to achieve fulfilment, in employment, education or training. One in four are affected by conflict or violence. Millions of girls become mothers while they are still children themselves. We must create an environment in which young people, all of our people, are seen as citizens with equal rights and as members of our societies with full rights of participation.\nYoung people are now at the leading edge of the rapid technological revolution we are living through, and this is important, for much of the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and other international commitments can be delivered only with technological steps forward. For this to happen, we must ensure that technological advances serve all of humankind and that societies and their needs are the arrows, not the targets, for technology and its applications.\nWhile technologies have made the world more connected, we can also witness the ways in which they can be misused to spread xenophobia or hateful rhetoric. It is essential that the fruits of new science and technology be used for the promotion and preservation of peace and not for a renewed pursuit and prosecution of war. This calls for a global-level institutional initiative that is effective and accountable in a multilateral way.\nIreland seeks to demonstrate its commitment to multilateralism in many practical ways. In the field of peacekeeping today there are more than 600 Irish Defence Forces personnel, women and men, deployed in United Nations missions, including more than 450 women and men on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. United Nations peacekeeping has deep public support in Ireland, and we are proud as a people to be the highest per capita European Union contributor of troops to United Nations peacekeeping, with deployments to missions across the Middle East and Africa.\nIreland also remains strongly committed to the development work of the United Nations while, of course, realizing that development has to be redefined to adjust to new circumstances of sustainability. It cannot be an introduction or an extension of what is failing.\nTo give direction to our commitment, we launched a new international development policy with a realigned focus on four priorities: gender equality, climate action, good governance and the combat against poverty, all to be delivered within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nAn important element of our development policy is a small island developing States strategy, developed following research and consultation with our SIDS counterparts. It was an honour for me, as President of Ireland, to meet in Ireland with more than 30 Permanent Representatives of small island developing States when the strategy was launched earlier this year.\nIreland\u2019s development policy also focuses heavily on humanitarian assistance and responses that are urgent and cannot be postponed. We will continue contributing to fragile and conflict-affected States with the goal of easing the plight of civilians in such places as the Central African Republic, Palestine, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen, and elsewhere. As we do so, we acknowledge that this is a response to what is urgent and cannot be postponed. We do not see humanitarian response as an alternative to the deep structural changes we need in relation to trade, debt, technology transfer and migration. They are simply inextricably intertwined.\nAs for migration, how we respond to the needs of those forced to leave their homes due to conflict and instability is a moral test of our times and our common humanity. I had the pleasure recently of hosting the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, in Ireland. I introduced him to four families that have sought refuge in Ireland. At that meeting, at which Mr. Grandi once again spelled out the vital work that his Office is doing, all of us present were reminded that we are challenged to give authentic expression to what we mean by hospitality and to give meaning by our actions to our words.\nI am very conscious of the fact that the most acute poverty is in zones of conflict and that displacement of our fellow global citizens is increasing, whether because of conflict, climate change or ethnic prejudice and hate. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees tells us that almost 71 million people have been forcibly displaced from their homes worldwide, with 26 million cross-border refugees.\nIt is important that the United Nations and all of us acknowledge the generosity of the many States that shoulder a heavy burden on the front line of this issue, States such as Bangladesh, Chad, Ethiopia, Iran, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Pakistan, Turkey and Uganda. The peoples of these States humble us all by hosting great numbers of persons displaced by conflict in their neighbourhood regions, and in its turn Ireland will continue to support refugees and those vulnerable host communities that have set a worthy example, reminding us of what shared humanity should mean.\nI applaud the leadership that Secretary-General Guterres continues to show on migration. Migration is central to our Irish consciousness. We are a migrant people on a migrant planet. We have always been so \u2014 from our origin, through our Great Famine, and into the modern period. Our country, which has historically seen people leave in their millions, is now a country of net immigration. Today, one in six of our population was born outside Ireland. We have been transformed from a place that people were forced to leave to one that now has the opportunity to be a real place of welcome.\nI fully agree with the Secretary-General when he says that the only way for migration to be sustainable and safe rather than irregular and inhumane and dangerous is for it to be undertaken out of volition and not necessity, which means having integrated policies. The vast majority of the world\u2019s migrants move between countries in a safe and orderly way. However, unregulated migration exacts a terrible human cost in lives lost at sea and across deserts and lives ruined at the hands of traffickers, unscrupulous employers and other exploiters. But then, too, how rarely it is that we hear of the positives, for example, the contribution of migrants to the economies and societies of so many Member States, or that 10 to 12 per cent of the global gross domestic product in any one of the last years was provided by migrants.\nBut whether their movement is voluntary or forced, all human beings must have their dignity upheld. A starting point for all of us \u2014 as the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (resolution 73/195) makes clear \u2014 is that in a world where so much of migration is made inescapable and necessary, it must be well managed and safe, not irregular and dangerous, which is something that can be achieved with goodwill and cooperation.\nThis session of the General Assembly will see some key moments for disarmament. We will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation Nuclear Weapons (NPT) at its tenth Review Conference. Proud of Ireland\u2019s role in developing the NPT, I reiterate our commitment to a successful Review Conference in 2020. I hope that it sets a level of ambition for the total elimination of nuclear weapons, the only guarantee of our safety. It is for this reason that Ireland is a strong supporter of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\nOne of the greatest challenges we are facing today as global policymakers is how to anticipate and deal with such complex risks as those associated with new weapon technologies. While such advances in science and technology as artificial intelligence are progressing rapidly, with countless potential benefits to society, the international community must recognize and respond to the risks and threats posed by the incorporation of these new and emerging technologies into weapons and weapons systems. It is difficult for me to reconcile the rhetoric for peace I formally hear from countries with the same countries\u2019 ever-increasing efforts aimed at acquiring a greater share of global armament sales.\nIreland is deeply concerned about the devastating impact of conflict on civilians. The protection of civilians and full compliance with international humanitarian law face new and greater challenges as warfare increasingly moves from open battlefields to urban settings. The use of explosive weapons in populated areas is a particular cause for concern. Ireland is proud to lead efforts to agree a political declaration among States, setting out how we as an international community can ensure full compliance with international humanitarian law. Indeed, I look forward to inviting States to Ireland next spring to agree on a political declaration focusing on the protection of civilians from the effects of explosive weapons in urban warfare.\nLike many Member States, Ireland is also clear on the need to reform the Security Council. For any entity to have legitimacy, it must reflect the make-up of the world in which it exists and the people of the world in which it exists. Quite simply, as we all know, many areas of the world are either insufficiently represented on the Security Council or not at all. In particular, we continue to witness the historically unjust underrepresentation of Africa, which was still ruled by colonial Powers when the United Nations came into existence and the Security Council was established. We have heard so many powerful speeches from an Africa that wants to be an Africa that can be humane. I think Africans must be allowed to have a fair say in Council decisions affecting their own continent.\nWe also want to see consideration of a designated role for small island developing States. The increasing effect of climate change on international peace and security gives this proposal even greater urgency.\nAnd just as the Security Council should reflect the composition of the United Nations membership, I want to repeat Ireland\u2019s deeply held view that political reform of the Council must lead to a greater sense of participation, responsibility and ownership among the membership, something that we believe would be a positive for the functioning of the United Nations more widely, as well as more just. As we have said before, if the power of evidence and argument is to mean anything, then Ireland will keep trying to build a coalition for change.\nIreland will always value how the United Nations brings and can bring out what is best in us. We will continue to seek opportunities to test ourselves against what we aspire to be, including the achievement of the requirements of a new paradigm that combines ecology, social justice and economy \u2014 to which I would add cultural diversity \u2014 in a way that achieves sustainability and social cohesion and sufficiently meets global needs. These are the values that are the driving force behind Ireland\u2019s candidacy for the Security Council for the 2021-2022 term.\nWe do not seek the support of the nations of the world to advance any narrow version of enlightened self-interest. We seek support for the opportunity to once again be measured against aspiration, by the ideals of the Charter and our ability to contribute and help shape societies seeking to achieve equality, deepen democracy, build an enduring peace, and do so with a shared purpose and a consistent transparent practice.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I have the pleasure of congratulating Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande and our brother country of Nigeria on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I want to assure him of the full support and cooperation of the delegation of the Sultanate of Oman in working for the success of this session. And I would like to express our appreciation to his predecessor, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for the manner in which she steered the work of the seventy-third session and the achievements during her presidency. We also express our appreciation for the efforts of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to strengthen the role of the United Nations and developing its mechanisms.\nThe United Nations is mandated with various tasks, including maintaining international peace and security, addressing international challenges and conflicts, working diligently to settle disputes through preventive diplomacy, deploying efforts to achieve peace and stability in the world by promoting confidence-building measures and resolving differences through diplomacy, as laid down in the Charter of the United Nations. My country believes that dialogue and negotiations are the most appropriate means for resolving differences. We have always affirmed that Oman and other countries will make joint efforts and use their good offices to support regional and international initiatives that will help achieve peace and promote a culture of security and stability in the region. In the Sultanate of Oman we believe that peace is a central building block for stability and sustainable development. Accordingly, we hope that international relations can be restarted on a new footing and based on the principles of good-neighbourliness, respect for national sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, with a view to building a world of justice, fairness, coexistence and tolerance for all in which everyone can enjoy prosperity, security and stability.\nAchieving peace in the Middle East has become an imperative. It is high time to put out the fires in the region. Those raging fires pose a threat to international peace and security and enormous economic, social and security challenges for the peoples of the region. They have created many problems, including violence, extremism, terrorism and a continued and unprecedented wave of displacement and migration to various parts of the world. We believe that the United Nations and the international community must take serious steps to build a regional and international consensus and support peaceful efforts to end instability in the region. From this rostrum, we also call on all disputing parties to look to the future and to rise above their differences, prioritize their ultimate national interests and adopt political and diplomatic approaches that safeguard the unity and cohesion of countries and their peoples\u2019 dignity, security and decent livelihoods. In that regard, we welcome the peaceful political agreements that have been reached in the sisterly Republic of the Sudan and the signing of documents on transitional civilian authority, which should help to achieve peace, security and stability for our brother people of the Sudan. We also highly appreciate the regional mediation efforts that have led the Sudanese parties to this great national achievement.\nThe Sultanate of Oman is concerned about maritime traffic in the Strait of Hormuz, as we are one of two countries bordering the Strait, which is considered one of the most important in the world. As a matter of fact, some of its shipping lanes are within our territorial waters. Given Oman\u2019s national sovereignty and international responsibilities with regard to ensuring the vital issue of the safety of maritime traffic and ships in the Strait of Hormuz, the Sultanate of Oman calls on all countries to cooperate constructively and respect its navigational separation lines, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, particularly articles 37 and 38, which cover the right to continued transit passage, and article 39, which sets out the duties of ships during transit passage.\nWe also call on all parties to avoid escalation and resolve differences through diplomatic means, thereby avoiding any repercussions for the region that could endanger freedom of navigation, international trade and the world economy. We believe that the international community and States with an interest in using the Strait of Hormuz should strive to find peaceful compromise solutions as the best way of maintaining the stability and safety of maritime navigation and more secure and effective than any other arrangements.\nThe ongoing conflict and war in Yemen and the failure of the warring parties to reach a political settlement to end it have resulted in a humanitarian, economic and social situation for Yemenis that is both tragic and unprecedented in the country\u2019s history, and one that must compel us all to redouble our political, diplomatic and humanitarian efforts to help Yemen put an end to the increasingly complex armed conflict. Oman supports every effort aimed at reaching a political solution in Yemen, particularly those of the United Nations and the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, Mr. Martin Griffiths. We call on all the parties to cooperate and engage positively with those efforts. The emphasis for the next phase should be on the political track, with a view to reaching a political settlement that can ensure security and stability in our brother country of Yemen and preserve the security and interests of its neighbours in the region. From this rostrum, we call on all the Yemeni parties to prioritize the country\u2019s best interests and urge Yemen\u2019s political leaders to take the initiative to end the conflict for the sake of Yemen and its good people. We also call on the countries of the region and the international community to support the efforts to restore peace and stability to Yemen in particular and the region in general.\nGiven our geographic proximity and deep historical, social and cultural ties with Yemen, we emphasize that Oman will continue to provide our brother people of Yemen with facilities and humanitarian assistance. We call on the international community and all parties concerned to undertake serious humanitarian efforts to enable humanitarian access to every region and province of the country, without exception or impediment, and to facilitate the use of all ports, airports and entry and exit points for that noble humanitarian purpose.\nThe establishment of a sovereign independent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem its capital is a compelling strategic requirement for achieving peace, stability and peaceful coexistence. An integrated vision for special relations between the Palestinian and Israeli parties, as well as their neighbours, should therefore be based on the values of peace, coexistence and common interest of all the peoples of the region, with a view to delivering security, peace and economic prosperity for all. We believe that failure to establish a Palestinian State will mean continued violence and terrorism. Cooperation between the international community and the relevant actors in creating the necessary conditions to end the more than 70 years of conflict is crucial to building a stable and prosperous new Middle East. Based on its steadfast position in support of peace and stabilization in the region, the Sultanate of Oman is prepared to make every effort and cooperate with the international parties in order to ensure that negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis are resumed and to support efforts leading to an agreement on a two- State solution, which would contribute to security and stability in the region.\nSustainable development is one of the most important pillars of Oman\u2019s vision for the future and consecutive five-year development plans, which are an extension of the values and principles of sustainability as a means of achieving lasting equality, justice and peace in Omani society, as clearly reflected in our basic law. In that regard, my country was an active partner in all the international and regional forums, deliberations and dialogues that resulted in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Oman has sought to implement its international obligation to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by setting up long-term policies and strategies and mid- and short-term plans and programmes that have become a fundamental component of our ninth five-year plan for the period from 2016 to 2020 and of Oman Vision 2040. Against that backdrop, in July my country submitted its first voluntary national review on the Sustainable Development Goals, commended by all thanks to our positive development indicators.\nIn conclusion, my country renews its call to all countries of the world to adhere to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law in order to resolve their differences through peaceful and diplomatic means. We also call for a bigger role for the United Nations and regional and international organizations in resolving disputes, consolidating international peace and security and promoting a culture of peace and tolerance, with the aim of sparing humankind the scourges of war and conflict that undermine the aspirations of our peoples to peace, stability, well-being and prosperity."

        "file_text": "It is my honour to address the General Assembly again on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Salva Kiir Mayardit, President of the Republic of South Sudan, who could not be present today given his busy schedule back at home. Our President is engaged in consolidating and streamlining the peace implementation process, as the pre-transitional period is ending soon and a new Government of National Unity will be formed by 12 November.\nI am honoured to be accompanied in my delegation by senior members of the political parties that are signatories to the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan. It is a demonstration of visionary leadership on the part of my President, who directed that they should be included in South Sudan\u2019s delegation to the General Assembly. I believe such an astute decision deserves recognition, as it is through cooperation among the leaders of South Sudan that a peaceful South Sudan can be realized and emerge as a beacon of hope and peace. To this end, I urge the international community and States Members of the United Nations to support the effort to bring the non-signatories to the peace agreement on board.\nThe Government and the people of the Republic of South Sudan wish to convey to the Government and the people of Zimbabwe, and the African Union, our heartfelt condolences on the loss of the iconic pan-African leader, Mr. Robert Gabriel Mugabe. His revolutionary role and dedicated statesmanship, in the solidarity movement in particular, will live on as a highlight of his exceptional legacy.\nI would like to congratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, and the Federal Republic of Nigeria on holding this position for the second time. The Republic of South Sudan affirms its commitment to playing its role in supporting the implementation of the agenda the President has set for this historic session. The theme he has selected for this session \u2014 \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d \u2014 strongly resonates not only in my country, but throughout the world at large.\nPoverty remains endemic worldwide, and there are direct correlations between poverty, lack of education, unemployment and political instability. We are grateful for the commitments made by our development partners to reduce poverty in the Republic of South Sudan. More support is needed if we are to make an effective contribution towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The Government of the Republic of South Sudan has initiated different programmes, policies and development initiatives to address and alleviate poverty.\nOn climate change, the Government of the Republic of South Sudan has updated its nationally determined contribution and will embark on a clean development trajectory by investing in clean energy, by producing 1,000 megawatts of power from hydro, solar, wind and geothermal energy sources and enhancing the resilience of its people by embarking on a smart-climate approach to agriculture. The Government of the Republic of South Sudan is also planning to take part in the Great Green Wall project that is being spearheaded by the African Union to halt the advancement of the Sahara desert southwards. In addition to this, we have taken many steps towards implementing a programme to plant 100 million trees over a period of five years, which translates to approximately 20 million trees every year.\nI now wish to draw the attention of the Assembly and the African Union to the continued issue of Lake Chad drying up. An immediate solution is needed to resolve this problem. Getting more water into Lake Chad should be a priority for all of us. I firmly believe that, once there is more water in Lake Chad, the advancement of the Sahara Desert southwards will be significantly stemmed.\nWe firmly believe that, as Nelson Mandela stated, \u201ceducation is the most powerful weapon we can use to change the world\u201d. The Republic of South Sudan is using education to transform the lives of our children and youth. We are happy to announce that we are making progress in our national education policy, which addresses the issues of access, equity, gender parity and quality education, and we are intending to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 4 through these strategies. We have developed a new national curriculum, with school-based peace clubs as one of the key initiatives. We have trained 400 teachers as pedagogues in peace education and the prevention of violent extremism.\nWe wish to express our deep gratitude to our development partners, especially the United Kingdom Department for International Development, the European Union, the United States Agency for International Development, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the China International Development Cooperation Agency, Norway, the Netherlands, the World Food Programme, UNICEF, UNESCO, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Global Partnership for Education and the African Development Bank, among others, for their support for education in the Republic of South Sudan. Nevertheless, we still face many challenges and we need the support of the international community to enable us to continue expanding access to education to the millions of children who are still not in school.\nOn the peace-implementation process, I would like to highlight some of the successes that we have seen on the path to peace and stability. Last year, I stood here representing a country that many sceptics considered to be on the brink of deteriorating into violent conflict, doubting whether the peace agreement would hold or not (see A/73/PV.12). It is my distinct pleasure to inform the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly that the Republic of South Sudan is heading towards lasting peace and stability. This is demonstrated by the ongoing implementation process of the Revitalized Peace Agreement and the willingness of all parties to work in Juba towards a permanent resolution of the conflict in the Republic of South Sudan.\nI wish to inform the Assembly of a historic spiritual retreat for all South Sudanese leaders at the Vatican at the invitation of His Holiness Pope Francis. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the former Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland were also in attendance. The retreat gave fresh impetus to the quest to restore peace and stability in the Republic of South Sudan.\nThe prayers did not stop in Rome; the leaders of the South Sudan Council of Churches and the South Sudan Islamic Council are leading the diverse faith groups in the healing and reconciliation process and are providing spiritual guidance as we implement the peace agreement. On 19 September, the Government of the Republic of South Sudan held a national day of prayer in the spirit of supporting this critical process of national healing and reconciliation. I wish to commend the role being played by spiritual leaders, in particular the Archbishop of the Catholic Church in Juba, Paulino Lukudu Loro; the Moderator of the South Sudan Presbyterian Church, the Right Reverend Peter Gai Lual Marrow; and Right Reverend Justin Badi Arama of the Episcopal Church of South Sudan. In addition, I also wish to commend the role of Sheikh Juma Saeed Ali, the Presidential Adviser on Islamic Affairs, as well as the leadership of the South Sudan Islamic Council and all religious and spiritual leaders within the Republic of South Sudan.\nThe successful face-to-face meeting, held in a friendly atmosphere between President Salva Kiir Mayardit and Mr. Riek Machar in Juba earlier this month, offered an opportunity to deliberate on critical pending issues to pave the way for the formation of the new Government of National Unity by 12 November. The engagement of the different stakeholders is critical to the success of the peace agreement in the Republic of South Sudan. The visit of Mr. Riek Machar and his delegation in Juba last month was a very important milestone and brought much-needed confidence to the leaders of the different political parties and the citizens of the Republic of South Sudan. This is a move in the right direction towards achieving lasting peace.\nSince the signing of the Revitalized Peace Agreement, the overall security situation in the Republic of South Sudan is stable. The Government and the parties to the agreement have worked diligently within the various mechanisms set up under the National Pre-transitional Committee to implement the provisions of the Revitalized Peace Agreement. In this context, the Chief of the South Sudan People\u2019s Defence Forces and the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army in Opposition are, together, leading and carrying out field visits to their respective forces to sensitize them about peace and prepare them for life in cantonments, which are now operational. Training centres have commenced their work as of 17 September, in accordance with the provisions of the Revitalized Peace Agreement.\nIn addition to the aforementioned peace initiatives, the national dialogue at various levels and grassroots, regional, national and people-to-people peace initiatives have made significant strides towards reconciliation and healing among the diverse communities in the Republic of South Sudan. The outcomes of the consultative dialogues held in the three regions of the Republic of South Sudan will soon be discussed at a national conference. It is our firm belief that the complementary three-track approach of the people-to-people peace initiatives, the national dialogue and the implementation of the peace agreement is the way to consolidate peace on the ground, ensure democracy and accountability and fight impunity in the Republic of South Sudan.\nSouth Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries and the internally displaced persons living in United Nations protection-of-civilians sites are voluntarily returning in large numbers to their respective States and homes. However, there is an urgent need to provide them with support mechanisms to ensure an easy transition and reintegration into their communities. This support includes transport for the returnees, the delivery of food to their respective areas, health care, clean water and educational services.\nOn humanitarian access, all indicators show that the humanitarian trend in the country has remarkably improved due to intensified collaboration between the Government, United Nations agencies and development partners. There are no longer delays in the delivery of humanitarian aid, as convoys are cleared instantly at the entry points.\nBefore I conclude, the Government and the citizens of the Republic of South Sudan would like to congratulate our brothers and sisters in the Republic of the Sudan for showing the patriotism and exemplary leadership needed to amicably resolve the political impasse that many feared would get out of hand. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the new Prime Minister of the Republic of the Sudan, His Excellency Mr. Abdalla Hamdok, for winning the confidence of the Transitional Military Council and the Forces for Freedom and Change to lead the interim Government. For the success of the interim Government in the Sudan, we call for the lifting of all sanctions imposed against the Republic of the Sudan and the removal of the Republic from the list of countries supporting terrorism. We also call for the cancellation of all of the Sudan\u2019s debts and the normalization of trade and economic relations.\nI wish to take this opportunity to reiterate that we are one people in two independent countries, united through our historical, cultural and social ties. Accordingly, the Republic of South Sudan will always seek to maintain a very strong relationship with the Sudan. This reality led His Excellency Mr. Salva Kiir Mayardit, President of the Republic of South Sudan, to take it upon himself to facilitate peace talks between the Government of the Sudan and the Sudanese armed opposition groups. A road map to realize this effort was signed in Juba on 12 September. Further peace negotiations between the parties are scheduled to commence in Juba on 14 October for a final peace settlement.\nWe look forward to working with the new Government of the Republic of the Sudan in addressing the pending issues in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 2005. Chief among those issues are the demarcation of our common border and the settlement of the final status of Abyei. The Government of the Republic of South Sudan is gravely concerned about the security situation in Abyei. We applaud and appreciate Security Council resolutions 2445 (2018) and 2469 (2019). We have considered most of the Secretary-General\u2019s recommendations for the reconfiguration of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) and for charting an exit strategy. We are still looking forward to the implementation of the provisions of the aforementioned resolutions, and especially urge the Secretary-General to accelerate the appointment of a civilian deputy head of mission for UNISFA. In this regard, we repeat our request to the African Union Peace and Security Council and the United Nations Security Council to finally endorse the African Union High-level Implementation Panel proposal of 21 September 2012 on Abyei. In seeking support and backing from the Security Council in this matter, we urge it to expedite its work towards determining the final status of Abyei.\nIn conclusion, the President of the Republic of South Sudan, His Excellency Mr. Salva Kiir Mayardit, is fully committed to the implementation of the signed Revitalized Peace Agreement. Together with the parties to the Revitalized Peace Agreement, the President is ready to form a new Government of National Unity on 12 November. The Transitional Government of National Unity will continue to consolidate peace, including preparations for the elections scheduled at the end of the transition period. We call upon the Assembly to extend its much-needed support to the new incoming Government.\n"

        "file_text": "The world in which we live today is indeed complex, sometimes chaotic, uncertain and unpredictable. It faces mounting challenges, including protracted conflicts, persistent poverty and hunger, terrorism and violent extremism and a rapidly changing climate. Although democracy is prevalent as never before, its strength is being challenged and tested. Inequalities are deepening, global military spending and arms competition are increasing, and respect for international norms and institutions is weakening. Multilateralism is being challenged more than ever before. In short, sometimes it feels like we are living in the cold war era.\nBut that era is long over. Back then, diametrically opposed antagonistic ideologies led to existential standoffs. I want to repeat this: those standoffs were existential. Compared to that, in today\u2019s world, there is virtually no other existence-threatening enemy, except for terrorism and the climate emergency. If one looks at the foreign policy documents, constitutions and laws of the absolute majority of countries, it is clear that war and violence are prohibited. Today all countries generally pursue growth, progress and prosperity for their own people, within their own jurisdictions, through international cooperation.\nThis general situation, coupled with unprecedented levels of education and information saturation in the wider population, as well as science and technological progress, apparently makes us believe that our reason is unshakably strong and extremely unlikely to yield to irrational urges. As a result, when we delve today into provocative and adversarial territory in our international debates, we seem to have an underlying belief that they will not degenerate into violence or corrosive interactions. However, that may be mistaken overconfidence in our intellect, humanity and reason.\nWe should not forget that we remain at core social animals. Aggression and anger triggers counter- aggression and angry responses. In addition to that, more than ever before we are vulnerable to the anger and frustration of a few multiplying and exploding into mass frustration due to our interconnectedness through the social media. We should always be mindful of that unique and unchartered territory. We have yet to fully understand the social change that the information age is generating. On top of all the aforementioned realities that we do not yet understand, we should not forget that we have piles of nuclear weapons that can put an end to all our differences, once and for all, along with all the virtues that life has to offer.\nThat is not the way we want to settle our differences. Indeed, after living in the world for about 30 years without an enemy \u2014 in the full nuclear sense \u2014 we are used to taking global peace for granted. We therefore often do little to control our rhetoric, as far as its potential to trigger animosity is concerned. However, in today\u2019s environment, we should not overestimate the strength of our reason and underestimate the threat posed by our animal instincts.\nThe world as we know it today is no masking its true nature through apparent political correctness. It is increasingly unveiling its rigidity and roughness with honesty, which reminds us to calm down and reassess the existing risks and dangers. In the light of the foregoing, we ought to realize that compared to the cold war era, our present world is a brotherhood of nations. If we accept to respect and understand each other before anything else, there are no differences today that we cannot overcome.\nOver this past high-level week, the international community gathered to unite in its resolve to speed up the collective action towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and addressing the climate emergency. Mongolia strongly supports the pledge to make the coming decade one of action and delivery by supporting the most vulnerable and coming first to the aid of those who are the furthest behind.\nI wish to applaud the leadership of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for hosting the Climate Action Summit earlier this week. The summit proved instrumental in building the momentum to turn the tide in the climate emergency, as 77 countries, along with over 100 cities, committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Seventy countries pledged to boost their nationally determined contributions by 2020, and a dozen Governments doubled their contributions to the Green Climate Fund.\nScience tells us that any temperature increase greater than 1.5\u00b0C would lead to catastrophic and irreversible damage to the ecosystem that supports us. Like many other developing countries, Mongolia has contributed the least to global warming. Yet, in Mongolia, over the past 80 years, annual mean temperatures have increased by 2.26\u00b0C. As a result, 77 per cent of our territory has been affected by desertification and land degradation. Over the past 40 years, the permafrost area has shrunk less than half of what it was, and more than 800 lakes have dried up. Given the fact that over 80 per cent of rural people\u2019s livelihoods depend on nature, climate change is already having a devastating impact on our people, our lives and our economy.\nFor its part, Mongolia is faithfully fulfilling its nationally determined contribution to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by 14 per cent. Furthermore, a more ambitious nationally determined contribution target, along with sound climate-change legislation and policies, is being developed. Mongolia has abundant solar and wind power resources and aims at increasing the share of renewable energy in its energy mix to 30 per cent, up from the current 3 per cent, by 2030. To this end, the Government has introduced feed-in tariffs for wind, solar and hydropower energy and is working to refine the relevant legislation in support of renewable energy. We are also working to set up a multilateral institution for electricity-grid interconnections to ensure energy security, job creation and the reduction of carbon-dioxide emissions in North-East Asia by tapping into its wind- and solar-energy potential.\nMongolia is willing to contribute not only to energy security, but also to peace and security in North-East Asia. Back in the early 1980s, Mongolia first proposed the idea of creating a regional-security dialogue mechanism. Later in 2000, we proposed to have an informal meeting of foreign ministers of the North- East Asian countries at the margins of the Ministerial meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum to start discussing the least contentious issues. At that time, some countries were not ready to start engaging in such a format. Perhaps now is a time more conducive to exploring such opportunities, which is why I reiterated our proposal at the last ASEAN Regional Forum Ministerial meeting, held on 2 August, in Bangkok.\nMongolia is indeed the only country in North- East Asia that does not have any unresolved issues \u2014 territorial or political \u2014 with other countries in the region or any other country in the world. Our aim is to provide a neutral ground for constructive dialogue and engagement. I am pleased to note that the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security, which Mongolia has hosted annually since 2014, is evolving into an open and inclusive mechanism for facilitating talks, promoting mutual understanding and confidence-building, and searching for room for compromise when necessary. Its agenda has also expanded to cover both traditional security issues and those related to energy, infrastructure, green growth, investment and humanitarian cooperation.\nThe overall security situation in North-East Asia remains complex. As a country whose nuclear- weapon-free status is well-recognized, Mongolia stands for a denuclearized Korean peninsula and welcomes the series of recent high-level summits between the main stakeholders. I join others in underscoring the importance of a continued dialogue, the implementation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea-United States joint statement and the relevant Security Council resolutions. In this context, I would also like to express my support for the idea proposed on 24 September by President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea to transform the demilitarized zone into an international peace zone (see A/74/PV.3).\nAchieving sustainable development for the people and the planet will not be smooth or easy. But we are all in this together. The heightened interdependence of the human family requires an effective global partnership to secure our common future. The full implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-2024 needs to be closely aligned with the SDGs and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development. We expect that its five-year review in December will come up with an ambitious road map for accelerating its implementation.\nThe landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) continue to face considerable challenges that are inherently linked to their geographical handicap. As a result, they remain largely marginalized in the context of global trade. Their combined share of global exports declined from 1.2 per cent in 2014 to 0.98 per cent in 2018, with commodities accounting for the bulk of their exports. Increased international assistance for export diversification, value addition, infrastructure development, institutional and productive capacity- building, and better market access remain essential for the LLDCs. Mongolia is proud to contribute to South-South cooperation by promoting the interests of LLDCs and through its participation in establishing the International Think Tank for Landlocked Developing Countries in 2006. Today this Ulaanbaatar-based think tank is actively engaging in global dialogues on related issues by providing evidence-based advisory services and organizing regional and international workshops. I wish to invite all States Members and development partners to support the work of this centre of excellence. For its part, the Government of Mongolia has been contributing $100,000 annually to the institution over the past several years.\nIn these turbulent times, democracy has been tested in many corners of the world. Some countries are having a hard time managing a downward spiral, while others have been able to withstand such a trajectory and strengthen the power of their people. In 1990, nearly three decades ago, Mongolia made the historic choice to adopt democracy and a market economy. Although the road leading to a multiparty system, parliamentary democracy, free elections, open markets, human rights and the rule of law has been bumpy and ridden with knolls and holes, we have been able to build our democracy and are proud of its solid achievements.\nToday,\tour citizens enjoy human rights, fundamental freedoms, ownership of private property and freedom of expression and movement. Democracy has unleashed the inherent potential of individuals, and the private sector now accounts for over 80 per cent of our gross domestic product. Our access to information and right to assembly allow for greater transparency, online and offline social interaction, and freedom of speech. Moreover, in recent years, Mongolia has taken a host of measures aimed at strengthening merit-based professional civil service, cutting red tape, promoting the rule of law and fighting corruption head-on. Globally, Mongolia has been proud to chair such various representative international entities as the International Conference of New or Restored Democracies, the Community of Democracies and the Freedom Online Coalition and share with others its lessons learned in democratic consolidation.\nThere is no doubt that democracy needs to be nurtured as we move forward with its consolidation. Accordingly, governance reform issues, including better checks and balances, securing the independence of the judiciary and greater authority for local and municipality levels, are being broadly discussed as our Parliament considers amendments to our 1992 Constitution. It is of paramount importance that we encourage the active involvement of all people in this exercise. The Parliament is set to decide on a national referendum on the constitutional amendments. I could not agree more with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres when, in his message to the people and the Government of Mongolia on the International Day of Democracy \u2014 on the eve of the thirtieth anniversary of our democratic transition \u2014 he urged all Governments to respect the right to active, substantive and meaningful participation.\nThe world today is home to 1.8 billion young people \u2014 the largest generation of young people in history. Young people are a source of new ideas, innovation, energy and dynamism. The constructive engagement of young generations in addressing global issues is critical. This point was vividly demonstrated last weekend when millions of young people marched in the global climate strike to demand climate justice, action and accountability. Their resolve helped to boost the momentum at the Climate Action Summit.\nWith a view to better utilizing social media to promoting a culture of peace, non-violence and tolerance among youth, in April in Ulaanbaatar, my Ministry organized a unique forum called the Peacebook Forum, in collaboration with Facebook. In addition, in June, my Ministry, together with the United Nations, hosted the first-ever North-East Asia workshop on youth, peace and security. The participants at the workshop highly appreciated our initiative to publish a completely digital peacebook journal of international relations. This journal would disseminate and publicize research works on global issues by scholars and peacebuilders from around the world. Young people would benefit from such a journal because it would promote a culture of peace, increase tolerance, encourage intercultural and interreligious dialogue and enhance the voice and participation of youth in decision-making in the prevention and resolution of conflicts. Furthermore, in our efforts to encourage critical, analytical, scholarly and academic thinking on global peace and security issues among young people, we have also proposed the creation of a competitive award called the Peace, Progress, Prosperity Promise Award to spur scholarly research. As we advance all these initiatives, we will be working together with all of our interested partners, including the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Envoy on Youth.\nAs we near the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, Mongolia reaffirms its unwavering commitment to serving the Organization, which is the centre of multilateralism. My delegation highly commends the Secretary-General\u2019s bold reforms of the peace and security pillar, in repositioning of the United Nations development system and in undertaking management and gender parity initiatives \u2014 all of which are designed to make the United Nations fit to meet the current manifold challenges. Our collective efforts must be redoubled to uphold and strengthen the capacity for multilateralism to promote peace, security and sustainable development, while also ensuring that no one and no country is left behind."

        "file_text": "Let me join previous speakers in congratulating His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I would like to assure him of our full cooperation in the discharge of his responsibilities, and I am confident that his wealth of experience and wisdom will prove invaluable in guiding us successfully through the current session. I also want to express Zambia\u2019s sincere gratitude to Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her exemplary work during the seventy-third session.\nThe theme for this session, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, presents an opportunity to re-examine our priorities, redefine our mission and sharpen our vision as we approach the seventy-fifth anniversary of this Organization. It is a call for us to generate an atmosphere in which the United Nations family can implement its priority programmes, especially in key areas such as alleviating poverty, in order to enhance the human condition throughout the world.\nThe eradication of poverty is feasible \u2014 we have seen remarkable progress across every dimension of poverty, while malnutrition and youth illiteracy have both substantially decreased. Such progress is gratifying but is still inadequate. One billion people continue to live in extreme poverty. If anything, the recent gains should spur us to do even more to finish the job and ensure that no child goes to bed hungry anymore. We must ensure that nobody is forced to choose between sending her daughter to school and sending her to work. Everybody has the opportunity to fully participate in their country\u2019s economic and civic life.\nZambia applauds the leadership that the United Nations provides in tackling climate change, as was illustrated only a few days ago by the hosting of the Climate Action Summit. Climate change frustrates efforts to raise the standards of living for the world\u2019s poor. Scientists have spoken and we have seen with our own eyes the devastating impact that climate change has had on our environment. Early this year, three of Zambia\u2019s neighbouring countries \u2014 Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe \u2014 were affected by cyclones. Not far away, half of Zambia experienced a severe drought that has since resulted in low crop productivity and low water levels for hydroelectricity generation. Therefore, opposite climatic extremes occur in the same neighbourhood.\nAs a consequence, Zambia is now scaling up its efforts to diversify energy production. Other priorities include increasing the adaptive capacity to reduce vulnerability and building resilience against extreme weather events, such as droughts and flooding. The impact of climate change requires global collaborative efforts and support for mitigation and adaptation strategies. As a developing country, Zambia needs assistance to enhance its capacity in key areas, such as scientific research, early warning, rapid response and the transfer of appropriate technologies to help cope with the negative impact of climate change.\nIn addition, scaling up global efforts to address climate change should certainly include providing increased accessibility to financial support, in particular for countries with limited resources, in order to enable them to make their fair contribution to the global effort and also bear the general climate-change-induced cost burdens. The need to secure and promote the well-being of wildlife flora and fauna as an environmental good for ecological and socio-economic benefit cannot be overemphasized.\nIn that regard, Zambia appreciates the hosting of the Elephant Summit initiative in Kasane, Botswana, in April this year, as well as Africa\u2019s Wildlife Economy Summit in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, in May this year, convened by the African Union and the United Nations Environment Programme. Those summits, among other things, recognized the need for partnerships with communities and the private sector as key in securing wildlife and enhancing economic benefits from wildlife. In our continued effort to support that cause, Zambia will host a follow-up summit in May 2020, in the tourism capital of Livingstone. I call upon our international collaborators to work with the countries of the region to achieve a successful outcome for our wildlife.\nOver the past years, Zambia has made important developmental efforts and we are determined to foster an all-inclusive development paradigm based on Agenda 2063 of the African Union and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Barely one month ago, on 7 August, Zambia had the honour to host a launching ceremony in Lusaka for the Sustainable Development Goals Subregional Centre for Southern Africa. The establishment of the Centre underscored our collective resolve as Southern African countries to win the war against poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy, through the exchange of best practices and joint action. However, we must also keep in mind that most African countries were not able to attain the forerunner Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), mainly because of various challenges, including inadequate financial resources.\nIn our quest to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, the MDG trend is, unfortunately, likely to continue unless Africa devises more innovative ways of addressing its development challenges. The Centre in Lusaka will bring the initiative closer to home for our Southern African region. It will be a vehicle for facilitating engagement among Governments and other stakeholders to accelerate the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals and for deepening regional integration.\nMy Government attaches great importance to the needs and welfare of all, with a specific focus on women, children and youth. To that end, Zambia\u2019s seventh national development plan has targeted the most vulnerable members of society to enhance their capacity to be involved in the country\u2019s economic and social life, in an effort to raise their standards of living. My Government has taken steps in that regard to ensure that there is equitable access to quality education for all Zambians, by providing universal basic education within the shortest realistic time frame.\nA comprehensive programme of health reforms is also under way and that should also result in the improvement of the well-being of our people. However, the measures and programmes that the Government has undertaken are not enough to fully attain the objectives of those programmes of action, mainly due to limited financial resources. We call on all partners to join efforts. Together, let us help to improve the lives of our peoples.\nThe horrifying shadows of poverty are darkened even further for Africa\u2019s refugee children. Zambia is a plateau of peace and a home to many refugees. We appeal to the United Nations and other humanitarian organizations of the world to help us share that burden. Together, we can restore dignity and help look after refugees.\nZambia continues to make tremendous strides in the campaign to end child marriage. We have also continued in that regard to engage traditional leaders to reform traditions and customs that promote child marriage. Currently, we are in the process of harmonizing statutory and customary law on marriage to prohibit early marriages. We are also repealing several discriminatory and outdated statutes related to children in order to come up with a children\u2019s code to domesticate the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nAs a designated African Union Champion on Ending Child Marriage, I am encouraged that the campaign is growing from strength to strength. However, much more needs to be done. We call on all partners to join efforts and together, let us raise our voices to protect our children and young people.\nPeace, security and the rule of law continue to be the basis for the meaningful development of any society. In keeping with that understanding, Zambia was, for a year, until last month, Chair of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation. In that role, Zambia contributed to the regional mechanism on conflict prevention and peacebuilding efforts.\nAs a State party to several international instruments aimed at countering the threat of proliferation, Zambia hosted a SADC regional awareness meeting on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004). The resolution is a vital element in the global architecture to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons to non-State actors, including terrorists. If properly implemented worldwide, it stands as a major contributor to preventing possible humanitarian, political, economic and environmental catastrophes should any of those weapons be used to cause large-scale casualties and suffering. It is clear that such a possibility is not just theoretical.\nThe spectre of international terrorism has, in recent times, assumed a dangerous momentum of its own. Terrorism does not discriminate between combatants and non-combatants. Innocent bystanders have to bear the brunt of that scourge. To protect human life, the international community should continue to seriously address that vice. The Assembly must expedite its conclusion of the long-overdue comprehensive Convention of the Organization of the Islamic Conference on Combating International Terrorism.\nIn our pursuit of the fight against terrorism, the Zambian Government has recently established an anti-terrorism centre, a national body that includes all national stakeholders, to coordinate the counter-terrorism efforts of individual security agencies, in keeping with the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations remains the only multilateral institution capable of addressing the challenges of our \u201cone world\u201d. The world looks to the Organization to encourage dialogue among civilizations on all global challenges in an inclusive manner, which offers the only practical way to ensure meaningful and effective international cooperation.\nTo be effective and efficient, there is a need to reform the United Nations, as we will over the coming year in commemoration of its 75 years of existence, and to reflect on its future.\nZambia believes that in the context of the evolution of the United Nations, the time has come for meaningful reform, including of the Security Council, which should be representative, democratic and accountable to all Member States, irrespective of status. That is essential for its integrity as the custodian of international peace. Given that Africa constitutes the second largest block of United Nations membership, proposals to reform the Security Council should heed Africa\u2019s call, as espoused in the Ezulwini Consensus.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Zambia\u2019s commitment to cooperate with the international community in addressing the numerous problems affecting our people, including in efforts to end poverty. We should not remain indecisive and indifferent to that serious issue, neither should we forgo this opportunity to make the world a better place for all humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin on a personal note by thanking the previous speaker, Charles Michel, who will be stepping down from the Belgian Government in a few months to take over the reins of the presidency of the European Council. I take this opportunity to wish him the best of luck as his neighbour in that endeavour that will occupy him for some years to come.\nAt the outset, I think we are all aware that the week under way here is remarkable in several respects \u2014 not only in the number of Member States participating, which continues to grow, but also the number of topics addressed during this week, whether in plenary, major meetings or in side events in parallel to the series of summits or high-level events.\nThis week is further notable for the unprecedented momentum to tackle specific challenges. I am referring, first and foremost, to the climate emergency, as reflected by the great many demonstrations in cities and towns in countries around the world. The activism of young people, together with the proliferation of initiatives by civil society, the private sector and intentional entities, is truly remarkable. We have all seen that over the past few days.\nHowever, it is through the actions of the men and women in Government that the momentum must find its expression in order to prevent an environmental, economic and ultimately geopolitical catastrophe. International security, growth, migration and human rights \u2014 not one of those areas is today unaffected by climate change, which becomes ever more alarming each year. The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change details the scale of the challenge and the urgent need for action. Only by cutting present global greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 followed by climate neutrality by 2050 will allow us to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nI was able to take the opportunity, for which I am grateful, on Monday during the Climate Summit to give an account of my country\u2019s contributions to collective efforts: first, we will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 55 per cent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels; secondly, we will increase the share of renewable energy in the mix we consume by 23 to 25 per cent by 2030; we will increase energy efficiency by 40 to 44 per cent by 2030; and thirdly, we will soon adopt a framework climate law aiming to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest.\nThose figures notwithstanding, most young people are frustrated because they believe such numbers are empty promises and will remain nothing more than numbers we proclaim. It is up to us to reassure our children that their future is secure. The hope and optimism of emerging generations also feed on their trust in their parents\u2019 actions. However, in the fight against climate change over the decades to come, young people are our allies, because they are never, on principle, opposed to change. Never. Youth brings change. It embodies change. For young people, change is a virtue; it is fundamentally positive. It is the way life is.\nWe understand that life is also about movement. When one is young and more so when one is no longer young, it is easy to note the importance of mobility. In Luxembourg, we decided to show that the fight against climate change can bring positive change and an improvement in the quality of life for all. We undertook an unprecedented landmark measure \u2014 free public transport at the national level for all buses, trams and trains, starting next year. Of course, we need an attractive, reliable and comfortable public transportation system. These are all challenges that we must overcome, and we are working on them.\nWith regard to international solidarity, for 2021-2025, Luxembourg will allocate \u20ac200 million for financial and technical assistance to combat climate change in developing countries, with priority given to the least developed countries and small island developing States. On an annual basis, that is twice the sum allocated in 2014-2020. A significant portion of those funds will go to the Green Climate Fund.\nLuxembourg will continue its efforts to create a favourable environment for green finance. In 2016, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange launched the Luxembourg Green Exchange, the first global listing platform dedicated exclusively to green bonds. In partnership with the European Investment Bank, also based in Luxembourg \u2014 which I sincerely thank for its collaboration \u2014 we created the Climate Finance Platform to increase our ability to leverage private investments in climate projects while mitigating their financial risk. We hope that, in the long-term, that this project will extend to the financing of the Sustainable Development Goals of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nAt the Summit held here yesterday and the day before, we discussed how critical financing is to meet those important Goals. That said, the contribution of States remains essential, especially in the area of financing for development. Another summit is being held on this subject in a room a few steps from here, where my country will present innovative initiatives, particularly in the field of investment vehicles with a social and environmental impact. The mobilization of private resources is a reality in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\nHowever, the most innovative mechanisms cannot compensate for the relative decline in public funding. For its part, Luxembourg will continue to devote 1 per cent of its gross national income to official development assistance, with a focus on the least developed countries. The funds allocated to international climate financing and to hosting refugees are additional to that, in accordance with the principle of additionality.\nFor years, we have remained convinced \u2014 and I know that the politics of cooperation just before elections, for some, is not very popular \u2014 that no matter what Administration is in power in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, investing in cooperation is the best preventive measure and the best investment that can be made. And we will continue to do so.\nThe five summit meetings being held this week on the margins of the general debate illustrate that the major challenges facing humankind can be addressed only within a universal and comprehensive framework. Nevertheless, there is a sense that multilateralism has, in other periods, been more successful than it is today. We see that, for example, in the fields of human rights, migration, security and trade. With regard to trade, for instance, the use of unilateral measures and countermeasures \u2014 often based on real concerns, but also often based on false pretexts \u2014 helps no one and drags us into a cycle that is dangerous to the entire international community. It is our people who, ultimately, end up losing out.\nIt is our duty, for the sake of our future, to relaunch multilateral formats. For our part, we have always been in favour of active, dynamic and rule-of-law multilateralism. This is natural for a small country with an open economy, but it is also an informed choice beyond the considerations of sovereignty alone. To the extent that we are able, we try to participate actively in the most committed forums in the pursuit of greater international cooperation. In that connection, to name but two examples, I note our participation in the High Ambition Coalition to fight climate change and our contribution to the Alliance for Multilateralism.\nThe European Union is one such push for multilateralism, which has enabled our continent to live in peace since 1957. Despite the limited conflict we have seen on the European continent, the members of the European Union have lived in peace since then. In that connection, the rise of populists in Europe is not helping. Conflicts, frozen or not, disputes between States and internal tensions among ethnic or religious groups persist in Europe. We cannot claim that Ukraine is now living in peace. The Caucuses and the Balkans are also rather tense. In other words, Europe is not in a position to lecture others on their actions. Nevertheless, it is important to be able to share and seek solutions together.\nTurning to the Middle East, the peace process is not improving, but rather is deteriorating year upon year. The prospects for a just and balanced peace are diminishing, along with the concept of a two-State solution. Recent developments in the context of the election campaign in Israel bear that out. At the same time, recent initiatives of an essentially bilateral nature, if they ever come to fruition, cannot replace the multilateral actors that confer international legitimacy on any negotiated solution.\nThe Middle East remains a source of serious concern. The wars in Syria and Yemen continue. We cannot never forget the suffering of civilians, the denial of humanitarian assistance and the flagrant, repeated and systematic violations of human rights in the region, which are our primary concern. But there are also other recent events, such as the attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. Let us therefore learn from our mistakes.\nAll actors in the region must help calm the situation and avoid escalation. That, of course, also applies to Iran, as well as to all other actors in the region. Tehran must also comply anew with all the provisions of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. My country, like the whole of the European Union, wants to believe that it is possible \u2014 even if it means broadening the scope \u2014 to make the 2015 agreement work. But if that is to happen, the United States and Iran must resume their dialogue.\nThe very volatile situation in the Middle East reminds us that contemporary crises are complex and have enormous explosive potential. Today, the mobile and instantaneous nature of communications have brought us closer to the misfortunes of all in a much more direct way. We must never forget that, beyond trade relations, direct investments and alliances, it is the destinies of individuals \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 that connect us all.\nThat is particularly true with regard to the situation in Libya, which is not improving. We see the ongoing difficulties that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ghassan Salame, continues to experience in bringing the parties to the table. It is crucial to reflect on how to resolve that situation. We know, too, that today it is impossible to tackle the situation in Libya without addressing the plight of the thousands of migrants from Africa, who must traverse the war-torn country in the hope of reaching Europe.\nI believe it is important to note that the ties between the African continent and mine are not limited to migration issues. Too often, there is a tendency to limit them to that issue. They never have been and never will be. Our ties are ancestral, forged by geographical and cultural proximity and by a common history, which has been painful at times and marked by the slave trade and colonialism, among other things. Today, my country\u2019s ties with the countries and peoples of the African continent are ties of friendship, solidarity and mutual respect. Luxembourg maintains particularly close links with the francophone West African countries.\nI would now like to say a few words about human rights worldwide. The situation on the ground is not good, and I am not referring only to conflict situations. It is also deteriorating with respect to gains that we thought had been consolidated and that are now systematically being called into question.\nIn conflict situations, the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war is a scourge that continues to strike throughout the world. We have seen this in equatorial Africa, in the Great Lakes region, in Iraq with Da\u2019esh and in the Balkans. This year, we organized a conference under the auspices of the Foundation of the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess to address this issue.\nThe situation of children in armed conflict also remains a source of great concern. The reports prepared by the United Nations are appalling. Although the Organization does not remain passive in such situations, Member States do not always understand the full consequences of their actions. Initiatives to reduce funding for human rights protection or children in armed conflict when deciding on funding for United Nations peacekeeping operations are hard hearted and difficult to justify.\nThose responsible for human rights violations in such situations must know that they too will one day be held accountable. Impunity cannot become the norm. The jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is not universal, but it is an integral part of the international system, and the Court\u2019s representatives must be able to travel and operate in that capacity without obstacles, including here in New York at United Nations Headquarters. When the ICC is unable to act, impartial and independent investigative mechanisms, such as those established by the General Assembly in the case of Syria and by the Human Rights Council in the case of Myanmar, provide an alternative.\nThe oppression of religious minorities and their lack of protection by the State have not been eliminated in the twenty-first century. In Asia, Africa, the Near and Middle East, countless women and men are persecuted. No distinction should be made between the rights of Christians, Jews or Muslims or members of any other faith. I know that Europe is not in a position to lecture others on this point. Barely seventy-five years after the liberation of the extermination camps in Europe, the European continent continues to have a duty to preserve and honour that memory, especially at a time when speeches invoke that same hatred, xenophobia, intolerance and anti-Semitism, which are all resurfacing in certain countries and in political speeches.\nIn January, we will commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by the Red Army. I do not know if anyone has visited Auschwitz, but I can say clearly that it changed me. In the camp, there are rooms filled with hair, rooms filled with glasses, rooms filled with prosthetic limbs, rooms filled with suitcases. Each item in these rooms was a life, a family. The people were condemned for being Jewish, for not espousing Nazi ideology, for being Gypsies, for being homosexuals, for being handicapped or simply being resisters. When I see that in certain countries there is a rise in revisionism, negationism, Nazism or Nazi ideology, I sometimes ask myself if we have ever truly learned anything from the Second World War.\nLet me also say how unacceptable it is for State resources to be increasingly used to silence those who have dedicated themselves to the protection of human rights or the protection of the environment or to reporting the news. The work carried out within the Human Rights Council in Geneva on this issue is decisive and includes testimonies. Unfortunately, it is not only compliance with human rights that is being challenged. In recent years, we have seen the very existence of certain rights being called into question. We must admit that this is even true within our Organization\u2019s forums, with regard to sexual and reproductive rights, which is adversely affecting programmes aimed at supporting the reproductive health of millions of women all over the world. I am convinced that this also applies to abortion and the right of every woman to make decisions about her own body.\nIn the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, a number of years ago women could still have an abortion for therapeutic reasons or if they are in distress. The law was changed. Abortion was no longer possible for women in distress or for therapeutic reasons. Women were forced to be interviewed by a panel of strangers. That law was changed immediately. I think that abortion is one of the most difficult decisions a woman must face. Every woman therefore needs to be heard and needs help. It is not the job of politics what is or is not good for her in this regard. It is a decision to be taken only after due reflection and help for the woman or couple concerned. It is not up to politics to say what is good for women, much less is it the job of men to decide what women should or should not do. This situation has become very difficult to tolerate and accept in 2020 \u2014 tomorrow \u2014 to tell the other sex what is good for her. The woman already has a difficult decision to make. Let us not make her life more difficult by trying to make them feel bad for making that decision.\nIn 2020, we will also celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Conference, which strengthened the Commission on the Status of Women. I sometimes wonder if today we would be able to renew the commitments undertaken on that occasion, when I hear the positions and statements of some people on the rights of women.\nThe same is true of the right to live according to one\u2019s sexual orientation. Here in New York, I was able to launch a debate on hate speech against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and inter sex persons. A lot of work remains to be done. Homosexuality is not a choice. It is time to accept it as it is. What is a choice is homophobia. Let us not forget that.\nThis year we are also commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, an almost universal convention. In this regard, I believe it is important to renew our commitments, including in the light of the developments that have taken place since its adoption, particularly in the field of climate and the digital economy.\nMy country\u2019s commitment to the promotion of human rights is part of its DNA, whether at the national, European or international level. It covers, without discrimination, the full range of rights recognized by our Organization, including economic and social rights. It is for these reasons that my country is a candidate for election as a member of the Human Rights Council for the period 2022-2024, for the first time since the Council was established. We count on the broad support of the General Assembly during the election in 2021.\nI do not want to miss this opportunity to remind the Assembly how important it is that our Organization, which alone can claim to represent the international community, and which, in a way, is the international community itself, adapt to the realities of today\u2019s world. The reforms initiated by the Secretary-General have made good progress. We must now translate them into action on the ground, particularly in terms of development and the organization of the security pillar.\nThe adaptation efforts of all components of the United Nations system is a prerequisite for the living and dynamic multilateralism that the world needs. That was clearly the original goal of the signatories to the Charter of the United Nations, whose seventy-fifth anniversary we will have the opportunity to celebrate next year. Seventy-five years is also when Auschwitz was liberated, as I said earlier, and also when my country was liberated by the Allies. And, as I stand in our host State, the United States, I am convinced that 99.9 per cent of the soldiers buried in the American cemetery in my country would not even have been able to find Luxembourg on a map. Nevertheless, they fought so that I could live in peace. I will never forget our gratitude to the Allies and our host country. Today, I can live in freedom and freely express my opinion. These cemeteries are proof that war leaves scars that do not heal. We must never forget that.\nThe summits and our debate this week have shown us that the United Nations is essential if we are to look to the future with clarity and address the challenges facing humankind today. My country is ready. The European Union is ready. Together with our partners in the international community, we want to ensure that we move forward together, because we know that the road is often long and sometimes difficult.\nSo let us stop speaking about one another. Let us talk to one another.\n"

        "file_text": "First and foremost, I would like to convey our congratulations on the opening of the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly, and our wishes for success in its work to all the participants, from President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov of Turkmenistan. I would like to congratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the Assembly for this session and to wish him every success in his important role. I also want to thank Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, President of the Assembly at its previous session, for her effective work in that position.\nIn formulating Turkmenistan\u2019s approach to this session, we started from the premise that current world realities, and the nature and trends of their political, economic and social processes, clearly demand increasingly close and coordinated interaction among States and major international organizations in achieving our main goals \u2014 ensuring peace and security, providing the conditions for sustainable development and preserving the legal and institutional foundations of the modern world order. In many respects, the degree of effectiveness of this cooperation and our ability to find a reasonable balance between national interests and those of the entire international community will determine whether we succeed in solving other, equally important global problems, including those related to the environment, energy and the fair distribution of water resources. Moreover, at bottom, a balance of interests and a high level of mutual understanding are what enable us to address problems such as poverty, terrorism, drugs, natural disasters, infectious diseases and other challenges. In our view, what is key to dealing with all of those issues is the restoration and reinforcement of trust and predictability, which are vital factors in building constructive relations in the international arena and making informed and responsible decisions.\nWe firmly believe that this process should begin with respect for universally recognized norms of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. In that context, it should be emphasized that the United Nations, despite all the difficulties that it has to overcome in the process of adapting to new geopolitical realities, remains the principal and uncontested guarantor of today\u2019s global security architecture, a bulwark of our world order and international law and a symbol of justice, humanity and respect in international relations. That is why the United Nations must take on the role of initiator in strengthening trust and developing a multilateral dialogue, based on its universal legitimacy, and in translating the character and direction of international communication into constructive direction.\nIn recognition of its own share of responsibility for the state of world affairs and in its deep belief in the high moral authority of the United Nations, Turkmenistan initiated resolution 73/338, which declared 2021 the International Year of Peace and Trust. The idea was first put forward in the President of Turkmenistan\u2019s address to the General Assembly at its seventy-third session (see A/73/PV.15), and the Assembly unanimously adopted resolution 73/338 just a few weeks ago, on 12 September, with the co-sponsorship of 73 Member States. I would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to all States Members of the United Nations, especially the sponsoring States, for their support and solidarity in the implementation of that initiative.\nPromoting comprehensive peace and security and maintaining strategic and regional stability means ensuring that the international community has instruments in its toolkit capable of providing effective solutions to its challenges. We believe that one such tool is preventive diplomacy. As experience has shown, preventive diplomacy under the auspices of the United Nations can produce real results. That is particularly evident in the work of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia, which serves as an effective link between the United Nations and the countries of Central Asia with regard to resolving numerous emerging issues. Needless to say, the most important of those is the work of preventing and neutralizing the various threats facing the region and establishing a solid foundation there for peace, security and sustainable development.\nIn the course of our joint work with the Centre, we have been developing common approaches to urgent problems such as terrorism, extremism, organized crime, the illicit drug trade, environmental issues, the management of transboundary water resources and regional stability. We believe in general that this practice should be harnessed in other areas so as to create a comprehensive arsenal of political, diplomatic and socioeconomic instruments for preventing risks and addressing challenges.\nIt will be essential to ensure that the concept of neutrality plays a crucial role in building non-confrontational and balanced international relations today. We believe firmly that a neutral model of foreign policy, with its inherent principles of non-interference in conflicts and non-participation in military associations and alliances, is bound to have a significant positive impact on the entire course and direction of global policy, bringing it greater clarity and predictability. As a State whose neutral status was unanimously affirmed and acknowledged by the United Nations on 12 December 1995 (resolution 50/80 A), Turkmenistan has always been and will continue to be true to its chosen foreign policy path and to the trust that the international community has put in us. It was therefore only logical that on Turkmenistan\u2019s initiative the Assembly established a new date in the global political calendar, the International Day of Neutrality, celebrated every year on 12 December (resolution 71/275). By that decision, the international community acknowledged the unqualified positive significance of neutrality as an essential factor in modern world politics, and its relevance to the long-term strategic goals of the United Nations.\nIn that regard, we believe that the practical applications of the political and legal principles and ideological foundations of neutrality should be a focus of close attention within the United Nations, first and foremost with regard to the peacebuilding potential of neutrality and the possibilities of conducting United Nations mediation missions with the participation and on the territories of neutral countries. There are a number of examples, including recent ones, when just such an approach has helped to achieve agreement and reconciliation. Based on that, we think it would be a good idea to hold a broad multilateral dialogue at the United Nations during this session on the use of the principle of neutrality in the practice of international relations, and we would like to ask Member States to support our proposal to develop a United Nations code of rules for the effective application of the principles of neutrality in resolving international issues.\nOn 12 December next year, we will mark the twenty- fifth anniversary of the international recognition of Turkmenistan\u2019s permanently neutral status. In that connection, in Ashgabat in December 2020 we will hold an international conference on issues of peace, security and development. We stand ready to work with the Secretariat, Member States, international organizations and all interested parties in order to prepare for and hold this forum.\nCooperation with the United Nations on sustainable development issues remains a priority for all of us in the long term. It is clear that despite the efforts that have been made, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is encountering various problems, including financial ones. In our opinion, they can be overcome if we harness political will and our efforts is properly organized. It will be essential to ensure a clear algorithm and the coordinated provision of adequate financial resources for specific projects and programmes aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. To that end, we think we should consider convening a United Nations conference on financing for development. To do that, we propose establishing an international coordinating group under the auspices of the United Nations to discuss the dates, venue, provisional agenda and other relevant issues for such a forum, which we believe can provide the impetus needed to ensure financial support for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nDuring this session, Turkmenistan will take further steps to establish a broad international partnership in the field of comprehensive energy security. To that end, my country will submit a draft resolution on the subject to the General Assembly during this session. We hope that Member States will participate actively in drafting it and agreeing on its provisions.\nFor Turkmenistan, one strategic direction of our work in the United Nations continues to be partnerships in the area of transport. My country will undertake efforts during this session to establish a systematic multilateral dialogue on transport issues. We believe that cooperation on international transport can be successful if it has a clearly articulated global focus that covers extensive areas and the various complexes of routes and railways that unite entire regions and continents.\nThe environment and its protection have traditionally been central to Turkmenistan\u2019s activities at the United Nations. During this session my country will add the Caspian Sea issue to its list of well-known environmental initiatives. In August Turkmenistan held the first Caspian Economic Forum, at which the President of Turkmenistan launched an initiative creating a new Caspian environment programme at the United Nations. Considering the universal importance of preserving the Caspian Sea as a unique natural complex, we hope to have the support of the international community for that initiative. Another important item for Turkmenistan on the agenda for this session is saving the Aral Sea. We will continue to work diligently to promote the idea of establishing a special United Nations programme for the countries of the Aral Sea basin, and we invite all interested parties to take part in the consultations on that subject.\nThe implementation of international agreements on climate change reached in the framework of the United Nations is a major focus for my country. With a view to mobilizing activity aimed at fulfilling our commitments under the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the President of Turkmenistan approved our updated national strategy on climate change on 23 September, the very day of the Climate Action Summit in New York.\nThe issue of the conservation and use of water resources is one of the most important and urgent challenges of our time. It is not an exaggeration to say that today the course of various global processes and the prospects for ensuring stability, development and well-being all over the world depend to a large degree on its resolution. Water issues, which have political, economic and social implications, require international consensus and demand that States concert their efforts on a common platform, where secondary and local interests and benefits must give way to an acknowledgement of truly global aims and priorities and the creation of a unified long-term strategy of action. The key condition for such concerted activity should continue to be an unconditional commitment to the principle of fair and equitable access to water resources and the recognition that it is a basic human right. Ensuring and assuming responsibility for the right of access to water is an obligation for every State, primarily because water is a common good every people on our planet. In adhering strictly to those principles, Turkmenistan has formulated a detailed position on water issues that can be summed up as follows.\nFirst, water issues in the various regions of the world should be addressed based on the universally recognized norms of international law and the relevant United Nations conventions in particular. Secondly, water issues should be considered based on the principles of mutual respect and consent and consideration of the interests of all States that share basins of transboundary rivers, water sources and shared-border lakes. In that regard, Turkmenistan opposes the construction of new hydraulic facilities on transboundary rivers, which is linked to high environmental, socioeconomic and humanitarian risks. Thirdly, we support greater and more active involvement on the part of international organizations in addressing water issues.\nTurkmenistan is approaching the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly with a fully responsible attitude. We see our task as one of contributing as much as we can to the work of the United Nations in strengthening global peace and security, fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals and deepening trust and predictability in international affairs, and in bringing creative impetus to our joint work within these walls. While we recognize the difficulties and problems that stand in the way, we believe that with goodwill and firm resolve we can overcome them together. Turkmenistan believes in the enormous potential of the United Nations, and in its authority and ability to effectively address complex issues. We will therefore do everything possible to further strengthen the United Nations, actively contributing to its peacebuilding efforts and working tirelessly towards our horizons for development and progress."

        "file_text": "As Robert Nesta Marley, a great poet of our Caribbean civilization, once paraphrased the Book of Psalms in song, \u201cthe stone that the builder refuse, will always be the head cornerstone\u201d. As it was in biblical and musical verse, so it is in modern geopolitics. Small island developing States (SIDS), ignored by the architects of the modern world order, are now increasingly indispensable to understanding and solving the challenges of our day. As the original builders of our global economic and political architecture descend into jingoistic isolationism and succumb to the narrowest pursuits of short-term self-interest, it is the small, the poor and the historically marginalized States of our global village that present the last, best chance to restore the crumbling edifice of international cooperation and the principles on which that cooperation rests. With multilateralism battered by a resurgence of base, dishonest pandering to narrowly partisan interest groups, and with great-Power intrigue driving nations further apart, by necessity small island developing States will prove to be the glue that holds together this international experiment in unity, discussion and joint action.\nThe rapid acceleration of climate change is the menacing manifestation of a failed multilateralism. Faced with a common threat, ample warning and overwhelming scientific consensus on its past causes, future effects and present solutions, the international community has dithered endlessly and impotently. As emissions continue to increase, legally binding limits are recast as voluntary targets and the worst offenders hypocritically highlight the specks of pollution in others\u2019 eyes to distract from the beam in their own. At the same time, many needlessly suffer and die while indisputably urgent global action is intentionally thwarted by selfish short-termists and convenient climate-change deniers.\nToday we are gathering in the wake of indescribable horror in the Bahamas, whose citizens and residents were terrorized by Hurricane Dorian. Weeks after the storm, hundreds are still missing. At United Nations gatherings, this tale has become sickeningly familiar. Only the names and locations change. Sadly, hurricanes are merely the most violent manifestation of the insidious effects of climate change. The floods, land degradation, droughts, landslides, coastal erosion and unreliable weather patterns across our region and elsewhere around the globe create increasingly insurmountable daily obstacles to life, living and production in vulnerable nations, particularly small island developing States. For us, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are a composite, integrated whole on which our very existence depends.\nThis week, the Secretary-General held a Climate Action Summit to confront our persistent paralysis in the face of the accelerating climate catastrophe. Stripped of the crafted eloquence, the Summit reconfirmed that there are basic litmus tests for a commitment to climate action \u2014 the enforcement of binding emissions targets aimed at keeping global warming below 1.5\u00b0C, investments in clean air and renewable energy, and the provision of easily accessible adaptation financing that prioritizes the most vulnerable nations.\nSurely the catastrophe in the Bahamas must finally put to rest the fiction that arbitrary and inaccurate measures of wealth are of greater import than the self-evident vulnerabilities of small island developing States. Measured by gross domestic product per capita, the Bahamas is a high-income nation, too rich to be eligible for many forms of concessional financing, assistance in building resilience or post-disaster support. Measured instead by size, location, geography and the immutable laws of nature, its vulnerabilities are starkly apparent. Before the fury of Mother Nature, our islands are equally vulnerable and must be equally assisted by any mechanism that purports to address the impact of climate change. There is a small island State exceptionalism that must be factored \u2014juridically, and in a non-discretionary manner \u2014 into the architecture of global partnerships on this existential matter.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines has long considered the failure of major emitters to set and honour ambitious mitigation pledges to be an act of hostility towards the very existence of small island developing States. As hundreds lie dead in the Bahamas and thousands more climate refugees are denied safe, temporary haven in the industrialized capitals of the nearest major polluter, those acts of hostility are brought into sharper relief. No nation that contributes to killing us and closes its eyes, ears and doors to our suffering can truly proclaim friendship with us with a clear conscience. I refer to a neighbour that pollutes our residence, sends noxious emissions into our homes or facilitates it, burns fires at our boundaries and smokes us out, commits egregious wrongs against us and is justly subjected to the requisite remedies of compensatory damages and restraining injunctions.\nA different type of metaphorical storm is wreaking havoc with the bedrock principles that undergird this Organization. The rising tide of hegemonic, unilateral and interventionist interference now threatens to inundate entire nations, while responsible States turn a blind eye to their responsibility to speak and act in defence of central tenets of the Charter of the United Nations. North, south, east or west, the hegemonic imperial hand is visible everywhere and the metaphoric eagle often threatens to unleash war and disorder in unilateralist vainglory. What all the world\u2019s peoples want is simply peace, dialogue, security and prosperity. That is all we want.\nThe sustained and coordinated attempts to engage in externally imposed regime change in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela are only one egregious example of the current trend. We are witnessing an illegal economic blockade eerily similar to the one of Cuba that we annually and overwhelmingly decry as immoral and anachronistic. We possess indisputable evidence of extensive foreign interference in the sovereign affairs of the Venezuelan people and frequent, unambiguous threats of military intervention. We are complicit in an international farce where the members of the General Assembly seat one Government as representative of the people of Venezuela while the Organization of American States, a self-described regional agency within the United Nations, seats a different, ill-defined entity, a fictitious creation of foreign Powers. We are mute in defence of the principles that have bound us together and steered us clear of world wars for the past 74 years.\nPrinciple and international law cannot be sporadically or selectively applied. Whatever the challenges facing Venezuela, they are exacerbated, not remedied, by hegemonic interventionism and compounded by our inconsistency. The solutions to the conflict in Venezuela are well known, as are those for other conflicts \u2014 facilitating peaceful dialogue, refraining from outside interference or threats of intervention and ensuring firm adherence to the principles of the Charter, including respect for sovereignty. Those who advance a different agenda are acting against the interests of the Venezuelan people and are becoming witting or unwitting co-conspirators in undermining multilateral diplomacy. The vulgar and unjustifiable imperialist weaponizing of trade and the banking system must be condemned by all right-thinking nations anxious to uphold internationally agreed, rules-based global trade and financial systems as fundamental to peace, security and prosperity.\nWithout hyperbole, we must now all recognize that the Palestinian peace process is mortally wounded and near death. Our silence is complicity in the increasingly brazen unilateral usurpations of international law. Neither a two-State solution nor regional peace can survive the ongoing disavowals of bedrock agreements and the enabling silence of our international community. The Palestinian people deserve more than lip service and hand-wringing. The General Assembly and the Security Council must be heard unambiguously on this matter.\nThis year, as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines celebrates the fortieth anniversary of its reclamation of independence from a lengthy but temporary colonial rule of 216 years, it is continuing the process of removing historical blinders, reassessing its challenges and opportunities and renewing its linkages with continental Africa. This year, after separate visits to the Caribbean by our brother Presidents of Ghana and Kenya that captured the region\u2019s imagination, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) approved the establishment in principle of an Africa-Brazil-Caribbean diaspora commission for further practical development with the African Union, Brazil \u2014 which is home to more than 100 million people of African descent \u2014 the 25 members of the Association of Caribbean States, and the African diaspora elsewhere, particularly North America and Europe. The Africa-Brazil-Caribbean diaspora commission places the fractured global might of peoples of African descent within a single institutional framework. Within that unity is undeniable and untapped strength. This is a concrete proposal for further uplifting the goals and targets of the United Nations Decade for People of African Descent. Africa\u2019s centrality is a core feature of CARICOM\u2019s public policy.\nThose efforts add to the political and administrative structure and respond to the abiding yearning for reconnection manifest in the Caribbean Community\u2019s formal demand for reparative justice for the crimes of native genocide and African slavery. As increasing numbers of venerable private institutions come to terms with the myriad ways in which they profited from or contributed to the transatlantic slave trade, the Governments of many States continue to dodge and dissemble when confronted with the indisputable evidence of their past actions and current impact. Caribbean nations will continue to push patiently but insistently for acknowledgements and actions to remedy this colossal historical injustice. This justifiable demand for compensatory resources to repair the legacy of underdevelopment that is the consequence of native genocide and the enslavement of African bodies is urgent and compelling. It is linked inextricably to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and their financing.\nThe eradication of poverty and the deepening of sustainable, people-centred development remain my Government\u2019s central drivers. Amid the ominous ubiquity of climate change, the unpredictability of escalating trade wars and the daily uncertainties of erratic global policy shifts, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines must seek increasingly creative pathways in pursuit of its people\u2019s right to development.\nAlongside our continuing efforts to engender growth and development through greater investments in agriculture, education, health, housing, tourism and the blue economy, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has established a well-regulated, export-oriented medical-cannabis industry that seeks to marry the latest scientific and pharmaceutical knowledge of cannabis with the long-standing expertise of our traditional cultivators of the plant. In defining the parameters of our medical-cannabis sector, we have made great efforts to scrupulously comply with international law, while taking into account the specific needs and characteristics of our country, culture and people. Undoubtedly, the rapidly shifting medical and legal landscape will eventually require the international community to revisit the long-standing treaties governing the use of and trade in cannabis. In the interim, it is crucial that the enforcers and interpreters of those international agreements refrain from a brand of hard-line orthodoxy that disproportionately affects small States, while accommodating a disdainful disregard for the law on the part of more powerful nations.\nThe General Assembly must stand resolutely against the thinly veiled war being waged on small island developing States on the pretext of combating tax evasion and reducing so-called illicit financial flows. The constant bullying by ruffians \u2014 and the original meaning of the word \u201cruffians\u201d is \u201cbully boys\u201d \u2014 particularly the ruffians who are the bureaucrats of the European Union, has revealed that the unambiguous objective of the European Union is not well-regulated Caribbean financial centres but a decimated and discredited sector, while it panders to the thriving centres that exist within its own borders or in other more powerful locales. The war being waged on legitimate commercial activity in the Caribbean by the European Union traffics in outmoded stereotypes and is accompanied by the unmistakable whiff of a paternalistic bias that romanticizes the Caribbean servant or subsistence labourer but instinctively rejects the concept of a Caribbean banker. In other words, we must continue always to be hewers of wood and drawers of water and not use our brains to do things.\nIt is self-evident that opaque, non-inclusive and undemocratic entities are presuming to impose an illegitimate rule-making authority on island States in the hope that their financial sector will collapse under the weight of onerous regulation, rapidly changing requirements and the threat of unilateral blacklists. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is under no illusion. Our financial-services sector and those of our Caribbean brothers and sisters are experiencing a synchronized political assault masquerading as an objective bureaucratic regulatory exercise. Let us be clear about that. Similarly, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines wishes to formally place the issues of de-risking and the loss of correspondent banking relations firmly on the agenda of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council. Well-meaning but ill-fitting regulatory attempts to combat terrorism and money-laundering have had the unintended effect of making it prohibitively expensive for banks to operate in small island locations. The flight of those banks and the withdrawal of relationships with other financial institutions threatens to disconnect island States from international trade and commerce, with disastrous consequences for development.\nInternational cooperation is essential to addressing these vexing challenges of modern globalization and sustainable development. Some of our allies, such as Taiwan, have been exemplary in offering their perspectives and support to our development aspirations, and have proved time and again that they are more than deserving of a meaningful role in the specialized agencies and bodies of the United Nations. Indeed, South-South cooperation is moving increasingly from the periphery to centre stage of the global political economy, to the benefit of SIDS such as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\nThe President\u2019s well-chosen thematic focus on inclusion and multilateralism is an apt encapsulation of the ambitious attempts of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to advocate for its right to be seated and heard at the highest levels of multilateral decision-making. This year Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was proud and humbled to be elected by the General Assembly to serve as a non-permanent member on the Security Council. Our overwhelming mandate remains an important endorsement of our nation\u2019s historic quest to become the smallest nation ever seated on that important global peacemaking body. More importantly, it is an unequivocal acknowledgement of the right and ability of small island States to participate meaningfully in the weightiest matters at the core of the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations. We hope that our presence will buttress the view of the overwhelming majority of nations that the membership and working methods of the Security Council should be reformed to reflect current global realities and the invaluable perspectives of small island developing States. So, too, must we right the historic wrong of the exclusion of Africa and others from permanent membership. We thank the General Assembly for voting so overwhelmingly to repose its trust in us. We ask for its continued support.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines based its Security Council campaign on the assumption that we are friends to all and strive for a better world. We support it with the belief that problems have solutions; with our love of peace and abhorrence of war; our reliance on the timeless principles of sovereign equality, non-interference and non-intervention; our confidence in systems of global governance based on transparent rule-making and equitable enforcement, irrespective of power disparities; and an unshakeable conviction, as enunciated by Martin Luther King, Jr., that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is a country with a small population, a small economic footprint, a small geographic area and a magnificent part of our legitimate and authentic Caribbean civilization. Our small islands, mere irrelevant pebbles in the eyes of some of the large, rich and powerful who ought to know better, must now form part of the new foundation of international cooperation. Our challenges must be acknowledged, and our voices, long humoured but unheard, must be listened to as consistent advocates on behalf of people, progress, partnership and principle. Too often the founding principles of the United Nations, like small island States, have been cast aside in the precipitate pursuit of convenient or expedient solutions. Too often the world has come to regret such reckless haste. Today we must recognize the folly of assuming that our Organization\u2019s institutions can withstand the challenges of unilateralism, isolationism and inactivity. The proper responses to those challenges are a reinvigorated Assembly, a recommitment to principle and international law and a renewed focus on the diverse voices of all Members of our noble institution.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. Zimbabwe is confident that under his able stewardship, the General Assembly will accelerate towards achieving our Organization\u2019s objectives. May I also commend his immediate predecessor, Ambassador Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for having successfully presided over the seventy-third session of the General Assembly.\nI am addressing the General Assembly today following the sad passing of the founding father of our country, the late former President, His Excellency Comrade Robert Gabriel Mugabe.\nZimbabwe is in transition and is determined to overcome the reality that we were a collapsed economy with a collapsed currency, owing to the illegal economic sanctions imposed on our country. Since I took over the leadership of Zimbabwe, much has been accomplished, including indicative recovery, stabilization and growth. Immense progress has been made towards macroeconomic and fiscal stabilization as well as high-impact projects that pave the way for private-sector-led growth.\nEmbedded in our aspirations is a strong sense of urgency for us to eradicate poverty, achieve quality and relevant education, create employment for women and youth, and mitigate the cross-cutting impact of climate change on our society and economy. Our people deserve better and we are committed to delivering on their aspirations.\nZimbabwe\u2019s engagement and re-engagement with all countries of the world so that it can return to its rightful place within the comity of nations is yielding notable progress. Our arms remain outstretched, and our heart is one of genuine friendship and cooperation, for all who are willing to join the new and exciting journey of Zimbabwe\u2019s rebirth. In our desire to deepen the democratic space in our country, we have established an open political platform which we have invited all political parties to share in a frank debate and dialogue on aspects of our social, political and economic reforms. Comprehensive and far-reaching reforms are being implemented by my Government for the benefit, protection and economic prosperity of our people in line with their ever-changing aspirations.\nIn addition, with fiscal austerity and discipline we have balanced our books and achieved a budget surplus, which is unprecedented in my country. It will take time for the impact of change and reforms on the general lives of our people to become apparent, but we are headed in the right direction. We will continue to put in place social safety nets to cushion the lower strata and most vulnerable members of our society and appeal for further multilateral support in that regard.\nThose achievements have been made despite the remaining albatross of the illegal economic sanctions, which constitute a denial of the human right of the people of Zimbabwe to develop and improve their quality of life. Furthermore, they are slowing down our progress, inhibiting our economic recovery and punishing the poorest and most vulnerable.\nAs the United Nations, let us boldly honour the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The wrongs of the world must be set right. Unfair practices must be challenged. Injustice, racism and all forms of oppression of humankind by humankind must be opposed and rejected. My country applauds the Southern African Development Community, the African Union and all who stand with us in demanding the immediate and unconditional removal of those illegal sanctions. Those who imposed illegal sanctions must heed this call and lift them now. Cooperation is a win-win game. Sanctions are a lose-lose game. Zimbabwe deserves a restart.\nZimbabwe is also reforming laws and regulations governing trade, investment and the ease and cost of doing business. Restrictions on shareholding across all sectors of the economy have been removed and some public entities are being privatized. The new national investment policy reflects the commitment of my Government and Administration to opening up the economy.\nIn line with our modernization and industrialization agenda, we are enhancing the quality of our education to make it more relevant with regard to modern technology and innovation. Greater focus is now being placed on science, technology and innovation, while incubation hubs and industrial parks are being established throughout the country. Increased collaboration among industry, small and medium enterprises and the education sector in support of responsive and relevant human capital development is being facilitated and encouraged. Our education system is now focused on producing relevant products, goods and services that respond to the ever-changing needs of our country and the world at large.\nIn our quest to deepen constitutionalism, the rule of law, democratic practices, good corporate governance, transparency and accountability, the capacity of our institutions that protect democracy continues to be enhanced. The anti-corruption drive is being accelerated by my Government by supporting and strengthening institutions that help in the fight against that cancer.\nNotable progress has also been achieved in the area of political and legislative reforms The alignment to date of most of our laws with the Constitution is almost complete. We commend the support that we continue to receive from the United Nations Development Programme and other stakeholders. Outdated media laws on access to information and the protection of privacy and the former Public Order and Security Act have been repealed. New laws in those areas have been enacted.\nLet us accelerate our quest to end poverty by 2030. In the spirit of leaving no one behind, synergies and greater coherence in the implementation of all global frameworks on sustainable development are imperative. The theme of the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, is most appropriate and timely.\nAs the climate crisis continues, the world is changing before our eyes. For us in southern Africa, Tropical Cyclone Idai recently served as a reminder that the impact of climate change and the damage it does to humankind and life on Earth are dire and irreparable. It left many thousands of people dead, injured or displaced and a trail of destroyed infrastructure. We are continuing to recover from the disaster and the cost of reconstruction and recovery is estimated at approximately $600 million for Zimbabwe alone. Let me take this opportunity to thank all well-wishers from around the world for the solidarity and support that we received for relief, recovery and reconstruction and other forms of assistance in the aftermath of Cyclone Idai.\nOur country is an agro-based economy. The agriculture sector contributes between 15 and 20 per cent of our gross domestic product and approximately 60 per cent of raw materials for industry. The impact of climate change has affected not only our agricultural productivity and food security but also our hydropower- generation capacity and overall economic recovery, growth and development. Consequently, my Government has since declared a state of national disaster.\nThe importance of a reinvigorated and responsive multilateral system to promote global partnerships for peace and development cannot be overemphasized. Zimbabwe will continue to do its part in working towards the attainment of world peace and sustainable development.\nThe reform of the United Nations system to make it more representative, empowered and responsive in fulfilling its mandate is long overdue. Zimbabwe remains firmly committed to the common African position, as set forth in the Ezulwini Consensus.\nI would like to conclude by reiterating that Zimbabwe is carrying out reforms and undertaking a collective journey towards a better and more secure future. A great task lies before us, and the road ahead is long, winding and sometimes very bumpy, but our potential and determination to succeed is just as tremendous. I urge the world to be patient with us, support us and join us on this new and exciting journey. Together we will realize our common vision to build a common future free of poverty, hunger and conflict, and a safe planet that can benefit all of our peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "Before I begin my remarks, I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere condolences to the Government and the people of France following the death Mr. Jacques Chirac, former President of the French Republic, to whose memory and commitment to peace and multilateralism I pay tribute.\nI am pleased to warmly congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election to preside over the Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I firmly believe that his personal and professional qualities will contribute to the success of our work. Allow me to pay tribute to his predecessor for the efficient way in which she steered the work of the seventy-third session.\nI would like to sincerely and acknowledge and thank His Excellency Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the various teams he leads for the efforts they make daily in service to the Organization, which is increasingly faced with challenges that make its work ever more complex.\nWhen our Organization was created, the founding fathers sought international peace and security by means of gradual disarmament, social justice and the well-being of peoples through mutual assistance among nations. Many decades have passed since then. Commitments were made and actions taken to achieve the objectives set more than 70 years ago. Today, it must be recognized that, beyond those initial objectives, new issues and challenges have imposed themselves on our world, which require that we, as the leaders we all are, review our policies and strategies and ensure for present and future generations what our predecessors sought to guarantee by creating the Organization.\nI will mention just some of the most recent strategies. The Millennium Summit, held in 2000, raised many hopes for the eradication of poverty and the advent of a better world that was safer \u2014 politically, socially and economically. At the time, the Millennium Development Goals benefited from global ownership that foreshadowed a better future for our peoples. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is an ideal platform for our collective commitment and on which we can rely for action in the area of development.\nBy adopting the Sustainable Development Goals, the United Nations has taken into account all the dimensions of and all elements related to development, in the broadest sense, as well as to the survival of humankind. In this regard, the Union of the Comoros has taken ownership of the Sustainable Development Goals, in all their aspects.\nThe realities of climate change must be taken seriously, as regions could simply disappear due to the harmful effects of environmental degradation. Although those issues spare no country or region, it should be underscored that the situation with regard to small island developing States is even more worrisome and deserves greater attention.\nMy country, the Union of the Comoros, is one of those small States that is exposed to climate threats and must therefore continue to address them. In April, our islands were severely affected by Hurricane Kenneth. It devastated nearly 80 per cent of agricultural production and destroyed roads and hundreds of schools, hospitals and homes, causing the forced and improvised displacement of more than 40,000 people out of a population of approximately 800,000 inhabitants. There was considerable internal and external support to address the situation. On behalf of the people and the Government of the Comoros and on my own behalf, I again thank brotherly and friendly countries and the partner institutions of the Comoros for the exemplary solidarity shown in the days immediately following the tragedy.\nAt the national level, all segments of the population, including civil servants, as well as the private sector, have shown exemplary solidarity and provided multifaceted support to the destitute. Of course, the reconstruction process will be long and difficult. We are also therefore counting on international solidarity to assist the disaster victims.\nLike so many others, small island developing States also face other dangerous challenges, such as maritime piracy, human trafficking at sea, drug trafficking, illegal fishing and the plundering of other resources at sea. My Government welcomes and joins all national, regional and international initiatives in the merciless fight against the barbaric acts that threaten the safety and security of our respective populations. In collaboration with various partners, we must step up preventive actions so as to protect our respective populations. In this regard, need we say that such actions must be collective, coordinated and global in scope, since we know that global challenges can be met only with global responses?\nThe theme of our session also touches on a key issue \u2014 quality education. In future, the leaders of our countries will be only what we decide that they will be. Today\u2019s young people \u2014 tomorrow\u2019s leaders \u2014 are looking to us. They have the right to quality education that would ensure that they become worthy leaders of our countries. We must follow up on these recommendations in order to give meaning to the shared commitments to our young people. In this regard, youth entrepreneurship could play a role in economic development and job creation, as, today, many young people tend to view entrepreneurship as a viable and attractive option, given the lack of employment opportunities. In this way, we can prevent the vulnerable segment of the population from falling prey to predators and extremists of all kinds.\nAllow me now to inform the Assembly of the new developments in my country, the Union of the Comoros, since our last session, at which I apprised the Assembly, from this rostrum, of the major events that had marked a decisive turning point in our country\u2019s socioeconomic context (see A/73/PV.11). Upon the initiative of civil society, national conferences led to a referendum and constitutional reforms. As I had announced, I shortened my term of office, and early elections were held to select the President of the Union and the governors of the islands. The Comorian people again elected me with 59 per cent of the vote, for which I sincerely thank them.\nFor the first time in the history of the Comoros, a woman was elected to head the governorate of Ngazidja, the largest of the four islands. To complete the electoral process, we are preparing for free and transparent legislative elections in January. I therefore again call on our partners in the international community to support us in this process so that it is transparent and credible.\nAbove and beyond the mark of political maturity of the Comorian people, the election also promoted the policy of openness that I have always advocated and led, and gender equality, which is one of the causes I continue unrelentingly to champion. Faced with the immediate and lofty task of charting the future of the Union of the Comoros, I decided to work harder than ever to strengthen national unity and social cohesion, without which efforts for harmonious development would be in vain. I have taken measures to appease social tensions, which have resulted in particular in pardons for many prisoners who had been sentenced to decades or even life in prison, most of whom had been involved in acts against State security. I remain convinced that Comorians, united and in solidarity with each other, will be able to strengthen the gains made in security and to make our country a haven of peace and a pleasant place to live.\nComorians will therefore be able to build and thrive on the recent reclassification by the World Bank, whereby the status of the Union of the Comoros has gone from a least developed country to a middle-income country. In addition, while thanking our various partners for their constant support, I would like to make a solemn appeal to the entire international community to support us further, particularly in organizing the conference of funding agencies and donors for the benefit of my country to be held in Paris in December. I would like to take this opportunity to thank, once again, the President of the French Republic, His Excellency Mr. Emmanuel Macron, for kindly sponsoring the conference and offering to host it in the French capital. Allow me also to thank, in advance, all those who, in a spirit of solidarity, will support the Union of the Comoros in this way.\nAlso at the national level, the General Assembly has always witnessed the commitment of successive Governments of my country to find a fair solution, in accordance with international law, to the thorny problem of the Comorian island of Mayotte. Indeed, despite this unpleasant dispute between friendly countries, the two sides are fortunately united by a political will for rapprochement and a common commitment. The signature, last July, during an official visit I made to Paris, of a new framework partnership agreement covering several vital areas, cements this willingness on both sides\nThe promotion of peaceful and fair societies will only be effective if we provide the necessary means to reduce inequality in all its forms. Accordingly, in order to better tackle global problems, it is certainly necessary to harness momentum. However, taking into account the disproportions in various parties\u2019 capacities is an essential component not to be forgotten.\nIn that vein, I cannot close this chapter without referring to the situation in the Near and Middle East, particularly in Syria and Yemen, with particular reference to the brother people of Palestine, as well as to other peoples who remain, even today, deprived of their most basic rights. Let me say that the illegal occupation of Palestine and the savage repression of the Palestinian people are fuelling extremism on all sides. It is therefore time for the General Assembly, just as it strived for the existence of Israel, to restore the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination through the creation of a Palestinian State, living in peace with the State of Israel, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nThe Union of the Comoros would also like to reaffirm its unwavering commitment to the definitive resolution of the question of the Moroccan Sahara, under the auspices of our prestigious Organization. We trust the Security Council to expedite the resolution of the situation. The Union of the Comoros is also following with interest developments in the Sudan. The Comorian people and Government therefore welcome the progress made recently on the political situation in the Sudan and strongly hope that this brother country will soon regain its stability in the interest of the Sudanese people and of Africa as a whole.\nMy thoughts also go to all the peoples who live under the threat of terrorism and for whom no development can be envisaged in a context of permanent attacks. Once again, I appeal to everyone to avoid the dangerous conflation of Islam and terrorism, as terrorists are neither Muslim, Catholic, Jewish or animist. Terrorists are just that, terrorists and barbarians, who defy all religions and scorns all civilizations.\nThe United Nations is seeing its missions multiply with every new challenge that emerges in the world. The Organization must be in a position to cope with them. Human and financial resources are necessary. But, above all, it also needs a new breath of fresh air to address those challenges. Its main organs, in particular the Security Council, must be reformed with a view to its renewal and to the establishment of true universality in the world\u2019s most prestigious organization, the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of His Excellency Mr. Desire Delano Bouterse, President of the Republic of Suriname, I extend sincere congratulations to Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I also wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her skilful leadership of the previous session and I wish her well in her future endeavours.\nDiversity characterizes Suriname and that diversity is manifested by our environment. Suriname is recognized as having the highest percentage of forest cover of any country on the planet and we are committed to preserving 93 per cent of our forest cover. Suriname is also recognized as the joint most carbon-negative country, alongside Bhutan. Suriname has unique biodiversity. In 1998, we were the first country to reserve 11 per cent of our land mass for scientific and conservation purposes, as a gift to humankind. That represents 1.6 million hectares of our territory \u2014 an ambitious contribution at that time.\nIt is therefore easy to understand why Suriname \u2014 along with many others here present in the Assembly Hall today \u2014 is deeply concerned about the effects of our changing global climate. Appropriately, we show solidarity with the Government and people of the Bahamas and others affected by the recent hurricanes. Parts of a small Caribbean nation have once again been wiped out. Is it a coincidence that in less than 3 years, several Caribbean countries have been struck by hurricanes of the highest category, or is it a telling phenomenon revealing that climate change has already become a fact of life with devastating effects?\nI wholeheartedly agree with the Secretary-General when he says, with regard to climate change, that now is the time for action and not for empty speeches and promises. It was in that spirit that Suriname initiated and hosted the first high-level meeting for high-forest low-deforestation (HFLD) countries in February. Since 2007, HFLD developing countries have received less than $2 billion in climate finance \u2014 less than 14 per cent of all climate funds committed.\nAt that meeting, the Krutu of Paramaribo Joint Declaration on HFLD Climate Finance Mobilization was adopted, representing the collective interests of 27 participating developing countries, which committed to taking action and increasing their access to climate finance in order to maintain their forests intact. Suriname has now been mandated by that group to lead the HFLD developing countries in achieving the joint objectives expressed in the Paramaribo Declaration. We therefore call for strong ambition and more action aimed at global mitigation and adaptation efforts, especially in order to facilitate access to finance.\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization (A/74/1) paints a worrying picture of the current state of world affairs with regard to peace and security.\nStating that diversity characterizes Suriname also reflects the fact that Suriname\u2019s population harbours at least seven major world cultures. The message of our national anthem is strong and clear, 4Wans\u2019 ope tata komopo, wi mu\u2019 seti kondre bun\u201d, which means, \u201cWherever we may have come from, we must build a prosperous nation\u201d. That has inspired us, as a diverse people, to advance towards a prosperous nation and has prevented inter-ethnic clashes, as Suriname is renowned for its harmony and tolerance, its respect for all religions and cultures and the peaceful coexistence of its citizens, while at the regional level, Suriname has always advocated and contributed to maintaining the Caribbean and South American region as a zone of peace.\nAt the regional level, we are confronted with tensions that have given rise to mistrust among States that for decades had enjoyed excellent political, economic, social and diplomatic relations. In the Latin American and Caribbean region, countries have endeavoured for long periods of time to preserve and promote peace, security, political stability and social and political inclusion.\nSuriname therefore reiterates the critical importance of respect for the principles of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of States and underscores the relevance of dialogue, diplomacy and the peaceful resolution of conflicts, as well as political and economic cooperation, as the building blocks for durable stability, peace and democracy. In that regard, I should like to mention several key points.\nFirst, we applaud the recent steps taken by parties at the national level in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to reach common ground through meaningful dialogue.\nSecondly, our colonial past has presented Suriname with unresolved border issues in the western and eastern parts of our territory. It is our conviction that we will find a solution to secure our territorial integrity in the near future. Suriname is intentionally choosing the path of dialogue in order to resolve those remnants from our colonial past.\nThirdly, with regard to the land rights of our indigenous and tribal communities, we have developed a road map aimed at achieving the legal recognition of those land rights within a Surinamese context. In response to the recent forest fires in the Amazon region, Suriname adhered to and welcomed the pact to protect the Amazon, which was signed in Leticia, Colombia, as a call to preserve and sustainably develop the region.\nWe strongly emphasized the inclusiveness of all Amazonian countries as part of a living Amazon that compels us and those countries to rise above political differences, organize relevant provisions to secure the development of indigenous and tribal communities and uphold the sovereignty of countries and the Amazon as a region. In so doing, we will continue to utilize the provisions of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization.\nWe consider the ongoing trade disputes among major international players to be a serious challenge with far-reaching consequences for our local economies. In the same vein, we strongly oppose the blacklisting and arbitrary seizure of funds without due regard for the severe consequences for the economic stability of countries. Those unwelcome actions remain major obstacles beyond the control of many nations. An atmosphere of trust and political will is crucial and should lead to dialogue and cooperation.\nBy the same token, we strongly disapprove of the continuation of the more than half-a-century-old economic, financial and commercial embargo against the sister Republic of Cuba and its people. Repeatedly, the vast majority of nations has taken a stance against that embargo. One may wonder if it is now not finally the time to understand that the continuation of those measures has been and will remain counterproductive.\nLastly, with our extensive open borders and sparsely inhabited hinterland, Suriname is a victim of the illicit trans-border drug trade. The recent adoption of the National Drug Master Plan (2019-2023) is a testimony to our resolve to combat that illicit trade, an important component of which is international cooperation. Bearing that in mind, Suriname co-chaired the biregional partnership between the European Union and Community of Latin American and Caribbean States on the Coordination and Cooperation Mechanism on Drugs, resulting in the adoption of a document that contains the necessary guidelines on the fight against illicit drug trafficking and drug-related transnational crime.\nConcerning our young people, we all are witnessing today how they are voicing their concerns about their future \u2014 and they have the right to do so. With lead responsibility for youth in the Caribbean Community, Suriname strongly advocates for youth involvement as a prerequisite for sustainable development and has made a deliberate choice to meet that expectation. We pride ourselves on our intergenerational approach, which provides opportunities for youth to engage and participate in all levels of decision-making. Young people are an integral part of the Surinamese delegation here today as well.\nThreats and obstacles to the achievement of the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development have been the key topic of concern. Every Member State has its own challenges. In that regard, Suriname notes the economic stagnation as a consequence of the fast and sharp decline in world market prices of crude oil and gold from 2013 to 2015, which significantly diminished the foreign currency earnings of the Surinamese economy and in response to which the Government executed a home-grown reform programme \u2014 home-grown because this Government is cognizant of the fact that our main asset for development is our people.\nIn 2010, President Bouterse envisioned and commenced a social contract with the people of Suriname. Universal health care, a general pension, a minimum hourly wage, access to affordable housing and education are the main components of that social contract, which the Government continued to uphold despite the economic crisis. Today, the economy has recovered in record time, achieving steady positive growth for two years in a row \u2014 2017 and 2018 \u2014 while inflation has come down from double digits to a single digit and is continuing to decrease; since mid-2018, it has dipped below 5 per cent annually. Exports and imports are both much stronger than during the crisis years.\nSecondly, I must mention an obstacle that is still unresolved and that if not addressed will make the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) practically unattainable \u2014 our classification as a middle-income country. As for many other developing countries, including the countries of the Caribbean, that classification of Suriname is based on gross domestic product per capita only and does not reflect our vulnerabilities.\nWe strongly reject that unrealistic classification, which disregards the full set of challenges that we face and which should be addressed with urgency. Access to concessional financing for our development is critical to allow for accelerated implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThirdly, our newest endeavour and priority in realizing the SDGs is the strengthening of our national planning institute. That institute has been extending its reach to all bodies of Government and applying results- based management to our annual plan and annual budget and will be instrumental in realizing a long-term strategy for development. Strengthening that core planning institute will greatly help us in addressing the challenge of collecting, analysing and delivering reliable data and statistics, which will in turn surely enhance the responsiveness of our decision-making, including the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and therefore has become one of our top priorities.\nIn closing, given a world in which there is an urgent need to cooperate and the imperative to solve the many serious issues it faces, Suriname is convinced that the United Nations remains the most important Organization for addressing all matters that confront the international community, one that is focused on finding solutions and taking into consideration the interests of all Member States.\nIt is therefore essential that the United Nations become a more effective multilateral institution, with adequate resources, that is fit for purpose to confront the challenges ahead. Suriname recognizes the eminent role that the United Nations can fulfil in ensuring lasting development and peace. It is up to us as Member States to make it work \u2014 and we can make it work.\n"

        "file_text": "Today our region and the entire world are facing great regional and global challenges, and we will be able to find solutions to them only if we act collectively rather than individually. We can make progress only by joining forces. The United Nations is made up of the nations of the world. If we are truly united, nations can achieve a more just and secure world of human dignity. If we call on nations freely and without imposing demands, together we can build the future. If small and large nations live together in equality and with respect, and if we hold on to the notion of making a lasting peace that is shared and universal, we will have a more fraternal world.\nThis is the first time that I have come to the United Nations. I am from Panama, where we live on a strip of land that, in the space of 35 minutes, spans two oceans, the Atlantic and the Pacific. Our country\u2019s aim is to serve humankind. That is our historical and geographical destiny.\nPanama\u2019s story contains many pages, some written and some as yet untold. It is much more than the story of one canal. It chronicles the Afro-Antillean hands that built it and all the migrants who linked two oceans with their blood and effort. It contains the first trans-isthmus railroad that joined two oceans and facilitated world trade, as well as Geisha coffee, which is cultivated by the Ngabe-Bugle Indians and is the best-quality coffee in the world.\nThe book recounts our efforts for peace, dialogue, negotiation and consensus. One page is about the dream of Simon Bolivar, who wrote that if the world were to choose its capital, it would assign that great destiny to the Isthmus of Panama. Its pages tell of the struggle of generations of Panamanians and the global support that culminated in the signing of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. I am referring to Jimmy Carter, former President of the United States, and Omar Torrijos, then Head of the Government of Panama, who led the negotiations between two nations, one large and one small, and who were able to reach an agreement and achieve a historic reparation \u2014 the restoration to Panama of our Canal and our territorial integrity. There is another page in that book that Pope Francis wrote this January, at the end of World Youth Day, which reads, \u201cPanama is a country of a noble people.\u201d Those are Panama\u2019s stories.\nIt is a privilege to be here and to address the citizens of the world and the people of Panama, proudly representing my homeland. Global problems require multilateral solutions. As it has done in the past, Panama is ready to contribute to the resolution of conflicts, especially in our region. Right now our nation, our home, is working on a particular conquest \u2014 the fight against poverty and inequality. It is a great challenge for Panamanians, but we have decided that together we can do it. Poverty and inequality harm human beings, damage families and close off the future for young people, not just in Panama but all over the world. For every word I utter here, thousands are dying in unjust wars, without doctors or medicine. A few are earning millions, and millions are surviving on very little. Leaving people to die in misery is inhumane, and there is no room for such indifference. Let us move from words to deeds. Let us join forces. By fighting poverty and inequality and fulfilling the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, we are addressing corruption through the effective administration of justice.\nOur most important task is transforming education. We have children who go to school and do not learn. We need education systems where students learn to think, work in a team, solve problems, harness creativity, take care of the environment and appreciate art and culture and science and technology. Education frees us from poverty and empowers people to achieve a dignified life. Education means social peace, while creating opportunities and making us more equal in our diversity.\nEducation means human dignity. Sharing knowledge is a universal goal of sustainable development, from early childhood to the best universities in the world. We should be generous in sharing knowledge rather than selfish in monopolizing it.\nWe have heard the concerns and warnings that were expressed at the Climate Action Summit loud and clear. Our verdant tropical forests are the most beautiful in the world. In Panama there are more than 10,000 varieties of plants and 1,000 species of birds. The biodiversity of the planet is in our hands. We must all work together for change in order to reduce the danger of our extinction. There are 1 million species at risk of dying out. We must expand multilateral initiatives to strengthen the climate change regime, and we must fulfil the agreements we sign. Our culture is changing. We are at a historic crossroads and we must redefine our own existence. We must redouble our efforts.\nWe invite the whole world to Panama. We offer more room for dialogue and regional and global understanding. I am not talking about a never-ending dialogue but rather those that unite and resolve. We facilitate good investments and have the best air, maritime, seaport and telecommunications connectivity in the region. We are the hub of the Americas. Panama is a land of innovation, science and technology and a place for universal encounters with knowledge.\nThere is a place in the world called Panama. It is written in the pages of our history that we never allow ourselves to be conquered by adversity. We know that better times are coming. That is what we want and aspire to for Panamanians and for all humankind. I want to reiterate that Panama is a country of noble and good people. Those are the pages of the story that we will continue to write. Today we are facing great challenges, but we can succeed in moving forward only by joining forces. The time is now.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to extend to Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, a well- deserved recognition for her excellent leadership of the main organ of the United Nations system. As the first woman from Latin America and the Caribbean to be elected President, she not only represented Latin Americans, but also women from all over the world.\nI would also like to congratulate the Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. We wish him every success in the discharge of his duties and pledge the commitment of our entire delegation.\nI cannot touch upon the central theme of this debate without first making some observations that put it in context. We are today living through a difficult global situation of great uncertainty, product of the clash of opposing forces struggling to establish a new world order, often without considering the serious consequences of their actions for world peace \u2014 that utopia we yearn for in which all people can live in a state of happiness and freedom, with their basic needs met and without fear of suffering least of all deprivation of their rights and security.\nA quick glance at the planet suffices to realize the fragility of the foundations that underpin peaceful coexistence among States. The tension in Western Asia and the Middle East, the political and economic upheaval in Europe, hunger and malnutrition in Africa and the alarming spread of extreme ideologies are additional risk factors beyond the power struggle among the various Powers vying for domination, whether in the form of trade wars or ideological wars.\nWe are gravely concerned about the withdrawal of the United States from the nuclear treaty with Iran, a hard-won agreement, which casts a shadow over the future of peace in that fragile region and could lead Iran to resume its nuclear programme, with unforeseeable consequences for international peace and security. Uruguay, a firm champion of denuclearization, urges the parties to reconsider their positions and act with a universal conscience by putting aside rhetoric to score short-term political gains at the cost of dire global consequences.\nSimilarly, my country is concerned about the proliferation of arms, especially small arms and light weapons. The indiscriminate access of private individuals to such weapons in countries with permissive legislation is responsible for a growing trend of vigilante justice.\nIn Latin America we are deeply alarmed by the spread of extreme ideologies that seek to forcibly apply their methods in other countries, thus shamelessly violating the authority of regional organizations and generating situations of crisis and violence as an excuse to impose their doctrines by force and plunder the Latin American peoples for their own benefit. We are even more concerned that some Governments in the region embrace those same ideologies and procedures, the use of which has had significant adverse effects still evokes bitter memories.\nWe cannot allow the principle of non-intervention to be a protective barrier to enable grave violations of human rights. Nor can we tolerate foreign intervention under the pretext of defending democracy, all the while terrorizing the population with the threat of an allegedly liberating invasion whose only certain results would be the loss of thousands of innocent lives and the suffocation of many others through economic sanctions that would plunge them into deeper poverty, as is currently the case with Venezuela. Only dialogue and understanding between the parties can lead to a peaceful solution to the crisis.\nIn a similar vein, we again raise our voice in this Assembly, as we have done for 27 years, to strongly condemn the savage and illegal commercial and financial blockade that has been applied for more than 50 years against the Republic of Cuba. Illegal sanctions that run counter to international law have impoverished the people of Cuba, and their grave consequences are detrimental to the future of the women and men of that brotherly Latin American country.\nUruguay has a long tradition of defending multilateralism, democracy, self-determination and the protection and promotion of human rights. We come to this Hall today to renew our commitment to fighting for solutions based on dialogue, peace, democracy and the full enjoyment of human rights when it comes to addressing conflicts generated in our region.\nUruguay considers the Security Council to be the only organ with the competence to apply measures against a Member State for the purpose of maintaining or restoring international peace and security or to determine whether the use of force is warranted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. The world has made progress in building this institutional architecture, which, with its strengths and weaknesses, must be defended \u2014 and Uruguay, which believes in international law as the guarantor of peaceful coexistence among nations, will always do so.\nFor that reason, it participates actively in the maintenance of international peace and security, through peace operations to which it contributes substantial contingents. In fact, Uruguay is the top personnel contributor in the entire Western Hemisphere. As a founding member of the United Nations, Uruguay is deeply committed to multilateralism in all spheres, not only as protection against more powerful actors, but also as a framework for faithfully fulfilling its own obligations.\nFour years ago, the States Members of the United Nations committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), some of which serve as inspiration for this general debate. In this regard, Uruguay has responsibly assumed its commitments to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which fully match the policies it has been implementing over the past 15 years, as my country has been integrating the SDGs at the national, departmental and local levels. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, in order to properly ensure accountability, my country submitted voluntary reports that take stock of the significant progress we have made in each of the 17 Goals.\nIn my view, there are three cross-cutting vectors within the Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 the elimination of poverty, the fight against climate change and quality education.\nAllow me first to focus on the worst global scourge, the greatest enemy of peace, the cause of most of the ills of our era and the enemy we should focus all our efforts towards exterminating \u2014 poverty. If we eliminate poverty, we can universalize education and do away with the education deficit. If we eliminate poverty, we would be reducing harm to the environment. If we eliminate poverty, we will be eliminating hunger, exclusion and discrimination. If we eliminate poverty, we will finally approach the state of well-being to which I referred at the beginning of my statement \u2014 world peace.\nThe equitable distribution of wealth and the eradication of extreme poverty are a priority objective for the Government of Uruguay. We are committed to definitively eradicating extreme poverty and indigence by 2030 and have been working for 15 years to achieve this objective. It is with great satisfaction that we can say today, in this Hall, that in Uruguay there is not a single child sleeping on the streets.\nThe year 2005 marked a milestone in the fight against poverty and extreme poverty in Uruguay. In order to respond to the needs of the Uruguayan people, we undertook key institutional innovations and promoted normative reforms that have expanded social protections. This new institutional framework focused on social policies, increased public spending and launched a comprehensive strategic planning programme in this area. All this took place in the context of uninterrupted economic growth over the past 15 years. In addition, our country opted for decent work, providing more guarantees and rights to workers, including the right to social security and free medical care for rural and domestic workers, who have historically been neglected.\nThose public policies have been critical for the Government to fulfil its social inclusion goals, which it has done with such remarkable success that, at the most recent International Labour Conference of the International Labour Organization, a private-sector representative complained that, in its view, the Government has granted workers too many rights. As a result of those same social policies, the total number of people living below the poverty line has been reduced to 8 per cent, the lowest in Latin America, with indigence standing at 0.1 per cent and inequality at 0.38 per cent, making Uruguay the most egalitarian country in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nThe rights agenda for which Uruguay is internationally recognized has also significantly contributed to the advancement of a freer and more democratic society. After all, we are one of the few full democracies in the world based on a strong institutional framework and the strength of traditional political parties, the oldest of which have existed for 200 years and the youngest of which has been around for half a century. Our robust institutions have allowed Uruguay to avoid the wave of corruption that shook the region.\nAlthough personal wealth worldwide has grown exponentially in the past 20 years, 736 million human beings live in extreme poverty. Less than 10 per cent of the world\u2019s population holds 86 per cent of global wealth, while 70 per cent shares a mere 2.7 per cent of the wealth. In addition, 96 per cent of the world\u2019s poor live in various Asian countries, in Africa and in Latin America.\nDriven by the explosion of digital technology and the growth of emerging economies and the global economy after the financial crisis at the start of the century, the world\u2019s wealth has increased by 66 per cent compared to the year 1995. However, that increase in wealth has not ended poverty or reduced inequality. On the contrary, they have increased. Today, the wealth per capita of the high-income member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is 52 times that of low-income countries. This is a major challenge for the United Nations. Only with enhanced institutions and exemplary legitimate governance can we make progress in managing the complex global processes that lead to inequality.\nWe are not utopian, but we believe that it is possible and necessary to take steps towards a gradual but effective action that will make it possible to reverse the abysmal and shameful inequality on the planet. This inequality significantly affects the entire edifice of rights and tends to turn it, not infrequently, into a formalism of little substance, valuable only as a proclamation of what should be, but not very real and present in the daily life of many nations.\nTo end poverty and reduce inequality, we must invest in people, the most important component of the wealth of nations. Women account for less than 40 per cent of global wealth because they continue to earn less than men throughout their lives. Achieving gender equality would increase human capital by almost 20 per cent. That is why Uruguay inserts a chapter on trade and gender, with an inclusive approach, in all of its trade agreements, as was the case in our recent agreements with Chile, with our Southern Common Market partners and with Canada. That is why it is important for States to design and implement fair and balanced social policies aimed at reducing inequalities, ending poverty and narrowing the existing gaps in our societies, thereby offering everyone a better, fairer and more hopeful future.\nNumerous studies show the multidimensional nature of the phenomenon of poverty, which can only be addressed through comprehensive policies that can build sustainable solutions. Without such a multidimensional approach, there will be 1 billion people living in poverty by 2050, with the lowest- income countries experiencing the highest population growth. All States must consider the multidimensional approach, since poverty is a problem that afflicts all societies in the world, which is why multilateral efforts are the key to eradicate it.\nSecondly, with regard to the fight against climate change, if we are to succeed, we must be aware that the harmful effects of climate change directly affect the increase in poverty and global economic and social inequality. By 2050, climate change could displace 140 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America alone.\nThe severity of environmental degradation has reached levels beyond what is tolerable. The commitment of all Members of the United Nations is essential to stopping environmental damage and to trying to reverse its bleak consequences. The devastating fires that have ravaged California, Siberia, Bolivia and Chile this year, in addition to those in the Brazilian Amazon, seriously threaten biodiversity and the balance of the planet\u2019s largest ecosystem. Governments have an obligation to protect biodiversity as our common heritage and legacy for future generations.\nUruguay reaffirms its willingness to work together with all countries committed to the protection and safeguarding of the environment, in accordance with the principles established in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted in 1992, and the commitments made in the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and makes a fervent appeal to Governments to seriously address this real threat to the stability and equilibrium of the globe. In this regard, my delegation reiterates its full support for the twenty- fifth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Santiago in December, and congratulates Costa Rica on its commitment to the environment and its efforts to accelerate climate action at the pre-Conference meeting it will host in October. Given the risk that climate change poses, Uruguay has been adopting policies that place it among the most advanced countries of the world in the field, including its salient national energy policy through which it achieved generating 98 per cent of its electricity through renewable energy sources.\nAs nations, we have the responsibility of pooling our efforts to agree on educational policies that allow us to deepen the integration of climate change throughout the educational process and to contribute to increasing the awareness of our peoples with respect to the challenges it poses. Only in this way will we be better prepared to face its negative effects and therefore achieve a more resilient international society that is less vulnerable, with greater capacity to adapt to change and climate variability and more aware and responsible given the challenge. An active and conscious citizenry, with an education guided by that awareness, will act as an effective means of controlling Governments and private enterprise, thereby enhancing cooperation with the safeguarding of the environment.\nThirdly, I will address education. In order to provide quality education, it is necessary to be prepared to face the use of technology and its democratization. Rapid technological advances in artificial intelligence are transforming societies by changing the way people learn, work and live together. Education systems could use artificial intelligence to change their management, teaching and learning.\nEach of the goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires education to equip all people with the knowledge, skills and values that will enable them to live with dignity, build their own lives and contribute to the societies in which they live. However, serious difficulties unfortunately persist. According to UNESCO, 262 million children and young people do not attend primary or secondary school, and 750 million adults are illiterate, all of which contribute to increased poverty and marginalization. Aid to education has stagnated since 2010, and only one third of it is allocated to primary and secondary education in low- and middle-income countries.\nIn Uruguay, we are absolutely convinced that the key to facing those challenges lies in the universalization of education. Education is a human right \u2014 an invisible engine of sustainable development and peace. Because of Uruguay\u2019s free, secular and obligatory education, 98.6 per cent of its population is literate, 99 per cent of five-year-old children are in school and 100 per cent of its public and private primary schoolteachers are credentialled.\nUruguay has chosen to embrace the concept of transformation with equity, and within that framework, it has developed public policies that have had a direct impact on reducing the digital divide. The introduction of technology was a fundamental tool for equity and social inclusion \u2014 values that are at the heart of our digital public policies \u2014 in addition to widely known projects, such as universal access to the Internet, livestock traceability and Plan Ceibal, through which Uruguay became the first country in 2009 to ensure that every school-age child had a laptop for personal use. More recently, a new plan was launched that universalizes the use of laptops and tablets among the elderly.\nFor those reasons, it is not surprising that since February 2018 Uruguay has been part of the group of the most digitally advanced countries, the so-called Digital 9, the chairmanship of which it has held since February. The next summit of the group will be held in Montevideo in November. However, countries such as Uruguay, which are on the path to development, still need a redesigned and refocused form of cooperation to support it in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by bridging the structural gaps that still persist.\nAs Uruguayan President Tabare Vazquez did before the General Assembly last year (see A/73/PV.8), we reaffirm the concept of development in transition, and we will continue to fight so that development is no longer measured solely in terms of per capita income \u2014 an indicator that ignores the existing gaps among the various sectors of each country, denies the reality of the most vulnerable groups and poses a very serious risk of reversing the progress so laboriously achieved by our Governments on social issues. Change is in our hands. By placing human beings at the centre of public policies, we will contribute to reducing inequalities, combating poverty and making this planet a better place every day, by giving everyone hope for a better, fairer future with better opportunities, free of hunger, poverty and exclusions, and in which peace prevails."

        "file_text": "I have the honour to join the General Assembly and deliver my first speech from the most important rostrum of the United Nations. The accession of the Republic of Moldova to the United Nations, its active participation in all the institutions of the Organization and the opportunity to debate in this Hall the most important ideas, aspirations and problems are among the outstanding achievements of the people of the Republic of Moldova since 1991.\nTo begin with, I would like to congratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session and to wish him much success in fulfilling his mandate. I also express my appreciation to Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for the wonderful work she did as President at the previous session.\nI would like to take the opportunity of speaking before the Assembly to assure its members of the Republic of Moldova\u2019s full support for all the initiatives and projects launched recently by the United Nations, which are designed to solve the most complicated problems that humankind faces during what has been a tumultuous start to the century. I also take advantage of this opportunity to highlight not only the most pressing challenges currently facing the Republic of Moldova but also our vision regarding possible ways to solve them.\nAs is widely known, we are living at a time when the magnitude and number of protracted crises is constantly on the rise. Military conflicts and humanitarian crises, climate change and environmental degradation, excessive consumption of natural resources, economic imbalances and forcible and encouraged migration are real threats to the task of building a prosperous and peaceful world as set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nAgainst that backdrop, the role of the United Nations as guarantor of international peace and security, but also as a global platform for identifying common solutions to existing and emerging challenges, is paramount. Accordingly, we wish to express our support to the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for the agenda of ambitious reforms that is under way. We also wish to reaffirm our support to the preventive diplomacy he promotes with the aim of preventing crises and conflicts.\nJust over a decade away from 2030, we note with regret that poverty, hunger, inequality and social exclusion continue to affect lives and, at the global level, to fuel new conflicts. The Republic of Moldova joins the common appeal, launched at the recent High-level Political Forum on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for the international community to accelerate its efforts to achieve the targets of the 2030 Agenda.\nThrough the 2030 Agenda, we are committed to promoting sustainable development based on respect for human rights. As in the past, the Republic of Moldova is determined to continue its contribution to fulfilling the important mandates of the Human Rights Council. In that context, and with regard to one particular social issue, I would like to point out that ensuring gender equality and empowering women are crucial aspects of accelerating sustainable development, since they boost economic growth and the well-being of families, communities and the State as a whole.\nThe Republic of Moldova has made remarkable progress recently in enhancing the role of women in decision-making. Women head the Parliament and the Government of the Republic of Moldova, as well as the Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia. They also represent 65 per cent of the members of Government and 25 per cent of the members of the national Parliament. We have also not forgotten the crucial role of women in any modern society \u2014 their role as mother and preserver of the family. In order to focus the State\u2019s attention on the need to protect and stimulate the creation and preservation of families, we decreed 2019 as the Year of the Family in the Republic of Moldova.\nClimate change is a direct threat to humankind, and its effects are felt worldwide, affecting ecosystems, national economies and health-care systems. Of course, those phenomena affect my country as well. The Republic of Moldova expresses its solidarity with Mr. Guterres\u2019 call to intensify efforts to halt climate change. We are firmly convinced that the complex problems facing the peoples of the world can be solved only through joint international efforts. The realities of the current period indicate that even internal issues cannot be settled exclusively by the solitary efforts of one nation but only with the help of international partners \u2014 and that is especially the case for small countries. The example of the Republic of Moldova is representative in that regard and, to a large extent, is relevant for many States around the world.\nOver the 28 years since the declaration of our independence, my country\u2019s profile has seen some dramatic changes. During that period, the number of newborns has dropped threefold, the population remaining in the country has fallen by 30 per cent and some economic indicators have not even returned to their 1990 levels. Approximately 1 million citizens, or more than half of the economically active population, work abroad. The massive depopulation of the country has become a major problem and a real threat to the State\u2019s sustainability.\nOur society\u2019s enormous investments in human capital and the education of the labour force have yielded almost no economic return \u2014 the country is losing the competition for its labour force and our people instead create added value and pay taxes elsewhere. The root cause of those bleak developments is of course a complex one, ranging from poor governance and endemic corruption in recent years to failures in economic or inter-ethnic policies.\nHowever, from this rostrum, I will highlight what is, in my opinion, one of the key factors, which is positioning \u2014 the place of the Republic of Moldova and other regional States in the puzzle of policies and strategic interests of the major world Powers.\nI dislike using military terms, and it is certainly not the most relevant analogy. However, it would be easy to characterize our situation using the term terra nullius in the context of the geopolitical confrontations in the region. It is notable that, although no shell has exploded in our territory since the military conflict along the Nistru River in 1992, the jockeying by major geopolitical players for better positioning in the region has never ceased. In all those years, there has been no consensus between the great Powers regarding the Republic of Moldova.\nOur country is a multi-ethnic State and, by virtue of historical developments in recent centuries, the geopolitical preferences of our population are divided almost equally between East and West \u2014 between the Russian Federation and the West. That essential feature, which will remain a constant for a long time to come, has neutralized the effects of uninspired and even adventurous attempts to attract Moldova into alliances against others.\nThe country paid a high price when our politicians and national elites got involved in such dealings. First, bloodshed and disintegration followed the armed conflict in the Transnistrian region of the country. That was succeeded by economic and social degradation for several decades. Unfortunately, throughout the 28 years of the Republic of Moldova\u2019s independence, diametrically opposed geopolitical preferences have divided Moldovan society. That fact has been ably exploited by different political forces to serve exclusively interests that are alien to those of our people.\nThat is why, as President of the Republic of Moldova, I make use of every opportunity to request the de facto recognition and observance of my country\u2019s neutrality status, which is also enshrined in our Constitution. We do not want to be treated as a neutral territory anymore \u2014 which is a different designation from that of a neutral State. Any attempt to undermine that neutrality status is an unfriendly act against the people of the Republic of Moldova because it deepens the internal dissensions in the country even more dramatically. Moreover, such attempts jeopardize any chance of making progress in the settlement of the Transnistrian problem and thereby enhance security throughout the region. Our objective and absolute priority for solving the Transnistrian problem are achievable only if the Republic of Moldova preserves its military neutrality status.\nOn numerous occasions, calls for the withdrawal of foreign military troops and ammunition from the territory of the Republic of Moldova have been made from this very rostrum. I welcome the Russian Federation\u2019s latest initiatives, expressed during the recent visit to Moldova by the Russian Defence Minister, Mr. Sergey Shoygu, and the official visit to Moscow of the Moldovan Foreign Minister, Mr. Nicolae Popescu, on resuming the process of disposing the foreign ammunition stored in the Transnistrian region of our country. This important step, a first since 2003, could be instrumental in reaching a geopolitical consensus for the political settlement of the Transnistrian dispute and, more generally, for the enhancement of regional security.\nUnlike other frozen conflicts, the Transnistrian case does not have interethnic, religious or other implications that are particularly difficult to settle. Moreover, nowadays there is no hatred between the inhabitants of the two banks of the Dniester River, who interact daily in a peaceful and friendly way. At the root of the conflict were myopic policies promoted by the leaders of a previous era, aggravated by the effects of the dismantling of the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s. The nation\u2019s elites were not capable enough to face the challenges before them, and the situation deteriorated into armed conflict.\nCurrently, we are witnessing a strong predisposition among the people to identify a mutually acceptable solution to this frozen conflict. Recent progress in the effort to bring the people of both Dniester banks together materialized through the emergence of humanitarian, economic and social projects, further strengthening the desire to settle the conflict. In our opinion, all of those aspects present a good chance for great diplomats to decisively contribute to settling the frozen conflict, creating thereby a positive precedent for solving other, similar tensions across the world.\nI would like to avail myself of this opportunity to express my gratitude to all participants in the negotiation process in the Permanent Conference on Political Issues in the Framework of the Negotiation Process for the Transnistrian Settlement in the 5+2 format. I reaffirm our confidence in that negotiating format, as it is the arrangement most likely to yield an acceptable solution to a problem that is of major importance to Moldova. Under the format, the special status of the Transnistrian region, within the internationally recognized borders of a sovereign and territorially integrated Moldova that guarantees full human rights and fundamental freedoms to its people, is to be debated and agreed. We also rely on the format to identify possible support from our foreign partners in the post-settlement phase of the Transnistrian problem.\nThe Republic of Moldova has been governed since 8 June by a parliamentary coalition consisting of political parties that represent the vast majority of the country\u2019s population. It is a unique case in the history of the Republic of Moldova for two political forces with diametrically opposed doctrines and geopolitical preferences to join forces to govern and solve the pressing problems of the country. However, what is important and unprecedented for our region is that this domestic consensus is strengthened by the common position of the country\u2019s main development partners and of the great world Powers, including the Russian Federation, the United States and the European Union (EU). It is an unusual case in international politics for geopolitical forces to unite their efforts against a criminal regime that had captured an entire State.\nThis very rare situation, involving a special moment of agreement, at both the domestic and the international level, fuels our hopes for real progress on the path towards developing such needed internal reforms as justice reform and the fight against corruption, as well as the way the Transnistrian problem is to be solved.\nOne of the unifying elements of the current governing coalition in the Republic of Moldova is an awareness of the importance of and willingness to promote a balanced foreign policy with all of the country\u2019s strategic partners. The representatives of both political parties in the parliamentary majority have already established a constructive dialogue with Eastern and Western partners, essentially increasing our chances of obtaining the external support that we need. A common approach to respecting all political and economic agreements signed by the Republic of Moldova, including the Association Agreement with the EU and our cooperation with States of the Commonwealth of Independent States, is in place.\nA distinguished place in our agenda is reserved for the Republic of Moldova\u2019s relations with our neighbours and friends Romania and Ukraine. Faced with similar problems, all three of us seek to deepen our humanitarian, economic, political and social ties and explore our enormous development potential for the benefit of all our citizens. Before the new governing coalition came to power, and before the great geopolitical forces began to support the democratic changes in Chisinau, the main challenge had been whether we would really show sufficient political maturity to go further than just freeing the State from the hands of oligarchs. I am firmly convinced that this unprecedented domestic and foreign consensus could and should be used by all of us to make real changes in the quality of life for our citizens, find a solution to the Transnistrian problem and give the Republic of Moldova a new chance to prosper.\nThe Republic of Moldova is a multi-ethnic country inhabited by representatives of approximately 125 ethnic groups. A third of the population considers itself Russian-speaking. In Moldova the Russian language, one of the six official languages of the United Nations, is considered to be the language of interethnic communication. As President of the Republic, I believe that the main task before the recently formed parliamentary majority, which is supported by 80 per cent of the country\u2019s population and by our Western and Eastern strategic partners, is to create a single legal, democratic, mutual multi-ethnic State that ensures every inhabitant with a decent standard of living and justified confidence in the future.\nWe will be on friendly terms and interact well with all of our partners. The either/or policy with respect to the Republic of Moldova, pursued in recent years by a number of major Powers, has clearly been revealed as empty and inadequate. I support the concept of a united Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok, where Moldova, as a European State, will play a special role.\nLet me re-emphasize that, as the Head of State, I am an active supporter of a balanced foreign policy for my country and I am ready to comprehensively promote mutually beneficial cooperation with all States Members of the United Nations with which we have established diplomatic relations. For the Moldovan people and the peoples of other Member States, peace is the main value. We strive to ensure peaceful coexistence with our neighbours and good relations with our development partners.\nOur intention is to strengthen the stability and security of the Republic of Moldova, maintain the constitutional status of permanent neutrality of our State and strive for its recognition at the international level, following the model of such countries as Austria. In that context, the example of military neutrality of certain States like Austria can be a relevant model for the Republic of Moldova. However, neutrality does not mean isolation. Moldova will therefore continue to strengthen its multilateral cooperation with Russia, the United States, the European Union, its neighbours and other States.\nI believe that the key to success lies in promoting the concept of the internationally recognized military neutrality of the Republic of Moldova, completing the removal and disposal of ammunition left in the territory since the Soviet era and the full and final withdrawal of foreign troops from the State that I have the honour to represent at this high tribune. Upon reaching the final political settlement of the Transnistrian conflict, there will be no need for a peacekeeping mission in our territory.\nAs my address draws to a close, I want to emphasize once again the importance of maintaining the consensus of the main geopolitical actors with regard to the Republic of Moldova. Only in such circumstances can we improve the chances of solving the severe problems facing my country, including the Transnistrian problem.\nI am very confident that such an effort, with the support of the Russian Federation and the West, could radically change the profile of my country, about which I spoke with such great concern at the beginning of my address.\nI reaffirm the commitment of the Republic of Moldova to approaches the United Nations is taking with respect to the main problems humankind faces today. The Republic of Moldova remains firmly committed to observing the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the vision of sustainable development that is anchored in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nOur determination is based on our full awareness of the imperative of forging solidarity among nations in the face of modern challenges. We are a few hundred peoples and countries, but we have one planet \u2014 one home \u2014 which we must care for together, regardless of our place under the sun.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour for me to and stand at this prestigious rostrum today to represent my fellow countrywomen and men and address distinguished colleagues and partners in the General Assembly.\nI am even more proud today because just two days ago, approximately 3 million Afghans, facing the threat of terrorism, risked their lives to vote in our young democracy\u2019s fourth presidential election. Those who voted included men and women, the very elderly, some voting for perhaps the last time, and the very young, those voting for the very first of many times, as well as those living with a disability, for whom the journey was longer and more tiresome, and some who came out despite having had their fingers cut off by the Taliban during previous votes. We all voted not just for a president, but also for democracy. We voted for our Constitution. We voted for freedom and sovereignty. We voted for prosperity and connectivity. We voted for peace. We voted for the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. I congratulate my fellow Afghans on exercising their right to vote.\nI also wholeheartedly thank the brave and professional Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) for protecting that right. Some 70,000 of our brave soldiers protected citizens during this historic event. Because of their professionalism, most attacks \u2014 and all attacks that were intended to inflict mass casualties on civilians \u2014 were averted.\nI also congratulate and thank my fellow citizens of the world. The international community, particularly the member countries of NATO, has stood by us over the past two decades. As we recovered from war, we rebuilt and reimagined a new Afghanistan \u2014 a new Afghanistan based on Islamic values, Afghan traditions and hope for a permanent escape from our bloody past. Members of the international community has invested heavily and dearly in our vision for an Afghan democracy, even with the lives of their own countrymen and women, from the time when it was only an idea, to today, when we can witness that those investments have been turned into policies, actions, institutions, principles and people. We, the young Afghan leaders of today, have embraced democratic values and principles, the same principles on which the United Nations itself was founded.\nI congratulate you, Mr. President, on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- fourth session, and we support the broad range of goals you are pursuing in the agenda of the General Assembly \u2014 advancing peace and security, enhancing equal education, eradicating poverty and addressing climate change. We also commend the efforts and leadership of the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces.\nTwo years ago, His Excellency President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani stood on this platform at the seventy- second session of the General Assembly and spoke of the uncertainty that challenged the global community with questions that we must confront together to find solutions (see A/72/PV.6). Since then, Afghans have created a bit more certainty in our corner of the world. We Afghans have confirmed our commitment to democracy and peace. The ANDSF has proven itself to be a solid and professional institution able to protect our democratic process, and the international community has taken a firm stand in solidarity with the Afghan people and their Government.\nBut uncertainty still lies with those who stand in the way of peace. To the Taliban and their foreign sponsors, I would transmit this message from the Afghan people: join us in peace, or we will continue to fight. As my colleague Ambassador Adela Raz said at the United Nations last week, this is a fight we can win.\nToday, I represent my people not only because it is my duty to do so but because I, like the vast majority \u2014 about 60 per cent \u2014 of my fellow citizens, have spent three and half decades of our lives in war. My colleagues, Ambassador Adela Raz and Ambassador Roya Rahmani, the latter of whom represents us in Washington, are also part of this generation born and raised in war. We are the new Afghanistan.\nIncreasingly, Afghanistan is now more than ever a country driven and defined by the expectations of its youth. The opportunities afforded to us through the gains of the past 20 years have allowed us to change hope into something much more powerful: belief. We believe in our ability to bring about the peace that we have hoped for all of our lives. We have already taken many steps, but we have a long way to go on this journey. The next step belongs to us Afghans. No matter the outcome of the presidential elections, one thing is clear \u2014 peace is and will remain the Government\u2019s priority, now further strengthened by the mandate given to us by the Afghan people.\nThe next step in the journey to peace will be taken by Afghans, just as the first step was. In February 2018, President Ashraf Ghani extended an unconditional offer of peace to the Taliban, one that still stands today. In June 2018, the unthinkable happened \u2014 a nationwide three-day ceasefire over the Eid holidays. Those days gave Afghans tremendous belief that peace is possible and proved that the Government has the ability to directly negotiate peace with our enemies. In November 2018, President Ghani presented the Government\u2019s road map to peace and announced a negotiating team. As 2019 began, Afghanistan\u2019s journey towards peace continued with nationwide consultations with the Afghan people.\nIn this context, I would like to give credit to Afghan women, who were the first group of Afghan citizens to unite nationally around the agenda for peace. In February, 15,000 women were consulted from all 34 provinces on what would be acceptable to them in a\npeace agreement, and 3,000 of them came together in Kabul to endorse that agenda.\nIn April, the Afghan Government organized a historic nationwide consultative jirga for peace, which laid out the people\u2019s demands for a peace agreement. Each of these has been a significant step in an ongoing Afghan-led process that is geared toward an inclusive, sustainable and dignified peace for all Afghans.\nAs we prepare to take the next step in this process, we are committed to the principles of inclusiveness, sustainability and dignity. The Afghan people have demanded a ceasefire to immediately stop the bloodshed. They have also demanded that talks happen among Afghans and that the Islamic Republic be preserved as the foundation of our nation State. We want not to only preserve the gains that we have made but to maintain the foundation that will allow us to further advance those gains.\nThroughout the process, we have welcomed and appreciated the assistance from our international partners. This assistance has been aligned with our principles of peacebuilding and supported our Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process. Peace is our common objective, and terrorists are our common enemy. We must not rush the former, at the risk of empowering the latter. I would like to thank our international friends and partners that have supported our peace efforts, including the United States of America, the European Union, Germany, Norway, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia and Uzbekistan, among many others.\nToday, Afghans fight on the front lines of global terrorism so that others can maintain peace in their homes and on their land. But peace is not a permanent state of being. Peace requires care and constant reappraisal undertaken by partners who share the same values, even as the fault lines between war and peace across the globe shift. The terrorists that Afghan soldiers are holding at bay today pose a threat to us all.\nTerrorism is an idea as much as it is a form of violence. We must continue to work together to extinguish the ideologies behind terrorism, wherever they may exist. The zero-tolerance approach that has been repeatedly called for must no longer be a talking point and instead become an action point. We need more institutional cooperation. We need more decisive action within the region.\nA strengthened collective security approach must take into account the wide nexus of transnational criminal activities as a whole, with a view to stemming the flow of terrorist fighters as well as their recruitment and the resources that allow them to remain lethal. Fighting terrorism is the basis of our critical partnership with the United States and our NATO partners \u2014 one to which Afghanistan remains firmly committed. I pay tribute to all those members of the military who have lost their lives, and their families, including our brave ANDSF and our partners who have fought shoulder to shoulder with us, including 2,438 soldiers from the United States and all others who have stood by us and paid the ultimate sacrifice. We Afghans will never forget their sacrifices, and we thank them for standing with us.\nAs the discussions at this General Assembly have shown, terrorism and conflict are only a couple of today\u2019s many threats. The detrimental effects of climate change and the global humanitarian crisis are also priorities \u2014 ones that we face on a daily basis in Afghanistan. These challenges will be tackled only by ensuring a new scale and scope of international cooperation. We need to look beyond the prism of individual interests if we are to address these challenges and meet the Sustainable Development Goals. Afghanistan has invested in the fulfilment of these goals, aligning them with our own national development agenda \u2014 the Afghanistan sustainable development goals. These goals are embedded within the Afghanistan national peace and development framework and our national priority programmes.\nWith a predominantly agricultural economy, Afghanistan has felt the enormous adverse effects of climate change. For our people, prolonged drought has been a matter of life and death, driving many from their homes and into severe poverty. Climate change is an issue to which we are still struggling to find long-term solutions, while simultaneously providing immediate humanitarian relief to those affected. Last week\u2019s Climate Action Summit reaffirmed the urgency with which new measures are needed in order to mitigate the effects of this threat. We will continue these important discussions in the upcoming Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which will take place in Chile in December.\nI want to conclude with a forward-looking message centred on the promise of the United Nations. Afghanistan\u2019s journey in re-emerging from the rubble and making steady progress is testament to the importance of international and multilateral cooperation. This year, Afghanistan celebrated the centenary of the restoration of its full sovereignty. Over the past two decades, the United Nations has helped us to build our democracy. We now stand confidently on its strong foundation, and we continue to advance toward self-reliance, prosperity and peace. The new Afghanistan continues to transform itself into a centre of cooperation, connectivity and development in our region. Afghan-led initiatives, such as the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process and the Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan, are already paying economic dividends, opening new frontiers for trade and the movement of goods, people and ideas throughout South and Central Asia. We can now say that Afghan democracy is a success story that belongs not only to Afghans, but to all of us at the United Nations.\nTime has witnessed our progress, but time remains a source of agony for us. Afghans agonize over the death of each of our compatriots. We lament each moment of time that takes an Afghan life in its passing. Our mission now is to bring about a peace that can end the suffering of all Afghans. Only when we have peace will each and every Afghan be able to experience the freedoms and opportunities of the democracy we have sacrificed so much to build. And no Afghan will truly be able to live in peace and freedom until the day when every single Afghan lives in peace and freedom. That is the day we live and work for \u2014 the day we know we will achieve in solidarity with our international friends and partners. It is the day that we no longer hope for, but that we believe in."

        "file_text": "Next year we will celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. This fundamental cornerstone of the international rules-based order, along with other important building blocks, has served us well. We live in a world that has become ever more interconnected, and the most demanding challenges of our times call for even greater unity and global action.\nNevertheless, that architecture is being tried and tested. It remains our responsibility to ensure that the principles, rights and obligations enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, including safeguarding peace and promoting development and human rights, are fulfilled and carried out in good faith. History tells us that those goals are best achieved in open democracies in which fundamental freedoms are respected and individuals and nation-States are allowed to prosper, and most importantly, in which politicians are accountable for their words and deeds, both at home and abroad. We need to safeguard the international rules-based system, with the United Nations at the helm. But we also need to pursue reforms if the system is no longer serving the very ideals on which it was founded or is even rewarding States that violate our principles.\nSmall and medium-size States, which in fact constitute the vast majority of the States Members of the United Nations, should not shy away from taking on a more active role on the global scene. For its part, Iceland is prepared to shoulder its responsibility and has steadily increased its contributions to United Nations funds and programmes. We have also taken on a more active role within various United Nations and other international and regional bodies. Last year Iceland became a member of the Human Rights Council for the first time. It is a privilege and a responsibility that we take seriously. Upholding human rights and treating one another with respect and fairness are part of the basic DNA for progress, peace and development. During its tenure on the Council, Iceland has actively promoted gender equality, children\u2019s rights and the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals. We have also advocated for much-needed reform in the work and composition of the Council, where we continue to see certain Member States elected as full members and passing judgment and casting votes on issues abroad while their own human rights records at home should be on trial. The Human Rights Council is the focal point and driving force for protecting and promoting human rights and ensuring that all States honour the commitments that they have voluntarily signed up to. While it is true that Member States are diverse and face different challenges, regional groups and Member States should make sure that those serving on the Council are truly committed to upholding human rights.\nIn Iceland, our experience shows that both individuals\u2019 rights and human rights are essential to positive economic and social development. That is particularly true for gender equality, which has enabled our society to prosper and thrive. But this is not a competition. Our goals should be shared, in order to ensure that women everywhere can realize their individual strengths and pave the way for achieving a sustainable development that leaves no one behind. Next year, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action will provide an important opportunity to reflect on our progress and shortcomings and to chart the way forward.\nIceland is committed to pursuing and implementing the Sustainable Development Goals, both at home and through international cooperation. For Icelanders, sustainability is not a new concept. We began using geothermal power to heat our houses more than a century ago. And decades ago we realized that our essential fish stocks would have to be protected and harvested in a sustainable way. Sustainability has been the key to our survival for a long time, and that is not going to change. In July we presented our first voluntary national review. So far, the sustainable development record seems a mixed one, but important achievements have been made in some areas, including gender equality, child mortality and communicable diseases. However, we need greater efforts and more research in order to address non-communicable diseases and neurological disorders, including spinal-cord injuries, which affect as many as a billion people worldwide. Iceland will continue to promote cooperation in research and raise awareness in that important field.\nIceland will also continue to share its insights and expertise in the areas of renewable energy, gender equality, land restoration and fisheries, all of which can act as powerful levers for sustainable development. United Nations training programmes in Iceland have played an important role by exporting know-how in all of those fields, but there are still many untapped opportunities for closer partnerships to be developed in trade, development and business. Such synergies should be promoted, and it remains my firm belief that open, fair and free trade is the single most important driver of economic growth and stability and for breaking the bonds of poverty. We must ensure that all States can reap the benefits of the multilateral trading system, and we must build bridges, not barriers, if we want to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\nClimate change is one of the most important challenges of our times, if not the most important. It affects global security, sustainable development, the health of our environment and ultimately human civilization. That is not a distant abstraction but a stark reality. In the Arctic, including in my country, we are witnessing glaciers melting and vanishing, and our seas and marine life are rapidly changing. And let us keep in mind that these developments in the world\u2019s northernmost region have global repercussions. What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic.\nIceland is firmly committed to reaching the goals of the Paris Climate Change Agreement by 2030. We have done quite well so far, with almost 100 per cent of our electricity and heating now based on renewables. But we can do even better, and we are therefore aiming to reach full carbon neutrality by 2040. Climate change and the health of our oceans are a key priority in our foreign policy, including in the Arctic Council and the Nordic Council, which Iceland currently chairs. More than 70 per cent of the surface of our planet is covered by water, and yet we tend to think of climate change only in connection with the atmosphere. Our oceans are of crucial importance to any meaningful discussion on climate change and have too often been on the margins instead of at the centre. Climate change is also ocean change.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the global constitution for our oceans, is the most important tool for ensuring the conservation and sustainable use of our marine environment. It is our firm belief that more effective implementation of the Convention, along with regional management of the conservation and sustainable use of our oceans, is the best way to ensure their long-term health. A new international legally binding instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction is being negotiated at the United Nations, and could become an important tool for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity on our high seas if it is based on consensus and universal participation.\nThe fight against climate change should begin at home, but high-income countries should also support lower-income countries in addressing the causes and consequences of climate change. That is an areas for focus in Iceland\u2019s new development cooperation policy, and earlier this week my Government announced that we will double our contribution to the Green Climate Fund. We should also bear in mind that some of the most effective solutions are low-cost, simple and nature-based solutions such as land restoration. And we should work more effectively with the private sector to achieve our common goals. In that connection, the Climate Action Summit earlier this week was an important event. We must now build on the momentum and push for further action. We have no time to spare.\nThe connection between climate change, human rights, development and security is evident in many conflicts and demands a holistic approach. We support the Secretary-General\u2019s in-house reform agenda and believe it will make the United Nations more fit for purpose. However, the Security Council, and not least its permanent members, must take a more active role in preventing and resolving these crises and live up to its responsibilities, as enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We must act and make full use of the tools available to hold to account those responsible for breaking international law, including bringing them before the International Criminal Court.\nIn Syria there seems no end to the carnage. Attacks on civilians have been occurring on a regular basis, leaving the country in ruins and large parts of its population displaced. With the current surge in fighting in Yemen, there is a real risk that the hard-won gains of the efforts to establish peace and political progress will be ruined, again adding to the already immense suffering of the civil population. The regional power brokers that are fuelling tensions and funding the warring parties must step back in support of a peaceful political process. In that context, the recent drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, which have intensified an already intense situation, are very worrying.\nThe fighting in Libya also continues and a ceasefire is urgently needed to pave the way for the United Nations-supported political process. The issue of Western Sahara remains unresolved, and developments in Israel and Palestine seem to take us ever further from a two-State solution, the only viable way to achieve peaceful coexistence. In Venezuela, the appalling humanitarian situation, driven deeper and deeper by the Maduro regime, continues to be of great concern, with 4.3 million people fleeing the country and its ongoing crisis. In Myanmar, we must keep our focus on the plight of the Rohingya population. Nor have we forgotten the blatant disregard for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and Georgia. Those and, sadly, other protracted conflicts, amid the growing distrust between major Powers, call for greater commitment, creative thinking and the allocation of more resources, both to the traditional arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation agenda and to emerging technologies, cybersecurity and hybrid threats.\nThe great generation that built the United Nations after the horrors of the Second World War is gradually leaving us, a generation that witnessed the arms race and the worst tensions of the Cold War and fought for many of our civil liberties. Their legacy will never die. As we celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of this great Organization next year, we should remember their achievements, but we should also look ahead and into our hearts and discuss how we can best promote the values and principles of the United Nations. We must never forget that our rules-based international system is based on determination and awareness that derive from one of the greatest tragedies in human history. We must never take it for granted.\n"

        "file_text": "Last year, I had the honour to stand before the General Assembly (see A/73/PV.13). At that time, I argued against the then- draft global compact for migration, which was still to be adopted. What has happened since then? Last December, in this very Hall (see A/73/PV.60), the General Assembly endorsed the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (resolution 73/195). Since then, increasing numbers of people have been hitting the road, and new migratory flows are being launched, posing additional security challenges to countries of origin, transit and destination. The most recent developments are frightening. It is therefore no wonder that the issue of migration again rules European and global political agendas.\nOne would expect the United Nations and other international organizations to promote and protect international law, to help those who respect and comply with international law and to take a stand against those who violate it. That is our expectation, especially when it comes to fundamental rights. We can and should raise the question: is migration a fundamental human right? The answer is: no, it is not. But what does the United Nations do? The United Nations promotes migration, which we consider truly disappointing.\nGoing forward, we could raise another question: If migration is not among the fundamental human rights, then what is? The answer is the following: Everyone in the world has the right to live in peaceful, safe and secure circumstances in his or her home. Does the Global Compact for Migration say anything about these people? Does it protect their rights? The answer is, unfortunately, no \u2014 a resounding no. Therefore, instead of protecting the actual fundamental human rights of people, the Global Compact for Migration promotes migration, which is not a fundamental human right but a dangerous phenomenon that increases security risks worldwide. We find that to be unacceptable.\nLast year, there was an attempt here in the United Nations to celebrate the Global Compact for Migration as the best document ever concluded in the history of the United Nations. But this attempt failed. The United States, Israel, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland voted against the Compact, with Brazil later joining those States. These six votes against prevented the adoption by unanimity of resolution 73/195, and we made it clear then that the Global Compact was the most dangerous document ever created in the United Nations. The past year has, unfortunately, proved us right.\nDuring the debate, some tricks were played. There were false explanations and references given, statements that it would not be a legally binding document although the words \u201ccommit\u201d and \u201ccommitment\u201d appear in the text 80 times. Over the past year, many attempts have been made here to push the Global Compact for Migration through, part by part, chapter by chapter. Many documents on our agenda contain references to the Compact, sometimes in a surreptitious way, sometimes in an open way. Is this how the Compact is supposed to be made part of international law? I must tell the Assembly that we reject such attempts and urge all United Nations institutions to stop such attempts: stop referring to the Compact in United Nations documents and stop pushing the Compact through in a surreptitious way. I also want to make it clear that we will in future reject all United Nations declarations, documents and resolutions containing any reference to the Global Compact for Migration in whole or in part.\nLet us consider what has happened in Europe in recent years. Due to the irresponsible and harmful migration policy of Brussels, more than 1 million illegal migrants entered the territory of Europe. Many people died in the Mediterranean. Perilous societies have arisen in Western Europe, where a noisy minority continuously and increasingly puts pressure on the silent majority. Terrorist threats have increased. The more than 30 significant terrorist attacks that have been committed in Europe by persons with a migratory background in recent years are the result of the hypocritical, ideologically motivated policy promulgated by Brussels. This policy puts pressures countries to get rid of national identity and cultural, religious and historic heritage in order to weaken member States and finally create a united States of Europe. But this is something that we reject.\nWe want the European Union to be strong again, but this can happen only when its member States themselves are strong. We are proud that Hungary is a strong country again. We are proud that we have been able to preserve Hungary as a Hungarian country. We are proud of our history. We are proud to be a 1,019-year- old State, among the oldest in Europe. We are proud to be a nation with a strong Christian heritage. We are proud of Christianity\u2019s role in creating and maintaining our statehood. And we are proud to be true patriots, for whom Hungary comes first and for whom the national interest serves as a compass.\nWe base our foreign policy strategy on a principle called mutual respect. We respect our partners and their history, heritage and the decisions of their citizens. And we expect the same from our partners: that they respect our sovereignty and our specificities, which are based on our very rich history. And we expect our partners to respect the right of Hungarians to take decisions about their own country and its future.\nHungarians have made very clear decisions, on multiple occasions: that we do not want to receive illegal migrants, that we reject all external pressure in this regard, and that we preserve our right to make our own decisions as to whom to allow to enter the territory of our country and whom we do not allow. It is our sole prerogative to decide with whom we would and would not like to live in our country. As this is the express will of the Hungarian people, it is therefore our national interest. For us, fulfilling our national interest is our number one duty.\nUnfortunately, based on recent developments in the European Union \u2014 opening ports to illegal migrants and debating yet again obligatory quotas for the resettlement of migrants \u2014 we must strengthen our efforts to protect our people and security. If we look at the migration situation in South-Eastern Europe today, it is comparable to that of 2015. Many countries, international organizations and, of course, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) inspire people in need to go to Europe. These people get the inspiration to pay thousands of dollars to smugglers. These people get the inspiration to board derelict vessels. And they get the inspiration to expect NGOs to come and take them illegally to Europe.\nNow, another question can be raised, I suppose, and with very good reason: who benefits from this? The answer is obvious: smugglers and organized criminal groups definitely benefit from all of this because they earn millions; and terrorist organizations benefit, too, because massive uncontrolled flows of migrants give terrorist organizations the chance to send their fighters all over the world.\nThe second part of this question is, who loses under such policies? Without a doubt, countries of origin lose, because if people are going far away from countries of origin, they will never return. The question then becomes, who will reconstruct and rebuild those countries? Transit also countries lose. If we look at the Western Balkans, we see migrants occupying public areas. They behave aggressively. In some schools, teachers were not able to begin teaching their classes in September. This is very similar to what we experienced first-hand in Hungary back in 2015, when 400,000 illegal migrants marched through the heart of the country, behaving in a very aggressive way, attacking our police, occupying public areas and blocking traffic on railway lines and highways. The countries of destination lose as well. And the people themselves lose because they put their lives at risk. If we look once again at how many people have died in the Mediterranean because of this very irresponsible policy being interpreted as an invitation.\nEverybody therefore loses. Everybody takes serious risks \u2014 except for the smugglers and terrorists organizations. I believe the United Nations should not do this. The United Nations should not encourage migratory waves; rather it should play a leading role in resolving conflicts, in helping countries to develop, in helping African countries to build capacity, because Africa can be the continent of the future, but only if we build capacities to keep people at home under appropriate circumstances. The United Nations should help those who have fled to return home as soon as possible. We should carry out reconstruction projects. We should guarantee the physical and legal security of those who had to flee and would like to return to their homes. We should help countries to protect themselves from negative shocks and security risks.\nThe United Nations should also help countries to ensure the security and safety of their own citizens. That is exactly what Hungary has been doing. We respect our obligations as a State to protect our citizens and guarantee them a safe and secure life, which is why we strictly and steadfastly protect our borders, allowing no illegal trespassing. The only way to come to Europe should be the legal way. The only way to come to Hungary is the legal way. We reject the approach that we should allow people to violate our borders. Why should we let people violate our borders? What humanitarian or legal reason would impel us to allow anybody to violate a border between two safe and peaceful countries?\nIndeed, border protection is a national security issue, and the United Nations should not act against the national security interests of any Member State. Unfortunately, the United Nations promotes the idea of allowing people to violate borders between peaceful countries. We expect the United Nations to consider the violation of a border as a serious criminal offence that should be prevented and punished instead of promoted and encouraged. We expect the United Nations to stop portraying NGOs as legitimate representatives of nations because they are not. Elected politicians represent their nations; Governments, not NGOs, are authorized by their peoples to act. I myself have never seen any NGO run in an election. In fact, it is to Governments and elected officials that people entrust authority. That is why Governments and elected politicians have the right to speak on behalf of nations and on behalf of peoples.\nWe read the Global Compact for Migration to provide that all countries must in future become either a country of origin, a country of transit or a country of destination. We reject this notion. We believe there is a fourth category: there are countries, such as Hungary, that do not wish to be a country of origin, transit or destination. And we have the right to so decide.\nWe urge the United Nations to stop portraying migration as the best development ever for humankind. We do not look at migration as the best instrument for addressing demographic and labour-market challenges. Let us leave it up to Member States to make sovereign decisions in this domain.\nWe in Hungary support our families and continuously modernize education instead of encouraging migration. And this approach works. The proof is that we are now number one in the European Union in terms of gross domestic product growth and we have reached full employment. We must also dispel another suggestion going around here, stating that multicultural societies are by definition better than homogeneous societies. We Hungarians do not feel less valuable just because we are not a multicultural society. We should leave it up to sovereign nations to decide how they want to live their lives.\nLet us provide help where it is needed and avoid causing problems where there are none. This is our principle. We must help people stay in their home countries with human dignity and help those having fled to return to their homes as soon as possible because this is what international law prescribes.\nWe Hungarians have spent $40 million to help Christian communities in the Middle East \u2014 in Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. We have rebuilt thousands of demolished houses and dozens of razed churches. We are covering the medical costs in the largest Christian hospitals in Syria. We have been rebuilding schools. Through these efforts, we have helped more than 50,000 people to be able to remain in their home country or to return as soon as possible. Through this programme of helping Christian communities, we wish to draw the attention of the international community to the fact that Christianity is the most persecuted religion the world over.\nIn order to help those countries currently unable to retain their populations, this year, we have increased our financial support to the least developed countries sevenfold, to $29 million, and, this year, we have increased our financial support to Africa fivefold, to $25 million dollars. I believe it is crucial for young people to be involved in these efforts. Capacity-building is of the utmost importance, which is why we are providing 4,870 scholarships to students from least developed countries in Asia, Africa and South America to gain the competitive knowledge and skills that contribute to strengthening their own countries when they return home. We do this because our top priority must be to help all people to enjoy a safe and secure life in their home countries. This is what international law requires and what responsible behaviour dictates.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly and to wish him every success in discharging his important duties. Mr. Muhammad- Bande can count on full support of the Republic of Azerbaijan for the duration of his tenure. My delegation is also grateful to Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her tremendous work in presiding over the Assembly during its seventy-third session. We are also grateful to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his efforts to reform the Organization and make it more integrated, effective and efficient.\nThe threats and challenges facing the world today demand our joint efforts to strengthen the international legal order and rekindle faith in multilateralism and confidence in the United Nations. Preserving the values of multilateralism and international cooperation, which underpin the Charter of the United Nations, is fundamental to promoting and supporting the three pillars of our Organization, namely, peace and security, development and human rights. It is our common duty, therefore, to promote and support a reformed, reinvigorated and strengthened multilateral system. The objective of ensuring a peaceful, just and prosperous world is hardly achievable if the universally accepted fundamental values, norms and principles are overtly disregarded so as to whitewash aggression and other illegal actions.\nIn that connection, accountability and the implementation of the resolutions adopted by the principal organs of the United Nations \u2014 the Security Council and the General Assembly \u2014 acquire significant importance. Evident disregard for Security Council resolutions containing binding demands cannot be an accepted practice if the Council is to discharge its primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security.\nThe United Nations, which was established to prevent war and human suffering by binding all its Members through a common rules-based order, plays a central role in ensuring that all involved in addressing peace and security concerns uphold the uniform application of the purposes and principles of our Organization. Supporting that role of the United Nations is crucial to maintaining peace, stability and sustainable development.\nOne of the strongest advocates of multilateralism in the contemporary international relations system is the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. We look forward to hosting the next Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, which will be held in Baku next month, on 25 and 26 October. Throughout its history, the Non-Aligned Movement has played a fundamental role in strengthening international peace and security by promoting adherence to its Bandung Principles. Azerbaijan\u2019s chairmanship will provide additional impetus for advancing the founding principles of the Movement, the sixty-fifth anniversary of which will be celebrated in 2020.\nAs we move forward on the path to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we must regularly assess to what extent we are delivering on our commitments. Sustainable efforts backed by adequate resources are essential to secure a bright future for our people and ensure that no one is left behind. Yesterday, Azerbaijan became a member of the Group of 77 and stands ready to actively contribute to efforts to ensure sustainable development through the promotion of economic cooperation.\nAzerbaijan has maintained its sustainable economic growth and made consistent efforts to improve the living standards of its citizens. Through the successful implementation of economic development programmes over the past 15 years, Azerbaijan\u2019s economy has developed at a record pace, with a gross domestic product (GDP) 3.3 times that of its initial GDP. Over the same period, industrial production has increased 2.6 times, exports 4.7 times and foreign exchange reserves 24 times, reaching up to $45 billion.\nThe social sphere has always been in the spotlight. This year, the Government adopted a social package that covers more than 4 million people, in a country of 10 million people. Social investments over the past 15 years resulted in a poverty rate decrease from 49 per cent in 2004 to less than 5 per cent in 2019. Over the same period, the unemployment rate dropped from 10.6 per cent to less than 5 per cent.\nThe World Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2019 report lists Azerbaijan among the top 10 leading reformers. Our favourable business climate attracted investments of about $250 billion in the Azerbaijani economy over the past 15 years, half of which are foreign investments.\nAzerbaijan contributes to regional development efforts by promoting connectivity, bringing together continents and creating platforms for mutually beneficial cooperation. Despite being a land-locked country, Azerbaijan has transformed into an important international transportation hub.\nAzerbaijan attaches particular importance to the promotion of cultural diversity. All ethnic and religious groups live in Azerbaij an in peace and harmony. In recent years, we have hosted several major global events and launched a number of initiatives aimed at strengthening dialogue and mutual understanding. Among such initiatives is the World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue, which has been recognized by the General Assembly and the Secretary-General as a key global platform for promoting intercultural dialogue.\nHaving one of the youngest age distributions among the European countries, the Government places special emphasis on the full realization of the future generation\u2019s potential by offering quality education and decent job opportunities. A new employment strategy for Azerbaijan for the period 2019 to 2030 has set 13 targets for 2030. Those targets aim to reduce unemployment among young people, improve vocational education and training and increase employment in small and medium enterprises.\nAzerbaijan continues to strive to ensure gender equality and empower women in their public and social lives. I am pleased to announce that we are currently developing a national action plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security.\nAs an emerging donor country, Azerbaij an continues to lend international humanitarian and development assistance to a number of countries through the Heydar Aliyev Foundation and the Azerbaijan International Development Agency. Particular attention is being paid to addressing the needs of developing and least developed countries.\nThe existential threat of climate change is becoming more real with every hurricane, wildfire and centimetre of sea-level rise. Azerbaijan is highly sensitive to the effects of climate change and is already facing negative impacts, such as floods, droughts and heat waves. My country is a party to major international agreements on climate action, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, its Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Our national policies and strategies have been adapted to be in line with those international instruments. The Government has taken important steps to minimize carbon dioxide emissions and has pledged to reduce them by 35 per cent by 2030.\nIt is well known that the Republic of Armenia\u2019s aggression against the Republic of Azerbaijan has resulted in the occupation of almost one fifth of my country\u2019s territory and the expulsion of more than 1 million Azerbaijanis from their homes and properties. The unresolved conflict continues to undermine international and regional peace and security. It is very important to note that, since last year\u2019s general debate, no progress has been achieved in the political settlement of the conflict.\nDespite direct contacts between the leaders of the two countries and meetings of Foreign Ministers over the past two years, the apparent lack of genuine interest by Armenia\u2019s leadership impedes the conflict resolution process. On the contrary, Yerevan, in words and deeds, has derailed the process and sabotaged the efforts for finding a peaceful settlement as soon as possible. The recent statements by the Prime Minister of Armenia and the members of his Government leave no doubt as to their annexationist intentions, in clear disregard of international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nIn his statements delivered recently, including at the General Assembly here in New York, the Prime Minister of Armenia publicly disclosed his Government\u2019s strategy in negotiations \u2014 \u201cto defend the outcomes of the war\u201d. In fact, what the leadership of Armenia intends to defend is the unacceptable status quo created through the unlawful use of force and the resulting occupation of the internationally recognized territories of Azerbaijan, accompanied by heinous crimes against humanity, war crimes and acts of genocide committed against the Azerbaijani civilian population and the total ethnic cleansing of all non-Armenians within the occupied territories.\nIn unanimously adopted resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993), the Security Council condemned the use of force against Azerbaijan, the occupation of its territories, the attacks on civilians and the bombardment of inhabited areas. In addition, it reaffirmed respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, the inviolability of international borders and the inadmissibility of the use of force for the acquisition of territory. Through its resolutions and in response to territorial claims and forcible actions, the Council confirmed that the Nagorno Karabakh region is an integral part of Azerbaijan and demanded the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces from all the occupied territories. Relevant General Assembly resolutions and numerous decisions and documents adopted by other authoritative international organizations are framed along the same lines.\nNevertheless, key Security Council demands, unfortunately, remain unimplemented. Instead, despite early warnings and condemnation by the international community, and against the background of ongoing efforts to reach a political settlement to the conflict, deliberate actions are being carried out in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan with a view to changing their demographic, cultural and physical character. Such actions include the implantation of settlers, the destruction and appropriation of historical and cultural heritage, and the exploitation and pillage of, and illicit trade in, assets, natural resources and other wealth in the occupied territories. Those actions constitute a clear violation of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and the 1977 Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions, amounting to war crimes and entailing State and individual criminal responsibility under international law.\nIt is abundantly clear that such policies and practices can in no way be reconciled with the objectives of achieving a peaceful resolution of the conflict, thereby necessitating the urgent action of the United Nations and the wider international community in order to defend the values, norms and principles of rules-based and civilized inter-State relations, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe primary objective of the ongoing peace process is to eliminate the consequences of the war unleashed by Armenia, thereby ensuring the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces from all the occupied territories of Azerbaijan \u2014 as called for in the Security Council resolutions \u2014 the restoration of the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan within its internationally recognized borders and the return of the forcibly displaced persons to their homes and properties \u2014 again, as enshrined in the Council\u2019s resolutions. The achievement of that objective is a must and is not subject to compromise.\nAzerbaijan remains committed to the earliest- possible political settlement of the conflict. At the same time, negotiations cannot last forever and imply a continuation and sustainment of the situation created as a result of the unlawful use of force, occupation and ethnic cleansing. Nor can they prejudice the realization of the inherent right of self-defence under the Charter and international law. Rather than wasting time on attempts to mislead the international community and its own people, Armenia must drop its losing attempts to prolong the unsustainable status quo and faithfully comply with its international obligations. The sooner Yerevan realizes the lack of any prospects for its destructive political agenda, the sooner all peoples of the region will be able to benefit from peace, stability and cooperation and the better the chances for Armenia to overcome the serious political, economic and social burdens it is facing due to its aggressive and hostile policies in the region."

        "file_text": "Allow me first to congratulate Ambassador Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session.\nIt is a great pleasure for me to address the General Assembly for the first time as the leader of the people who first developed the values that most of the modern world embraces \u2014 democracy, individual rights and equal justice under law.\nFor the past decade, however, the story of the Greek people has suffered a series of misfortunes that have tested the will and mettle of our nation. But we struggled and persevered and this past summer we opened a new chapter in our enduring saga that will show once again what we are made of as a people and as a nation.\nIn national elections last July, Greek voters gave my New Democracy Party the support to form a strong majority Government and the mandate to chart a new course for our country that will build a more productive, more prosperous society, able to offer our people new opportunities to realize their dreams and fulfil their destinies. We moved quickly to carry out that mandate. In less than three months, we ended capital controls, initiated measures to spur privatization and attract investment, and passed legislation to cut taxes, open markets and reduce red tape. And we are just getting started.\nA new day has dawned in Greece, warmed by the clear light of reason and buoyed by the winds of change and hope. As we move to steer our country away from the storms that buffeted it for a decade towards calm seas and bright horizons, we remain extremely mindful of our place in the volatile region where we live, our role in the European Union (EU), whose ideals we inspired, and our responsibilities to the fragile world that we all inhabit.\nGiven the multitude of today\u2019s challenges and perils, the role of the United Nations must constantly evolve and diversify in order to remain relevant and to promote freedom, prosperity and peace in troubled regions. Greece fully supports the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to lead the reforms needed to make the United Nations more effective.\nIt is indeed time for the United Nations to enhance its ability to engage in preventive diplomacy, provide humanitarian assistance and lead both peacemaking and peacekeeping missions, as well as rebuild shattered nations once conflicts are resolved. And it is crucial to do it all with greater transparency, efficiency and accountability.\nI believe that we would all agree that no matter how many peacemaking or peacekeeping operations are deployed in conflict areas, at the end of the day peace and security cannot prevail in the absence of development and inclusive growth. Greece remains strongly committed to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to the long-term vision of a climate-neutral European Union economy by 2050.\nTo achieve those goals, the Greek Government has made addressing climate change a core component of its agenda. That is not just a defensive strategy to protect our forests from wildfires and our beaches from erosion and rising sea levels. It is about leveraging our unique natural environment and cultural heritage as a comparative advantage that will lead to new sustainable growth.\nTo do so, we plan to adopt a new, ambitious national strategy for energy, environment and climate before the end of this year. We will ban single-use plastics across the country by the end of 2021. We will close all our lignite power plants by the end of 2028. We will press forward with initiatives to protect our intangible cultural heritage from the impact of adverse climate conditions. We will follow up on the international summit on the impact of climate change on cultural heritage, which took place in Athens in June, by calling for a high-level meeting next year to continue and expand on the work that begun at the Athens conference.\nFor Greece, sustainable development and prosperity are also linked to the effective management of one of today\u2019s main challenges, the refugee crisis. Situated at the external borders of the European Union, and therefore at the forefront of the migration and refugee crisis for several years now, Greece continues to be confronted with the largest migrant and refugee flows to Europe since the Second World War.\nWe rank among the top four EU member States in asylum applications and have one of the highest ratios of asylum seekers per capita. Despite the disproportionate burden and the resulting tremendous pressure on our reception and asylum systems, we have managed to save thousands of lives at sea. We are deploying enormous efforts and resources, to the best of our abilities, in order to host refugees and migrants in a humane and decent way, respecting the human rights and human dignity of both refugees and migrants arriving in our country.\nHowever, we are reaching the limits of our ability to address this problem. Entry countries cannot and should not bear the burden of the migratory pressure on their own. Refugee and migration management is a European challenge that calls for collective action, a comprehensive approach and broad solutions, always based on the fair sharing of responsibility, not xenophobic agendas.\nWe need to state the obvious to our European partners, which is that Greece cannot bear alone the burden of massive movements of people fleeing wars and oppression or simply seeking a better future, as has recently been the case. For these people, Greece is not their final destination. They come to Europe through the European Union\u2019s external borders, which happen to be our borders. Their plight cannot be turned into a weapon in the service of political goals by anyone, anywhere.\nThe agreement between the European Union and Turkey must be respected and Turkey must do much more to fulfil its part of the bargain. The recent drastic increase in the number of migrants crossing the Aegean Sea is unacceptable. Europe should continue supporting Turkey financially, recognizing that millions of refugees currently live in Turkey.\nAt the same time, the European Union must move fast to adopt new common rules for asylum seekers that apply to all countries. No European nation can be a member of the Schengen area and benefit from the free movement of people while at the same time refusing to participate in burden-sharing arrangements regarding the migration crisis. Solidarity is not a one-way street.\nThe situation in the Middle East and North Africa is a source of deep concern and should be addressed by the international community in a comprehensive manner. It is tragic that eight years after the eruption of the Syrian crisis, the country continues to be a battlefield, for regional and international differences as well as domestic ones, with repercussions felt by all, but first and foremost by the unhappy Syrian people. Greece sees no alternative to a political solution. We fully support the inclusive political dialogue in Geneva under United Nations auspices that will produce a framework agreement based on Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) and that will not only enable Syrian refugees to return to their homeland but will also provide a basis for starting the reconstruction of this ravaged country.\nOn Libya, it is imperative to establish the security conditions that will allow the country to heal. As one of Libya\u2019s neighbours, Greece attaches particular importance to the international efforts to stabilize the country. We fully support the United Nations Action Plan for Libya and the recently announced three-part programme of action, and believe that they constitute a solid road map for achieving progress.\nAs a country that enjoys both longstanding ties to the Arab world and excellent relations with Israel, which Greece first recognized when my father was Prime Minister almost 30 years ago, we believe that the Middle East peace process must remain alive and lead to a two-State solution, in the hope that one day the area can become a promised land for all its people.\nIt is often said that geography is destiny. Nevertheless, it is our responsibility to shape our own destiny. Although my country is situated close to an extremely turbulent region, it remains a pillar of stability that actively promotes peace, security and cooperation. Along with the Republic of Cyprus, Greece has established constructive trilateral cooperation schemes with Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine. Consistent with its role as a stabilizing force in a region confronted with grave challenges, Greece remains fully committed to the principle of good-neighbourly relations with all its neighbours.\nHowever, no tangible progress in relations between two neighbouring countries can be achieved without full respect for international law, including the law of the sea, and full respect for international treaties. Actions that persistently challenge Greece\u2019s sovereignty and sovereign rights, in the sea and in the air, undermine the important principle of good-neighbourly relations, contravene international law and seriously impede efforts aimed at achieving mutually beneficial relationships.\nForty-five years have passed since the illegal Turkish invasion and occupation of more than a third of the Republic of Cyprus. An agreed, comprehensive and viable solution in accordance with Security Council resolutions should put an end to this injustice. We welcome President Anastasiades\u2019s and Turkish Cypriot leader Ak\u0131nc\u0131\u2019s efforts to agree on the terms of reference for resuming the negotiations to resolve the Cyprus question. It is up to them to decide what is good for their communities, and they do not need any foreign tutelage. As President Anastasiades repeated in this Hall yesterday (see A/74/PV.7), the only acceptable solution is the evolution of the Republic of Cyprus into a bizonal, bicommunal federation with political equality, a single sovereignty, a single international legal representation and a single citizenship. Greece stands ready to resume negotiations for the termination of the outdated, totally anachronistic 1960 system of guarantees and unilateral rights of intervention and for the withdrawal of the Turkish occupation troops from the island.\nHowever, Turkey\u2019s illegal drilling activities in the eastern Mediterranean, particularly within Cyprus\u2019s exclusive economic zone and territorial waters, violate international law. They blatantly undermine ongoing efforts being made under United Nations auspices to restart the Cyprus negotiations and dangerously escalate tensions in the eastern Mediterranean. Gunboat diplomacy has no place in the twenty-first century. It belongs in the nineteenth. Furthermore, recent Turkish actions and statements concerning the opening of Varosha under Turkish-Cypriot administration are in blatant violation of relevant Security Council resolutions, which call for the return of all legal inhabitants to Varosha under United Nations administration.\nWith respect to our neighbours to the north, Greece will continue to support the efforts of all the countries of the Western Balkans to join the European Union, as long as they fully respect their international obligations to the European Union and to their neighbours. Greece is playing a vital role in the economic development of the entire Balkans region, thanks to trade opportunities provided by its ports in Piraeus and Thessaloniki, as well as its position as one of the most important investors in South-Eastern Europe. And we will continue to do so more intensively in future.\nLet me conclude by making the following observation. We naturally think of the United Nations whenever we are confronted with difficult problems. All too often we are quick to criticize the United Nations if it comes up short in handling them. But for those who are caught in the middle of wars and revolutions, the United Nations is the only bulwark of safety they can count on, and to the millions of refugees around the world to whom it provides food and shelter, it is their only beacon of hope. I therefore wish to conclude my first appearance before the General Assembly by saluting the United Nations for the conflicts it has resolved, the suffering it has diminished and the pain it has eased all over the world.\n"

I come on behalf of the one Venezuela, which is worthy, brave and does not kneel before any imperial Power. I convey the greetings of President Nicolas Maduro Moros and the Venezuelan people, as well as the Bolivarian tidings of the spirit of our Commander, Hugo Chavez Frias.\nWe have come here with the purpose of announcing some very good news about the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The first item is that Venezuela is at peace, as witnessed firsthand by the 120 delegations that recently participated in the ministerial conference of the Non-Aligned Movement held in Venezuela \u2014 very much despite the media war that powerful media corporations have unleashed to tarnish the reputation of Bolivarian Venezuela and despite the attempted coups d\u2019\u00e9tat by extremist Venezuelan political factions, including even assassination attempts against the Head of State, the entire military and political command and the Venezuelan State authorities, as well as Ambassadors accredited in the country.\nThe world media says nothing, which is why I commend this space in which peoples can speak to one another, as they are unable to access that same apparatus, which is exclusively at the service of the world hegemonic Power and its satellites. The world media says nothing about the social-protection system in Venezuela, which covers almost 19 million Venezuelan women and men without distinction. This model of inclusion, justice and social protection has been designated as a target for destruction by the Government of the United States of America, and is the true threat posed to its model of capitalist supremacism The Bolivarian model runs intrinsically contrary to the project set in motion by the Monroe Doctrine, which seeks to show that the rest of the Americas is the United States backyard.\nWithin the framework of extraordinary social programmes, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development stands out as a joint commitment of the General Assembly and as the way forward for this Organization. Here, in this home of the international community, we encourage the development of shared cooperation mechanisms to address the urgent need to preserve our environment, which has been gravely impacted by the devastating capitalist model. We express our solidarity with the brotherly Caribbean people of the Bahamas, recently fallen victim to the ravages of climate change. Moreover, as a country of the Amazon, we raise our voices against the barbaric commercialization of our Amazon, led by the President of Brazil, Mr. Jair Bolsonaro, who has used his extremist ideology to attack the natural lungs of the world. We therefore proclaim that nature is an inalienable right of all peoples.\nWe also come to this Organization to effectively tackle the urgent issues of poverty and inequality, in a world where 26 individuals possess the same amount of wealth as the 3.8 billion poorest people in the world. We agree with the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, in his call to States to come here with concrete actions, not florid speeches. I would add that they should also not come here with falsehoods and lies as they address the General Assembly. The point is precisely how to achieve these noble and commendable commitments as an international community that has seen grave damage done to its multilateral and legal structure.\nI wish to spend some time exposing the coercive unilateral and therefore illegal measures to which millions of people throughout the world are subjected. These measures constitute the use of force that is prohibited by the Charter of the United Nations and international law, which is an attack on peace and security and a massive violation of human rights. Between 2015 and 2019, the Government of the United States has adopted more than 350 unilateral coercive measures against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, including the illegal and undue appropriation of all our resources and assets abroad and a comprehensive financial and commercial blockade that affects health, education and food and which is aimed primarily at suffocating the Venezuelan economy and bringing our people to their knees.\nI wish to share some terrifying data with the General Assembly on the dimensions that unilateral coercive measures represent in comparison to conventional wars. It is well known that the use of armed force by the United States military-industrial complex means big business. The past three Presidents of the United States have increased the number of illegal bombings, thereby violating the Charter of the United Nations and without any authorization whatsoever from the Security Council.\nBetween 2001 and 2009, President George W. Bush launched 70,000 bombs in total, or an average of 24 bombs per day. In the period between 2009 and 2017, under the leadership of President Barack Obama, the United States Government launched 100,000 bombs, raising the daily average to 34 bombs. More recently, with Mr. Donald Trump as President, 44,096 bombs have been launched, breaking the record, with an average of 121 bombs per day. These bombs have caused the entire civilian population to suffer, indiscriminately affecting boys and girls and the elderly.\nHowever, there is a new type of State terrorism being imposed upon our citizens \u2014 one that does not involve the use of bombs: in this digital era, banks and insurance companies are able to do damage with the touch of a button. These are precisely the measures being taken by the United States as it exploits the dominance of the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency. The United States Department of the Treasury is the economic Pentagon militarizing international relations and punishing millions of innocent people by enforcing doctrines of regime change and blatantly stealing the resources of other nations.\nThe fact that these measures even exist is proof of the collapse of the international legal order. In this regard, Venezuela has become the greatest evil experiment against multilateralism. Economic terrorism against Venezuela has caused its income to drop by more than a factor of nine. It is estimated that, between 2015 and 2018, the total losses for the Venezuelan economy reached $130 billion owing to the brutal financial blockade imposed by the United States Government, which can only be characterized as a shameless robbery and plundering of our resources.\nBut Venezuela is not alone. Donald Trump\u2019s supremacist hatred has hooked its imperial claws into the revolution in our sister nation of Cuba, savagely intensifying the extent of these coercive measures in the form of illicit sanctions. It appears that five decades is not long enough for the United States to realize that Cuba will never surrender. Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba will never submit to any imperialist design after having spent over five decades resisting the economic blockade. What will make them realize that they will never be able to defeat the revolution led by Jose Marti?\nOur sisterly nation of Nicaragua was also destined for a similar fate. These three revolutions on our continent \u2014 the Sandinista revolution, the revolution led by Jose Marti and the Bolivarian revolution \u2014 served as the basis for the project motivated by the Monroe Doctrine. Indeed, the United States Government judges us, promulgating indicators of democracy that it does not even adhere to itself. They judge us when there are 400 people in that country holding more wealth than 240 million others, thereby forming an oligarchy that controls the political life of the majority. A society whose political system is dominated by plutocratic minorities is not a democracy, let alone one with the authority to impose its model on other nations. We call on the United States to be less arrogant and more tolerant in its coexistence with the free nations of the world.\nAlong the same lines, I want to highlight the special relationship that exists between the primary cocaine producer in the world and the primary consumer of this drug on the planet \u2014 I am referring to the narcotic relationship that exists between Colombia and the United States. It has been broadly documented that Colombia produces 70 per cent of all cocaine being consumed in the world, having increased its production in the past year by more than 30 per cent, which is higher than ever before in its production history. I wish to recall that the United States contributed more than $10 billion to the Plan Colombia initiative in order to combat this scourge. United States citizens \u2014 the vast majority, not the oligarchy \u2014 must feel as though this is a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money and wonder when this is going to stop.\nThanks to Commander Hugo Chavez and President Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela was a supporter of peace agreements praised by this Organization and the global advertising machine. But today, in one fell swoop, President Ivan Duque Marquez is blatantly violating and tearing up those agreements.\nSince the signing of those accords, the United Nations has confirmed the murder of 123 former combatants and 739 social leaders in our fellow country Colombia over the past year. Colombia has the highest number of internally displaced persons of any country, at almost 8 million. There are almost 6 million Colombian men and women living in Venezuela alone. The mass media, which serve the interests of the global hegemony, will never report those number.\nI wish to dwell on this because two days ago the President of Colombia stood before the General Assembly spewing lies about Venezuela (see A/74/PV.5). He brought here several pieces of what he claimed was evidence that we in Venezuela are harbouring Colombian irregulars. Have we stooped to such a level of disrespect \u2014 to come lie to the Assembly?\nA brief examination of those photographs \u2014 which all members will recognize because the scandal was covered by the media worldwide \u2014 reveals that they in fact depict Colombian territory, not that of Venezuela as Mr. Ivan Duque had claimed, in the cases of Cauca and Catatumbo. This violates all mutual assistance mechanisms existing between countries under conventions governing reciprocal cooperation between police and legal systems. The appropriate path is that of diplomacy. What is needed is for countries to establish respectful means of communication in accordance with international law.\nI suggest that President Duque grab a pencil because he has forced us to come before the General Assembly to provide specific coordinates for the camps where terrorists are being trained to attack Venezuela. There are three sites in the north-east of President Duque\u2019s country: Santa Marta, Riohacha and Maicao. Let me provide the coordinates for the camps, which will also be given the Secretary-General: Santa Marta, 11\u00b014\u201919\u201d N 79\u00b06\u201915\u201dW; Riohacha, 11\u00b032\u20193\u201d N 75\u00b055\u201914\u201d W; Maicao, 11\u00b022\u201939\u201d N 72\u00b013\u201958\u201d W. We will also provide photographs of the camps, where, again, mercenaries are being trained to attack Venezuela.\nVenezuela, for its part, has taken appropriate actions. We turned to public international law and presented the evidence to the Government of Colombia. The Venezuelan public prosecutor also provided all evidence of the presence of persons in the process of committing serious crimes against the constitutional order in Venezuela \u2014 terrorism, the attempted assassination of Venezuelan State officials and of President Nicolas Maduro. The official response of the Government of Colombia was to shelter and grant safe harbour to those individuals being sought by the Venezuelan justice system, in flagrant violation of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001).\nWith those lies, President Duque proved himself not only a bad comedian but also an awful liar. It took less than 24 hours for the truth to come out: that truth is that Venezuela\u2019s robust rule of law guarantees that our inviolable territory has never been used to commit any abuses or crimes against a brotherly country. And I say that fully conscious of my responsibility. The United States and its regional satellites are preparing an act of aggression against Venezuela from Colombia, putting the security and stability of the continent at risk.\nAs far back as 2015, when President Barack Obama issued the infamous executive order labelling Venezuela as a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, President Nicolas Maduro warned us what was on the horizon. That was the starting point of the most obstinate exercise ever carried out by the Organization of American States (OAS), of which Venezuela is no longer a member, when it adopted the provocative and obsolete Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, laying the groundwork to justify armed intervention in Venezuela led by the United States and carried out through other Governments. It is worth noting that all of the measures provided for by that Treaty have already been used against Venezuela except one: armed intervention. That is why we have come before the Assembly to issue a warning in the hope of preventing the conflict that they wish to sow in our region.\nAction taken by several parties does not make it multilateralism; it is group unilateralism, intended to bypass the rule of international law. A glance at the history of the OAS is enough to realize that such group unilateralism is responsible for turning that organization into what it is today, that is, a mere spectre of what it once was.\nAmid today\u2019s global realities, our Organization, this shared home, is being called upon to play a more proactive role in tackling issues with a direct impact on international peace and security. One of the issues that stands out most \u2014 and shamefully so, I would say \u2014 is that of the question of Palestine. All of us owe a debt to the Palestinian people, now dating back more than 50 years. They have been denied their inalienable right to self-determination in a free, sovereign and independent State with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nWe also reject any form of trade war against China. We repudiate the illicit sanctions against Russia. These are two developing world Powers engaged in building a new multipolar and multicentred world with respect for international law.\nWe likewise reject the sanctions against Iran, North Korea, Syria and Zimbabwe. More than 30 countries have been targeted with such illegal criminal sanctions.\nWe welcome the election of our brotherly country Mexico to the presidency of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the legacy of great men like Fidel Castro and Commander Hugo Chavez, who had a great vision of how to reclaim the deepest roots of the freedom and greatness of our lands. We welcome Mexico\u2019s presidency and condemn any kind of offence against the dignity of its people and its name.\nWe also reaffirm our historic rights over Guayana Esequiba and recall that the Geneva Agreement of 1966, duly deposited with the United Nations, is the only valid and legally binding instrument providing for bilateral negotiations for the resolution of this territorial dispute.\nThe present massive anti-Venezuelan operation dates back to 2002, when the United States led a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against President Hugo Chavez, with the support of the very same actors today unfortunately attempting to overthrow our legitimate Government. Something occurred in Venezuela on 23 January that is without precedent in the world: a member of Congress elected with fewer than 90,000 votes stood in a public square and proclaimed himself president of Venezuela. That member of Congress is an imperial puppet. He has no political legitimacy in Venezuela; he is nothing more than an illegitimate and criminal tool, created to undermine stability and peace in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\nHis self-proclamation was recognized by a minority of Governments of this unequal world, in perhaps one of the worst mistakes in their diplomatic history. But while the unequal world that favours the few supported that illegal conspiracy, the legitimate Government headed by President Nicolas Maduro received the support of almost two thirds of the States Members of the United Nations allied as the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\nExactly eight months have passed since that vile, twisted turn in the history of our republic. The legitimate constitutional Government with effective territorial control and the institutional mechanisms of the rule of law continues, and will continue to be, that of President Nicolas Maduro, chosen by us Venezuelans through the exercise of our sacred right to self-determination.\nMost of the world supports Venezuela and is well aware that this imperialist farce is tantamount to organized crime. Even graver still was the coordination among that puppet, Colombian paramilitary groups and the Government of Ivan Duque. I take this opportunity to show this photograph of the self-proclaimed president together with a leading member of the Rastrojos paramilitary group. I am showing this to the Assembly to illustrate what we are facing. We are facing the use of criminal gangs and drug-trafficking paramilitary groups to destabilize Venezuela.\nThis is familiar enough from history. Our sister Nicaragua recalls only too well when the Government of the United States used the Contras to overthrow the Sandinistas. The countries of the Middle East likewise endured terrorist organizations created, armed, financed and used to overthrow Governments that were not in the orbit of the hegemonic Power.\nIn that regard, I wish to inform the international community that on Wednesday our Ambassador to the International Criminal Court delivered a video containing the full confession of a leader of the Rastrojos paramilitary gang for consideration as part of the preliminary examination on Colombia and paramilitary activities.\nPrecisely with a view to achieving, guaranteeing and preserving peace and order in our republic, President Nicolas Maduro invited all segments of society to participate in a sovereign dialogue. Our commitment to a constitutional approach is unshakable.\nWe have brought this story to light in order to warn the world and the international community about these twisted machinations, on the edge of legality, which tomorrow could, without any justification, impact any other country the global hegemon might decide to openly rob of its resources or change the Government at any cost. Venezuela is and will continue to be united, unique and indivisible. We are the Venezuela that Bolivar and our liberators would never surrender to any empire.\nThe Government of the United States has supported this illegitimate enterprise by the brutal and criminal imposition of an all-out embargo. The United States had imposed 6,000 coercive measures against dozens of countries around the world by 2014. Today, in 2019, the number of illicit unilateral coercive measures has risen to 8,000. Such measures constitute the preferred weapon for domination in the twenty-first century, with least cost and greatest benefit in neocolonialist terms.\nThirty-two countries are today subject to such economic aggression by the United States Government and, according to the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations on the negative impact of the unilateral coercive measures, one third of humankind is suffering the consequences of this form of collective punishment. The Non-Aligned Movement just yesterday approved a statement firmly rejecting the application of such illicit sanctions. This is a new form of economic terrorism that uses the suffering of innocent civilians to generate political benefits for the global hegemon. Moreover, in our digital age, it illegally yields billions of dollars at the touch of a button.\nI brought with me to read out two statements made in 2018, the first from the United States Department of State: \u201cThe pressure campaign is working. The financial sanctions we have placed on the Venezuelan Government have forced it to begin becoming in default, both on sovereign and PDVSA, its oil company\u2019s debt. And what we are seeing [...] is a total economic collapse in Venezuela. So our policy is working, our strategy is working and we\u2019re going to keep it\u201d.\nThere can be no doubt this criminal confession flagrantly violated the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe second statement was made by former Ambassador William Brownfield: \u201cWe must treat this like an agony, a tragedy that will continue until it comes to an end. If we can do something that will bring that end quicker, we probably should do it, but we should do it understanding that it\u2019s going to have an impact on millions and millions of people who are already having great difficulty finding enough to eat, getting themselves cured when they get sick, or finding clothes to put on their children before they go off to school. We don\u2019t get to do this and pretend as though it has no impact there. We have to make the hard decision \u2014 the desired outcome justifies this fairly severe punishment.\u201d\nAnd what outcome does the United States of America desire? It seeks to defeat the Bolivarian Revolution and maintain its hegemony in every corner of the world. It also attacks Iran, Russia and China \u2014 countries engaged in building a new world. It pursues nefarious policies to effect the illicit doctrine of regime change.\nGiven these grave claims, Venezuela calls for the investigation of all these blatant violations by the United States of the Charter of the United Nations. There can be no doubt they constitute crimes against humanity in respect of Venezuela and the world \u2014 the perpetrators have admitted as much.\nWhat measures must we take to correct the abusive conduct of the Government of the United States, which causes such suffering even to its own people? I would say to President Trump that his people expects its leaders to be truly committed to democracy and to eradicating poverty and inequality. They expect not to be drawn into wars of any kind. The people of Walt Whitman has more in common with its poets than with the arrogant and supremacist prose its Government brandishes so recklessly. The world expects the United States to change course immediately, to subject itself, once and for all, to international law and to show respect for our common home.\nSeventy-five years since the founding of the United Nations, we aspire to a robust Organization, free of unjust constraints and able to restrain the illegitimate exercise of power. Let us have less ostentatious rhetoric. As the Secretary-General has said, let us say yes to more concrete and effective action. Let us, in chorus, form a common front in defence of the Charter of the United Nations and its principles and purposes, which are the basis of international law and the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the Organization. Only in this way will we guarantee the survival of the human species and the harmonious and lawful coexistence of the community of nations.\nI conclude my statement by reaffirming that Venezuela is and will remain at peace, cared for by a dignified, courageous people that steadfastly rejects submission. We are an infinite legacy of the sword that we inherited from our liberator and father Simon Bolivar. By his spirit we entered the world so as to never give space to the Santander and oligarchic betrayal of the free peoples of the great homeland. Let us build a common front to defend the United Nations Charter and the happiness of our peoples. In the words of the poet Benedetti, happiness should be defended as a trench, as a principle, as a flag, as a right. With our Bolivar, let us shed our fear and save our homeland. Today we say, let us shed our fear and save the world from capitalist violence.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour to speak before the General Assembly today, in the year when Liechtenstein is celebrating its 300th anniversary. We are proud of and blessed to look back at three centuries of absence of armed conflict, good relations with our neighbours and a trajectory from poverty to economic prosperity and political stability. We are grateful for the numerous partnerships that have made that journey possible. An active foreign policy and diplomacy have been crucial for our survival as one of the smallest States in Europe. Without our international connections, we would not have been recognized as a sovereign State, we would not have consolidated our position at the Vienna Congress and we would not have survived as a sovereign State during the difficult times of two World Wars.\nWorking together with others on the basis of common rules is not just something to which we subscribe conceptually; it is an indispensable part of our history as a country and of our success as a society. Joining the United Nations in 1990 was therefore a natural continuation of what has consistently been our approach to foreign policy. Almost 30 years ago now, securing our sovereign equality was a key driver in Liechtenstein becoming a member of the Assembly.\nYet we have never looked at that important step as an end in itself. Rather, it has given us the means to help develop a rules-based international order and the rule of law as an expression of that sovereign equality. Today more than ever, we are committed to those goals and to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\nSixty years ago, Liechtenstein was still a poor, agrarian emigration country, with a weak economy and very limited employment opportunities. Our path to being one of the most industrialized countries, with a highly diversified and innovative economy, was made possible through the opening of global markets based on common rules. We are witnessing difficult trends today \u2014 a more unstable global order, an increase in protectionism, a weakening of international cooperation and the erosion of internationally agreed standards and the rule of law. We will continue our commitment to respect international law, the bedrock of the United Nations, and will work with those who are committed to multilateralism.\nAs a small State, we will always stand with the rule of law and against the rule of might. We will continue to apply the important lessons of our history \u2014 consistent foreign policy investments pay important dividends domestically. Indeed, the United Nations is the key forum in which to promote those goals.\nIt is not a time of easy successes and quick wins for the United Nations but it is still a time of opportunity. The trust of the international public in the United Nations continues to be very high \u2014 surprisingly high, one is tempted to say. More than ever, people around the world understand that the big threats that we face, including to the survival of our planet, require all of us to work together. That is the political capital we are given and that we must use in our conversation with Governments that tend to look for solutions elsewhere or simply deny the challenges.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development remains a central blueprint for our common future, with the enormous challenge of climate change at its core. The Sustainable Development Goals have galvanized important initiatives in Liechtenstein, and I am particularly encouraged by the positive response of the private sector.\nFor years, we have been talking about the need to involve a broader range of stakeholders than just Governments. The need to involve not only the private sector but also local communities, cities and other stakeholders is overwhelming today. Liechtenstein has already developed a number of sustainability initiatives that could potentially be of interest to our international partners. If we can continue being innovative and creative in that area, we can generate an interest in our sustainability initiatives that matches the interest in the products and services of our industrial and financial sectors.\nOne of our central sustainability initiatives is a public-private partnership in which our financial sector has a key role \u2014 the Liechtenstein Initiative for a Financial Sector Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking. The blueprint produced by the Financial Sector Commission, to be launched this coming Friday, offers a toolkit to help financial institutions to fight slavery \u2014 one of the major organized crime models of our time.\nI am pleased to be able to witness the discussions at the High-Level Political Forum during my visit to New York. We should all welcome the strong engagement of young people with regard to questions of sustainability. Their voice calls for intergenerational justice as a fundamental principle of our policymaking. We should take that voice seriously.\nFor the first time, Liechtenstein has appointed a youth delegate, who was part of the delegation that presented our first report on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda here in July. It is certainly our responsibility to make the right policy decisions. But in doing so we also have the responsibility to be aware of the consequences for those who will have to live with their effects in the years beyond 2030.\nWe are committed to strengthening international law, which entails not only securing respect for the norms that we have agreed but also developing new norms where necessary. The rule of law at the international level and international justice are crucial for us. We joined the International Court of Justice many years before we became a Member of the United Nations and have accepted its compulsory jurisdiction.\nMore recently, we have been strongly committed to furthering international criminal justice, and we have had considerable success in that respect.\nThe International Criminal Court remains the centre of the international fight against impunity. At a time when agreed international rules, such as the Geneva Conventions, are routinely ignored, the Court has become even more important. The performance of the Court has not always matched our expectations, and it is of course particularly exposed to the headwinds caused by isolationist and nationalist trends. Yet that must be an incentive for us to increase our political investment. In helping the Court improve its performance, we can make it less vulnerable to political attacks.\nWe have also led the effort to establish accountability for the crimes committed in the conflict in Syria. The creation of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011 was a major success for the Assembly to help shape the future of the country. The political discussions on a post-conflict Syria must include accountability for the atrocities committed during the conflict. Those discussions will not be easy, but they will be necessary to create sustainable peace for the Syrian people.\nThe Organization was created to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. It was indeed the disaster of the Second World War that led to its creation. There have been other essential peace projects. For us, of course, the European Union has been central in that respect \u2014 it has secured a period of peace that our region has never witnessed before. As a global peace project, however, the United Nations remains unique. Its success in preventing conflict has been mixed, owing especially to the divisions among the permanent members of its Security Council and, recently, to the excessive use of the veto power.\nYet today, more so than in a long time, armed conflict of unforeseeable consequences is a real danger. The existence of nuclear weapons and the options presented by cyberwarfare illustrate the incredible level of risk and the potential devastating impact of armed conflict today.\nAll of us in this Hall have subscribed to the very strict rules that constrain the use of force in the United Nations Charter. Armed conflict is illegal except when the use of force is authorized by the Security Council or is carried out in self-defence. The most serious forms of the illegal use of force are also a criminal offence now, both in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and in many domestic legal systems. Those new legal norms are needed more than ever and also apply to new methods of warfare.\nIn conclusion, I wish to address a concern that my father, Prince Hans-Adam II, presented to the Assembly (see A/46/PV.10) as the very first of our initiatives presented at the United Nations. As a small State, we have consistently stood up for the right of self-determination. It is one of the fundamental principles of international law and, as such, is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and has also been incorporated in the Liechtenstein Constitution. Many of today\u2019s conflicts are rooted in claims for self-determination. If not addressed in an effective and timely manner, the resulting controversies may lead to violence and, in extreme cases, to armed conflict.\nWe continue to believe that we need models for innovative application of the right of self-determination in cases where independence is not a political option. Our work on that has extended over several decades now. We will continue working to make that part of our contribution to achieving the goals reflected in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government of the Republic of San Marino, and on my own behalf, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. We wish you, Mr. President, a productive session ahead. The Republic of San Marino supports the priorities outlined in the programme of work for this session, as mentioned in your inaugural address (see A/74/PV.1), and we assure you, Sir, of our full cooperation in all of the General Assembly\u2019s work.\nI would also like to express my country\u2019s gratitude to the outgoing President, Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for the important work carried out during the seventy-third session. I should also like to extend my special thanks to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his energy and determination in leading the United Nations and for his efforts aimed at reforming the Organization.\nI welcome the theme chosen for this session \u2014 \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d \u2014 which is a broad and cross-cutting approach, as it deals with human rights, the fight against climate change and sustainable development, to which the Republic of San Marino attaches great importance. It also gives States Members of the United Nations the opportunity to constructively contribute to the work of the General Assembly. It is clear that there is a link between multilateralism \u2014 that is to say, the orientation towards common and coordinated policies \u2014 and global challenges, the scope of which goes beyond the capacities of each individual State \u2014 even the most powerful or technologically advanced \u2014 to confront them on its own.\nRecent developments in the global political landscape have created obstacles to the development of multilateralism, thereby putting it at risk. However, the increasingly evident interrelationships among various global challenges have highlighted the need, today more than ever, for Member States to work together in order to overcome these difficulties. These difficulties also require that we strengthen international cooperation and our Organization as a whole. My country welcomes the outcome of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly to commemorate and promote the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, which took place on 24 April (see A/73/PV.78). Preserving the values of multilateralism and international cooperation, which underpin the Charter of the United Nations and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, is of fundamental importance in promoting and supporting peace and security, development and human rights. The challenges of protectionism and isolationism facing our world today must and can be countered by the rules of international law, which have guided Member States for decades.\nThe Republic of San Marino believes it is essential to continue to reaffirm the collective commitment to multilateralism, in particular in the framework of the General Assembly, which is the most representative body of the United Nations owing to its deeply democratic nature, universal participation and undisputed legitimacy. San Marino has decided to cooperate within the framework of international structures and mechanisms \u2014 the most important of which is the United Nations itself\u2014 because we believe in the effectiveness of dialogue, democracy and respect for others. The peaceful coexistence of peoples relies on such values. However, multilateralism cannot be a mere statement of collective intentions. Rather, it must translate into concrete actions to improve people\u2019s lives and leave no one behind.\nFour years ago, Member States adopted a very ambitious plan to end poverty and create shared prosperity on a peaceful and healthy planet \u2014 the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In recent days, in New York, world leaders have gathered to take stock of the implementation of sustainable-development commitments and to reaffirm our collective ambition for a better world. As the Secretary-General stated in his latest special-edition report (E/2019/68) on progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), progress is being made in the implementation of the SDGs. Extreme poverty and child mortality rates continue to fall, albeit not yet at the desired rate; progress is being made in fighting certain diseases, such as hepatitis; important developments are being made with regard to targets on gender equality; electricity access in the poorest countries is improving; labour productivity has increased; and global unemployment has returned to pre-financial-crisis levels. This progress illustrates the great work carried out by Member States and their partners since 2015.\nSan Marino believes that sustainability is a major issue that must be addressed at the global level in order to ensure the future of the planet and that of young and future generations. The Republic of San Marino therefore recently joined the 25+5 SDG Cities initiative \u2014 managed by the United Nations Global Sustainability Index Institute, in collaboration with the United Nations Office for Project Services \u2014 which will be a fundamental tool in transforming our country into a reference hub for various projects, such as sustainable agriculture. However, despite the positive trends and the many initiatives undertaken at the local, regional and national levels, which continue to be inspired by the 2030 Agenda, an acceleration in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals is needed if the required level of transformation is to be achieved by 2030.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s special-edition report also reveals that hunger and malnutrition are far from being resolved, greenhouse gas emissions are continuing to increase, biological diversity is rapidly diminishing, the level of financing for sustainable development is not sufficient and, even at the institutional level, there is a lack of efficiency and strength to respond to the challenges. There is also evidence that the most vulnerable groups of the population remain largely excluded from political, economic and social processes. Overall, young people are three times more likely to be unemployed than adults; one in five children lives in poverty; people with disabilities continue to face multiple disadvantages, often to the detriment of the full enjoyment of their human rights; and gender inequalities persist.\nThe divergences in the implementation of the SDGs exist not only between but also within countries. A major cause for concern is that the most vulnerable countries and those lagging behind in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda are precisely those in which there are major obstacles to successfully implementing the SDGs. These are also the countries in which situations of armed conflict, political or economic instability and economic losses from natural disasters have jeopardized the implementation of the SDGs or even reversed the progress that had been achieved. Without effective action to contain it, global warming will further inhibit our ability to adapt and increase the sense of vulnerability among large sectors of the world\u2019s population.\nMy country welcomes the convening of the Climate Action Summit in recent days and the ambitious initiatives that were put forward there. Since 2008, the Republic of San Marino has intensified its commitment to environmental sustainability, particularly in the production of electricity from renewable resources. This commitment has resulted in San Marino ranking among the world\u2019s leading countries in the production of photovoltaic energy per capita. We are also committed to improving our strategies and practices in the fields of waste management, sustainable mobility and the raising of public awareness, particularly among the younger generations, with regard to a sustainable and environmentally friendly lifestyle.\nThe effects of climate change represent the greatest challenge of our time, owing to their unprecedented impact on our lives. Cyclone Idai this year caused devastation in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. No country or community is immune to the destructive effects of global warming, but the poorest and most vulnerable groups already are already suffering the greatest damage. This is a global problem requiring solutions coordinated at the global level. It is essential to strengthen international cooperation in order to accelerate our collective action.\nThe special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicated that we had 11 years left to change course for future generations and to get global warming under control. The interlinkages between the climate and the 2030 Agenda must be seen as an opportunity to unleash synergies to drive collective action. Indeed, while achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will help limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C, climate action will likewise support the attainment of the economic and social targets of the Agenda through job creation. It also promotes better health and well-being for the world\u2019s population.\nThe eradication of poverty in all its forms and manifestations, in particular extreme poverty, is perhaps the most difficult and important challenge we face in achieving the objective of sustainable development. While the global reduction in extreme poverty continues, as the Secretary-General\u2019s report shows, it is not falling fast enough for us to attain the 3 per cent objective by 2030. Those living in extreme poverty suffer deprivation, often exacerbated by violent conflict or vulnerability due to natural disasters. The principle whereby no one should be left behind requires the adoption of targeted measures to support people in vulnerable situations. It is indispensable to take into account the needs of children, young people, persons with disabilities, the elderly, indigenous people, refugees, the displaced, migrants, and people living in areas affected by humanitarian emergencies or in situations of armed conflict.\nUniversal respect for human rights and human dignity is at the core of the 2030 Agenda. Peace, justice, equality and non-discrimination are fundamental rights that must be fully realized if we are to succeed in building inclusive societies.\nIt is essential to protect children and young people. We must promote actions to support them to ensure they can grow up free from all forms of abuse and exploitation. Unfortunately, children pay a very high price in areas of armed conflict; many lose their lives, are kidnapped or raped, used as shields or recruited as soldiers.\nMy country believes that respect for international humanitarian law and human rights law is essential in conflict situations. The Republic of San Marino is part of the Group of Friends of Children and Armed Conflict, has ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflicts, and supports the Paris Principles. Moreover, San Marino is among the countries that support the Safe Schools Declaration, an important tool to protect educational facilities from military use during conflicts. San Marino also took part in the launch on 2 April of the ACT to Protect Children affected by Conflict initiative of the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Virginia Gamba.\nIf we want to build sustainable, resilient and inclusive societies, we need to promote the full and effective participation of women in decision-making processes. The Republic of San Marino commits to fighting all forms of gender-based violence, sexual abuse and exploitation. We attach great important to the aims of gender equality, the empowerment of women and girls and the full realization of their human rights. Gender equality must also be translated into equal educational opportunities. In this regard, I would like to underline the importance of scientific subjects because technology, science and innovation in general play a vital role in tackling global challenges and thus in the pursuit of sustainable development.\nThis year San Marino signed, together with other countries, a document entitled \u201cInvestment in Women and Girls in Science for Inclusive Green Growth\u201d, which recognizes the fundamental role science, technology and innovation play in socioeconomic development and the need to boost investment in these sectors. But, above all, the document affirms the importance of investing in programmes that promote equality and gender parity in science.\nMy country firmly believes that, today more than ever, particular attention must be paid to emerging technologies, science and innovation, which should facilitate sustainable development through means of communication that do not distort the truth and thereby undermine the very concept of freedom. This year, having hosted the inaugural High-level Conference on the Dangers of Disinformation, on 10 May, the Republic of San Marino made a concrete and determined contribution to the international discourse around objective information, in contrast to the ever more dangerous, deceptive and out of control phenomenon of fake news, capable of inciting hatred and nurturing prejudice.\nAware that disinformation represents a global threat and a genuine risk to the stability of our democratic systems, my country is committed to becoming a veritable observatory for the study of and scientific research on a dangerous phenomenon that is harmful to democracy and freedom. San Marino\u2019s efforts to protect quality information aim to identify new operational strategies and synergies to promote the exchange of best practices on combating misinformation, including at the international level.\nThe international community must protect and support the most vulnerable groups, ensuring that none are excluded from decision-making process. My country attaches great importance to disability issues and has frequently contributed over recent years to United Nations discussions on this important topic, sharing our experiences and the achievements attained in this regard in our Republic. People with disabilities must be guaranteed full participation in social, economic and cultural life. To this end, it is necessary to fully implement the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\nWhen we talk about multilateralism and the United Nations, we must also inevitably reflect on the process of reforming our Organization. The United Nations is able to translate objectives into action with a real and measurable impact on the lives of citizens only if it is equipped with structures necessary to implement action on a global scale. In this regard, the Republic of San Marino last year expressed its support for the reform agenda launched by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres covering peace and security, management and the United Nations development system, based on our belief that it will enhance the capacity of the United Nations to attain more concrete and visible results.\nMy country is also closely following the process of Security Council reform. We believe that intergovernmental negotiations are the right way to reach an agreement that reflects the interests and positions of all. San Marino favours reforming the Security Council to make it more democratic, transparent and effective. However, it is necessary to take a step forward and overcome the opening positions in order to negotiate an agreement that reaches the broadest possible consensus.\nSan Marino expresses its concern at the growing number of conflicts around the world, fuelled by threats of religious radicalism, terrorism, transnational organized crime, trafficking in drugs and human beings, weapons of mass destruction, violent extremism, marginalization and exclusion. Over recent years, the United Nations has suffered a loss of credibility, partly due to the failure of the Security Council to fulfil its mandate effectively. With a view to supporting the Security Council to act swiftly and decisively, I recall that my country has adhered to the Code of Conduct regarding Security Council action against genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes, drawn up by the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group, and the joint declaration by France and Mexico on the voluntary suspension of the veto by the permanent members of the Security Council.\nThe international community has, without a doubt, faced major challenges over recent years due to increasing migration flows, driven in part by the effects of climate change, which have forced millions of people to seek refuge in other countries, and in part by persecution and armed conflict, as well as by socioeconomic hardship in the form of lack of food, water, education and health services. No country can face migration alone given the transnational nature of the phenomenon. My country intends to renew its support to the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, adopted last December in Marrakech, Morocco. The Compact aims to manage migration flows through enhanced international cooperation. Moreover, it reaffirms migrants\u2019 human rights and dignity in order to ensure the protection of their fundamental rights.\nOver recent years, perhaps because of certain difficulties multilateralism has encountered in tackling global challenges, we have seen the unfortunate growth in some parts of the world of protectionist, isolationist or, worse yet, openly xenophobic ideologies, which go against the principle of international cooperation. I believe that the general debate is an important opportunity to renew our commitment to a stronger United Nations, capable of coordinating economic, social and environmental policies and translating them into effective action at all levels. Trust, inclusiveness and dialogue are essential elements in supporting multilateralism and its capacity to produce concrete results at the global level. San Marino will never fail to do its part."

        "file_text": "I would first like to congratulate Ambassador Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of Nigeria on his commendable election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I also congratulate the members of his Office and wish his entire team success in fulfilling their important mission. I would also like to pay tribute to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his tireless efforts to support our Organization and strengthen its role in finding solutions to problems that threaten peace, security and prosperity in the world.\nThe theme of the current session, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, has been well chosen at a particularly difficult time for multilateralism, when humankind has engaged itself with unprecedented momentum towards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. That theme encompasses the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, the implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development and the achievement of the objectives set out in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nInequality and feelings of exclusion are at the root of the main threats to peace, stability and harmonious development. They fuel the uncontrolled migration flows of entire peoples in search of a better future. In both northern and southern countries, they have amplified xenophobic reflexes, the rise of populism and the radicalization of those that get left behind.\nThe tragic recent events in South Africa are the worst illustration of that. Such movements of popular frustration, which in some regions even go on to fuel terrorism, hold political debate hostage and prevent us from providing concerted responses to the problems that affect us all. I would like to tell the General Assembly that no country in the world can face those challenges alone. Unity, solidarity, tolerance and international cooperation are essential values, as reflected by our founding Members in the Charter of the United Nations.\nMore than ever, economic and social development and the well-being of the peoples of the world are fundamental and inalienable rights. As leaders, we have an obligation to work hard to guarantee those rights. For decades, our Organization has been striving to adapt to the new realities of our constantly changing world.\nIn order to be better able to meet the challenges of development in a globalized world in a sustainable way, we call for a comprehensive reform of the United Nations system, in particular the Security Council and the agencies of the United Nations. The Security Council reform process must be brought to completion and take into account the common African position, as set out in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.\nIt is not fair for Africa to remain the only region in the world without permanent representation on the Security Council, while most of the world\u2019s demographic, social and environmental challenges are intrinsically linked to our continent. We want a fair and equitable configuration of the Security Council that is more representative of the diversity of the world\u2019s peoples and is accountable for its actions.\nDespite the high-level commitments that we have made to creating the world we want by 2030, nearly 1 billion people in the world are still living in hunger, malnutrition and extreme poverty, while 118 million people in extreme poverty will be exposed to drought, floods and heat in Africa by 2030. We cannot accept the mere suggestion of the possible failure to meet the 2030 commitments, especially after the very mixed outcome of the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in Africa.\nThe eradication of poverty and hunger is urgent. The Democratic Republic of Congo can be part of the solution, with its 80 million hectares of arable land and abundant water resources, capable of feeding more than 2 billion people.\nThe challenge of access to quality education for all, the second element of this session\u2019s theme, is of particular concern to us because the development experience in the decades since our independence has strengthened our conviction that there is no wealth but human beings. That is why since 2011, we had already embraced the key principle of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to leave no one behind through our commitment, well known to my compatriots, to put the people first. As a result, the main social priorities of my tenure are the following.\nThe first priority is to make primary education free as part of public education, as required by my country\u2019s Constitution. That commitment has been effective throughout the country since the beginning of this month. In one year, it will increase the share of education expenditure from 8 per cent to nearly 20 per cent of the State budget, that is, a level close to the standards recommended by UNESCO.\nThe second priority is to promote a better match between education and employment through an ambitious vocational and technical training approach, developed and implemented in partnership with the private sector.\nThe third priority is to advance the work on universal health coverage. We therefore hope that by the end of next year, more than 8 million more Congolese will have access to an effective health coverage system.\nIn addition, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has just set out its national digital plan, whose implementation will have an impact on all sectors of public life. Moreover, the digitization of the economy will enable the country to make rapid progress in the fight against corruption and various economic crimes.\nAs our democracies have become particularly demanding and impatient, we must find innovative ways to implement our ambitions. I have therefore initiated an extensive emergency community development programme, which will serve as a driver to accelerate the reduction in socioeconomic and spatial inequalities within cities and territories. It will be a special multisectoral and integrated programme, which I personally will lead with a view to making up for some of the country\u2019s delayed progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The programme will be supported structurally and financially by all our partners and assisted by the United Nations Development Programme. It seeks to increase people\u2019s access to basic social services, in particular by promoting rural micro-hydroelectric power plants, for which more than 700 sites have already been identified. The programme also seeks to develop human capital and to improve land connectivity through rural roads.\nThe socioeconomic development of humankind by 2030 must be sustainable or it will not be. In that regard, the fate of us all, rich or poor, is more closely linked than ever. With its natural resources and demographic strength, Africa has become key to that sustainability.\nIn such an Africa, nature has made my country the custodian of 47 per cent of the continent\u2019s forests, placing in it a major responsibility in addressing the challenges of our planet\u2019s survival.\nI have already had to reiterate this on several occasions: it is vital and urgent to make available to our continent new sources of energy and new modes of production that are compatible with protecting the environment and affirming our inalienable right to development.\nWe are firmly committed to protecting our forests. However, the preservation of our natural heritage must not be at the expense of our development.\nIt is incomprehensible that the forests of the Congo Basin, which are the best preserved in the world, receive only 1 per cent of the available funding. It is essential that the entire international financial architecture, including the International Monetary Fund in its catalytic role in development financing, further integrate environmental considerations into its analysis of the macroeconomic criteria and challenges associated with its interventions in the different countries.\nFor our part, aware of the major role of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in that regard, our Government has relaunched dialogue with its main partners on environmental issues, in particular those within the Central Africa World Heritage Forest Initiative. In response to the Secretary-General\u2019s appeal, our Government has committed, through me, to increasing the level of its commitments under its nationally determined contribution and to continuing close cooperation among the countries of the subregion in order to speak with a single voice on all major issues related to forest conservation.\nMy Government has made the production of clean and renewable energy its foremost/top economic priorities for the five-year term.\nThrough aggressive investments and an attractive policy of protecting those investments, we can go from less than 10 per cent electrification at present to 60 per cent in the next 10 years, significantly reducing the consumption of firewood. Also, as part of the realization of our input energy mix, in order to strengthen the fight against deforestation, my Government encourages the development of domestic gas use in urban, peri-urban and rural areas.\nIn the long term, we want to be the place on the planet where the electric kilowatt hour will be the cheapest thanks to harnessing/exploiting our capacity of more than 100,000 megawatts in hydroelectricity.\nWe are willing to further regulate logging and expand national reserves and parks to increase our biomass and protect our biodiversity. On the other hand, that can be achieved only with the effective implementation of an environmentally responsible industrialization strategy that focuses on production and consumption centres and generating jobs for our youth. Our population, with an average age of 17.5 years, is only slightly older than young Greta Thunberg, and they share some of her concerns and interests. But how will our young people engage in the same struggle when they have neither water nor light?\nI have also decided to gradually transition my country out of an outdated agricultural system that has low productivity and is destroying our forest heritage. To that end, we will promote agroforestry that maximizes our comparative advantage for certain crops, with a focus on savannah areas. I intend to make the environmental issue a pervasive and cross-cutting concern in all our development policies, strategies, programmes and projects.\nAs I address the world from this rostrum for the first time, I must recall the special relationship between the Organization and my country. Above all, the relationship evokes in me a sense of gratitude. Indeed, the Democratic Republic of Congo has often been at the centre of the Organization\u2019s concerns owing to the many crises it has experienced since its independence.\nFrom the tragic death of Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold and the many peacekeepers killed in action to the recent heinous assassination of United Nations experts Zaida Catalan and Michael Sharp, the United Nations, more than any other international organization, has itself experienced the realities faced by millions of my compatriots. The United Nations and its various agencies have also deployed significant financial resources to support the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I would therefore like to reiterate to the United Nations the gratitude of the Congolese people, who will never forget its support.\nNonetheless, I cannot help but regret that the history of my country is so painfully linked to the United Nations, which has deployed a peace mission there for 24 of the 59 years of our independence. Why, despite that long presence, have most hopes for peace and development been dashed? Beyond internal choices and responsibilities, my country and Africa cannot be seen in isolation from the rest of the world and the interests of others.\nWhat would the Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s trajectory have been without the assassination of Patrice Emery Lumumba? What would have become of my country if it had been allowed to continue its peaceful post-Cold War democratic apprenticeship without being derailed by a war from without? I need not go so far back in time \u2014 every day we experience clashes of interests that explain, more often than not, the ongoing fragility of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nThe greatest challenge facing my country today is how to ensure peace, security and stability. Since our inauguration, convinced of the absolute necessity for peace, we have unreservedly committed to achieving that goal, taking into account its full regional and international dimension. With that in mind, last July at the thirty-ninth summit of the Southern African Development Community, held in Dar es Salaam, I proposed the creation of a regional coalition, modelled on the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, to eradicate the scourge of insecurity created by armed groups of internal and external origin.\nIn the east of my country, with the support of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), our security forces are fighting back on a daily basis, determined to eradicate the negative forces that are spreading death and desolation among our population. Some of those rebel movements, including the Allied Democratic Forces, conduct terrorist activities that are consistent with their allegiance to Da\u2019esh, thereby posing a new threat to both my country and the subregion.\nAs if conflict and instability were not enough, for the past year the eastern Central African Republic has been suffering from an outbreak of the Ebola virus. Owing to the seriousness of the situation, last May I set up a technical unit under my supervision, composed of internationally renowned experts and led by my compatriot, Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, who identified the Ebola virus and whose research led to the discovery of mAb 114, a molecule used to treat that disease.\nThe new response strategy is beginning to have an impact, particularly in the city of Goma, which is now immune to the virus. Although much has been done, the epidemic has not yet been eradicated. In addition to the Ebola vaccine, the strategy will be bolstered by the introduction of five new approved drugs that will help to completely eliminate the scourge.\nI would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the outpouring of solidarity from our bilateral and multilateral partners, including the World Health Organization, the African Union, UNICEF, the World Food Programme, MONUSCO and many others. With particular regard to MONUSCO, at the present pivotal time for its future in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has been marked by the conduct of a strategic review, I would like first of all to reiterate the gratitude of the Congolese people to the contributing countries for the human and material sacrifices they have made for my country to date.\nI note a convergence of views with the Secretary-General on the urgent need to readjust the configuration of MONUSCO to the changing situation on the ground by focusing more on the operational response capabilities of United Nations forces alongside the Forces armees de la Republique Democratique du Congo. In other words, the Democratic Republic of the Congo still needs MONUSCO, but a streamlined, well-equipped, robust MONUSCO, with an appropriate mandate, like the Rapid Intervention Brigade that once helped rout the Mouvement du 23 mars.\nLike other developing countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo wishes to advance. We are convinced that, given its geostrategic position at the crossroads of the economic groupings of Central, South and East Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo should opt for African integration as an engine of development and a vector of peace among nations.\nThat is why we have supported the project for an African continental free trade area, even as we are aware that it will be implemented in stages. That process will inevitably require the streamlining and dismantling of customs barriers. It is with that in mind that the Democratic Republic of the Congo intends to accelerate the implementation of an infrastructure development programme for its immense area of 2,345,000 square kilometres in order to link the country from east to west and north to south, facilitate the movement of goods and people and unlock the agricultural potential of our provinces.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo today holds about 70 per cent of the world\u2019s reserves of strategic metals, which are essential to achieving the energy and digital transition that humankind needs. Rather than using those natural mineral reserves as a source of monopolistic income, my country intends to open itself up to the world by allowing the regulated exploitation of its subsoil in exchange for support for industrialization and the production of batteries and higher value-added components. While the world has a thirst for cobalt, coltan and lithium, we in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have a need for industrial jobs, training and development.\nMy country also has 53 per cent of Africa\u2019s freshwater reserves. The sustainable management of that potential will one day help to quench the thirst of one quarter of the planet\u2019s inhabitants.\nWe are currently experiencing a profound crisis of the international liberal order. Rule by force serves only to engender frustration and violence, as illustrated by the recent attacks on oil installations in Saudi Arabia, raising fears of a conflagration in the vicinity of the Strait of Hormuz that would paralyse the world economy. We have a duty to denounce any form of violent reaction to political problems that could be resolved through dialogue and consultation.\nAre we ready to define a new world order in which Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo play a role bestowed on us by the changes that have taken place? I believe that a new path is possible \u2014 undoubtedly a very difficult, complex and demanding path that will require us to think outside the box.\nMy country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2014 which recently held democratic and peaceful elections for the third time \u2014 has been fortunate enough to experience a peaceful and democratic transfer of power for the first time in its history, despite many outside observers painting a rather gloomy and pessimistic picture of the outcome of those elections. That historic victory is above all one of the Congolese people, whose heavy sacrifices in recent years have been rewarded by the successful holding of elections under high-risk circumstances.\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank the international community, in particular the Southern African Development Community countries, as well as Kenya, Egypt and the United States, which did not hesitate to encourage the giant step taken by my country in the process of building a State governed by the rule of law. Since my inauguration as President, I have been working to consolidate democratic progress by guaranteeing all rights and freedoms. No one is harassed for their opinions. The Democratic Republic of the Congo no longer has prisoners of conscience. None of our people feel the need to emigrate in order to save their lives or safeguard their security because of their individual political convictions or associations.\nAs far as gender mainstreaming is concerned, although we have yet to achieve full gender parity, I am pleased to say that progress has been made in that area across all sectors in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. By increasing the rate of participation of women from 6 per cent to 18 per cent, the current Government has achieved the highest level of female participation in my country\u2019s history. I have committed to making the issue of gender one of my political priorities.\nAt the regional level, I have engaged in intense diplomatic activities with a view to reaffirming my country\u2019s continued commitment to ensuring good-neighbourly relations and peaceful coexistence, with full respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other nations. In that regard, we African leaders must endow our continent with a voice of consensus and harmony, based on policies that are truly African.\nAllow me to express my deep concern about what is happening in the Mediterranean Sea, where many people who are seeking to emigrate are dying every day in inhumane conditions. The waves of refugees and the shocking images we have seen over the past few years on the coast of Europe should challenge our consciences as leaders. More than 500,000 migrants have tried to reach Europe via the Mediterranean since the beginning of 2015, and more than 5,000 of them have died during the crossing.\nThe seriousness of that disaster requires that we find urgent and effective solutions. The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, adopted in Marrakech in 2018, is our response to the migration crisis. We have a duty to draw up ambitious national initiatives as soon as possible with a view to implementing that agreement, but our best weapon is to strive for development, equity and stability around the world.\nI issue a call from this rostrum for the full lifting of sanctions that have been affecting the Republic of Zimbabwe since 2002. Those sanctions are no longer justifiable at a time when that country has started a new chapter in its history and shown itself to be open to cooperating with the rest of the world. Upholding those sanctions is unfair \u2014 it hampers the country\u2019s attractiveness to foreign investment and affects not only Zimbabwe but also the entire region.\nThe absolute top priority of my work is to offer a perspective of dignity to our population, promote job creation \u2014 especially for young people \u2014 and combat insecurity and exclusion. The General Assembly, which wishes to reduce inequalities and build a more inclusive world, can be the advocate for those who have been left out. The challenge ahead of us is enormous, but what makes us human is our ability to find solutions \u2014 even those that seem most improbable \u2014 when necessary.\n"

        "file_text": "It will surprise no one that climate change and its catastrophic consequences are foremost in my mind. As the leader of a small island State, which, two years later, is still suffering the damaging consequences of Hurricane Irma, we know and live the terrible reality of climate change. Those who continue to deny its existence cannot gainsay the massive destruction to property and loss of life that so glaringly stare them in the face year after year. No one can repudiate the awful scenes flashed globally across television screens and through social media of the decimation of the Abaco islands and Grand Bahama in the Bahamas island chain. The lament of the people of the Bahamas, as that entire nation suffered in hopelessness, should echo in the ears of all who feel any compassion for their fellow human beings.\nThe consequences of climate change have become our annual Hiroshima. The effects are as horrific as any battleground and as devastating and long-lasting as the detonation of an atomic bomb. But, in this war that we did not start, that we do not wage and that we do not want, the peoples of small island States have no means to defend themselves and little means to recover. We are simply the hapless victims of those Governments whose destructive climate policies are killing small island States, with brutal storm after brutal storm, each more destructive than the last.\nThe economies of Caribbean small island States are rooted in tourism and agriculture, which are sectors that are very dependent on stable climate conditions. Already, these activities are being persistently disrupted, causing our countries to lose revenue and incur large recurring debt to finance both reconstruction and resilience-building. With few exceptions, pledges of assistance, when they have been made, are inadequate and slow to be delivered, if they are delivered at all.\nDespite all the targets set by climate-change conferences to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C over pre-industrial levels, every nation on this earth, and all the people within them, should understand that, even if that small level of ambition is achieved, these climate effects will continue for at least a thousand years. That is correct: a thousand years. The Assembly should take urgent and special note of the special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on the impacts of global warming, entitled Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C, and the recent Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.\nIn small island States, we have come to the painful conclusion that 30 or more generations of our people will, year after year, suffer from conditions already created by the harmful greenhouse-gas emissions of a handful of countries. We also know that, if this profligate behaviour does not stop, many of our island States will not last another thousand years. We also fear that the necessary action to halt greenhouse-gas emissions might only come when a few countries and coastal communities are entirely washed away and eliminated from the face of the global map. Even then, after a ritual wringing of hands and pledges to act to stop the obliteration of small island States, business may well continue as usual.\nThat is the sad reality. And it is not, of course, a prospect that the Governments and peoples of small States will contemplate for a second, which is why this is pre-eminently a time to speak the truth \u2014 the whole truth \u2014 frankly and boldly in this Assembly, without fear or favour. The very existence of our small island States and our civilization are imperilled. However, we will not sit idly by in silence. Action is imperative, and we certainly will act now.\nThis year, we mark the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, the activities of a handful of nations are making a mockery of the Convention, which asserts that improving the living conditions of children in every community is crucial, especially in developing countries. The prospects for the world\u2019s children are impaired, and they are being robbed of a bright and prosperous future. That is correct \u2014 we are robbing our youth of a bright and prosperous future. I congratulate Ms. Greta Thunberg and all the children she motivated globally, including those in my own country. In fact, I congratulate all those who acted in solidarity on 20 September to warn our Governments to take bold action against climate change. I remind the Assembly that young people are watching and that Governments choosing to turn a deaf ear to them will surely pay a price.\nThe protection of fossil-fuel economic interests at the expense of climate justice is unfair, unjust and unconscionable. If Governments have lost their moral compass in a world where multilateralism and common interests are being discarded, we must hope that Governments realize nonetheless that global cooperation is still required to preserve national interests. We should remind ourselves of the wisdom of the poet John Donne\u2019s Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions, and several steps in my Sickness: \u201cNo man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.\u201d\nWhether they like it or not, refugees from the countries that are decimated by hurricanes will wash up on their shores. It is inescapable. The internally displaced persons forced to leave their homes due to hurricanes in 2017, and also in 2019, were cared for mostly within their own national boundaries. But there were others who had to seek refuge elsewhere \u2014 refuge that was not provided within a legal and predictable framework but was offered by other nations in a spirit of generosity and compassion. This is not an acceptable basis for going forward. With the best will in the world, generosity is constrained by capacity, and compassion is tempered by reality.\nThis Assembly should recognize that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which operates under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, contemplates refugees only in the context of conflict and/or political upheaval. However, the number of refugees already created by climate change and the potential for greater numbers in future demand that the legal recognition of a refugee includes persons forced to seek refuge outside of their national borders. In this regard, my Government proposes that Member States agree at this Assembly that the matter of climate refugees be taken up in all the appropriate committees to secure an agreed definition of the term \u201cclimate refugee\u201d, which could be adopted in international law where it does not now exist.\nMy Government is perfectly aware that this proposal will be resisted by those Governments that deny climate change and are fearful of acknowledging its consequences. Nonetheless, we will put it forward, seeking support from countries that are similarly threatened and from States that recognize the potential threats. We will act to protect lives and safeguard order. But if this matter is left unaddressed by the United Nations, then it will certainly carry the indelible stain of guilt for the catastrophe that will befall us because we failed to act to establish a global framework to manage cross-border climate refugees.\nIn this Hall, in the presence of high representatives of the world\u2019s peoples, I invoke the words of United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt who said, at a time of crisis, in 1933: \u201cIn the field of world policy, I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbour, the neighbour who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others, the neighbour who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbours.\u201d\nThere is only one common homeland and one human race. There is no Planet B, or any viable alternative planet on which to live. The worst and immediate victims of climate change are small island States, where a history of human exploitation and neglect has left significant numbers of our population poor and without resources to build climate-resilient infrastructure and homes. That is our inheritance but, eventually, climate change will make victims of people who live in the large land masses too, and not only their coastal areas but their hinterlands as well. That process has started already, on every continent and across every border. The only solution to the harmful effects of climate change is to stop the greenhouse-gas emissions. There is no other choice. And that is what the heavy users of fossil fuels must do. They must lead by example to achieve a carbon-neutral world.\nPresident Roosevelt\u2019s summons to every nation to be a good neighbour is more relevant now than it was 86 years ago. In Antigua and Barbuda, we are playing our part. My Government has banned the importation of single-use plastics and is actively transforming our marine environment into a plastic-free one. We are also actively making the transition into alternate energy with intended nationally determined contributions that will make our country carbon neutral by 2040.\nEarlier this year, we were pleased to host an international concert, the Play it Out concert, in collaboration with the Government of Norway and the former President of the General Assembly, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, to heighten global awareness of the harmful effects of plastics on our oceans. Antigua and Barbuda is standing up to be counted among those countries that are doing \u2014 and will continue to do \u2014 all in their power to curb pollution in all its aspects.\nThere is a notion abroad that developing countries, especially small ones, operate on a premise that rich and powerful nations are to be blamed for their problems of underdevelopment and lack of capacity to produce and compete, and that, consequently, we the developing countries live in a state of paralysis, waiting for aid. That notion is extremely flawed; it is very different from reality. Our small nations are not beggars; we are not mendicants. But, where there is injustice, we must fight for justice. Where there is inequity, we must fight for equity. Whereas most countries have access to cheap funding on the capital markets, needy small island States have had to borrow at commercial rates to fund their development. Where is the justice in that? That is why we have to fight for change. That is why we have to fight for equity. What we want is access to financing on fair and concessionary terms, commensurate with our size and vulnerabilities. That is not too much to ask.\nWe have a proud history of seizing the reins of our independence and sovereignty against all odds. We have done so to develop our countries rapidly after centuries of colonial or hegemonistic exploitation. But we know that our underdevelopment and financial vulnerability were created by centuries of exploitation in slavery and bonded labour for which no compensation was paid. That is why Caribbean countries, in all sectors driven by non-governmental organizations, have urged the relevant European Governments to repair the debilitating socioeconomic conditions, the destruction of resources and the dehumanization and genocide of Caribbean people resulting from the slave trade, slavery and the ravages of colonialism. That is why I take the opportunity of the Assembly to do so again.\nThe relevant European nations should provide reparations, not only because, at last, it would compensate for their development on the backs of our people, but because it is the morally correct thing to do to restore equity and justice. And we should be clear: reparation is not aid and it is not a gift. It is compensation to correct the injustices of the past and restore equity. That is what we want. We want equity. Similarly, the provision of finance to support mitigation, adaptation and resilience in small States, such as Antigua and Barbuda, is not aid. It is compensation for the damage done to our countries, for the reversals in our economic gains and for the additional money we must spend to counter the further injurious effects of climate change, in which we play little part.\nMy country and others in the Caribbean are intent on promoting economic growth, social development and resilience by internal action. We will do so even as we expect developed countries to meet their obligations. We do not depend on them exclusively. But it seems that every time we achieve a high level of competitiveness with rich regions of the world, they impose arbitrary measures to undermine and shackle us. Indeed, in the financial services sector, anti-competitive actions have been forced on us by the European Union in the area of taxation, despite the fact that our countries have been compliant with standards set by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Further, despite our vulnerabilities as remote islands, confronted with high interest and insurance costs, unsustainable debt and frequent disasters arising from climate change, we are disqualified from access to concessional financing based on a single criterion \u2014 per capita income. That cannot be fair. That cannot be just.\nToday, we reiterate our call for the removal of the per capita income criterion, which precludes vulnerable small island States from accessing much-needed concessional funding. In addition, climate funding to adapt, mitigate and build resilience should not be subject to any conditionality, but be based exclusively on vulnerability and need. That is what is equitable.\nAnother injustice the Caribbean is confronting is the phenomenon of the withdrawal of correspondent banking relations \u2014 in essence, the financial abandonment of our region by banks in the United States and some parts of Europe. That is based primarily on profit motives and the false allegations that our countries are major money-launderers and tax havens, which is simply not so. Both the Financial Action Task Force and the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have assessed and found most of our countries to be fully compliant with rigorous international standards. Yet the process of withdrawing correspondent banking relations continues unabated, thereby threatening to exclude Caribbean countries from the international payment system and de-banking our nations, with the potential to plunge all of them into poverty. Again, that is an inequitable approach. Let me make the point here that correspondent banking is a public global good and a fundamental human right that must be available to all countries and regions.\nUnless that process is stopped and reversed, it is not only Caribbean countries that will suffer, but so too will the developed countries in which the global banks are located. For the Caribbean\u2019s exclusion from the world\u2019s trading system and the resultant economic collapse will create poverty, unemployment, crime, including drug trafficking, underground money-laundering and refugees \u2014 all of which will challenge the security of wealthy neighbouring States in this hemisphere. If those countries will not act in our interest, they certainly should act in their own interests. The fire in our house, which we did not start, will inevitably spread to theirs. The time to extinguish it is now.\nOur small island States could be forgiven for their belief that the cards are being deliberately stacked against them. No evidence is available to contend otherwise. In this connection, my Government is obliged once again to draw to the attention of the Assembly the fact that 15 years ago my country won an arbitration against the United States, the most powerful country in the world, at the World Trade Organization (WTO). The matter was appealed twice, and twice the arbitral award was given in Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s favour. The final award was made 12 years ago, imagine that \u2014 12 years ago.\nThe World Trade Organization gave my country the right to sell United States copyright material on an annual basis, and it did so in order to help us recover the full costs of our trade losses. However, we decided not to do so but to negotiate with the United States Government, since the former option would have deprived United States copyright holders of deserved income from their intellectual property, through no fault of their own. We thought that we were doing the sensible thing. But advantage has been taken of our forbearance and our magnanimity. Despite the ruling of the WTO, my small country has not been able to bring the representatives of the United States to the table to settle this arbitration award. This is a typical example of might is right, and of \u201cto whom much is given, much is expected\u201d. The arbitral award due to us has been ignored, while the perennial trade surplus that the United States enjoys with my little country has exceeded $3.53 billion during the past 12 years. This, too, is unfair, it is unjust and it is unconscionable. How many times do we have to come here to the United Nations and ask the United States to settle? We want justice.\nOnce again, we urge the United States to respect the decision of the WTO and settle its obligations as soon as possible. Twelve years is too long. Let me make it abundantly clear that our country cannot forgo legally awarded recompense for the trade losses we have suffered as a result of United States action \u2014 and we will not. We are not afraid of its might. We are standing on principle. In fact, let me make it clear that we, too, have a duty of care to our people. So, just as how it is protecting its interests, we must also protect our national interests. The last time I checked, we live in a democratic world, so those who want to take punitive action against us for speaking out for what is right can do so. But we will stand in any forum and defend the interests of Antigua and Barbuda.\nMy Government is deeply concerned about the trade contention between the United States and the People\u2019s Republic of China. Trade wars invariably push up the cost of living for peoples across the world, especially the poor and vulnerable, and, ultimately, they cause the entire global economy to suffer. There are no winners in this. We are already in that spiral. Confrontation instead of dialogue and cooperation is exacerbating risks, eroding confidence and weakening the prospects of global economic growth. There will be no winners if this continues, only losers. Unfortunately, among the hardest hit will be small island developing States, with their open and vulnerable economies. So there we go again, suffering from the injustices of the mighty. The international system, which has never been perfect, is now being dangerously weakened. A handful of powerful nations are seeking to violate international norms and the rule of law to advance narrow political agendas \u2014 concerned more with getting rid of Governments that they dislike than with advancing human rights, under whose guise they seek cover. We are not stupid; we know exactly what they are doing, and we are watching them.\nOnly this week, 16 countries, a few of them perhaps coerced into participation, maybe by threats or promises, invoked the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance as a weapon against the sovereign nation of Venezuela. The Treaty is a 72-year-old anachronism that encourages the use of force against a sovereign State, contrary to international law and not within the concept of the legitimate defence set out in Article 51 of our United Nations Charter. Without producing a shred of evidence to support their allegations, those 16 nations have arbitrarily decided to impose sanctions against Venezuela, with the sole intention of regime change. They are doing so against all international standards. We all know that United Nations standards call for non-interference and non-intervention in the affairs of other States. In fact, significantly, we should note that the International Contact Group on Venezuela, at a meeting on the same day, reaffirmed that the only sustainable solution to the Venezuelan crisis was a political, peaceful and democratic one, excluding the use of force and through credible and transparent presidential elections. Now that position is sensible and in keeping with international law.\nMy Government protests the arrogance inherent in the belief of 16 countries that they have the right to decide for the rest of the world. How can they believe that they can ignore the United Nations, be contemptuous of the Security Council and act to harm a country on a spurious charge of drug trafficking, money laundering and organized crime? That action follows the same formula that has destabilized Cuba, robbing that country of the possibility of fulfilling its considerable potential to contribute fully to global advancement, peace and security. Why can we not live in peace and harmony? Why can we not resolve our conflicts through diplomacy and dialogue? My Government once again calls on the United States to lift the debilitating sanctions against Cuba and those against Venezuela. It is killing innocent people.\nWe are also troubled by events in the Middle East and the overall heightening of tensions in the world, in which multilateral solutions are being discarded in favour of unilateral action, and even the contemplation of war. The world is not the O.K. Corral, and a gunfight should not decide who wins and who loses. My Government calls on all Governments to return to the rules-based system of international relations, which was meticulously established to settle disputes and resolve conflicts. The rules are there to protect all of us. A world of prosperity will not be sustained without global cooperation, global peace and global justice.\nIn this context, I recall the words of Nelson Mandela, who knew much about working with the enemy \u2014 real, perceived or created. He said: \u201cIf you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy. Then he becomes your partner\u201d.\nThe world needs partners, not enemies. Our planet and all our peoples depend on it.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to join in the heartfelt congratulations extended to Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I would also like to express my appreciation to Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her excellent work as President of the Assembly at its seventy-third session.\nFor nearly 75 years the United Nations has been a universal platform for discussing and resolving urgent issues of the day. However, the world we live in is changing rapidly. The current unstable situation, in a context of growing geopolitical and economic competition as well as increasing numbers of global threats and challenges, demands that we act effectively and consistently. We believe it is essential to marshal all the tools at the Organization\u2019s disposal and to improve our joint efforts. We must also strengthen our commitment to maintaining the rules-based order, with an effectively functioning United Nations at its centre. In that regard, Tajikistan supports the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to promote comprehensive reform of the Organization, aimed at strengthening and enhancing its capacity to counter today\u2019s challenges and threats in a timely and effective manner.\nTerrorism and extremism, together with transnational organized crime and illicit drug trafficking, undermine international peace and security, aggravate conflicts and destabilize entire regions. They hinder our efforts to advance and protect human rights and promote sustainable development. Today Tajikistan is doing its utmost to help to combat terrorism and extremism, transnational organized crime and illicit drug trafficking. Given our years of experience in peacebuilding and in preventing and countering terrorism, as well as combating illicit drug trafficking, in May in Dushanbe we held a high-level conference on international and regional cooperation on countering terrorism and its financing through illicit drug trafficking and organized crime. The Dushanbe conference was the first in a series of regional initiatives within the framework of the follow-up process to the High-level Conference of Heads of Counter-Terrorism Agencies of Member States convened by the Secretary-General on 28 and 29 June 2018 in New York. We are confident that the Dushanbe conference will serve as an important platform for comprehensive dialogue and the exchange of best practices and experiences among all interested parties.\nIssues related to combating terrorism and extremism were also discussed at the fifth Summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia, held in Dushanbe on 15 June. As the current Chair of the Conference, we believe it important to advance our countries\u2019 efforts to promote peace, stability and security in Asia, which should focus on dismantling the military infrastructure of international terrorism, denying it political, military and financial support and preventing the misuse of the Internet for radicalization, recruitment and propagandizing for extremism and violence.\nIllicit drug trafficking is one of the primary sources of terrorism financing. As my country is on the front lines of the battle against that evil, we have done a great deal to address it since becoming independent. At the direction of President Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan, our national drug enforcement agency was established in 1999 with the support of the United Nations. In 2013 we adopted a national counter-narcotics strategy for the period from 2013 to 2020. In what we see as an important and timely initiative, President Rahmon has proposed establishing, with the support of the United Nations, a special group that would include representatives of law-enforcement agencies from the countries of the so-called Northern Route, with the participation of experts researching issues related to illicit drug trafficking. We hope that Member States will support that initiative.\nSecurity and stability in Central Asia are closely linked to developments in Afghanistan. Tajikistan\u2019s border with Afghanistan is the longest of any country, and since the first days of our independence we have therefore worked consistently to promote lasting peace and stability in our neighbour. We are also making a practical contribution to Afghanistan\u2019s social and economic development by connecting our two countries\u2019 transport corridors through an energy bridge, the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project, which provides the Afghan people with electricity and essential commodities, as well as by training specialists. One of the important areas in that regard is involving Afghanistan in the process of multilateral regional cooperation and the creation of conditions that will help to fulfil the transit potential of the country and the region. Tajikistan fully supports the efforts of the Afghanistan authorities to establish a peaceful negotiation process.\nThis is a very important year for taking stock of the results of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The four-year cycle of the High-level Political forum on Sustainable Development has been successfully completed. We have plenty of room for enhancing our efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda over the next 11 years, since the current pace of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is insufficient, despite significant efforts. In that regard, we support the call of the Secretary-General to act urgently and with purpose in order to successfully implement the 2030 Agenda in a timely manner. We have adopted a national development strategy for the period up to 2030 and a medium-term development plan from 2016 to 2020, both of which fully align with the 2030 Agenda and are key tools for ensuring national ownership of the SDGs in Tajikistan. However, we are also dealing with an array of new issues and problems, first and foremost of which, in our view, is climate change, which seriously affects the process of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and their targets.\nOver the past 60 years, the average annual air temperature in Tajikistan has increased by 1\u00b0C. The number of days with heavy precipitation has increased, as have the frequency and intensity of natural hydro-meteorological events. Water-related natural disasters alone cost our economy hundreds of millions of dollars in damage every year. Natural disasters often claim human lives. The negative impact of climate change on the quantity and quality of the world\u2019s freshwater resources is also becoming increasingly evident. In the past few decades Tajikistan has seen the surface area of its glaciers, which are vitally important to the whole of Central Asia, shrink significantly. In that regard, we believe it is essential to strengthen cooperation among countries in order to address the consequences of natural disasters by developing preventive measures and establishing funds to assist countries in need. It is also essential to enhance the monitoring of glaciers, snow and other water sources and take effective steps to protect them for future generations.\nWe consider it vital to promote development of a green economy in every way, and particularly green energy, which is a crucial component of sustainable development. Expanding the use of renewable energy, principally hydroelectricity, contributes to Tajikistan\u2019s economic and social development while keeping harmful emissions into the atmosphere as low as possible. Hydropower plants, which generate about 98 per cent of our electricity, form the basis of the country\u2019s energy sector. The Government has been taking comprehensive measures to balance energy production and consumption by modernizing and upgrading our existing hydropower stations, building new ones and introducing modern energy-conservation methods.\nTajikistan is a leader in promoting water issues at the global level. It is well known that in the past few decades, at the initiative of President Rahmon four important global initiatives were endorsed by the General Assembly. In the course of their promotion and implementation, the initiatives received broad support from Member States, international and regional organizations, financial institutions, prominent members of the science and business communities and representatives of civil society. In 2018, we began implementing our fourth global initiative, the International Decade for Action \u201cWater for Sustainable Development\u201d 2018-2028. Resolution 71/222, on this issue, outlines the modalities of the midterm comprehensive review of the Decade\u2019s implementation and envisages two important global events. For the first time since the first United Nations Water Conference was held in Mar del Plata, Argentina, more than 40 years ago, a United Nations conference on the midterm comprehensive review of the implementation of the objectives of the International Decade for Action \u201cWater for Sustainable Development\u201d will be held in New York in March 2023. In 2021, there will be a one-day high-level meeting of the General Assembly to promote the implementation of the water-related goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda.\nIn that connection, the Republic of Tajikistan, as part of the Dushanbe process, will hold the second conference on the implementation of the International Decade of Action, entitled \u201cGalvanizing water-related actions and partnerships at the local, national, regional and global levels\u201d, in Dushanbe in June 2020. We sincerely hope that Member States will once again support us and take an active part in our upcoming conference in Dushanbe. We believe firmly that developing water cooperation and partnerships will help to ensure the timely adoption of measures needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\nIn conclusion, I would like to note that today, against a background of emerging problems on a global scale, we must make tremendous efforts to achieve the goals we have set in a timely way. Of those, the most urgent are the threats of global terrorism, climate change, environmental degradation, acute shortages of resources and the growing gap between poor and rich countries and population groups. The United Nations remains the only universal organization capable of coordinating and uniting the efforts of the entire international community to resolve these problems currently facing humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "The Government and the people of Solomon Islands join me in congratulating Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. His wealth of experience will serve the United Nations well as he leads us through the Assembly\u2019s agenda, and I want to assure him of the support and cooperation of Solomon Islands during his time in office. I also wish to express my gratitude to his predecessor, Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her sterling leadership and stewardship over the past year, and to wish her every success in her future endeavours.\nIf there was ever a time where the work of the United Nations needed to be enhanced, it is now. The many challenges we face require collective efforts and solidarity for progressive action moving forward. Our aspirations for achieving peace and well- being and living in dignity depend on the strength of multilateralism. The theme of this session of the General Assembly, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, is therefore both fitting and timely.\nAs we prepare to commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the creation of our Organization, let us use a reinvigorated United Nations to provide the platform on which we, the leaders, can confront the many challenges and issues that we face today and will face long into future. That requires collective action. We must not allow the United Nations to be undermined by the unilateral actions of a few. The United Nations was set up for all. It provides a platform for global discussions. It unites and promotes our common strengths in addressing the complex challenges facing our countries.\nOver the past 41 years, our relationship with the United Nations has been managed externally from the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s Pacific Office in Fiji. We reiterate our call for the United Nations to end its business-as-usual approach and build a stronger country presence in Solomon Islands. We do not accept the outcome of the assessment of the Multi-country Office, which recommended retaining the current arrangement. Solomon Islands is a post-conflict country. Its population is estimated to surpass that of Fiji by the early 2030s. It deserves to have its own country office.\nClimate change and natural disasters are affecting all our countries. Our oceans are warming. Sea levels are rising. Extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones, hurricanes, flooding, drought and king tides, are becoming more intense, inflicting more damage and destruction on communities and ecosystems. They put people\u2019s lives at risk. In this regard, my Government expresses its sincere condolences to the Government and the people of the Bahamas for the recent destruction caused by and the lives lost in Hurricane Dorian. We are steadfast in our support for and solidarity with the Government and the people of the Bahamas as they embark on the long recovery process ahead.\nThe Pacific island countries and the Caribbean island countries are and always will be at the forefront of the climatic events generated through the changing global climate systems. The Secretary-General\u2019s visit to the Pacific earlier this year highlighted the gravity of climate change for small island States. In the 75 years of the history of the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres is only the second Secretary-General to visit the Pacific islands. His visit demonstrates his personal commitment to better understanding the plight of the peoples of the Pacific in their struggle against climate change. It helped him see and understand that climate change is a matter of life and death for the peoples of the Pacific.\nThe impact of climate change is well documented. However, it is important to remind the General Assembly of a few key points. By 2030, it is estimated that 90 per cent of our coral reefs will be bleached, threatening the food security, fisheries and livelihoods of our people. There will be more frequent severe weather events leading to the destruction of property and the loss of life. The economic costs resulting from severe weather events in smaller island States are beyond the capacity of each individual country to address or respond.\nIt is also important to reflect on the impact of climate change to date. Solomon Islands is experiencing an impact of climate change that is three times the global average. The pace of sea-level rise means that we are continuing to lose islands. The ongoing resettlement of internally displaced populations is now a new normal. We remain in an endless state of recovery from slow-onset events; this is particularly the case with populations living on low-lying islands.\nConsidering those events, my Government wants to once again convey its sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General for gracing our region with his visit, which showed us that he cares. There is no room for cynicism or complacency. We need urgent and collective climate action. The Kainaki II Declaration for Urgent Climate Change Action Now, issued by leaders at the Pacific Islands Forum held in Tuvalu last month, reaffirmed climate change as the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and well-being of our peoples.\nWe commend the Secretary-General\u2019s Climate Action Summit, convened this week. However, we are disappointed by the lack of political will on the part of those with the means of implementation to present more ambitious commitments that would put us on a pathway below 1.5\u00b0C. In the current circumstances, we are heading towards a 3\u00b0C world. The science is clear and non-negotiable, and we must ensure that our policies and actions are guided by it.\nSolomon Islands has embarked on an exciting journey to further reduce its carbon footprint. In 2024, we will commission our first 15-megawatt hydropower project, which will reduce fossil-fuel consumption by 70 per cent, the equivalent of 50,600 tons of carbon-dioxide greenhouse-gas emissions. This is more than twice our commitment under the nationally determined contributions we have submitted. We continue to call for international partnership to help us meet our conditional emission-reduction targets of 45 per cent by 2030 and 50 per cent by 2050.\nWe rely on our oceans for our livelihoods. Much of our economy is linked to our oceans, including tourism, fisheries and transportation. Our oceans are an essential part of our culture, gastronomy and leisure. Our identity as islanders is inextricably linked to the ocean. It defines who we are. As an ocean State, we are committed to strengthening the management, use and conservation of our oceans, including the high seas.\nIt is no secret that our ocean is the last remaining rich fishing ground in the world. Our region supplies more than 60 per cent of the world\u2019s tuna. It is our shared responsibility and in our collective interest to have a healthy ocean with a healthy tuna stock to ensure that we have sustained supplies of tuna for current and future generations.\nOur regional institutions, the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency, which is located in our capital city, and the secretariat of the Pacific Community, continue to assist our island countries in managing the tuna resources of our member States, worth over $3 billion annually. This annual catch generates $535 million for the region and contributes more than $400 million to the region\u2019s gross domestic product. Despite these facts, it is the distant-water fishing nations that still obtain the largest benefits from the tuna industry. Solomon Islands\u2019 tuna catch in our waters last year amounted to 124,724 tons. Some 24,000 tons are processed for consumption by our local company, SolTuna Limited. The export of processed tuna generated an average annual export value of $59 million and provides 2,000 jobs.\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is undermining our tuna-management system. We have put in place mechanisms, including the Niue Treaty on Cooperation in Fisheries Surveillance and Law Enforcement in the South Pacific Region and the Vessel Day Scheme, as a deterrence-management system. IUU fishing in the Western and Central Pacific region has an estimated value of $600 million, with an estimated direct economic loss of around $150 million for island countries. We call on distant-water fishing nations to eliminate IUU fishing and to ensure that ocean States receive the full benefits from the resources within their jurisdiction.\nThe Pacific small island developing States are in one of the largest oceans in the world, with an estimated total area of more than 36 million square kilometres. The Solomon Islands exclusive economic zone amounts to 1.4 million square kilometres of sea, compared to a land area of 28,466 square kilometres.\nSolomon Islands has developed a national ocean policy to manage all issues relating to the oceans. I am pleased to note that our tripartite joint submission for an extended continental shelf, the Ontong Java Plateau, prepared by Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and the Federated States of Micronesia, was successful, and we thank the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf for its consideration of our joint submission.\nA future instrument on biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction is currently being negotiated. We anticipate a fair, equitable and inclusive outcome that addresses our specific needs to support us in the implementation of our obligations and rights under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We hope to incorporate traditional-knowledge systems that complement science in the new instrument. My Government is committed to working with others towards concluding the negotiations on biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction by 2020.\nThe United Nations was born out of the ashes of the Second World War. The Charter of the United Nations compels us to uphold peaceful coexistence among, within and between nations through the use of intensive, sustained and inclusive dialogue to resolve our differences and conflicts. Peace is not just the absence of war. It means the absence of hunger, too, and access to the basic necessities of life, so that we can all live our lives to the full. Access to finance, particularly for the most marginalized and vulnerable, is one of the basic necessities of modern-day life. These basic rights remain a challenge in my country, with a narrow economic base and an increasingly large youth bulge that creates 18,000 new job seekers every year, competing for employment in a market that can provide only 3,000 new jobs each year. Job security is key to long-term peace and security in a post-conflict country such as Solomon Islands\nWhile facing its own challenges, Solomon Islands is proud to have contributed 12 police officers to the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, in the Sudan, and we stand ready to deploy more officers for peacekeeping duties in other United Nations missions. As a beneficiary of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands over the past 14 years, we know what it means to reciprocate the type of assistance from which our people have benefited. I must also note my country\u2019s deep gratitude to the Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding Fund for their continued support to our people. Three of our provincial Governments have received programme, policy and budget support from the Commission.\nWith regard to Security Council reform, we would like to see the Council become more representative, relevant and effective, in keeping with today\u2019s realities. In this regard, we call for a non-permanent seat on the Council expressly for small island developing States.\nSolomon Islands reaffirms its ongoing commitment to maintaining a nuclear-free Pacific through the Treaty of Rarotonga. We reiterate our call for the total elimination of nuclear weapons by all nuclear-weapon States, including those continuing to possess all forms of weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, we would also like to see a world free of weapons of mass destruction. Solomon Islands will spare no effort in seeking the full implementation of all the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nThe World Summit for Social Development identified poverty eradication as amoral, ethical, social, political and economic imperative for humankind. We support the call for Governments to address the root causes of poverty, provide for the basic needs of all and ensure that the poor have access to productive resources, including credit, education and training.\nResponding to the need for support for financing for rural development, in 2018 my Government passed an act re-establishing the Development Bank of Solomon Islands, which will facilitate the economic and social development of Solomon Islands within our national development strategy. The emphasis will be on Solomon Islanders\u2019 participation in economic development, as well as the stimulation of industrial activities.\nBeginning in August, my Government doubled the basic minimum wage in the country in order to increase the ability of workers to cope with the high cost of food, electricity, rent, transport and school fees. We will also review our personal tax-exemption threshold for workers.\nAttention is being paid to how the most vulnerable can benefit from rapid technological developments and interconnectivity. Our undersea cable, which will link Honiara to Sydney, is a critical transformative infrastructure that will bring the Government closer to its people. The submarine cable will be commissioned and go live in December, and I thank the Government of Australia, the main financing partner of this transformative project.\nThe Solomon Islands Government has embarked on an ambitious and transformative infrastructure development agenda for a national transport core, which aims to connect all 50 constituencies in our 10 provinces and the totality of our population within 15 years. The first phase of this transformative infrastructure programme, which involves building roads, bridges, ports and airports, as well as procuring well-designed ferries, aims to connect 37 constituencies and 75 per cent of our population in the first 10 years. The Government is also exploring other innovative modes of revenue and partnerships as we look to transform our country\u2019s development.\nSolomon Islands is scheduled to graduate from the least-developed-country category in December 2024, after meeting two of the three criteria for graduation. While accepting that we need to graduate, I must emphasize that we did not pass the vulnerability criterion, which should have been the most important of the three. As the several superstorms that have recently hit small islands States attest, the gains made by a State can be reversed in a matter of hours. We look forward to further discussing those matters during the visit of United Nations agencies in mid-October to assist us in developing a practical and smooth transition strategy.\nSolomon Islands subscribes to the Istanbul Programme of Action, the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I am happy to state that the goals, targets and indicators in those three global mechanisms have been mainstreamed into our 2016-2035 national development strategy. Incorporating all three global frameworks into our development strategy will ensure that we will not only achieve the targets set forth in it, it will also fulfil the national vision underpinning the strategy, entitled \u201cImproving the Social and Economic Livelihoods of all Solomon Islanders\u201d. Solomon Islands will present its voluntary national review of the SDGs in July 2020.\nSolomon Islands has the fastest population growth rate in the Pacific, with 50 children \u2014 two full classrooms \u2014 being born every day. By 2050, it is projected that almost 80 children will be born in our country every day, the equivalent of three new classrooms every day, or a new combined primary and high school every week. We are reforming our education system to accommodate this added pressure, with an increased focus on technical, vocational and life-skills education.\nWe are also creating an inventory of all youth in the country, with a view to having a pool of young people ready for employment opportunities inside and outside their country, as well as for further training opportunities. I acknowledge with appreciation the tremendous support provided by Australia and New Zealand for employment opportunities for young Solomon Islanders in their respective countries.\nWhile accepting that climate change is the most important challenge facing all countries, and especially Pacific Island countries, I must also express my Government\u2019s concern that the single largest killer of our people today in virtually all our countries is non-communicable diseases (NCDs). I am also concerned about the fact that not nearly as much attention is accorded to halting or reversing the NCD epidemic. In Solomon Islands, seven of every 10 deaths are due to NCDs. In some other Pacific countries, it is as high as eight of 10 deaths. Malaria adds to the challenge.\nI am happy to inform the Assembly that my Government has developed and is implementing a road map to eliminate malaria by 2030. We are also developing a road map to halt and reverse the NCD epidemic in Solomon Islands. For some forms of NCDs we are also exploring alternative modalities of treatment, particularly plant-based pharmaceuticals that are affordable and can be produced domestically. Solomon Islands is working with Cuba to explore further opportunities in this area. However, my key message to the Assembly is that hundreds of thousands of people are dying every day due to NCDs and diseases such as malaria. We must therefore step up the fight with urgency and reverse the NCD epidemic.\nWith regard to human rights, Solomon Islands is preparing its third Universal Periodic Review and will ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities during the current session.\nWith respect to the issue of West Papua, Solomon Islands aligns itself with the position of the Pacific Islands Forum. We reaffirm Indonesia\u2019s sovereignty over Papua. However, we remain concerned about the escalation of violence and the continued allegations of human rights abuses reported in West Papua. We welcome Indonesia\u2019s invitation to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit and conduct an independent assessment of human rights in West Papua. We encourage both parties to agree quickly on a date for such a visit to ensure that the outcome is reached as soon as possible.\nSolomon Islands thanks Cuba for the training it has offered our medical students, with more than 80 medical doctors from Solomon Islands having graduated from Cuban medical schools. We note that the 59-year economic embargo imposed on Cuba remains in place. Solomon Islands calls for the lifting of this embargo. We encourage the restoration of good relations between Cuba and the United States in the name of peace and in line with the spirit, purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\nMy country has made a commitment to hosting the 2023 Pacific Games, which will bring together all 24 countries and territories of the Pacific. I am pleased to note the support we are receiving from traditional and non-traditional development partners in preparing our country for the Games, and I especially want to acknowledge our immediate neighbours, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. We are also reaching out to other partners who we hope will respond positively to our 2023 Games proposals.\nI also want to announce to the Assembly that Solomon Islands has begun reviewing its foreign policy. In so doing, we have recognized the One China policy, in accordance with resolution 2758 (XXVI), and have formalized our relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China. We are broadening our engagements with all countries in keeping with our policy of \u201cfriends to all, enemies to none\u201d.\nIn conclusion, returning to the theme of the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, Solomon Islands sees value in it and believes that we can achieve many things through strategic partnerships and meaningful multilateral and bilateral engagements among and between countries. I commend the Secretary-General for this theme. It has provided a basis for self-reflection for many countries.\nIn the Pacific context, our ocean is our single largest shared resource and one where meaningful multilateral and bilateral efforts can unlock untold development opportunities. Protecting our oceans is protecting our future.\nThe United Nations negotiations on climate change must be concluded without delay. We must go from rhetoric to real progress to ensure that our children and future generations are able to live their lives to the full.\nThe NCD crisis must be halted and reversed. The NCD epidemic could undermine the future of some countries. In my view, this challenge is more urgent right now than climate change.\nAs the great French writer Victor Hugo said, \u201cNothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come.\u201d I submit that the twin fights against climate change and NCDs are ideas whose time has come. Let us do that now and be on the right side of history.\n"

        "file_text": "The seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly, as has been noted by most speakers from this rostrum, is being held amid an international context that is alarming in terms of peace, security and the protection of human rights. A number of developments are unfolding around the world before our very eyes: ill-founded ideologies that oppose humanism are emerging; intolerance is rising and people are increasingly espousing nationalist sentiments; sectarianism is intensifying and hate speech is becoming normalized; fanaticism and proselytism of all kinds are sweeping across the globe; national irredentism is resurging, and the arms race \u2014 a dismal part of our collective memory \u2014 is starting up again.\nThose situations sometimes carry the real risk of armed confrontation between States. They give rise to legitimate fears and contribute to our naturally understandable uncertainties about the future of the world. We the peoples of the United Nations, represented here, can no longer continue to hide those fears and uncertainties. We the peoples of the United Nations, meeting here and deliberating honourably in this prestigious body, cannot countenance the seemingly methodical dismantling of the multilateralism upon which our fathers and grandfathers patiently built the post-war world \u2014 the same multilateralism upon which our hope now rests that one day humankind will become less selfish and more brotherly.\nMoving with the tides of history enables us to see clearly. And, for us, moving with the tides of history means having a willingness to respect the diversity of our world, achieve mutual understanding among nations, build peace and friendship between peoples, achieve mutual tolerance with regard to cultures and practices, achieve brotherly solidarity and world peace, and, above all, steer clear of narrow interests and extremism as well as contempt for and hatred and rejection of others. What I said during the previous session (see A/73/PV.15) bears repeating: we all belong, without exception, to one unique human race. This divine human race, which was placed on Earth by Providence, is the only group to which we will ever belong, together in a community of destiny.\nFour years ago in the General Assembly, the international community adopted an ambitious development agenda (resolution 70/1) to be implemented by 2030 \u2014 the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \u2014 along with 17 Sustainable Development Goals. In my country, as part of our efforts to combat poverty, the Government implemented, following broad popular consultations, its national development plan 2018-2022. The plan places particular emphasis on universal access to health care, which is all the more important given the fact that two serious health dangers are now threatening to decimate entire populations on our continent and in our subregion.\nThe first is humanitarian assistance emorrhagic fever caused by the Ebola virus, which has struck the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has been declared a public-health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization. Given the severity of the daily devastation that this outbreak is causing, the international community should mobilize its efforts like never before. It should proactively mobilize to provide significant support to the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo in their courageous combat against this merciless outbreak. It should mobilize to provide the real financial and human resources that are critical to a robust and effective response.\nThe second threat to health to which our populations are exposed today concerns the unrestrained \u2014 amid widespread indifference \u2014 spread of counterfeit medicines. Mafia- and criminal-run dispensaries are responsible for orchestrating this phenomenon and selling counterfeit medicines to the poorest of the poor. Greedy, lawless networks are dumping their product onto the wretched of the Earth. These counterfeit medicines and the dispensaries that produce them must be clearly declared public enemies by all without exception here at the United Nations, as this phenomenon is tantamount to a vile mass-poisoning agenda. For its part, my Government fully supports the African-led initiative, spearheaded by the Brazzaville Foundation, to convene in Lome, in partnership with the Government of the Togolese Republic, a summit of Heads of State devoted to that problem, which is affecting the foundations of life itself throughout the continent.\nThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which most of the speakers have mentioned, is in reality a lifeline for all of humankind. Notwithstanding the scepticism of some among us, we can never overstate the importance of all the vital forces of our era and all actors of goodwill in the world standing shoulder to shoulder in the combat that is under way against the threat of climate change. The truth is that we have little choice but to unite our efforts to try to stem the degradation of our natural environment and ward off the negative effects that it could have on the future of life on Earth and the survival of our own species. It is regrettable that this issue, of which every aspect is vital and which is affecting the future of humankind itself, is still the subject of perplexing differences of opinion, while the specific commitments made by Governments to the peoples of the world are not being met and continue to be plagued by a lack of funding.\nI take this opportunity to recall the need, for the benefit of us all, to operationalize the Congo Basin Blue Fund, an initiative of President Denis Sassou Nguesso and his peers in Central Africa that aims to protect the world\u2019s second-largest \u201cgreen lung\u201d, and which today constitutes a major complement to global policies on ecosystem conservation. Without an environment of peace, security and stability, it is futile to hope that we will achieve the Sustainable Development Goals that we have set here and which I just mentioned. Without those conditions and without peace, it is futile to hope to achieve the development of States, the prosperity of nations and the happiness of peoples.\nThat is why my country, which chairs the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and which has always shouldered its share of responsibility for peacebuilding in this geographical area, welcomes the positive developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the successful holding of elections, the establishment of a new Parliament and the formation of a new Government. All of that is unfolding in a context of peace, reinforced by a strong will for national reconciliation. In the Central African Republic, where peace is also on the agenda, we welcome the tireless efforts of President Faustin Archange Touadera to restore security in all the provinces of that country. The difficult negotiations held in Khartoum between the Government and 14 armed groups, under the auspices of the African Union and the United Nations, as well as the signing in Bangui of the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic, clearly reflect the determination of political actors to build peace and move towards genuine reconciliation.\nThe international community must without hesitation assist the Central African Republic in completing the difficult process of disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and repatriation currently under way. The international community must support that country in rebuilding its army, which is not just the backbone of the State, but also a factor of national unity and social cohesion.\nConcerning Libya, my country chairs the corresponding African Union High-level Committee, on the quest for peace in that country. We cannot but deplore the fact that fighting has resumed in Tripoli and that the situation is at an impasse, which shows that the efforts undertaken to date have not sufficed to bring about a lasting settlement of the crisis. We must therefore continue to take action without ever becoming discouraged. We must act in a collective, cohesive and coordinated way, with perseverance and our sole aim being to put an end to the fighting, to resume dialogue and initiate national reconciliation. Clearly, only a comprehensive ceasefire and a definitive cessation of hostilities can set the stage for inclusive dialogue ahead of general elections, with a view to the restoration of constitutional order.\nThat has been the sole agenda of the African Union High-Level Committee from the very outset. We consider it to be an agenda of common sense and reason. It is specifically this type of agenda, this frank and sincere approach, that made it possible to end the crisis in neighbouring Sudan. That was a positive outcome, which we welcome here, and one that in a way was the result of the ancient African tradition of palaver \u2014 a process that, as everyone knows, is based on reflection and wisdom. Thirty years ago, with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of communism, many of us dreamt of a world that would finally see an end to injustice related to the antagonisms and complex history of the post-war period. Just like Francis Fukuyama, an eminent thinker, we, too, had hoped that the end of the Cold War would equally mean an end to the absurd hatred among nations, especially those bold nations that together made the sacrifice of countless lives to defeat the Nazi scourge.\nThirty years after the end of Cold War, it is evident that the yoke of the embargo continues to weigh heavily on Cuba and its people, that generous people who are often considered to be a positive model for cultural mixing between the peoples of Africa, Europe and America. Just like the country currently hosting us, Cuba also is a harbinger of the sociological makeup and image of the world to come. On behalf of the Republic of the Congo, I urge those responsible to do away with this anachronism, demonstrate political courage and simply and definitively lift the embargo, in a spirit of reconciliation. This should be done in the name of peace and friendship among peoples and of the Charter of the United Nations.\nIt cannot be overstated that today more than ever the United Nations needs to be rejuvenated. Indeed, the structural changes and sociological transformations that have arisen in the world since the advent of the third millennium, the emergence of new forces on the international stage, the emancipation of mindsets and the shift in mentalities today require an intelligent, deft restructuring of our Organization so as to make of the United Nations a truly meaningful mechanism for the benefit of humankind in all of its diversity, a mechanism that is better tailored to reflect the requirements of our time. For that reason, the thorny question of reforming the United Nations and its Security Council remains vital to our future. We cannot indefinitely continue to ignore or sidestep this issue without ultimately betraying the magnanimous spirit of our Organization\u2019s founding fathers. It is a question of justice and equity, and it is our responsibility to history."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to the President and assure him of my Government\u2019s unwavering support during his tenure.\nI consider the chosen theme for this year\u2019s General Assembly to be particularly pertinent, given that the combination of poverty, lack of adequate educational opportunities, social and economic exclusion and climate change constitute the most serious problems facing billions of human beings around the world \u2014 human beings who are placing their hopes in the international community to undertake efficient and effective measures, human beings who do not wish to be recipients of mere verbal support or wishful thinking that will expire at the end of the session. We should not only address the root causes of these challenges, but also reflect on why we have yet to tackle them.\nIndeed, one cannot deny that failing to effectively tackle these challenges has, in turn, further aggravated such growing phenomena as religious fundamentalism, violent extremism, sectarianism, destruction of cultural heritage, civil war and ethnic conflict. What is most alarming, however, is that the combination of those factors has led to the forcible displacement of millions of people and unprecedented waves of refugee and migratory flows.\nLeaving aside the strengths and weaknesses, successes and failures of the United Nations, we should not overlook that it is the only international forum where nations can collectively interact, deliberate and pursue common goals, work together to resolve not only their differences but also pressing regional and international challenges that are not country-specific, and call the international order into question. That is why it is our strong conviction that, in order to finally eliminate the threats we are facing in an increasingly interdependent world, there is only one answer: multilateralism, decisive collective action, international cooperation, greater solidarity and stronger partnerships.\nFor some, alternatives to multilateralism may seem attractive. Certain States might want to serve their short-sighted interests at the expense of universal principles. However, history has repeatedly taught us the catastrophic consequences of not adhering to the principles, rules and synergies we have commonly developed within the framework of the United Nations. It is for this very reason that we lend our unwavering support to the reform priorities of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres, which aim to reinforce the effectiveness of the Organization and further advance multilateralism, peacekeeping and peacebuilding, humanitarian assistance and long-term development and growth. Setting aside diverging aspirations and conflicting interests, we should rise to meet our shared responsibility and collectively strengthen our support and commitment to the United Nations.\nI have talked about the challenges we are facing and the humanitarian crises of refugees and migration flows. At the same time, we must also realize that we are at a defining moment with regard to climate change. I was particularly touched by the massive presence of young people at the Climate Action Summit and by their sincere calls of worry and concern about the effects of climate change. I was deeply affected in particular by the words of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, who stated that the eyes of all future generations are upon us. Indeed, we collectively carry the obligation to provide to the generations to come a better future, a greener planet.\nImagine how climate change will affect our world if we do not decisively act today. Record-high temperatures and protracted heat waves, devastating fires and deforestation, melting ice and sea-level rise, droughts, floods and extreme weather phenomena attest to the dire situation we are facing. Taking into account the particularly alarming projections concerning the impact of climate change on our immediate region, namely, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East, Cyprus has recently undertaken an initiative to coordinate regional climate-change actions. More specifically, this initiative intends to bring together our regions\u2019 leading scientists and policymakers, with a view to developing practical and achievable solutions that will have durable benefits for our citizens.\nCyprus is also at the forefront of other initiatives aimed at establishing conditions of peace and stability in our region, through, inter alia, establishing synergies and enhancing our relations with neighbouring countries. Such advanced cooperation is based on the doctrine of multilateralism and positive agendas without any exclusions. It constitutes a promising step towards institutionalizing partnerships in the Eastern Mediterranean.\nOver the past 45 years, we have undertaken the same positive initiatives in order to end the unacceptable status quo in my homeland and achieve lasting peace and stability there. The status quo is the result of the illegal Turkish invasion in 1974, the violation of the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus, the consequent military occupation of more than a third of the country and the forcible displacement of 40 per cent of its population. Since 1974, despite the sincere efforts and the constructive engagement of both my predecessors and me in seeking a just and fair settlement, Cyprus has unfortunately remained the last divided country in Europe.\nWe are currently in the midst of a new effort that is providing a glimmer of hope. I wish to stress in the strongest manner my full dedication and support to the new effort by the Secretary-General to resume the process from the point where it stopped at Crans-Montana. In that context, and following a call from the Secretary-General for an agreed basis for the resumption of negotiations, there is an understanding by the leaders of the two communities that the relevant terms of reference should be comprised of the following elements: first, the Joint Declaration on Cyprus of 11 February 2014, which sets out the basic guidelines and principles for the framework of the sought-after solution, as well as the methodology of the negotiating process; secondly, the convergences achieved that had led to the holding of the Conference on Cyprus at Crans-Montana; and, thirdly, the six-point framework of the Secretary-General on security and guarantees, troops, effective participation, territorial adjustments, property and equitable treatment, as presented on 30 June 2017 at Crans-Montana.\nSuch an understanding could pave the way for the resumption of talks with the sole aim of reaching a comprehensive settlement on the basis of what has been agreed as a historic compromise by our side, namely, the evolution of the Republic of Cyprus into a bizonal, bicommunal federation with political equality, as set out in the relevant Security Council resolutions and high-level agreements, with a single sovereignty, a single international legal personality and a single citizenship. It would be a settlement that will establish a viable, functional and lasting State, free from foreign dependencies, foreign troops and the rights of intervention by third countries. The settlement should not deviate from the relevant Security Council resolutions and European Union values and principles.\nI want to send a clear message: the United Nations and the Secretary-General\u2019s good-offices mission is the only way forward for us.\nRegrettably, while the efforts at resuming the negotiating process are under way, recent actions by Turkey not only violate international law but severely undermine the aim of having an environment conducive to meaningful negotiations. While I do not intend to embark on a blame game, I cannot \u2014 nor will the dignity of my people allow me to \u2014 accept gun-boat diplomacy, blackmail tactics and attempts to force our side to negotiate under duress. Is it possible for the efforts of the Secretary-General to succeed while Turkey continues to violate the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus in its internationally recognized exclusive economic zone and continental shelf? Is it possible when Turkey threatens Cyprus with severe consequences if we move forward again with our energy programme? Is it possible when Turkey threatens neighbouring States and energy companies with which we cooperate and have established conventional obligations? Is it possible for the efforts of the Secretary-General to succeed when recent public statements and acts by Turkish officials signal plans to build settlements in the fenced area of Varosha, the uninhabited part of Famagusta that is under illegal Turkish military occupation?\nWith regard to Varosha, I wish to stress that its distinct status has been recognized in all reports of the Secretary-General and by the United Nations operations in Cyprus. More specifically, the framework for the resettlement of Varosha by its lawful inhabitants, under the auspices of the United Nations, was set as a priority by both the 1979 high-level agreement between the leaders of the two communities and Security Council resolutions 550 (1984) and 789 (1992). In that regard, we deeply appreciate the recent reaffirmation by the Secretary-General that the position of the United Nations on the matter remains unchanged and is still guided by the Security Council resolutions.\nAs we speak, we are also confronted by an increasingly aggressive positioning of the Turkish military and an escalation of violations in the buffer zone. All those developments make the role of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and the fulfilment of its mandate more necessary than ever. And as if it were not enough that we have been confronted by the challenges I mentioned, two days ago, in this Hall, the Turkish President, Mr. Erdogan, embarked on an address in which he made misleading allegations. He referred, inter alia, to an uncompromising position of the Greek Cypriot side, saying that \u201cthose who claim to be working towards solving the Cyprus problem with zero security and zero guarantee have had ill-intentions from the outset\u201d (A/74/PV3, p. 21).\nI wonder, and would ask, if it is uncompromising and ill-intentioned to aspire to establishing an independent and sovereign State, free from the presence of occupying troops. Is it uncompromising and ill-intentioned to envision terminating the anachronistic Treaty of Guarantee and establish a robust system of security, fully based on the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant European Union treaties? Which of the other 193 States Members of the United Nations is subject to a system of guarantees with a third country? Is it uncompromising and ill-intentioned to aspire to establish a normal State in which all decisions will be made only by Cypriots, free from foreign dependency?\nPresident Erdogan further alleged that the Greek Cypriot side \u201crefuses to share political power and prosperity with the Turkish Cypriots.\u201d (ibid) Are we refusing to share political power and prosperity with the Turkish Cypriots when we have accepted political equality as defined by the Secretary-General and as upheld by the relevant Security Council resolutions, and when the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, within the context of the negotiating process, have reached an agreement on the issue of natural resources, in line with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea? We have also conveyed our readiness, still within the framework of meaningful negotiations, to deposit revenues accrued from the exploitation of hydrocarbons to an escrow account for the Turkish Cypriot community, through which we are protecting the Turkish Cypriot community\u2019s rightful share, in accordance with the population ratio of the future constituent States.\nPresident Erdogan also claimed that Turkey has a reasonable approach to the issue of energy resources and that he and his country will ultimately protect the legitimate rights of the Turkish Cypriots until the very end. Is it a reasonable approach to unilaterally and unlawfully conduct hydrocarbon-exploration drilling in another country\u2019s exclusive economic zone through the threat of use of force? And I wonder whose interests Turkey is protecting when its claims to limit the exclusive economic zone of Cyprus by 44 per cent for its own benefit and at the expense of the rights and interests of both Greek and Turkish Cypriots.\nAs I stated earlier, it was not, and is not, my intention to embark on a confrontation. To the contrary, I fully ascribe to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s emotional concluding remarks, as they encapsulate the essence of what we are trying to achieve in Cyprus \u2014 \u201cfreedom for all, peace for all, prosperity for all, justice for all and a peaceful and safe future for all.\u201d (ibid. p. 26) This is my further vision \u2014 and it is also the vision of the people of Cyprus: to end the unacceptable status quo with the establishment of a State that will ensure a shared prosperous future for coming generations of Greek and Turkish Cypriots, enabling them to live freely together and collaborate in conditions of stability, safety and peaceful coexistence. Only then will we be able to utilize the unfulfilled potential and capacities of our country. I will not deviate from pursuing this vision, and I call for Members\u2019 solidarity in supporting efforts to reach a solution to the Cyprus problem. It is not only in the interests of the people of Cyprus, but also for the benefit and in the interests of Turkey, the region and the international community.\nI may have devoted a large part of my address to the Cyprus problem. I did not, however, neglect or overlook the vast importance of global challenges, particularly poverty, climate change and sustainable development. The solution to tackling those challenges rests entirely on the decisiveness of the States Members of the United Nations in finally putting aside short-term interests and expediencies and reaching a joint understanding of the need to fully adhere to the Charter, resolutions and decisions of our common family. Only then will we fulfil our collective aims and targets and bestow a better future upon our children, grandchildren and the generations to come.\n"

        "file_text": "I am doubly honoured to address the General Assembly today: on account of being in this loftiest of venues, and because I am speaking on behalf of the new Government of Mexico, elected to power less than one year ago. That Government is led by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whose purpose is to lead the fourth transformation of Mexico.\nIn its history, Mexico has undergone three major transformations: the first was the independence of the country; the second was a liberal reform headed by Benito Juarez and the restoration of the Republic; and the third was the Mexican Revolution. Today we are undergoing our fourth transformation, which means not only a change of Government but a change of regime in Mexico.\nWhat does this fourth transformation propose? When President Lopez Obrador asked himself how to summarize it, he said that it means, first of all, bringing an end to corruption in Mexico, separating economic power from a political power, establishing respect for our legal norms and austerity, and forging a relationship with society that is different from what has been seen over recent years.\nSecondly, we wish to significantly decrease inequality in our country because, as Members are aware, we still have more than 52 million people living in poverty despite being one of the largest economies in the world, with an expansive and successful export base. Reducing inequality is therefore our second great objective.\nThe third is accelerating economic growth on the basis of self-confidence, productivity, innovation, organizational capacity and global presence. This is what Mexico is doing today.\nThe fourth objective, building on the other three, is to make Mexico a safe society where Mexican families can enjoy peace and security.\nIn brief, Mexico has reclaimed its self-confidence. Today I would like to inform the Assembly that strengthening, broadening and deepening our involvement with effective multilateralism is among our top priorities. We are well aware that these are difficult times, with many challenges and risks to global coexistence and international security and peace. The moment is therefore right for this renewed Mexico, once again sure of itself, to participate broadly, deeply and intensively in strengthening the multilateral order and its objectives.\nMexico therefore recently presented itself as a candidate for a term on the Security Council starting in 2021. Moreover, in many of the most important areas of endeavour among Mexico\u2019s priorities, we have sought the support of the United Nations in recent months and we will continue to do so by pursuing and participating in the struggles that all of us represented here seek to overcome.\nI must say, first and foremost, that our foreign policy and participation in the United Nations will be guided by the principles of Mexican foreign policy: non-intervention, the self-determination peoples and the peaceful resolution of disputes. This is why, in the context of Latin America and the Caribbean, I express Mexico\u2019s opposition to such measures as the embargo against Cuba and the imposition of sanctions against countries, and we advocate dialogue and communication whereby peoples and nations can resolve their differences. Peace can be achieved through political means, not through the use of force.\nWe are committed to upholding and promoting the values of freedom and human rights. Mexico will contribute, and with great determination, in response to the appeal by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that we step up climate action and redouble our efforts. We have already put forth additional actions, in the belief that this is a matter of life or death for humankind, so there is no room for delay or excuses when it comes to making these commitments.\nMexico will also engage vigorously in seeking and promoting solutions to the issues of migration and inequality that we are confronting in various regions around the world. Suffice it to say that the number of migrants so far this year in Central America and Mexico has broken recent records. We are talking more than 1.3 million people on the move, placing us among the regions with highest number of migrants in the world.\nMexico requested the support of the United Nations \u2014 and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General for his support \u2014 through the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, which is the body at the disposal of the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean, to develop a comprehensive development plan for southern Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, which was presented yesterday with the participation and support of 18 United Nations entities and, so far, 35 countries. I mentioned the concept of effective multilateralism because we fully subscribe to multilateralism and believe it is the most efficient tool at our disposal to resolve the major problems facing the world today.\nWith regard to migration, we believe that coercive measures have no prospect of success. We believe that migration should be a choice, not forced by insecurity or, primarily, by poverty. We therefore have great expectations for the aforementioned comprehensive development plan. For the time being, Mexico has stepped up its cooperation in the plan\u2019s implementation by a factor of five this year, by which we wish to show that through committed and decisive participation by several countries we can create, in the region I just outlined, over 60,000 jobs in one year. These efforts will create real opportunities for people where they live, meaning they will not be forced to migrate.\nI would also like to express our gratitude to the United Nations and affirm that we will continue partnering with the United Nations to ensure transparency in important decision-making by the Mexican Government in the months and years ahead with a view to accelerating development. We invited the United Nations Office for Project Services and several agencies of the United Nations to partner with us in the great struggle to end corruption. Together we are making progress, and we will continue to do so.\nJust a few days ago, I said that the Government of Mexico considers itself a feminist Government. We will endeavour to prove as much through our commitments and actions over the years ahead. We believe that gender equality is at the very foundation of an equitable society. It is impossible to change society without a deep and far-reaching commitment to gender equality. That is why I say to the Assembly today that the Government of Mexico will support all efforts under the Beijing+25 and United Nations initiatives under way.\nI should also like to state that we are in favour of measures to ensure no one is persecuted for their sexual orientation. Our Government is and will continue to be active, determined and resolved in favour of protecting the freedoms and rights of all persons, including with respect to their sexual orientation. Persecution is divisive and exclusion destroys hope. We must therefore remain committed and uphold the human rights and freedoms of all.\nWe believe that it is necessary to step up efforts to effectively protect the cultural heritage of all peoples, hence Mexico\u2019s active participation under the UNESCO Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. Mexico has made it clear in many settings that the international community must not allow the looting of the historical and cultural heritage of peoples. We will therefore continue devoting concerted effort to that end. We will join forces with other peoples and nations represented here having expressed similar concerns.\nWe remain concerned at, and actively engaged in, the fight against terrorism and recall that, as recently as August, we jointly suffered the effects of the tragedy in El Paso, Texas, where Mexican men and women were among the victims. That tragic event was, according to the perpetrator, linked to, indeed inspired by, that in Christchurch, New Zealand. We must therefore be conscious that, as the Secretary-General has pointed out, there is a strong connection between white supremacy and ideologies involving the replacement of civilizations. We must therefore join together to tackle them. That means not only prevention, that we take all possible measures to ensure such incidents do not continue to occur, but also charge headlong into the battle of cultures and civilizations so as to prevent the further spread of such ideas, which threaten the very pillars of peaceful coexistence, both within our countries and at the global level. The individual who perpetrated that attack uploaded a document 20 minutes before carrying it out stating that the Latino community was his target, similar to what was done in Christchurch against the Muslim community. Mexico will therefore participate resolutely together with several countries present here and United Nations entities to tackle this threat to coexistence and the very existence of democracy, to which all States Members of the United Nations are committed.\nAs I was saying, we are working to make Mexico a safer and fairer society, and to strengthen multilateralism the world over. We take a critical view of the current state of affairs. We must strengthen multilateralism and contain the growing trend towards unilateralism. It is this critical perspective we wish to bring to bear as a member of the Security Council. That is why we are here with all our fellow Members and will make reform proposals over the months ahead.\nHowever, we are conscious that the United Nations and multilateralism must be strengthened, being as they are the arena for the pursuit of the world\u2019s worthiest causes.\nI should like to conclude by saying that Mexico has recovered its self-confidence. Mexico has strengths to share with its fellow Member States. Mexico supports such causes as those highlighted by the Secretary-General in his opening address to the General Assembly (see A/74/PV.3). And we have everything necessary to, in the next generation, make great progress through multilateralism anchored in the United Nations. I would like to conclude by reading some verses from the poet-king Nezahualcoyotl:\n\u201cWith what should I go?\nWill I leave nothing behind me on the earth?\nHow should my heart act?\nDid we come to live in vain, perhaps?\nTo sprout here on the earth?\nLet us leave at least flowers!\nLet us leave at least songs!\u201d"

        "file_text": "Never in the history of the world has humankind been more interconnected. Never in its history has humankind been better informed about events happening on the other side of the planet. And never have we been more acutely aware that we all face the same challenges \u2014 such challenges as climate change, migration, transnational crime and terrorism. They are global in nature and, therefore, by definition, require global responses. But instead of reproducing the heyday of international cooperation, as we should, multilateral diplomacy has entered a period of crisis.\nThere are many examples of that development. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change is no longer a global arrangement by all. Great Powers have withdrawn from longstanding disarmament treaties. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action hangs by a thread, which has led to a spiral of toughening positions. The United Nations and other multilateral organizations are often sidelined from solving conflicts, and, what is more, the Security Council often fails to achieve consensus on how to bring peace to the world\u2019s worst crisis areas. I am deeply concerned by these developments.\nLike many other small and medium-sized countries, Austria depends on negotiated solutions for addressing global problems. If the choice is between the rule of law and the law of the jungle, for Austria the answer is very clear: there needs to be a rules-based international order, where good governance, open markets and the notion of pacta sunt servanda prevail.\nEveryone in this Hall is aware that multilateralism is hard work, often frustrating and has no easy wins or quick fixes, and that the need to compromise can be hard to sell to a domestic audience. But there is simply no alternative to international cooperation. Neither unilateralism nor multilateralism a la carte will solve any of the complex challenges we face.\nThe European Union is built on cooperation and compromise, and I believe that we Europeans are therefore highly credible in reaffirming our commitment to rules-based multilateralism. Against this backdrop, I should like to address several global challenges that, in my view, urgently demand multilateral solutions.\nThe first is climate change. The year 2018 has been the hottest on record in Austria. Our glaciers are melting away. Our Alpine regions are severely suffering. Climate change is truly a global challenge, which requires urgent global action.\nAs a member of the High Ambition Coalition, we are fully committed to the Paris Climate Agreement and we support the Secretary-General\u2019s call for the swift implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 13 at this week\u2019s Climate Action Summit. In the coming years, Europe will work hard towards becoming the world\u2019s first climate-neutral continent, which means net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. The Green New Deal in Europe, which the incoming European Commission has put forward, is very ambitious, and it sends a very strong signal to the world. However, such ambition should not be limited to Europe. At the High-level Political Forum, all States Members of the United Nations reaffirmed their commitment to the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. Austria will present its first voluntary national review at next year\u2019s High-level Political Forum. Our focus will be on climate, women and youth.\nFor almost a decade, armed conflict has been raging in Syria and Iraq, with hundreds of thousands of victims and displaced persons. The so-called Islamic State has been defeated on the ground, but we owe it to the victims of its crimes to ensure that justice is delivered. Austria therefore continues to strongly support the referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. In addition, we believe that a special criminal tribunal should be established in the region to ensure accountability for the most serious crimes. This approach should go hand in hand with capacity- building for national justice to ensure due process.\nToday, most conflicts are fought in cities and densely populated areas. In this urban warfare, international humanitarian law is often violated, with devastating consequences. When explosive weapons are used in populated areas, 91 per cent of the casualties, on average, are civilians. This is simply unacceptable. Clearly, we need to strengthen the protection of civilians. In order to emphasize the importance and urgency of this issue, Austria is bringing together in Vienna a broad alliance of partners next week, on 1 and 2 October 2019, for the first worldwide international conference on this topic. I cordially invite all Member States to attend.\nThe protection and promotion of human rights is and remains a clear priority for Austria, and we are honoured to be serving on the Human Rights Council for the next three years. International humanitarian law and the universality of human rights are probably the greatest achievements of the modern global community. We must clearly stand up against any attempts to undermine them. Human rights are simply not negotiable. The international community has a duty to demand accountability when human rights are violated. We therefore welcome the independent investigations in Syria, Yemen and Myanmar.\nAs geopolitical tensions have grown, so has the risk of military confrontation. After the disappointing end of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, we must avoid the deployment of medium-range missiles in Europe. We urge the United States and Russia to refrain from taking any steps in this direction and call for an extension of the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.\nAs long as nuclear weapons exist, the risk of their use \u2014 on purpose or by accident \u2014 remains real. These weapons are inhumane and a danger to our security. The current narrative that nuclear weapons are somehow necessary for security is not only wrong: it is outright dangerous. The case for the total elimination of nuclear weapons is very clear. This is a moral imperative, but, more than that, what is at stake is the survival of humankind. We are therefore encouraged that the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which Austria helped initiate, is now well on its way to entering into force. I call on all States to sign and ratify the Treaty and contribute to a world free of nuclear weapons. We also support initiatives to ban weapons that are fully autonomous. We cannot allow machines to decide issues of human life and death.\nAt the outset, I shared with the Assembly my concern about the state of multilateralism. But at the same time, here in this Hall, I also feel hope. Why is that so? I feel this way because, once again, the United Nations high-level week has brought us all together: those that stress sovereignty and those who call for multilateralism, those who underline national priorities and those who seek international solutions, the patriots and the globalists \u2014 all together, here, at the United Nations, to talk, discuss and listen to each other. To me, this is multilateralism.\nNext year, the United Nations will turn 75. That is a very respectable age and a reason to celebrate one of the greatest institutions ever created. However, we all know that the United Nations needs to be modernized. Austria therefore strongly supports the Secretary-General\u2019s reform agenda.\nThe global challenges we are all facing together require a strong United Nations. It is in all our interests. In May this year, in Vienna, we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the Vienna International Centre, a hub for addressing security issues, including nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, energy, sustainable development, the peaceful use of outer space and the fight against corruption, drugs and crime. I can assure members of the General Assembly that Austria is and will remain a proud and committed United Nations host country.\nAll of us here in this Hall share the same responsibility for the effectiveness of the United Nations and the international order that we have built together over the past decades. As the Secretary-General put it, in a time of multiple complex challenges, multilateralism is the world\u2019s best hope. Austria stands ready to assume its responsibilities as a member of the Human Rights Council, as host of the United Nations in Vienna, as a committed troop contributor to peacekeeping and as a candidate for membership of the Security Council in 2027-2028.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour and privilege to be here today to convey the warm greetings of His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di Pertuan of Negara Brunei Darussalam to the General Assembly.\nI wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. My appreciation also goes to Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her valuable contribution and dedication to the Assembly over the past year. I am also deeply grateful to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his leadership and laudable initiatives that have given renewed impetus to our Organization, particularly in hosting the Climate Action Summit and the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) summit.\nIn 2015, our leaders gathered in this Hall to adopt the landmark 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This remarkable feat is testament to the success of multilateralism. Today, we continue to honour this agenda through this session\u2019s theme, which is focused on galvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion. The global consensus on this agenda is clear \u2014 our ability to fulfil the promise of the SDGs begins and ends with a commitment of the States Members of the United Nations to working together.\nOur search for a better future is often mired in increasingly complex and interconnected challenges. More and more countries are struggling to address such overlapping concerns as deforestation and access to clean air. This struggle reflects the indivisibility and multidimensional nature of the SDGs, which must be addressed collectively and to the fullest extent possible. The path that each country takes in achieving its goals will be unique, but we recognize that all paths mutually reinforce one another. For its part, Brunei Darussalam will present its voluntary national review for the first time at next year\u2019s High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, where we will be happy to share our best practices, lessons learned and challenges encountered.\nGlobally, even though overall progress has been made, trends indicate that the pace of improvement is too slow to ensure complete success by 2030. While we believe in the common pledge for no one to be left behind, we also recognize that no country can do it alone. We therefore welcome the call to accelerate collective actions, as contained in the political declaration adopted recently at the SDG summit (resolution 74/4). Success in achieving the SDGs will be a test of global cooperation, partnership and collaboration that requires action at the local, national and regional levels. To this end, we are working closely to advance a people-centred Association of Southeast Asian Nations community that complements the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda.\nTo localize the impact of the SDGs, Brunei Darussalam continues to undertake measures aimed at realizing the well-being, peace and harmony of its people. Our Government has ensured access to affordable housing and health care for all, as well as clean water and a clean environment. As a country with a young demographic, we also prioritize the education of our youth and recognize the importance of lifelong learning. Education will empower and better prepare our people, acting as a catalyst for achieving the SDGs and our own continued development. People need the tools to build a better life. In this regard, His Majesty\u2019s Government remains committed to providing free, high-quality education all the way to the tertiary level so that no Bruneian is left behind.\nIn our quest for progress, we have learned that there are costs associated with economic development. Perhaps the most common is damage to the environment. As citizens of the world, we are all stakeholders in ensuring a healthy planet. There is a shared global responsibility incumbent upon all of us to be principled in our undertakings, be it Governments, the private sector, individuals, corporate players or investors. We must ensure a universal commitment in order to overcome this existential threat and effectively work towards building a sustainable future.\nThe effects of climate change are being felt now and they will only get worse. We are at a critical juncture and stand at the precipice of making significant changes so as to reverse the climate crisis and secure the right of future generations to live in a sustainable world. There is a vested interest in ensuring our legacy as problem solvers and not problem makers. Technological advancements and innovations have made it possible for us to engineer modern solutions to modern challenges. We therefore believe that more needs to be done in sharing and transferring technology, so that we can all move from reactive responses to proactive solutions on climate change.\nThe digital revolution has redefined social interaction, intensified e-commerce and expanded information-sharing. However, we need to prevent the malicious use of these technologies. Although technology like the Internet can be positive, it has also given rise to an age of unprecedented misinformation and manipulation. The rampant misuse of the Internet and social media spreads hatred, incites violence and even glorifies acts of crime and terrorism. While we must adapt to technological advances, it is also urgent that we collectively address the emerging threats they can pose.\nDespite our best efforts, an increase in conflicts around the world has left many displaced, destitute and vulnerable. We see the perpetual struggle of the Palestinian people for Statehood and their inalienable right to self-determination being continually neglected. Prolonged occupation, forced displacement and illegal settlements have deprived them of every human right. This seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly has heard repeated calls for no one to be left behind. However, the Palestinian people have been left behind for as long as they have been fighting for their existence. As the premier multilateral forum, the United Nations has an unequalled role in ensuring the achievement of a just solution that establishes a sovereign State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nAs we move towards the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations next year, this milestone presents a good opportunity for us to reflect on all the work we have done and where we are going. The reality of our world today demands concerted and collective action. I believe the UnitedNations is now more relevant than ever. We must reconnect with the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, which enshrines the equality of nations and the multilateralism that respects the individuality and independence of all States. Collectively, we depend on the United Nations to uphold the sovereign right of all nations to choose a path and policies that resonate with their own customs and traditions. It is not a time to retreat, but rather to push forward and strengthen multilateralism, so we can fulfil the varied needs of the global community and permit everyone to enjoy peace, prosperity and development."

        "file_text": "I would like to join the others in congratulating Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I would also like to thank Her Excellency Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her dedication and stewardship in successfully completing the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session.\nMalaysia welcomes the theme of this year\u2019s General Assembly, which is \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d. The key message of that theme is \u201cgalvanizing multilateral efforts\u201d, which is what the United Nations stands for. I will propose a few.\nAlmost three-quarters of a century ago, five countries claimed victory in the Second World War. On the basis of that victory, they insisted on the right to practically rule the world, and so they gave themselves veto power over the rest of the world in the Organization they built \u2014 an Organization they claimed would end wars and solve conflicts. The veto power, as they must know, was against all the principles of human rights of which they themselves claim to be the champions. It killed the very purpose of the great Organization that they had created. It ensured that all solutions to all conflicts could be negated by any one of them. Broken up into ideological factions, they frustrated all attempts to solve problems.\nEach one of them can negate the wishes of the nearly 200 other members. It is totally and absolutely undemocratic. Yet, there are among them those that berate other countries of the world for not being democratic or democratic enough. How much longer should that group be allowed to exercise that power? How long? Forever? The unspoken time frame seems to be eternal. That very power has resulted in an arms race. Each one of the five rely on its military might in order to challenge any attempt to take its power away. They feel that they must be well armed to retain their right to be the privileged five.\nIt is that structure of the United Nations that renders it incapable of achieving its principle objectives of preventing wars between nations. Indeed, the structure has enabled the promotion of war within countries and between countries. True, the warlike European countries have not gone to war with each other over the past two-thirds of a century, but elsewhere there is evidence that European countries have caused wars to break out and arms and funds to be supplied, and have actively participated in prolonging those wars. It is apparently good for business and for weapons sales.\nThe first act engineered by the Western countries was the creation of the State of Israel by the seizure of Palestinian land and the expulsion of its 90 per cent Arab population. Since then wars have been fought in many countries, and many have been related to the creation of the State of Israel. And now we have terrorism where there was none before, or at least none at the present scale. Military actions against acts of terrorism will not succeed. We need to identify the cause and remove it, but the great Powers refuse to deal with the root cause. They prefer military action and sanctions, and they will continue to fail to stop terrorism.\nMalaysia accepts the State of Israel as a fait accompli, but it cannot the blatant seizure of Palestinian land by Israel for its settlements or its occupation of Jerusalem. The Palestinians cannot even enter the settlements that are built on their land. Because of the creation of Israel, there is now enmity towards Muslims and Islam. Muslims are accused of terrorism even if they do nothing.\nMuslim countries have been destabilized by the campaign for democracy and regime change. Muslims everywhere have been oppressed, expelled from their countries and refused asylum. Thousands have died at sea and in the severe winters of Europe. It is undeniable that in the past there was no such massive migration. Now the wars and instability caused by regime changes have forced people to run away from their countries.\nI will admit that democracy is a better form of Government than dictatorship, but democracy is not the easiest form of Government to operate. That is especially true when it is adopted overnight. Time should be allowed for a gradual transition to democracy. Indeed, the very countries that promote democracy became democratic over a period of decades, if not centuries. The result of an overnight switch to democracy is destabilization and civil war, reducing some countries to governmentless wilderness. Some have even reverted to authoritarian regimes that are worse than those that were displaced. Unable to withstand the suffering of war and violence, their people are forced to migrate.\nThe great democracies talk incessantly about the rule of law, but they are selective. Their friends may break any law and get away scot-free. Israel can break all international laws and norms of the world and will continue to be supported and defended. Unfriendly countries can do nothing right. There is no justice in this world.\nI must again refer to the fate of the Rohingya in Myanmar. Many colonies of the West expelled non-natives from their countries upon independence, but no country has ever been as brutal as Myanmar. Even the natives of the land were massacred, brutally killed and raped in full view of the world, against the backdrop of burning houses and villages of the victims. They were forced to migrate and now dare not return to Myanmar even when offered the chance. They cannot trust the Myanmar military unless some form of non-Myanmar protection is offered.\nThe helplessness of the world in stopping the atrocities inflicted on the Rohingya in Myanmar Regard has reduced regard for the resolutions of the United Nations. Now, despite United Nations resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir, the country has been invaded and occupied. There may be reasons for this action, but it is still wrong. The problem must be solved by peaceful means. India should work with Pakistan to that end. Ignoring the United Nations would lead to other forms of disregard for the Organization and the rule of law.\nAll countries of the world wish to prosper and grow their economies. In colonial days, the wealth of colonized lands was exploited to enrich their colonial masters. We cannot expect much from their former colonial masters, but they do expect to be allowed to develop their own country for themselves. However, they are hampered from doing so. There is much talk about free trade, but new regulations are constantly being introduced that are detrimental to the development of poor countries. This is because proposals, rules and regulations are made by the rich, often secretly, and the poor are practically forced to accept them.\nOne example is the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It was cooked up in Washington, D.C., with input from big business. In the agreement, the Governments of small countries could have been forced to greatly compensate big foreign companies with huge sums of money should their decisions affect the profitability of those companies, including future profits. Fortunately, now the powerful country that prepared the agreement has rejected it. With the exclusion of that country, the agreement has become more palatable, but it still lays down trade conditions that negate free trade. We are told that we must remove duties on imports or reduce them so that foreign products can knock out our infant industries. We are reduced to exporting only raw materials. How do we industrialize and create jobs for our people?\nA classic case of the denial of free trade is the ban on the import of palm oil, proposed by European countries. Unable to sustain the competitiveness of their own edible oils, they campaign to ban palm oil. It is said that palm oil is poisonous, destroys the habitats of long-nosed monkeys, reduces carbon dioxide absorption and so on. European products are labelled palm-oil free to show their dislike of and ban on palm oil. Malaysia produces palm oil; many poor countries produce palm oil. Malaysia will not clear more forests for palm oil plantation. We are just as concerned as the Europeans about our environment.\nAt the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, Malaysia pledged to maintain at least 50 per cent of its land mass under forest cover. We have made good on our pledge and even surpassed it. Our forest cover is currently at 55.3 per cent, exceeding our Rio pledge. Palm oil is still a big contributor to our economy. There is no evidence that it is poisonous. Millions have consumed palm oil and have not fallen ill. We appeal to the good sense of the rich not to impoverish us and prevent hundreds of thousands of our workers from earning a living. Consuming palm oil will constitute a good deed.\nIn keeping with the objectives of the United Nations, Malaysia has launched a campaign to criminalize war. It is ridiculous to hang a murderer for killing one person and yet glorify those who are responsible for the deaths of millions of people. Modern wars are total in every way. Not just combatants, but innocent people \u2014 children, the sick and the incapacitated \u2014 are killed and wounded. Whole countries are devastated and trillions of dollars are lost. In the end, both the victors and the losers suffer. We consider ourselves civilized, but we are still very primitive, given that we accept killing people as a way to settle disputes between or within nations. There are other ways of settling disputes. We can negotiate or submit to arbitration by third parties or we can resort to the courts of law, for example the International Court of Justice.\nMalaysia does not just talk; we take action. We settle disputes with our neighbours through negotiation and through the International Court of Justice. We have won some and we have lost some, but no one has been killed. All this talk about not giving up one inch of territory is ridiculous. We know that, if we go to war, that inch is going to cost us far more than it is worth. When we go to court, we do not always get what we claim to be rightfully ours, but it is the same with war \u2014 we do not always win. In a contest between two parties, one must lose if the other is to win, but if we use peaceful means even if we lose it will cost us much less. No one dies, nor is any land devastated.\nThe world is experiencing climate change. Malaysia is hotter than ever before. We do not seem to be returning to previous temperatures; in fact, it seems to be getting hotter and hotter. Elsewhere, powerful typhoons and hurricanes are destroying whole towns, killing thousands and wreaking havoc of unprecedented proportions. Flood waters from storms inundate huge areas of land. Sometimes there is a dry spell and wildfires destroy forest and towns, creating haze and potentially causing hundreds of deaths. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are more frequent and destroying towns and cities. Melting snow in the Arctic and Antarctic is causing sea levels to rise and threatening to overrun islands. I have a feeling that these disasters are part of the cycles of change that our planet has been going through for millions of years.\nCould it be that the stable, salubrious climate that we have been enjoying has come to the end of its cycle? Could it be that the cycle is changing, as it did in prehistoric times, millions of years ago? Is it possible for temperatures to rise to a level where living conditions become unbearable? I think that, instead of preparing for war, we should be paying attention to climate change and the natural disasters that accompany it. We should be preparing to combat climate change in order to bring back the normal environment we have been used to for thousands of years. We should be preparing ourselves for major earthquakes, typhoons and hurricanes, floods and landslides, inter alia. We should learn how to mitigate these natural disasters.\nWe should be constructing shelters, making rain and growing food without sunlight and evacuating coastal areas, among other things.\nWe should have teams of well-equipped and trained disaster experts ready to rush to disaster areas. Every disaster is a world disaster. All these natural disasters may not happen, of course, but we cannot rely on that. We are wasting our money preparing for wars and inventing more new destructive weapons when we could all be wiped out by natural disasters as the planet goes through its next cycle. We human creatures are clever. We can still survive the next cycle if we task our researchers with coming up with defences against catastrophes. If we reduce our budgets for killing people, we will have the funds for research and preparation.\nMalaysia is a middle-income country that depends on trade to grow. Naturally, our markets are the rich countries. Now the rich want us to balance the trade and to buy more of their goods to correct the imbalance. To do this, we will have to spend the money we earn from trade to import the goods of the rich. Our growth will be stunted so that those who are already rich can become richer. Trade enriches everyone. That has been shown through the ages. Malaysia is a trading nation. Our population is too small to provide a good domestic market, so we need the world market. With new communication technologies, we can increase our trade with the world. Therefore, I ask our partners not to impoverish us by forcing us to buy what we do not need or to reduce our exports. Trade wars are wasteful. Now that the entire world has become a market for everyone, trade wars will stultify the potential of everyone to become rich.\nWe are also seeing sanctions being applied to countries. We do not know the laws under which such sanctions are applied; it appears to be a privilege of the rich and the powerful. If we want sanctions, let us have a law to govern them. The fact is that when a sanction is applied to a country, other countries get sanctioned as well. Malaysia and many others lost a big market when sanctions were applied to Iran. I believe in capitalism, but capitalism has gone mad. They are already talking of making trillions of dollars. It is dangerous for a person or a company to have so much money. It can influence things and it can buy power; hence the need for anti-trust laws. We saw what happened with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, whereby rich companies gave themselves the power to sue Governments. The terms of the agreement were drawn up by them, and they are not all like Bill Gates, who spends some money on charity. Most are bent on exploiting the power that money gives them.\nThe United Nations has failed to protect the poor from the scourge of war, but in other fields it has done much better. It has contributed to better health and to alleviating the suffering of some of the poor and the needy. It provides a degree of security and stability in places plagued by internal conflicts. It can do more, but it is short of funds. Certain countries, including those that are very rich, are not paying their dues. It is shameful. We need to support the United Nations, even though it has failed to banish wars. Its work on health, education and social security make the United Nations worth having.\nI would like to thank the staff and officers of the United Nations for their work and dedication in all those fields. Malaysia has been able to contribute by carrying out peacekeeping activities in many countries. I look forward to the time when those services will no longer be needed and when countries will be able to ensure their own security.\nThe United Nations should play a major role in the restoration of failed Governments. Many countries have failed because their administrative machinery does not function well. Modern technology can help, but there is a need for good training. Countries and people should be allowed to retain their cultures and ways of life. The General Assembly should authorize international interference only if those ways of life involve taking away the rights of people.\nAs for the Security Council, the time has come to modify the veto power if it cannot be done away with completely. The veto should be valid only if two permanent members and three non-permanent members of the Security Council agree to apply it. That way, abuses would be less frequent.\nThree-quarters of a century is a long time. We cannot be held to ransom by events of the distant past. The members of the Security Council with the power of the veto should not think that they will always be above international laws and norms. New, cheap yet powerful weapons have been invented that even the poor can produce and use. If we do not make wars a crime, our security cannot be sustained. We must resuscitate the original purpose of this great Organization \u2014 the United Nations. We must punish warmongers. We must make the world peaceful for all. That was our mission, and that must remain our mission. Only if we succeed can we claim to be civilized.\n"

        "file_text": "As I join the great family of the international community for the 74th session of the General Assembly, I would like to begin by extending to you, Mr. President, Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, my warm and sincere congratulations on your election to preside over our work. Your election is a well-deserved honour for and a tribute to the entire African continent, and in particular your country, the Federal Republic of Nigeria. I continue to believe that your perfect understanding of the international scene, as well as your great personal qualities, are an asset to and a guarantee of the success of our work.\nI also take this opportunity to commend Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her excellent work and achievements at the seventy-third session. We offer her the full expression of our gratitude and satisfaction.\nAllow me to reiterate my gratitude to and trust in Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his sustained commitment to peace and development in the world and, above all, for his tireless and multifaceted support for the Central African Republic.\nThe seventy-fourth session is being held at a time when the world is faced with threats to international peace and security \u2014 terrorism, poverty, climate change and migration. I have therefore come to share with the Assembly my country\u2019s concerns and ideas about the theme \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d. The relevance of the theme is matched only by the challenges the world faces today. The globalization movement has nurtured among the peoples of the world the common dream of seeing the Earth become a true global village.\nRegrettably, however, we have never seen so many walls and barriers being erected. In the era of globalization, we are subjected to the perils of nationalism and identity-based isolation. The intolerance of differences and growing extremism are expressed with increasing violence. Needless to say, times like these allow for a period of individual introspection and for exchange so that, together, we can meet the challenge of building bridges of brotherhood and peace that transcend borders.\nAs we all begin to unite our efforts, we will overcome the various sources of ongoing tension and crises in the world. No country, no nation is immune to the threats facing humankind today. The challenge for us as leaders is to have the courage to dare to take action. We must dare to question ourselves in order to develop innovative, effective and efficient solutions to build peace and stability and create a solid foundation for sustainable development.\nSeveral of our countries, including my own, are faced with a security situation that remains a source of concern and deserves the full attention of the international community. We must therefore bear in mind the fact that so long as one of our Member States does not have peace, the entire community of nations that will be affected.\nThe situation in the Middle East is of the utmost concern in terms of international security. We maintain our call for a peaceful, just and equitable resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on the solution of two States living in perfect symbiosis and harmony within safe and recognized borders. At the same time, we urge the entire international community to invest in the quest for genuine peace in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, in accordance with international law.\nIn Africa, the current situation shows that the proliferation of small arms and light weapons is a real threat to peace and security. More than ever, our States are called upon to unite their efforts and pool their resources, primarily in the areas of intelligence, prevention and early warning. The joint summit of the Economic Community of West African States and the Economic Community of Central African States, held in Lome in July 2018, should inspire more concerted and coordinated action at a time when the circulation of small arms and light weapons defies national borders. That has led to unsafe situations that remind us that the effective implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty would significantly reduce that threat to our continent. In that regard, the Central African Republic strongly supports the actions taken by our Organization, under the leadership of the Security Council, in order to achieve general and complete disarmament with regard to weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons alike.\nWhile development requires a minimum of peace, it is equally true that peace cannot prosper in the enclaves of abject poverty and insecurity, which present a distressing picture to the world. Beyond words that confirm our good intentions, let us drive forward a virtuous momentum of poverty eradication through concrete and strong action. Such action should help us to devise appropriate forms of social protection for all. It must contribute to generating wealth, the equitable distribution of which, with the aim of a common minimum standard of living, is among the factors that prevent conflict.\nIn that regard, in line with the deep aspirations of my people, I have urged my Government to prepare the National Plan for Recovery and Peacebuilding in the Central African Republic, which considers the main thrusts of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Agenda 2063 of the African Union. The challenges of transforming the world and our countries require that our populations have the necessary tools to remain active players in an ever-changing world.\nTo that end, on the heels of national reconstruction, my country intends to invest in education that combines quality with the efficient use of resources. Investing in learners, as well as in teachers, is our wager. And in my country emerging from the crisis, all our efforts must be directed towards the opportunities offered by new technologies. In addition, we would like to engage in an international discussion on education with a view to avoiding several pitfalls, such as education-for-all programmes, which wind up simply being literacy classes, when the resources do not follow to support quality education. Quality education is the tool that must should be used as a basis for more lasting and harmonious development, while also constituting a solid bastion against extremism in all its forms.\nWhile we applaud the progress that has been made in recent years with respect to the development of our countries, albeit unequal, we must also deeply reflect on humankind\u2019s impact on the environment. The abusive exploitation of natural resources is one of the causes of climate change, which is seriously disrupting and jeopardizing the future of humankind. Although the Central African Republic is far from being a major polluter, we stand in solidarity with the international efforts undertaken to preserve our planet; it is our historic responsibility.\nI firmly call for the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and its ratification by all States parties. We hope to see a significant reduction in the carbon emissions of developed countries and the fulfilment of financial commitments for carbon credits, in order to strengthen the resilience of developing countries against climate disasters.\nWithout contriving new lines of actions to take, our collective responsibility is to implement all our commitments, including the resolutions resulting from the twenty-fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as well as the recommendations made at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa, which has afforded us the opportunity to reaffirm our support for the implementation of the sustainable development agenda.\nFrom all the foregoing, it is clear that combining the efforts of the States members of our Organization, within the framework of multilateral action, is the cornerstone of success in our shared ideal of a more just and balanced and safer world for all, everywhere. That is evidenced by the mobilization of international solidarity that allowed my country to turn the page to a new chapter in its history, thanks to the signing, under the auspices of the African Union, of the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic between my Government and the 14 armed groups on 6 February. Today, we are mobilized for the implementation of this Agreement with the support of the guarantors, the African Union and the Economic Community of Central African States, and the facilitators, chief among which is the United Nations through the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic.\nWith the support of all our partners in the subregion and around the world, we are making progress, modest but steady, on the extending the State\u2019s authority throughout the country and reforms in the security and defence sectors, which will facilitate the gradual redeployment of the defence and security forces and the continuation of the national disarmament, demobilization, repatriation and reintegration programme. We also welcome the recent launch of development programmes to demonstrate that the first peace dividends are a reality.\nWithout denying our satisfaction at the singular momentum given to the peace process by the signing of that Agreement, much remains to be done. The situation in my country remains fragile, despite some real progress being made. Armed groups continue to acquire their war supplies and ammunition through illegal channels, committing mass and repeated violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. But, as members of the Assembly know, the embargo was imposed only on the legal and legitimate forces of the Central African Republic, thereby depriving the State of the resources to fulfil its mission to protect its citizens and territory. In line with the Central African Government, the States members of the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa supported the call for the lifting of that embargo at its forty-eighth ministerial meeting, in May, in Kinshasa.\nToday, I welcome the unanimous vote of the Security Council on the adoption of resolution 2488 (2019), which contributed to the easing of the arms embargo on our defence and security forces. However, I solemnly repeat the Government\u2019s request and the Central African people\u2019s legitimate aspiration for the total lifting of that embargo to enable the State to extend its authority throughout the national territory, with a view to protecting the civilian population. Indeed, the midterm report of 15 June 2019 submitted by my Government shows that the conditions set by the Sanctions Committee have been met, in addition to important strides made in the process of reforming the defence and security sectors.\nTo overcome the crisis that has shaken my country, and in line with the theme of our session, I call for multilateral, dynamic, concerted, coherent and coordinated action. I hope that the international community will remain mobilized alongside the people and the Government of the Central African Republic and will continue to support them in my country\u2019s recovery.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her strong leadership over the past year. I extend my heartfelt thanks to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his dynamic leadership.\nAs I stand here at this august podium, I recall the architect of Bangladesh, the father of our nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In 1974, before the General Assembly, he said, \u201cIn a world that is marked by strife and human misery, the United Nations remains the focus of man\u2019s hope for the future. Despite the many difficulties and obstacles placed in its way, the United Nations, during the more than quarter-century of its existence, has significantly contributed to human progress in the political, economic, social and cultural fields.\u201d (A/PV.2243, para. 21)\nIn fact, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman envisaged a leading role for the United Nations in pursuing development, peace and justice.\nIn Bangladesh, we are now preparing to celebrate the centenary of the birth of this great leader, beginning in March 2020. Reflecting on his vision and aspirations, we wish to bring this celebration to the United Nations in the next year.\nThe President\u2019s call to galvanize multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion could not have been more relevant. As the world\u2019s principal multilateral body, the General Assembly is perfectly suited to steer the actions that would promote international cooperation to achieve development, peace and security. The emphasis given to the specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion, are critically important for our civilization.\nOur shared aspirations and commitment to realizing the SDGs are reflected in the election manifesto of the Bangladesh Awami League, with which we earned the confidence of the people to grant us our third consecutive term in office. Our 21-point political commitment is dedicated to the well-being of people.\nBangladesh has often been cited as a development miracle. Despite turbulence in the rules-based international order and fears of a gradual economic slowdown, Bangladesh has continued to prosper over the past 10 years. According to the Spectator Index 2019, Bangladesh recorded the highest economic growth of 26 listed countries in the past 10 years, with the 188 per cent expansion of its gross domestic product (GDP) at current prices. Our GDP has grown from $102 billion in 2009 to $302 billion this year.\nWe continue to pursue a pragmatic programme for achieving rapid economic and social development. Poverty eradication, sustainable growth, the protection of the environment and human-resources development are some of the key features of our development strategy. Over the past 10 years, we have adopted progressive and timely policies and taken measures that have resulted in impressive development. Our exports grew threefold for the period from 2005 to 2006, reaching $37 billion in 2017-18. Per capita income grew by a factor of three and a half. Our GDP growth has now reached 8.13 per cent. From 2005 to 2006 and from 2018 to 2019, our investment rose from 26 per cent to 31.5 per cent of GDP. Private-sector investment increased by a factor of five to $70.8 billion. The foreign exchange reserve grew by a factor of nine to $33 billion.\nPoverty and inequality are the two major obstacles that stand in the way of development. Bangladesh has achieved one of the fastest poverty-reduction rates in the world, with the poverty rate dropping from 41.5 per cent in 2006 to 21.4 per cent in 2018, and with extreme poverty decreasing from 24 per cent to 11.3 per cent for the same period. Extensive rural development, embedded in the concept of \u201cmy village, my town\u201d and home-grown and pro-poor village projects like the Ashrayan and Amar Bari Amar Khamar projects have contributed to our inclusive development. Bangladesh was ranked thirty-fourth in the World Economic Forum\u2019s Inclusive Development Index 2018, significantly surpassing other South Asian countries in this ranking.\nA key development strategy in Bangladesh has been addressing inequality through social security, decent work and financial inclusion. The current safety-net system provides special consideration for vulnerable groups. Support comes in the form of cash, food, assets, employment wages, training, savings and community support. These programmes are expanding, currently serve almost a quarter of the population and account for 2.58 per cent of our GDP.\nHaving achieved the milestones of gender parity and 100 per cent enrolment, we are now focusing on enhancing the quality of education, with an emphasis on e-learning and qualified teachers. Our school drop-out rate has decreased from 50 per cent to 18 per cent. In 2010, we initiated a free book-distribution programme for all students up to tenth grade. To date, 2.96 billion textbooks have been distributed free of cost, of which approximately 352.2 million books were distributed in 2019 alone, 2.3 million students in primary and higher levels of education were awarded scholarships, and 12.3 million mothers are receiving stipends by mobile phone.\nWe have created an extensive network of 18,000 community clinics and union health centres to provide the entire population with health-care coverage. The centres provide 30 different types of medicine and primary health-care services free of cost to people living in rural areas, 80 per cent of whom are women and children. The number of cases of maternal, infant and child mortality, malnutrition, stunting and low weight continue to decline thanks to these measures. We have put special emphasis on the inclusion of persons with autism, disabilities and special needs in our development journey. Currently, 1.645 million people with such disabilities and needs are receiving Government allowances.\nWe are investing in human capital to create an inclusive society through equal access to technology. Countrywide, 5,800 digital centres are bringing 600 e-public services to people\u2019s doorsteps. The number of Internet users has crossed the threshold of 90 million people, and teledensity has surpassed 93 per cent. The Bangabandhu Satellite-1, which we launched last year, has facilitated the expansion of broadcast-based services in remote areas and improved communications for development.\nThe blue economy is our new frontier for opportunities. We have developed a policy and a plan of action to tap our marine resources in the Bay of Bengal. We are contributing to the United Nations norm-setting exercises on protecting marine biological diversity in areas within and beyond national jurisdiction.\nWe are building our first-ever nuclear-power plant in Rooppur, based on the principle of the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Some 93 per cent of our population is covered by the electricity grid. Bangladesh is now the second-largest user of solar-powered household systems in the world. Bangladesh\u2019s commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear energy is enhanced by its consistent position against nuclear armament. We recently ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\nThe global stand for taking climate action fostered by the Climate Action Summit, concluded just days ago, will translate into genuine impetus for the implementation of the Paris Agreement in the broader context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As a partner country in the Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment and the Global Commission on Adaptation, Bangladesh has advocated addressing the special challenges and vulnerabilities of countries such as our own and adopted transformative and innovative climate-resilient technology and crops to reduce disaster risks.\nOur long-term plan for adaptation and resilience is anchored in our Delta Plan 2100, a comprehensive and long-term technoeconomic plan for the Bangladesh Delta. The Plan focuses on food security, water safety, climate change, environment sustainability, disaster management and sustained economic growth. Following the recent Dhaka meeting of the Global Commission on Adaptation, we are working on setting up a global centre for adaptation in Dhaka.\nAs the second largest troop- and police-contributing country, Bangladesh continues to respond to the call for troops to participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations. We support the Secretary-General\u2019s initiatives to make United Nations peace operations fit for the future. In responding to his call for the implementation of the Action for Peacekeeping agenda, we have come on board as a champion country. We have also been playing an important role in the evolution of the sustaining-peace conceptual framework.\nWe continue to promote the idea of the culture of peace, which has withstood the test of time and become a dominant theme at the United Nations. Earlier this month, in this Hall, we celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace. Our strong actions against extremism, terrorism, drug trafficking and corruption have restored peace in our society and among its people. We shall persist in our actions.\nBangladesh promotes safe, orderly and regular migration. Following the adoption of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, we have spearheaded the development of modalities for its implementation. At the national level, we are mainstreaming migration into national development strategies. Irregular migration and human trafficking are global menaces rooted in complex nets of syndicates and criminal networks. In order to prevent and suppress human trafficking nationally and foster international cooperation in tackling human trafficking, we recently acceded to the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, also known as the Palermo Protocol.\nThe value of the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security is enormous. During the 1971 war of liberation, 3 million innocent people were killed in a genocide orchestrated by the Pakistani occupation forces and their local collaborators. Some 200,000 women were violated. Our painful experiences have emboldened us to continue to speak out for the oppressed. We will stand firm in our support for our Palestinian brothers and sisters until their just and rightful struggle comes to fruition.\nAs the Rohingya crisis remains unresolved, I am unfortunately compelled to raise the issue in the Assembly again. We continue to host 1.1 million Rohingya who were forced to leave Myanmar owing to atrocities committed against them. The crisis is now entering its third year. Yet to date not a single member of the Rohingya people has been able to return to Myanmar due to the absence of safety, security and freedom of movement and an overall environment that is not conducive to the return of the Rohingya to the Rakhine state of Myanmar. I urge the international community to understand that the situation is untenable. The crisis is now going beyond the camps; indeed, despite all our efforts to contain it, the crisis is now becoming a regional threat. Moreover, increasing congestion and environmental degradation is challenging the health and security of people in the host area.\nWe are bearing the burden of a crisis that is of Myanmar\u2019s own making. It is an issue solely between Myanmar and its own people, the Rohingya. They themselves have to resolve it. The voluntary return of the Rohingya to their homes in Rakhine state in safety, security and dignity is the only possible solution to the crisis. We will continue our engagement with Myanmar to ensure the repatriation of the Rohingya.\nIn my address to the seventy-second General Assembly, I presented a five-point proposal to resolve the crisis, which included the full implementation of the recommendations of the Kofi Annan Foundation Advisory Commission report and the establishment of civilian-monitored safe zones in Rakhine state (see A/72/PV.14). Today I would like to reiterate some of the actions I proposed.\nFirst, Myanmar must manifest clear political will that is supported by concrete actions for the sustainable return and reintegration of the Rohingya to Myanmar.\nSecondly, Myanmar must build trust among the Rohingya by abrogating and ending discriminatory laws and practices and granting the Rohingya representatives go-and-see visits to northern Rakhine.\nThirdly, Myanmar must guarantee the security and safety of the Rohingya by deploying civilian monitors from the international community in Rakhine state.\nFourthly, the international community must ensure that the root causes of the Rohingya problem are addressed and that the human rights violations and other atrocity crimes committed against the Rohingya are held to account.\nWe appreciate the Secretary-General\u2019s initiatives aimed at reform, particularly those of the United Nations development system. We have high expectations that the new generation of United Nations country teams and the reinvigorated resident coordinator system will be able deliver results that are better aligned with national priorities and more accountable to host countries. We will continue to lend our support to the bold and constructive actions of the Secretary-General to make the Organization fit for purpose and strengthen people\u2019s trust in it. As an expression of our support for the reforms and to ensure the effective functionality of the new resident coordinator system, we will make a financial contribution to the special purpose trust fund.\nFor us, multilateralism remains a panacea for resolving the problems of the world and creating global goods. The United Nations is the symbol of hope for peace, stability and prosperity, as envisioned by the father of our nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in his address to the General Assembly in 1974. Bangladesh will continue to support the United Nations as a strong multilateral body that is fully equipped to deal with the tasks and responsibilities assigned to it under the Charter of the United Nations. With the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations approaching next year, let us call for collective action to build a stronger United Nations so that our civilizations may deal with emerging challenges throughout the next century. May Bangladesh live forever.\n"

        "file_text": "It is customary for the British Prime Minister to come to the United Nations and pledge to advance our values and defend our rules, the rules of a peaceful world, from protecting freedom of navigation in the Gulf to persevering in the vital task of achieving a two-State solution to the conflict in the Middle East. And, of course, I am proud to do all of these things.\nBut no one can ignore a gathering force that is reshaping the future of every member of the General Assembly. There has been nothing like it in history. When I think of the great scientific revolutions of the past \u2014 print, the steam engine, aviation, the atomic age \u2014 I think of new tools that we acquired but over which we, the human race, had the advantage, which we controlled. That is not necessarily the case in the digital age.\nYou may keep secrets from your friends, from your parents, your children, your doctor, even your personal trainer, but it takes real effort to conceal your thoughts from Google. And if that is true today, in future there may be nowhere to hide. Smart cities will pullulate with sensors, all joined together by the Internet of Things, bollards communing invisibly with lampposts, so there is always a parking space for your electric car, so that no bin goes unemptied, no street unswept, and the urban environment is as antiseptic as a Zurich pharmacy.\nBut this technology could also be used to keep every citizen under round-the-clock surveillance. A future Alexa will pretend to take orders, but this Alexa will be watching you, clucking her tongue and stamping her foot. In future, voice connectivity will be in every room and almost every object; your mattress will monitor your nightmares; your fridge will beep for more cheese; your front door will sweep wide the moment you approach, like some silent butler; your smart meter will go hustling \u2014 of its own accord \u2014 for the cheapest electricity, and every one of them minutely transcribing your every habit in tiny electronic shorthand, stored not in their chips or their innards \u2014 nowhere you can find it, but in some great cloud of data that lowers ever more oppressively over the human race. A giant dark thundercloud is waiting to burst, and we have no control over how or when the precipitation will take place.\nAnd every day that we tap on our phones or work on our iPads \u2014 as I see some of those present here are doing now \u2014 we not only leave our indelible spoor in the ether, but we are ourselves becoming a resource click by click, tap by tap. Just as the carboniferous period created the indescribable wealth, leaf by decaying leaf, of hydrocarbons, data is the crude oil of the modern economy.\nWe are now in an environment where we do not know who should own these new oil fields, we do not know who should have the rights or the title to these gushers of cash, and we do not know who decides how to use that data. Can these algorithms be trusted with our lives and hopes? Should the machines, and only the machines, decide whether or not we are eligible for a mortgage or insurance or what surgery or medicines we should receive? Are we doomed to a cold and heartless future in which computer says yes, or computer says no, with the grim finality of an emperor in the arena?\nHow does one plead with an algorithm? How does one get it to see extenuating circumstances? How do we know that the machines have not been insidiously programmed to fool us or even to cheat us? We are already using all kinds of messaging services that offer instant communication at minimal cost. These same programmes and platforms could also be designed for real-time censorship of every conversation, with offending words automatically deleted; indeed, in some countries, this is happening today.\nDigital authoritarianism is not, alas, the stuff of dystopian fantasy but of an emerging reality. The reason I am giving this speech today with its slightly gloomy proem is that the United Kingdom is one of the world\u2019s technology leaders, and I believe that Governments have been simply caught unawares by the unintended consequences of the Internet, a scientific breakthrough more far-reaching in its everyday psychological impact than any other invention since Gutenberg\u2019s. And when one considers how long it took for books to come into widespread circulation, the arrival of the Internet is far bigger than print. It is bigger than the atomic age, but it is like nuclear power in that it is capable of both good and harm. But of course it is not alone. As new technologies seem to race towards us from the far horizon, we strain our eyes as they come to make out whether they are for good or bad \u2014 friends or foes?\nArtificial intelligence \u2014 what will it mean? Helpful robots washing and caring for an ageing population? Or pink-eyed terminators sent back from the future to cull the human race? What will synthetic biology stand for \u2014 restoring our livers and our eyes with miracle regeneration of the tissues, like some fantastic hangover cure? Or will it bring terrifying limbless chickens to our tables? Will nanotechnology help us to beat disease, or will it leave tiny robots to replicate in the crevices of our cells?\nIt is a trope as old as literature that any scientific advance is punished by the gods. When Prometheus brought fire to humankind in a tube of fennel, as you may remember, with his brother Epimetheus, Zeus punished him by chaining him to a Tartarean crag while his liver was pecked out \u2014 I did talk about a hangover cure \u2014 by an eagle. And every time his liver regrew, the eagle came back and pecked it again. This went on forever, a bit like the experience of Brexit in the United Kingdom, if some of our parliamentarians had their way.\nIn fact, it was a standard poetic practice to curse the protos heuretes, the person responsible for any scientific or technical breakthrough. If only they had never invented the ship, then Jason would never have sailed to Colchis, and all sorts of disasters would never have happened.\nIt is a deep human instinct to be wary of any kind of technical progress. In 1829, they thought the human frame would not withstand the speeds attained by Stephenson\u2019s rocket. And there are today people today who are actually anti-science \u2014 a whole movement called the anti-vaxxers, who refuse to acknowledge the evidence that vaccinations have eradicated smallpox and who by their prejudices are actually endangering the very children they want to protect. I totally reject this anti-scientific pessimism.\nI am profoundly optimistic about the ability of new technology to serve as a liberator and remake the world wondrously and benignly; indeed, in countless respects technology is already doing just that. Today, nanotechnology, as I mentioned earlier, is revolutionizing medicine by designing robots a fraction of the size of a red blood cell, capable of swimming through our bodies, dispensing medicine and attacking malignant cells like some Star Wars armada. Neural interface technology is producing a new generation of cochlear implants, allowing the gift of hearing to people who would not otherwise be able to hear the voices of their own children.\nA London technology company has worked out how to help the blind to navigate more freely with nothing more than an app on their smartphones \u2014 new technologies, produced in Britain, helping the deaf to hear and the blind to see. We used to think that printing was something that you did to run off a boarding card; now a British company has used 3D printing to make an engine capable of blasting a rocket into space.\nIn African countries, millions of people without bank accounts can now transfer money using a simple app; they can buy solar energy and leap in one transaction from no electricity to green power. New advances are making renewable energy ever cheaper, aiding our common struggle against climate change. Our understanding of the natural world is being transformed by genome sequencing \u2014 the discovery of the very essence of life itself, the secret genetic code that animates the spirit of every living being and allows medical breakthroughs the likes of which we have never known. Treatments are tailored to the precise genetic makeup of the individual.\nSo far, we have discovered the secrets of less than 0.3 per cent of complex life on the planet. Think what we will achieve when \u2014 and it is a matter of when \u2014 we understand 1 or 2 per cent of it, let alone 5 or 10 per cent. But it is how we design the emerging technologies behind these breakthroughs and which values inform their design that will shape the future of humankind. That is the point I wish to make tonight.\nAt stake is whether we bequeath an Orwellian world, designed for censorship, repression and control, or a world of emancipation, debate and learning, where technology threatens famine and disease but not our freedoms. Seven decades ago, the General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with no dissenting voices, uniting humankind for the first and perhaps only time behind one set of principles. Our joint declaration upholds the freedom of opinion and expression, the privacy of home and correspondence, and the right to seek and impart information and ideas. Unless we ensure that new technology reflects this spirit, I fear that our declaration will mean nothing and no longer hold. The mission of the United Kingdom and all who share our values must therefore be to ensure that emerging technologies are designed from the outset for freedom, openness and pluralism, with the right safeguards in place to protect our peoples.\nMonth by month, vital decisions are being taken in academic committees, company boardrooms and industry standards groups. They are writing the rulebooks of the future, making ethical judgements and choosing what will or will not be rendered possible. Together, we need to ensure that new advances reflect our values by design.\nThere is excellent work being done by the European Union, the Commonwealth and, of course, the United Nations, which has a vital role in ensuring that no country is excluded from the wonderful benefits of this technology and the industrial revolution it is bringing about. But we must continue to be more ambitious: we need to find the right balance between freedom and control, between innovation and regulation, and between private enterprise and Government oversight. We must insist that the ethical judgments inherent in the design of new technology are transparent to all and we must make our voices heard more loudly in the standards bodies that write the rules. Above all, we need to agree a common set of global principles to shape the norms and standards that will guide the development of emerging technology.\nHere is the good news. I invite all present to a summit next year in London \u2014 a wonderful city where, by the way, it is not raining 94 per cent of the time. At one stage, when I was Mayor of London, we discovered that we had even more Michelin-starred restaurants than Paris. The French somehow rapidly recovered by a process that I am not quite sure was entirely fair. But in the United Kingdom, in London, we still have by far the biggest technology sector anywhere in Europe. We have every kind of technology \u2014 financial technology, biological technology, medical technology, nanotechnology, green technology \u2014 and perhaps half a million people working in technology alone. I hope to see everyone there as we seek to assemble the broadest possible coalition to take forward this vital task, building on all that the United Kingdom can contribute to this mission as a global leader in ethical and responsible technology.\nIf we master this challenge \u2014 and I have no doubt that we can \u2014 then we will not only safeguard our ideals, we will surmount the limits that once constrained humankind and conquer the perils that once ended so many lives. Together, we will vanquish killer diseases, eliminate famine, protect the environment and transform our cities. Success will depend, now as ever, on freedom, openness and pluralism, which is the formula that not only emancipates the human spirit, but also releases the boundless ingenuity and inventiveness of humankind, and which, above all, the United Kingdom will strive to preserve and advance.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to thank the President of the General Assembly for his able guidance, which I believe will lead us to answers for the pressing challenges we face. Today, more than ever, we need to stand for a rules-based multilateral system with the United Nations at its core. In that context, I would like to express our support for the timely and important initiative launched by Germany and France for the creation of an Alliance for Multilateralism, a network of like-minded nations working to foster effective multilateral approaches to global issues through the United Nations. This initiative perfectly matches this year\u2019s topic for the general debate.\nAllow me to say a few words on the different building blocks of our main topic as set forth in the overarching theme of this session \u2014 sustainable development for all parts of our planet. The High-level Political Forum on sustainable development is a pivotal event at the margins of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. The need to accelerate the pace of progress in achieving all Sustainable Development Goals is pressing. The human race is facing the rapidly developing detrimental consequences of ever-increasing overuse of natural resources and massive urbanization. Some human activities result in irreversible environmental pollution, which reduces biodiversity and threatens fragile ecosystems.\nWe commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for convening the Climate Action Summit as a catalyst for collective political will to attain lower and, over time, climate-neutral levels of industrial greenhouse-gas emissions. This, the master message of the Summit, must ring out loudly from this, the highest of international tribunes. Bulgaria stands by its obligations under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. My country will spare no effort in transforming its economy in a way that will contribute to the common goal of keeping temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C and reaching net-zero global emissions by 2050. Bulgaria has already reached the interim target of an 18 per cent share of renewable sources in its energy mix, thereby becoming a European Union (EU) champion.\nThis year, on 24 January, Secretary-General Guterres marked the first-ever International Day of Education, putting education at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Bulgaria wholeheartedly subscribes to his assessment that education is an engine for poverty eradication and a driving force for peace.\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, Bulgaria is committed to the empowerment of children with disabilities through inclusive education. Inclusive education is an essential tool for the whole process of social inclusion. In a world driven by information and communication technologies, we place particular emphasis on the opportunities offered by education. In the coming years, the European Commissioner in charge of the innovation, education and the youth sector will be from Bulgaria, which demonstrates the importance we attach to these priorities.\nGlobal health is one of the major present-day global challenges we face. Bulgaria affirms its commitment to achieving universal health coverage, as set forth in our national priorities. We welcome the timely high-level meeting on the matter, as well as the political declaration on universal health coverage and its ambitious call to action.\nThe United Nations has a unique array of tools for mediation, conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. We welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s vision for a closely interlinked reform of all key areas in this most important field. Bulgaria welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s commitment to advancing diplomacy for peace and stands ready to support his efforts to strengthen the role of mediation in conflict prevention, embodied in the Action for Peacekeeping initiative.\nInternational terrorism and violent extremism continue to pose a significant threat to international peace and security, human rights and sustainable development. The international community should beef up efforts to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation by supporting the United Nations as a key player. Unfortunately, over the past year, the international community has not been able to reach a breakthrough in any major conflict around the world. The proclaimed military victory over the so-called caliphate of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham last March was not enough to bring the war-torn Middle East region closer to the peace. The international community should stay vigilant, as terrorist threats persist in different forms.\nFinding a political solution to the conflict in Syria is crucial for the stability and security of the region and beyond. We call for a nationwide cessation of hostilities and for the protection of civilians. It is imperative to ensure humanitarian access to all parts of the country. Under the auspices of the United Nations, a lasting political process aimed at a peaceful and inclusive political transition should be launched. A sustainable political solution should be sought through a genuine Syrian-owned political process in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) and the 2012 Geneva communique (S/2012/522, annex). Bulgaria highly appreciates the commitment of neighbouring host countries to easing the suffering of the refugees.\nThere is no military solution to the crisis in Libya. Bulgaria will continue to support the relaunching of the United Nations-led mediation process and preparations for parliamentary and presidential elections when possible. The stabilization of Libya is of the utmost importance for regional security and for the management of migration flows in the Mediterranean. Bulgaria supports close cooperation between the European Union and the International Organization for Migration aimed at increasing the number of voluntary returns and improving the conditions in detention centres in Libya.\nBulgaria will continue to support all efforts aimed at resuming the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, including those of the Quartet on the Middle East peace process. A two-State solution is the only way to sustainable peace.\nThe humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is cause for great concern. It should remain a priority for the United Nations and the international community alike.\nThe five-year-long armed confrontation in Yemen has clearly shown that a durable and comprehensive solution to the conflict cannot be achieved by military means. The effective end of hostilities would allow for improving the catastrophic humanitarian situation. Bulgaria supports efforts to revive the political process as well as the full implementation of the Stockholm Agreement as a starting point for a peace settlement.\nIt has been more than five years since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine. Despite periodic ceasefires, the situation in eastern Ukraine remains highly precarious. We call for a peaceful settlement of the crisis in accordance with resolution 68/262, of March 2014. The exchange of detainees is a sign of hope, but the parties to the conflict should implement in full the mutually agreed package of measures endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 2202 (2015). It is of vital importance that they abide by the ceasefire, complete the withdrawal of heavy weapons and grant unhindered access to all sites to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission.\nBulgaria expresses deep concern about the decision of Iran to suspend the implementation of some of its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on its nuclear programme. A return to full compliance with the nuclear deal and further diplomatic outreach provide the only way to reduce tensions. Discussing Iran\u2019s regional role and the country\u2019s ballistic-missile programme should be addressed separately from the JCPOA.\nWe are also seriously concerned by the recent escalation of tensions in the Persian Gulf. An immediate priority should be given to de-escalation measures aimed at avoiding further incidents.\nThe resumption of dialogue between the United States and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the encouraging sign of Pyongyang\u2019s readiness to engage in negotiations on denuclearization represent a qualitatively new phase in international efforts. It is vital that summit agreements be followed by actions yielding tangible results. Bulgaria reiterates its support for the strict and effective implementation of the sanctions regime, as well as for keeping the channels of communication open.\nMultilateral efforts on non-proliferation and disarmament remain central. Next year we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which coincides with the 2020 NPT Review Conference. To keep up the momentum, we must reaffirm the validity of the Treaty as the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\nBulgaria has consistently supported the integration of the Western Balkans into the European Union. The process leading to membership is an investment in stability. Bulgaria puts a special emphasis on the need to overcome the legacies of the past in the region by actively building good-neighbourly relations.\nBulgaria welcomes all initiatives that benefit social and economic empowerment, especially that of persons belonging to vulnerable groups. As a member of the Human Rights Council, my country is dedicated to remaining active on such matters. I had the honour to address the Council in June and to confirm our commitment to champion the rights of those in need.\nAs a Chair of the Group of Friends of Children and the Sustainable Development Goals, and working together with UNICEF, we strictly follow our principles, and I would like to highlight that the family is the best environment for raising children. Bulgaria is a champion of deinstitutionalization.\nWomen around the world continue to be underrepresented in both Government and private entities. They still constitute the majority of the world\u2019s poor. I am proud that my country has an outstanding record in the field of women\u2019s empowerment. Bulgaria is fully committed to the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000).\nTolerance and understanding are values underpinning the very foundation of democracy. Regrettably, despite all efforts made, anti-Semitism continues today to rear its ugly head. The rescue of the entire Jewish population of Bulgaria in 1943 is one of the stellar moments in our history. In the darkest moments of the Second World War, not a single individual of the 50,000-strong Bulgarian Jewish community was sent to the death camps. My country provided an example of how civil society can defend human values. Our national tradition of tolerance and respect for others obliges us to provide a clear response to growing anti-Semitism, xenophobia and hate speech.\nNext year will mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. Strong messages mobilizing broad international approval and bold and prompt concerted actions are needed today more than ever before, and will certainly be needed tomorrow. The message I would like to convey to the Assembly is also my personal belief \u2014 our mission is possible, and we must see to it that it is achieved.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, on behalf of my country and on my own behalf, I convey to His Excellency Ambassador Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, our warmest congratulations on his election to this important position, which dignifies not only his country, Nigeria, but also the entire African continent. I therefore reaffirm Guinea-Bissau\u2019s unconditional support during his term.\nI also thank the United Nations, particularly Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, for the attention accorded to Guinea-Bissau and for the important contributions of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau to our country.\nThe United Nations system, founded and developed in the aftermath of major conflicts of the twentieth century, is once again taking on particular relevance with the rising threats posed by nationalist policies, which are opposed to multilateralism and the values of the Organization. I therefore commend everyone for the pertinence of the theme chosen for the debate during this session.\nIndeed, the threats of climate change, terrorism, transnational organized crime and the armed conflicts that are ravaging many places throughout the world will be checked and eventually overcome only through the joint efforts of States within the framework of the United Nations. No national or special-group interests can be allowed to come before those of preserving our planet and combating organized crime.\nI wish to convey to the Assembly the feeling of renewed hope pervading Bissau-Guinean society in this new cycle and reaffirm the political will and profound commitment of the authorities of my country to the peacebuilding and political stabilization process. We look forward to creating sustainable mechanisms for achieving the goals established in our national development plan, based on and sustained by the strategic and operational plan known as Terra Ranka, which has been submitted to our partners in a timely manner and which we hereby reaffirm.\nUnder the leadership of His Excellency Prime Minister Aristides Gomes, the Government of Guinea-Bissau has an ambitious governance programme that emphasizes the reduction of poverty, the promotion of quality education through youth entrepreneurship and the empowerment of women in order to ensure a more just and inclusive society. It is our responsibility as the Government to create the necessary conditions for harmonious and sustainable development.\nIn that regard, Guinea-Bissau fully subscribes to the political declaration of the high-level meeting on universal health coverage, entitled \u201cUniversal health coverage: moving together to build a healthier world\u201d, which was adopted by the General Assembly earlier this week (resolution 74/2). It is important to note that, in 2014, our country adopted a policy that exempts pregnant women and children under five years of age from having to pay for health services. The measure reflects social justice and equity that our Government accepts as a duty and responsibility in the light of the precarious indicators associated with that segment of the population. If the initiative is to be sustainable, however, we will require the unequivocal and urgent support of our regional and international partners.\nThe current Government, which is the result of the 10 March parliamentary elections, has engaged in inclusive dialogue and continuous political cooperation as priority instruments in efforts to consolidate political stabilization and create broad consensus around key governance issues. In addition to strengthening the democratic legitimacy of our political institutions, we intend to build the necessary foundations for a better-structured and more united society. We are pursuing that aspiration, based on political agreements defining the general outlines of legislative and governmental action, including issues related to structural reform of State institutions, constitutional revision and the rebuilding of the economic and social fabric.\nThat vision of compromise and sharing in the resolution of our key problems is demonstrated by the signing of agreements of parliamentary and governmental incidence by five of the seven political parties represented in Parliament. In addition to demonstrating the resolve of Bissau-Guineans to walk together for the sake of cohesion and stability, that understanding enabled the formation of a pluralistic Government, bringing together national competencies from various interests and political convictions. For the first time, we have achieved absolute gender parity across posts.\nSuch hopeful signs nevertheless do not negate our situation as an institutionally fragile post-conflict State with sparse financial resources, of which we suffer the grave political, economic, environmental and social consequences. Guinea-Bissau is facing a difficult and complex situation, with continuing and grave internal and external threats, and calls on the international community to play a central stabilizing role through international monitoring and accountability mechanisms.\nAs a Member of the Organization, Guinea-Bissau is firmly committed to the Charter of the United Nations and supports the multilateral systems and mechanisms that promote the cause of peace as a shared public asset. Our country, a member of the Group of Seven Plus, advocates the promotion of peace through the sharing of experiences among countries, based on national dialogue and reconciliation, as set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nOrganized crime networks continue to pose a grave threat and to undermine the enormous stabilization achieved through joint national efforts, supported by the entire international community. One example of such destabilization is the use of our territory for the transit of illicit drugs, which was recently reduced by record-breaking seizures in a major operation carried out by our judiciary police. That manifestation of our Government\u2019s political will and determination to combat that scourge has had a profound impact on the political structures that sustain those businesses. We are already seeing and feeling the effects of the attacks and intense attempts to compromise the governance process in order to reinstate instability, which favours the previous long-standing status quo.\nThat is certainly not a national phenomenon, and it is clear that organized crime exploits the fragility of our States with regard to entrenched local interests. In that regard, it is essential that we strengthen the mechanisms that our main partners use to monitor the political process in Guinea-Bissau.\nSimilarly, it is imperative that our national security and justice institutions enjoy the necessary attention and support from their subregional and international counterparts in order to strengthen their capabilities and adopt best practices to defend the universal rights of citizens, both individually and collectively. Ultimately, that is the perfect illustration of the importance of multilateralism, which greatly justifies and elevates the existence of the Organization.\nMany have already cited the original historic reasons for the current composition of the Security Council, which no longer reflects our geopolitical reality. I therefore add my country\u2019s voice to the appeal to broaden that important part of the United Nations in order to strengthen its legitimacy and representation. From that perspective and in line with the position of the African Union, Guinea-Bissau advocates the designation of two permanent seats, with veto power, and five non-permanent seats in the Security Council to the African continent.\nThe Sahel region is a perfect illustration of the devastating danger that terrorism poses to the world. Therefore, from this rostrum, I appeal to the international community to create and put in place financing mechanisms to ensure the operational readiness of the Joint Force of the Group of Five for the Sahel and to tackle the region\u2019s challenges, which greatly surpass the logistical capabilities of its countries. More than just a regional threat, terrorism affects the whole continent and may adversely impact world peace.\nWe welcome and encourage the redoubled efforts of the United Nations, particularly those of the Secretary-General, for the vision and sensitivity with which it has addressed the issue of gender equality within the United Nations system. As a champion of gender equality, Guinea-Bissau welcomes the progress made and wishes to share with the General Assembly the historical adoption of the law of parity by the People\u2019s National Assembly in Guinea-Bissau in 2018, which established women\u2019s level of representation in elected positions at 36 per cent. As a result, Guinea-Bissau became part of a group of more than 80 countries that have adopted corrective and temporary measures to increase the participation of women in politics and decision-making.\nI cannot but express our profound recognition and gratitude to all of our international partners, including the United Nations, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States, the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, the European Union, the West African Economic and Monetary Union and the International Organization of la Francophonie, whose support has been key in monitoring and managing the political transition process, as well as in the legislative elections held in our country in March. We also extend our recognition and gratitude to all countries that, upon seeing the need of the brotherly people of our country, provided critical support and contributed significantly towards overcoming the crisis in Guinea-Bissau.\nHowever, this election cycle will be complete only when presidential elections are held. These are scheduled for 24 November. We therefore reiterate our appeal for technical and financial assistance from the international community in order to ensure that this important event takes place without disruption.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the new global development paradigm to be established must be rooted in peoples\u2019 specific cultures and realities and draw inspiration from the lessons of the Millennium Development Goals. With respect to climate change, Guinea-Bissau, as a coastal country and archipelago, has a low-lying coastal area 5 meters below sea level, on average, which makes our country highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\nDespite the challenges that my country has faced in its holistic approach to international commitments, we are pleased and proud to inform the Assembly that approximately 27 per cent of our national territory consists of protected areas, thus broadly surpassing Goal 11 of the SDGs and making Guinea-Bissau a country of biodiversity, as the survival of our population greatly depends on such resources. Therefore, we are betting on green, inclusive growth that benefits the economy of biodiversity.\nOur national efforts to build a resilient society based on our geographic reality were recently recognized by the United Nations Development Programme through the Equator Prize 2019, for an initiative developed by the national non-governmental organization Tiniguena in collaboration with the Government, which consists of using traditional knowledge to protect marine ecosystems and ensure sustainable livelihoods for autochthonous peoples of the Bijagos archipelago.\nI conclude my remarks by reiterating our gratitude to the United Nations and recognizing the role that the Peacebuilding Commission has played in supporting the political stabilization and governance process in my country. Bissau-Guineans are determined to turn a new page and return to our history of honour and dignity, aware that, in this phase, we will need even more assistance and support from our international partners. Guinea-Bissau is mobilized to transform our territory into a space of peace and human security open to all peoples of the world who wish to build a more fraternal, safe, welcoming, and progressive society for all peoples and cultures."

        "file_text": "This year marks the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The United Nations was established in 1945 in response to the call of the times. Four years later, the People\u2019s Republic of China was founded and the Chinese nation re-emerged before the eyes of the world as a completely reborn nation.\nOver the past 70 years, we Chinese have changed our destiny through tireless efforts. Seventy years ago, China put an end to a period in modern history during which the country was torn apart and trampled on. We stood up and became the true masters of our country. Over the past seven decades, China has transformed itself from a closed, backward and poor country with a weak foundation into one that is open and on the move.\nWith regard to meeting the basic needs of its people, China has achieved initial prosperity. Eight hundred and fifty million Chinese have shaken off poverty, and hundreds of millions have joined the middle-income group. Such achievements are nothing short of a miracle in the development of humankind. In just a few decades, China has finished what it took developed countries several hundred years to complete. In so doing, China has blazed a new path to modernization for developing countries, and what it has achieved has enriched the dreams of people around the world for a better life.\nNone of those achievements has fallen from the sky. Rather, they are owed to the hard work, vision and courage of the Chinese people. The secret behind China\u2019s development is our adherence to the centralized, unified leadership of the Communist Party of China, the development path suited to China\u2019s national conditions, the fundamental State policy of reform and opening up and a people-centred development philosophy.\nOver the past 70 years, China has integrated itself into the global community and made its contribution to the world, boosting world peace and prosperity through its development. Today China has become the leading engine of global development and an anchor of stability for world peace. We are the second-largest funding contributor to both the United Nations and United Nations peacekeeping operations. China has also deployed more peacekeeping personnel than any other permanent member of the Security Council. For more than a decade, China has been a main driver of global growth. We are now pursuing a new round of opening up with higher standards, which I am sure will deliver new opportunities for the world.\nAs we enter a new era, we Chinese are more confident and capable than ever of achieving a great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and we are better positioned than ever to make a greater contribution to humankind. Guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, China will continue to strive for success and forge ahead. Looking back on the road we have traversed over the past 70 years, we are full of pride. Looking ahead at the journey before us, we are full of confidence in our bright future.\nOn the diplomatic front, China has travelled a journey of tests and challenges and has remained true to its original purpose. The goal of China\u2019s diplomacy has never changed. The Chinese people and the peoples of other countries have always treated each other with sincerity and lent each other mutual support. China and the rest of the world have become stakeholders sharing a common future as their interdependence has increasingly grown. Facing international uncertainties, China will maintain the stability and continuity of its foreign policy and will continue to pursue major- country diplomacy, with distinct Chinese features. We will continue to safeguard world peace and prosperity and promote the development and advancement of humankind.\nChina is guided by the principle of independence. We will continue to pursue an independent foreign policy of peace. We will neither subordinate ourselves to others nor coerce others into submission. We are firm in upholding China\u2019s core national interests and legitimate rights, and we are opposed to the abuse of power and will never yield to pressure. We will remain committed to the basic principles of sovereign equality and non-interference in other country\u2019s internal affairs, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. China will never pursue hegemony or seek expansion. Peaceful development, which has long been incorporated into China\u2019s Constitution, is the cornerstone of its foreign policy.\nChina believes in equality among nations. In the twenty-first century, power politics and the law of the jungle are outdated and obsolete. People want mutual respect and harmonious coexistence. China stands for equality among all countries, irrespective of their size. China respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries and the social systems and development paths independently chosen by the people of those countries. China stands ready to share its development experience with other countries and provide the necessary assistance in times of need, but we have no intention of exporting our development model or lecturing others. Nor do we attach any political strings to our assistance.\nChina stands for equity and justice. On the international stage, we speak for justice and oppose hegemonism and bullying. We wish to engage others in extensive consultations and joint contributions in pursuit of shared benefits. We call for handling international affairs based on the merits of each particular case, and for settling issues through consultations. As the world\u2019s largest developing country, China will always stand firmly with other developing countries in safeguarding their common interests and right to development and in increasing their representation and say in global governance so as to promote democracy in international relations.\nChina pursues mutually beneficial cooperation. In this globalized world, countries all rise or fall together. A zero-sum mentality and beggar-thy-neighbour policies are recipes for failure. China is committed to fostering an open world economy, upholding the multilateral trading regime of the World Trade Organization and making globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all. We do not seek unilateral security, nor do we put our own interests above those of others. It is our aim to advance our development as part of the development of the global community. We seek to keep the door open, expand shared interests and share opportunities with others through cooperation.\nThe world today is not a peaceful place. Unilateralism and protectionism are posing major threats to the international order. At a time when the future of the world is at stake, China has never been and will never be an onlooker. As a founding Member of the United Nations, we will work with other countries to build a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for humankind. We will be resolute in upholding the stature and role of the United Nations, the international system underpinned by the United Nations and an international order anchored on international law.\nFacing the headwinds of protectionism, we should not just stand idly by. Erecting walls will not resolve global challenges and blaming others for one\u2019s own problems does not work. The lessons of the Great Depression should not be forgotten. Tariffs, and the provocation of trade disputes that upset global industrial and supply chains, undermine the multilateral trading regime and the global economic and trade order. They may even plunge the world into recession.\nChina is committed to resolving economic and trade frictions and differences in a calm, rational and comprehensive manner, and is willing to demonstrate as much patience and goodwill as necessary. Should the other side act in bad faith or show no respect for equal status or rules in negotiations, we will have to respond as necessary to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests and uphold international justice. Let me make it very clear. China is a country with a 5,000-year-old civilization, 1.4 billion hardworking and courageous people and a vast land of 9.6 million square kilometres. We will not be cowed by threats or subdued by pressure.\nIn the face of rampant unilateralism, we should not sit on our hands. For the international order to function, we must abide by laws and rules, and acts that violate international norms can only plunge the world into chaos. The opportunities arising from the new round of scientific and technological revolution are opportunities for the world. The advances thus made should not be monopolized by any single country, and no one should obstruct the efforts of other countries in the name of innovation. It is neither legitimate nor justifiable for any country in a position of power to impose unilateral sanctions or exercise long-arm jurisdiction over other countries, as such practices have no basis in international law and are therefore devoid of legitimacy. Putting one\u2019s own interests above the common interests of all other countries is a typical bullying practice that will find no support among the people.\nThe Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty is important in upholding global strategic balance and stability. A unilateral withdrawal from it would have multiple negative effects. China is opposed to the deployment of land-based intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific. We urge the countries with the largest nuclear arsenals to fulfil their special and primary responsibilities in nuclear disarmament. China will continue to take an active part in the international arms control process. I would like to announce here that China has initiated the domestic legal procedures for joining the Arms Trade Treaty.\nThe permanent members of the Security Council should lead by example, as major countries have special responsibilities for maintaining a stable international order. We support the new round of efforts by Secretary-General Guterres to reform the United Nations system and make it more efficient and equitable. China has set up an 8,000-strong peacekeeping standby force and permanent peacekeeping police squads. They have met the standards for operation and are ready for action. China stands ready to work with other parties to fulfil our due responsibilities as a major country in upholding global peace and justice.\nIn a world fraught with challenges and mounting risks, China will remain on the side of peace and justice. We will actively explore and apply a Chinese approach to addressing hotspot issues and play a constructive role in upholding international peace and security. China stands for common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. We hold that disputes should be settled through dialogue and consultation and that common threats should be addressed through international cooperation in the interests of sustaining global peace and common security.\nThe Iranian nuclear issue affects world peace and security. All the parties involved should work together to uphold the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and ensure that this historic effort is not derailed. Given the growing tensions in the Middle East and the Gulf region, China proposes that the Iranian nuclear issue should be speedily put back on the JCPOA track, the Gulf countries urged to establish a platform for dialogue and consultation, and that countries from outside the region should play a positive role in maintaining security in the region.\nThe Palestinian issue should be at the top of the international agenda. What we lack is not a grand design but the courage to deliver on existing commitments and the conscience to uphold justice. There should be no more backsliding on the efforts to achieve a two-State solution and implement the principle of land for peace, which represent the bottom line for international justice. The establishment of an independent State is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people and should not be used as a bargaining chip.\nTurning to Afghanistan, what we hope to see is a united country where all political parties and ethnic groups can unite to determine the future of their nation, a stable country that resolutely combats terrorism and a country living in harmony with its neighbours that can become a positive force for maintaining peace and stability in the region. We will continue to do our share in contributing to Afghanistan\u2019s reconciliation and reconstruction.\nRegarding the Korean peninsula, we must not miss the opportunity for a political settlement again. The zigzag course of the past 20 years or so has shown time and again that the only realistic and viable way forward is by promoting parallel progress in denuclearization and the establishment of a peace mechanism in order to accommodate the concerns of all sides and gradually build trust through phased and synchronized actions. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea has demonstrated a readiness to promote dialogue, and it is to be hoped that the United States can meet the Democratic People\u2019s Republic halfway. In the light of the new developments on the peninsula, the Security Council should consider invoking the rollback terms of the relevant resolutions in order to foster a political settlement of the issue.\nWith China\u2019s mediation efforts, Myanmar and Bangladesh have reached a new, common understanding on accelerating the work of returning displaced persons to Myanmar. The momentum created did not come easily. Waiting without taking action produces no solutions and can lead only to a further deterioration in the humanitarian situation. Only real action will bring hope and create the conditions for reaching a final settlement of the issue of Rakhine state. All the parties involved, including United Nations agencies, should help move things forward rather than hold back the process.\nThe Kashmir dispute, a holdover from the past, should be peacefully and properly addressed in accordance with the Charter, the relevant Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements. No actions that would unilaterally change the status quo should be taken. As a neighbour of both India and Pakistan, China hopes to see the dispute effectively managed and stability restored to the relationship between the two sides.\nDevelopment is the master key to solving all problems. It should be at the centre of the global macro policy framework, with a continued focus on priority areas such as poverty reduction, infrastructure, education and public health. We need to maintain global development cooperation with North-South cooperation as the main channel, supplemented by South-South cooperation. We must build an open world economy and help developing countries better integrate into the global industrial and value chains. Member States should align their medium- and long-term development strategies with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in an effort to pursue high-quality development. China\u2019s Belt and Road initiative aims to achieve high-standard, people-centred development that is open, green and clean. The initiative, which is highly compatible with the 2030 Agenda, has become a road to cooperation, hope and prosperity, delivering real benefits to people the world over. We hope that other countries will seize the development opportunities that it creates to add fresh impetus to their implementation of the 2030 Agenda.\nThere is global consensus on the need to address climate change, and cutting emissions calls for concerted global efforts. The outcomes of the Climate Action Summit are positive. China, as a co-lead on the nature-based solutions track, has done its part to make that possible. We believe in acting in good faith. We will deliver what we have signed up to, fulfil our obligations and take concrete action to help to build a clean and beautiful world.\nChina places high importance on the life and health of its people and has always taken a zero- tolerance approach to narcotics. We have put controls on all fentanyl-related substances, a move that goes well beyond the scheduling efforts of the United Nations and demonstrates that China is actively participating in global narcotics control with a keen sense of responsibility. With regard to the Ebola outbreak in Africa, as the alarm is sounded once again,\nChina has already sent emergency aid supplies to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its neighbours affected by the epidemic. China has also sent public health experts and is maintaining a close collaboration with the World Health Organization and the African Union Commission. In addition, China will donate another $18 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\nI would like to conclude with a quote from President Xi Jinping, in which he said, \u201cOur world is full both of hope and challenges. We should not give up our dreams just because the reality around us is too complicated. We should not stop pursuing our ideals just because they seem out of our reach.\u201d\nLet us work tirelessly to promote the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and together build a community with a shared future for humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "There are principles of coexistence among human beings that are recognized as universal. Such principles are valid in both times of peace and times of conflict among States. I would like to cite some examples: respect every nation as you would have yours be respected; never tolerate abuse against anyone, while always helping those in need to the extent you can; violence breeds only violence, and its effects pass from one generation to the next; peace among countries is born from tolerance and the cultivation of common interests.\nIt is therefore worth asking the following question: if no conflict among States has ever been eternal, why not build peace as soon as possible? Those and other visions of coexistence among peoples, which apply to life among States and societies, are enshrined, in different words, in the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. They are the pillars that support the spacious General Assembly Hall that houses and shelters us today.\nThe United Nations and its multilateralism exist because those principles are effective and constitute the guidelines for a peaceful and harmonious coexistence, as well as promoting the individual interests of States and guiding their interactions with one another. The Organization is a living example that multilateralism is still a completely essential tool. It shows how cooperation can be consolidated across borders and regions, that the peaceful settlement of disputes is always on the table \u2014 an alternative to the horrors of the violence of war \u2014 and that human beings must jointly respond to the problems of our time, that is, sustainable development, climate change, the protection and conservation of nature, the building of non-discriminatory and fully inclusive societies, dialogue among cultures and differing opinions.\nUnder those principles, which are inscribed in the Charter, signed in San Francisco, the General Assembly can work for a better world and seek to develop them and their different facets, country by country, region by region, conflict by conflict. When international cooperation lapses, wars endure and injustices seem eternal, that is usually because States have lost their way or do not have the political will to correctly apply the United Nations principles.\nMore than ever, multilateralism and the United Nations system are today under considerable attack and subject to harmful criticism. We are witnessing sustained attempts to weaken international cooperation and devalue the work of the United Nations. I therefore call on all States to meet and address those urgent challenges, which are worth repeating and expanding on \u2014 climate change, sustainable development, protracted humanitarian crises, large-scale human rights abuses, widespread poverty, growing inequalities and threats to international peace and security, to name a few.\nDialogue is the foundation of the multilateral action that nourishes the United Nations and that we ourselves should continue to advocate. What drives relationships among States is one joint frame of mind when analysing problems, respect for all points of view and, above all, the subsequent formation of consensus agreements. Without dialogue and a shared spirit of democracy, we cannot understand each other; neither can we understand each other with imposed unilateralism.\nThe same can of course be said of national societies. In Ecuador we are promoting an initiative for reaching agreement, so that all members of society are able to identify areas that unite them and overcome issues on which they have differing opinions. Enough of focusing on what separates us and what sets us apart. Let us look instead at what unites us, what identifies us and what allows us to nurture a greater common well-being.\nSeeking national agreement among all the actors of our society is of course not straightforward. Indeed, agreement arises when difficulties are overcome together, when we find common ground and leave the door open to compromise and innovation when seeking solutions. If there is no agreement, that raises the question of where and what is the alternative. National agreement is the best antidote to outrage and unilateral intolerance and to disrespect for human rights; it facilitates the creation of societies that are democratic in practice and not just by design or proclamation.\nNational agreement has another name at the international level, but the same spirit. We call it multilateralism. The multilateral approach promoted by the United Nations is the best tool for societies to jointly build the better world for which we all yearn and of which we all dream, in order to face the problems that, due to their cross-cutting nature, affect us equally, such as the eradication of poverty, the quality of education, the protection of the planet and the inclusion of those who are defenceless.\nWe all live in the same neighbourhood \u2014 planet Earth \u2014 which is limited in size and resources and is contending with a constantly growing population, as well as challenges to the environment, wealth inequality and the urgent desire to achieve adequate levels of well-being and respect for human rights. It is a world where the temptation remains to impose individual visions and interests through the use of force.\nThe concerted action of States continues to be the only tool for ending those violations. We must all feel part of the global solutions needed for global problems. Climate change, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the pollution of oceans, the erosion of human rights, restrictions on world trade and the marginal importance of fair trade are issues that we all face and cannot be adequately resolved without the contribution and political will of all countries.\nDisarmament, in particular nuclear disarmament and the future prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, is a goal for coexistence, especially in regions of ongoing or latent conflict. When we focus on current conflicts and conflict zones, there is one unchanging common denominator: the risk of the use of weapons of mass destruction. Ecuador therefore deposited its ratification of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, not, of course, because our country can, or even wants to, possess such arms, but because it is clear that the uncontrolled possession of that type of weaponry can result in deliberate or accidental use. If that were to occur, the brutal effects would not be restricted to those waging an atomic war but would affect the entire world. We would all be the victims of radioactive contamination for centuries. We and our descendants would be exposed to harmful agents that cause catastrophic disease and genetic deformities.\nGlobal problems affect and hurt us all. Even if some do not impact us immediately, the fact of belonging to the human race means that we are implicated. Let us share empathy with victims and think about the suffering of those societies facing such issues directly. Terence said it well, and his wisdom persists, \u201cNothing that is human is alien to me\u201d. Dialogue, multilateral action and national agreement in Ecuador have not just appeared out of thin air. A nation\u2019s backdrop defines its actions and those of its social actors, which, to use a sporting term, delimits the playing field. I am talking about people\u2019s fundamental rights, which appear in the Constitution of Ecuador, the universal Charter of the United Nations and the international treaties that protect political, economic, social and cultural guarantees, including rights in relation to the natural world. Indeed, one year ago, Ecuador became only the fifth country in the world to ratify the 18 United Nations conventions on the protection of human rights. If there is one thing that I hope my Government will be remembered for, it is its deep conviction and work for the protection, promotion, respect and effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nReinstating democratic institutions in Ecuador, respecting the opinions of the people and the media, safeguarding the actions of opposing politicians and civil organizations and eliminating bureaucratic entities that were once designed to expand State power at the expense of civil society are all issues that are being addressed by my Government and are in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular Goals 4, 5 and 16 \u2014 relating to inclusive, equitable and quality education; gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls; and the promotion of fair, peaceful and inclusive societies.\nThat is of course no simple task. It takes a lot of work to overcome a culture of fear, break with institutional and legal ties and stand for freedom of opinion and expression. However, with determination and perseverance, we managed to dismantle a State of propaganda, overrule a gag law on journalists, eliminate an institution trying to silence the press and remove an intelligence service that, instead of protecting our collective interests, was devoted to recording the private conversations of Ecuadorians, snooping in the lives of opposition politicians and hacking electronic communications and other people\u2019s databases. We succeeded in that task, and I feel great pride at having let the fresh air of democracy into a closed establishment of intolerance, abuse and the vain quest for power for power\u2019s sake.\nHere are the reliable facts. Last year the Special Rapporteurs on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression of the United Nations and the Organization of American States visited Ecuador, together with the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples and the Special Rapporteur on the right to physical and mental health. Ecuador has returned to participating in inter-American human rights forums, and we signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. That does not constitute just another signature; it is in line with our resolute action taken to become the first country in our region to sign the Convention that protects one of the most vulnerable and defenceless groups of our society, our children.\nAnother vulnerable group is migrants. We have already welcomed almost 500,000 Venezuelan brothers and sisters, the victims of the worst exodus on our continent. It is the task of the United Nations to seek a definitive solution to the crisis in Venezuela. Our Venezuelan brothers and sisters tell us on a daily basis that there is no food, health care or medicine and that education is suffering. They are leaving their land out of despair at seeing one another die before the half-hearted and distant gaze of the world. None of them are abandoning their beloved land, relatives and friends willingly; they are doing it because they are being forced out by a diaspora initiated by a high-handed Government lacking any humanity.\nDespite its lack of resources, Ecuador accommodated all who arrived on our territory until last month. Today, in this venue of world democracy, I call on Members to sit down and talk with the victims of the conflict to help them escape a catastrophe caused by an irresponsible and de facto Government. For its part, Ecuador will host the session of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in November, something that would have been unthinkable only two years ago. In the same month, we will also host the Global Forum on Migration and Development, of which my country currently holds the chairmanship.\nAs I mentioned, Ecuador continues to multiply its progressive efforts in the fields of human, economic, social and cultural rights. While doing as much as possible within the usual budgetary limitations, through our Toda Una Vida development plan and Las Manuelas mission, we are effectively implementing comprehensive programmes that protect all human beings, from the very moment of conception until God decides to close our eyes and the Creator calls us to his side. While civil and political rights are being implemented without delay, economic, social and cultural rights, as recognized by international treaties, are being implemented gradually. Nevertheless, they have a special significance for developing nations; their relevance and the work of promoting them is crucial for most of the world. Such rights must also rise above political and ideological positions, given that they appeal to universal values.\nProtecting the planet, our greater home, is imperative. In Ecuador we have already implemented an energy efficiency law. A circular economy pact was signed with the manufacturing sector to create a modern plastics economy. We have also eliminated taxes on the import of electric vehicles, and we have established preferential credits for sustainable mobility, while using renewable energy for public transport.\nAt the beginning of this month, at the presidential summit for the countries of the Amazon, I said that we should take a leap forward in the areas of evolution, development and progress. That is a concept that has become selfish, consumerist and predatory. We still cherish the hope that in the face of those negative trends affecting human coexistence, there are also signs of solidarity, brotherhood and mutual respect. Let us try to strengthen those virtues among nations.\nThe international community must systematically intensify its actions aimed at cultivating solidarity; preserving fraternal ties and good neighbourliness; and respecting not only the environment, but also diverse cultures, countries on the other side of oceans and victims of conflict. Such conflicts are caused by both man and natural disasters, which are increasingly destructive, due to the harmful effects of global warming. The only way that cooperation and solidarity among nations can shape international life is, to put it simply, for us to put those concepts into practice, while of course continuing to pursue concrete efforts that emphasize, as I previously said, what unites us and what we have in common, not what separates us.\nEconomic, social and cultural human rights should become pillars of the management systems of authorities. We dream and hope that one day we will measure development based on the number of disabled people who have been fully included, the absence of gender-based violence and what values and principles are taught in the classroom, the press, on the streets and at the polls. It is up to us and our conviction to be able to stop seeing the ethical values of civilization as utopian and unattainable goals that are simply paradigms, but instead as aspirations of where to arrive, where to start and, fundamentally, of how to behave.\n"

        "file_text": "In Germany, there was once a mayor of Cologne \u2014 at 41, he was a young leader for his times \u2014 who held the view that peace in Europe depended on the relations between Germany and France. He said that could be achieved only by developing strong economic and political ties that would unite the interests of both nations. Today that proposition would surprise no one, but what is different about it was that Konrad Adenauer, that young mayor, was advocating it from his mayor\u2019s office about 100 years ago, in the 1920s, as he sought better relations between the countries of the Rhine basin. The idea did not prosper at the time, much less with the outbreak of the Second World War, which led to the events we are all familiar with that resulted in the promulgation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the creation of this formidable Organization that is the United Nations, where I have the honour to speak today.\nSimilarly, in 1960 some other visionary leaders in Central America began the process of creating the Central American Common Market, the oldest integration effort on the continent, which helped to jointly drive the development of Central America with a view to improving its inhabitants\u2019 living conditions.\nThe leaders who preceded me in Costa Rica were also ahead of their times. As early as the second half of the nineteenth century we announced that education for children would be free and compulsory, and in 1941 we established the foundations of a universal social-security system. Seventy years ago we abolished our army and declared that we would be at peace with the world forever. At the time, it was said that it would be impossible for a country to survive without an army, and yet here I am, 70 years later, proof to the contrary.\nIn 1981 we opened the University for Peace to the world. All of that was possible only in a multilateral world that fights for peace, international law and human rights. Our continent\u2019s ideas also showed themselves ahead of their times with the adoption of the American Convention on Human Rights, known as the San Jose Pact, and with the creation of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.\nWould it have been possible to advance the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the creation of the United Nations, the implementation of the Marshall Plan, the Alliance for Progress, decolonization or the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as proactive steps towards building a better world? Or was it inevitable that they were responses, aimed at preventing new wars and other global threats? Might it have been possible to avoid so much pain and loss?\nIdeas can be ahead of their time. Rather than waiting, we should take the initiative to mobilize joint projects for peace and progress for humankind as a road to building a better shared future for all through multilateralism. The freedom of the human spirit compels us to act. We should not be condemned merely to be reactive to potential painful events that might occur or that we know could occur in the future. It is our responsibility today to anticipate the direction that history will take and to take advantage of opportunities, without allowing a new economic, environmental or conflict crisis to be the new lever that compels us to adopt the necessary changes.\nContemporary thinkers such as Rob Riemen, Yuval Noah Harari, Joseph Stiglitz and others agree that today we are seeing parallels with the world of the 1930s. Despair, frustration, resentment and the lack of a sense of belonging create a breeding ground for regimes that trample on people\u2019s rights and wage war in the name of perverse and spurious ideals. In an era of profound transformation that is forcing us to rethink the very foundations of our social contract, a simplistic discourse of \u201cisms\u201d is echoing around and penetrating societies from within, gathering popular support in democratic and legal systems, and within our democracies we have been unable to provide similarly agile and concrete responses to inequality and a lack of opportunity.\nWe must also anticipate history with strength and courage, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the past. In our discussions over the past few days during the Climate Action Summit, we have discussed the urgent implementation of global mechanisms to address our current challenges, and we have analysed the positive results we have had where we have been able to implement innovative ideas.\nBased on its history, Costa Rica supports multilateralism as a tool to confront common threats and build a joint future for our planet. Advocating for multilateral solutions to common global causes does not mean that we must agree on each and every detail. We must do it while respecting each other\u2019s differences, with dialogue and an understanding that our shared objective transcends individual differences. We are capable of agreeing on coordinating our actions and contributions for the common cause, as was achieved in the founding Charter of the United Nations, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nNo home is more shared than the planet we inhabit and no cause is more global than the fight against the climate crisis. No one can escape its effects and no contribution is too small, because only the sum of the actions of all countries and all people will enable us to address it. We are honoured that the international community has entrusted Costa Rica with organizing the preparatory meeting for the twenty-fifth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which we are hosting between 8 and 10 October, in preparation for the twenty-fifth Conference of the Parties, to be held in December by our brother country Chile. Our commitments must be clear, concrete and forceful.\nIn February, in our resolve to do our part, we launched a national decarbonization plan for Costa Rica to achieve a modern, green, digital, resilient and inclusive economy free from the use of fossil fuels by 2050, in line with our ambitious environmental goals, taking the disruptive approach that has been characteristic of our country. In the same way that we have shown that it is possible to achieve 99 per cent clean and renewable electricity and to reverse deforestation processes, going from 20 per cent forest cover in the 1980s to what is now more than 50 per cent, we are working towards the goals of decarbonization, biodiversity conservation and the implementation of nature-based solutions. That is what the young people and many others who have been demonstrating on a weekly basis in so many countries are demanding.\nThe effects of the climate crisis, inequality, poverty and, in many cases, violence drive migratory flows of millions of people around the world that represent a challenge for the international community. From the point of view of human rights, we must provide united and sophisticated responses. Central American migration could be eliminated by bringing economic and social development to our countries\u2019 rural areas, which is where most migrant populations come from. The best investment in migration is to establish good, fair and well-paid international markets for the agricultural and pastoral products produced in rural Central America and thereby improve well-being in those areas. That could be done through the combined efforts of many countries and partners by means of good, fair market prices, technology, added value and cooperation. That is the best and most humane solution to the tragedy of economic migration.\nAn African proverb says that when two elephants fight it is the grass that suffers \u2014 or these days we could say we all suffer. Humankind has already endured an era of bipolarity, and we know what the legacy of that was. The turbulence affecting the global economy today is hampering economic growth, especially in the most vulnerable countries, as the employment and entrepreneurship opportunities linked to production disappear. In addition to its economic impact, that puts pressure on democratic institutions. Democracies are affected by restrictive environments and austerity regimes that are designed to maintain macroeconomic balances but also limit plans for reducing inequalities and concentrated wealth. Less spending on weapons and accumulation and more investment in fighting poverty, inequality and climate change is the smartest thing that the world can do today. Let us once more get ahead of history in that regard.\nThe information society and digitization have created an additional area of pressure. Participating in the fourth industrial revolution is not optional. We are being forced to rethink the future of work, the conceptualization of learning and the sustainability of employment-based social protection institutions, as the International Labour Organization and its Global Commission on the Future of Work have begun to do. The world must not let its cohesion weaken. We must bridge the gap between the excluded and the included of the world. Managing technological change to advance decent work and close technological and gender gaps will be key to getting ahead of history and preserving the democratic and social fabric.\nThe establishment of a global initiative for digital inclusion and literacy, as well as inclusion itself, would be the smartest thing we could do for humankind. We should not be erecting more barriers because of our differences but rather reaping an abundance of human enrichment and understanding through our marvellous diversity. As in any natural ecosystem, human diversity enables us to complement one other and makes us stronger, and our cohesion lies in the respect, understanding and empathy we have for one another. We, the States that make up this Organization, have the tools to do that, and young people are demanding it.\nDemocracy, peace, the defence of international law, human rights and international humanitarian law are all facing challenges. In Nicaragua, there is a clear need to restore social peace. Costa Rica has denounced the violence, the disrespect and the ongoing, constant, State-sponsored violations of human rights suffered by those who oppose the Government, which have drastically increased the number of refugees that we receive from that country. National dialogue and an inclusive, transparent and internationally supervised electoral process are crucial.\nAs a global community, we must seek a peaceful and expeditious settlement to the situation of grave political, humanitarian and human rights violations into which the ruling regime has plunged our brother people of Venezuela. The human rights violations are confirmed in the latest report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights situation in Venezuela (A/HRC/41/18). We must also put an end to the economic blockade of Cuba, whose adverse effects are inflicted on its population, and concert real efforts to deal with the political and social crisis in Haiti. In all those cases, let us get ahead of history.\nStrengthening inclusion, especially with regard to gender equality, women\u2019s economic and political empowerment and the fight against all forms of discrimination, with an emphasis on those based on race, religion or sexual orientation, is vital to ensuring respect for human rights and sustainable development. Costa Rica is committed to advancing the rights of people of African descent who face clear conditions of disadvantage. In October we are hosting a high-level meeting on accelerating global action for ensuring the rights of people of African descent. Epsy Campbell Barr, the Vice-President of Costa Rica, who is the continent\u2019s first woman of African descent to occupy that post, will assume that responsibility on behalf of my Government.\nMore than ever in today\u2019s world we need people and leaders who are courageous in both heart and mind, and our responses must strengthen our welfare and peace institutions, support a free press, promote truthful information, protect the security of people\u2019s private information, devise ethical algorithms and protocols and, above all, improve the lives of all people, hopefully lifting their spirits. The hands engraved almost 50,000 years ago in cave paintings, whether in the Sulawesi caves in Indonesia or in the El Castillo cave in Cantabria in Spain, illustrate our shared path as human beings. They are the same hands of the same species. The Egyptian and Mayan pyramids and the stone spheres of the Diquis in my country are examples of the civilizations that we have built and that taken together are the legacies of a single humankind.\nOur mission as leaders today is to get ahead of history and to learn from it so as not to end up like Sisyphus. Getting ahead of history means having courageous and innovative proposals so that when the day comes, we can together overcome the challenges that threaten our planet and one day fulfil intimate dreams such as those of the Costa Rican poet Jorge Debravo, when he wrote, \u201cI ask for tenderness, dinner, silence, bread, home ...\u201d, or the big shared dreams that unite us, such as in the poem by the great American writer Ray Bradbury in which he wrote, \u201cI work for that Short man, Large dream I send my rockets forth between my ears Hoping an inch of Good is worth a pound of years Aching to hear a voice cry back along the universal mall: We\u2019ve reached Alpha Centauri! We\u2019re tall, O God, we\u2019re tall!\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "What a happy coincidence it is to follow, at this rostrum, President Joao Louren\u00e7o from the brotherly country of Angola, 20 years after the referendum that opened the door to the independence of Timor-Leste. That confirmed the strength of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, which is taking steps towards greater internal mobility.\nI would ask you, Sir, to convey our congratulations to President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election, which symbolizes the presence of the African continent to which we are bound by ties of affection, deep friendship and respect. I would also like to thank his predecessor, Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her always tireless and warm-hearted performance of her duties.\nPortugal welcomes and reaffirms its support for all the priorities that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has pursued in his coherent, dynamic and resolute mandate, including by defending effective multilateralism, based on international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and its legal extension to new global realities, such as the oceans, combating terrorism and artificial intelligence.\nWe also support his reform of the United Nations system in the areas of conflict prevention; development cooperation; peacekeeping; human rights, in particular those of children, young people and women; migration and refugees; and, as always, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at all levels. Yesterday\u2019s successful Climate Action Summit is an example of such work, as well as the Sustainable Development Goals Summit, the Ocean Conference, the digital cooperation initiative and the Plan of Action to Safeguard Religious Sites.\nWe recall the creation \u2014 100 years ago \u2014 of the League of Nations, an initiative of United States President Woodrow Wilson, who signed its establishing treaty but saw an isolationist Congress reject its ratification upon his return home. The United States of America, which had been the starting point of what might have been a new international order, shunned the new organization and never became a permanent member of its deliberative body. For ideological reasons, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics did not wish to join the founders of the League of Nations either and went on to join too late.\nWithout the United States and, for a long time, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the League of Nations \u2014 itself conceived for a waning imperial and colonial world \u2014 never recovered from the lack of commitment of one of the world Powers and the late entry of another, which coincided with the growth of ever more hypernationalist, isolationist and unilateralist leadership. It was a failed attempt to embrace multilateralism.\nThe Second World War began exactly 80 years ago. What had appeared in 1919 to be a promise, however precarious, had become a hecatomb by 1939. Notwithstanding the differences in time frame and style, it is worth stopping and reflecting for a moment on the lessons of that still recent past now that we are entering the seventy-fifth year of existence of the United Nations.\nWe believe that it is worth fighting for stronger international laws to help steer relations among States and peoples; for international organizations to help solve problems that affect everyone, not just a few; for a political and not merely a technical role for those organizations; and for a multilateral vision that is shared by all, including those deemed most powerful, because nobody is an island and nobody, alone or with a few allies, can address the increasingly complex problems that affect us all.\nIt is important to bear in mind the lessons that history has taught us and not to mistake transitory power or leadership for eternity. Over the last 40 to 50 years we have seen many changes. The world used to have two super Powers and now has one \u2014 an absolute super Power, meaning that multilateralism is now even more important. The world has indeed changed a great deal.\nIt is all the more essential that we use dialogue to prevent conflict and agree initiatives in areas of common interest. We must resist the temptation to fixate on our own power, our upcoming elections and the immediate demands of difficult times or of rapid change, which may lead us to ignore, fail to accept and reject others and pretend that the rest of the world does not exist and can only exist if it resembles us.\nIn line with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 guidance, Portugal calls for multilateralism, investment in international organizations, the alignment of the 2030 Agenda, the payment on time and in full of assessed contributions and United Nations reform of its management, development system and peace and security architecture. We continue to believe that it is important to alter the composition of the Security Council to include the membership of one or more countries from Africa and of Brazil and India at the very least.\nWe also advocate for participation in peacekeeping operations; the adoption of a resolution on a moratorium on the death penalty; engagement in the twenty-fifth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Chile; the conclusion of the treaty on marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction; and the implementation of the Paris Agreement.\nAt the same time, Portugal is proud of its participation in eight peacekeeping operations, six of them in Africa. We are also involved in European Union training and capacity-building missions in Africa, especially in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic, where Portugal has a quick reaction force that is truly essential for the protection of civilians.\nWe are also proud to be organizing, together with Kenya, the United Nations Ocean Conference, which is to be held in Lisbon in June 2020 in synergy with the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. We take pride in the launch of the national road map for carbon neutrality 2050, an instrument for economic competitiveness, employment, wealth and social justice.\nWe recall the success of the World Conference of Ministers Responsible for Youth and Youth Forum Lisbon+21 and, in that regard, we presented the traditional draft resolution on policies and programmes involving youth (E/CN.5/2019/L.3). We also draw attention to the measures we have adopted for the promotion of women\u2019s rights in the 40 years since the adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and in the 25 years since the adoption of the Beijing Platform for Action.\nWe not only support the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and the global compact on refugees, but we have also approved a national implementation plan on the issue. Ever since our nation was founded nine centuries ago, we have been a country of migrants and there are millions of Portuguese citizens scattered around the world.\nWe combat xenophobia and intolerance and view education as a priority, as shown by the global support platform for Syrian students, an initiative of President Jorge Sampaio. Moreover, we advocate for inclusive and sustainable development in migrants\u2019 and refugees\u2019 countries of origin in order to prevent and eradicate terrorism, radicalization and human trafficking, while also safeguarding peace and the rights of peoples and communities.\nThis autumn we have seen global and regional indicators that point in opposite directions, some of them troubling and others \u2014 regrettably fewer in number \u2014 favourable and even promising. In the international arena, we are seeing the emergence of a trade, economic, financial and currency war, an open arms race, a cyberpresence used as a fairly common means of external intervention, and disinvestment in international law and international organizations. Examples of the most acute situations in the world include Yemen and Libya and, despite the steps taken to resolve the situation, Syria, as well as the Sahel, where the situation is increasingly critical.\nWe advocate progress in maternal and child health and the agreement between the European Union and MERCOSUR, which we hope will go hand in hand with a shared sensitivity to environmental challenges. We also have fresh hope for the Republic of North Macedonia and hope the window of opportunity regarding the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will remain open. In addition, we support a stable transition in the Democratic Republic of Congo and further promising developments in Eastern Africa.\nEqually important is the vision for a closer cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union and between the European Union and the African Union. Portugal, which was directly involved in the first Europe-Africa summits, is willing to organize the next meeting of the European Union and African Union leaders during its upcoming presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2021.\nIn short, we have positive hopes for the future. We must stay on this path, which will enable us to not only harness multilateralism but also practice patriotism in our own countries. To be a patriot is to be proud of the past, one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history, while also understanding the world as it is and that others are also entitled to be proud of their countries. If we no longer act as islands then dialogue and a common patriotic spirit will be able to govern the world.\nAfter 75 years we continue to believe in the United Nations. Only those who disregard history and therefore do not mind repeating the mistakes of the past minimize the role of the United Nations. In this Hall, fortunately we are all patriots, because we love our motherlands, our roots and our history and only want the best for our present and future. The best does not mean ignoring the world we live in; we all depend on so many others. We, as patriots, know that we need more and not less United Nations. One hundred years after its founding, let us not repeat the same mistakes of the League of Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "As Africa\u2019s candidate for the position of President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande was elected on 4 June (see A/73/ PV.87), and it gives me great pleasure to extend my heartfelt and brotherly congratulations, as well as those of my delegation. He has held high office in his country, Nigeria, and has a perfect knowledge of the United Nations. I wish him every success and assure him of Burkina Faso\u2019s full support as he fulfils his mandate.\nHistory will remember the outgoing President, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, as the fourth woman \u2014 the second in half a century \u2014 to be elected President of the General Assembly in the seventy-four years that our Organization has existed. In view of the outstanding work she did and the results she achieved, I wish to congratulate her on having undertaken the major challenges related to the theme of the seventy- third session.\nAllow me to reaffirm the gratitude and appreciation of the people of Burkina Faso to the Secretary-General for his personal commitment and support, as well as that of the United Nations system, to my country in difficult times. This is an opportunity to renew my encouragement for the courageous implementation of the reforms undertaken and to congratulate him on his report presented to the Security Council on 24 July on the activities of the United Nations Office for West Africa and the Sahel (S/2019/549). The statement made by the President of the Security Council during that briefing bodes well for the future (see S/PV.8585).\nThis year\u2019s seventy-fourth session is being held under the theme \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d. Burkina Faso welcomes the choice of theme, its relevance and its timeliness because, now more than ever, multilateralism remains the only way for my country to find solutions to the major problems faced by the world. Those challenges must include the fight against terrorism and violent extremism, organized crime and cybercrime, which no country, no matter how powerful, can vanquish alone.\nIn view of all the achievements made by the United Nations in the areas of peacekeeping, security, justice, human rights, development and the fight against climate change, with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, it is imperative that we work to strengthen multilateralism and the role of the United Nations as a means of achieving common solutions to our planet\u2019s problems.\nTerrorism and poverty are the most devastating phenomena that our world faces today. Since January 2016, our country has been confronted with persistent and unprecedented terrorist attacks, with far-reaching human, social and economic consequences. The escalation of violence and insecurity has led to a major humanitarian crisis, resulting in numerous casualties among civilians and defence and security forces alike; hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons; schools and health facilities shut down; and State symbols destroyed. Destabilization continues through the instrumentalization of latent problems between communities that develop into violent clashes. In terms of public finances, we can see an increase in security spending at the expense of funding for development and social sectors.\nI would like to take this opportunity to welcome the support of the United Nations in the face of the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso\u2019s eligibility for the Peacebuilding Fund, as announced by the Secretary- General, has made it possible \u2014 following an inter-agency mission led by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for West Africa and the Sahel and an emergency task force under the leadership of the Assistant Secretary-General \u2014 to open one of the five United Nations regional centres outside the capital, so as to be closer to the population in these difficult times.\nTo ensure that support from international partners is well coordinated and aligned with an agreed comprehensive and integrated strategy that links prevention, emergency aid, rehabilitation and development, the Government requested an assessment mission regarding prevention and peacebuilding to be conducted by the African Development Bank, the European Union and the World Bank. The assessment took place from 1 to 10 July and its recommendations are being implemented.\nEliminating poverty is the first of the Sustainable Development Goals because, according to the United Nations, millions of people are living below the poverty line. If that trend is not reversed, more than 168 million children will be living in extreme poverty. More than ever, the international community must intensify its efforts in the fight to eradicate poverty, which is a sine qua non for sustainable and inclusive development. The fight will have an impact only if we effectively coordinate multifaceted actions within the framework of the third United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty 2018-2027 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe security situation in the area covered by the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel) remains a source of concern. Beyond Burkina Faso, and in my capacity as current Chair of the G-5 Sahel, I would like to remind the international community of the importance of supporting the G-5 Sahel countries in their determined fight against terrorism and to foster development. The activity of armed terrorist groups is expanding geographically, both within our countries and outside the G-5 Sahel area, which clearly demonstrates the urgent need to take appropriate measures and initiatives. In that regard, the Accra initiative and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) extraordinary summit on terrorism, held on 14 September, should be commended. Those initiatives serve to indicate clearly that terrorism needs to be fought at the regional level.\nAt this stage, I am delighted that the appeal of the G-5 Sahel, with the staunch support of the Secretary- General, was received favourably by the Security Council with the adoption of resolution 2480 (2019), to renew the mandate of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). Through that resolution, MINUSMA will provide support to all battalions operating under the Joint Force of the G-5 Sahel, on the condition that the G-5 Sahel or other partners will assume responsibility for the delivery of aid to operations beyond Malian territory.\nAt the ECOWAS extraordinary summit on terrorism in Ouagadougou, Heads of State noted the ineffectiveness of MINUSMA in dealing with terrorism in Mali because of the limits of the mandate conferred upon it by the Security Council. It would seem inconceivable that, with 12,000 men and substantial resources, the Join Force is unable to contribute effectively to the fight against terrorism in the country. That is why, alongside my ECOWAS peers and in my capacity as current Chair of the G-5 Sahel, I call for a more robust and more offensive mandate for MINUSMA. Such a mandate would make it possible to secure and stabilize Mali and all other countries of the G-5 Sahel. Likewise, we call on the Security Council to confer a mandate under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to the Joint Force of the G-5 Sahel in order to provide it with perennial resources.\nAt the Group of Seven Summit in Biarritz, we proposed, along with Germany and France, the establishment of an international partnership for stability and security in the Sahel that includes addressing the issues of terrorism and the need for development. I would like to call upon all partners to join that initiative unreservedly, as peace and stability in the Sahel also mean peace and stability in Africa and the rest of the world.\nI would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the gratitude of the Governments and the peoples of my country as well as the countries of the G-5 Sahel to the entire United Nations system and all our partners for their support and guidance ever since the beginning of the security and humanitarian crisis. I reiterate my appeal for bilateral and international solidarity to provide the Joint Force of the G-5 Sahel with the predictable and sustainable equipment and financial resources necessary for its proper functioning in order to promote our national and regional development programmes through the Priority Investment Programme. The two pillars \u2014 security and development \u2014 are necessary to guarantee the stability of the region. In the same vein, the countries of the G-5 Sahel adopted, on 13 September, the Desert to Power initiative, together with the African Development Bank, which aims to harness solar energy and provide electricity to more than 60 million people by 2030, as well as to create jobs and provide access to water, agriculture, education and health care.\nDespite the prevailing situation in my country, my Government is continuing to implement its development programme in order to meet the basic needs of our people, strengthen democracy and consolidate the rule of law. Bolstering economic recovery, fighting unemployment, empowering women and youth, creating initiatives for vulnerable people and promoting good governance are at the core of our efforts. Moreover, in the context of the fight against social inequality, as well as to ensure the harmonious development of the entire country, Burkina Faso has implemented two instruments to reduce regional disparities and to galvanize local economies through a local economic development support programme and the Emergency Programme for the Sahel, which has now been extended to the five regions affected by violent extremism.\nIn terms of democratic governance, I invited the majority party and the opposition to partake in a political dialogue from 15 to 22 July. The dialogue was positive and has allowed us to make progress that should be consolidated by the adoption of relevant regulatory and legislative texts.\nTurning to the fight against climate change, I would first of all like to applaud yesterday\u2019s Climate Action Summit, the format of which made it possible to put forward concrete proposals. I would also like to commend the success of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification held in India just a few days ago, and to recall the clear link between desertification and climate change. The countries of the Sahel understand that well, having created the Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel in 1973.\nClimate change is causing population displacement in Burkina Faso and exacerbating conflicts between herders and farmers due to water shortages and the scarcity of arable and grazing land. That is why, in the context of preventing and combating the impacts of climate change, my Government has taken important initiatives, including a five-year reforestation plan, a law to reduce the effects of disasters and humanitarian crises and a national plan for risk reduction and emergency preparedness for the period 2016 to 2020.\nDespite the difficult security situation, Burkina Faso has continued to fulfil its international obligations by supporting fraternal nations restore peace through United Nations missions. For example, as one of the major troop contributors to peacekeeping missions, Burkina Faso is present in both Mali and Darfur. In Guinea-Bissau, our troops are involved in the ECOWAS Mission in Guinea-Bissau, which has contributed to providing a certain level of stability to that friendly country, allowing a President of the Republic to finish their term for the first time. We are also undertaking to increase women\u2019s contribution as part of gender mainstreaming efforts in United Nations peacekeeping operations.\nAs we meet today, the international news is marked by tensions and threats to international peace and security. If we are all present at each new session of the General Assembly, it is because we believe in the capacity of the United Nations \u2014 a symbol par excellence of multilateralism and diplomacy \u2014 to find lasting solutions to the major challenges and various crises that affect us in many parts of the world.\nI would like to recall that the ongoing security crisis in the G-5 Sahel space is a direct result of the destruction of the Libyan State. I urge the international community to mobilize in order to find a solution for lasting peace in that country, because resolving the security crisis in our countries is heavily dependent upon peace in Libya. In that connection, Burkina Faso welcomes United Nations mediation and strongly recommends the involvement of the African Union in the hope that such joint efforts will lead to the resolution of the Libyan crisis. In keeping with the shared views of the G-5 Sahel and the outcome of the ECOWAS extraordinary summit in Ouagadougou, I call on the Security Council to appoint a joint United Nations-African Union special envoy with a profound understanding of the situation in Libya.\nOn the question of Western Sahara, Burkina Faso reiterates its support for the political process under way, conducted under the exclusive auspices of the Secretary-General with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable and negotiated political solution to the dispute, as has been recommended by the Council since 2007, including in resolution 2468 (2019), adopted in April. Burkina Faso also welcomes the holding of two round tables among Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania and the Polisario Front, in accordance with Security Council resolutions 2414 (2018) and 2440 (2018). I would like to take this opportunity to commend the work carried out by the former Special Envoy of the Secretary- General of the United Nations during his tenure. Given the regional dimension of the dispute, Burkina Faso calls on all States in the region to contribute to the political process and step up their participation in the negotiation process.\nIn the Middle East, the question of Palestinian remains a major concern in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Burkina Faso reiterates its support for the two-State solution, with Israel and Palestine living in peace and good-neighbourliness.\nBurkina Faso strongly condemns the repeated attacks against Saudi Arabia and its oil facilities. Whatever their origin, these attacks constitute serious threats to peace in Saudi Arabia and the region as a whole. We therefore firmly call for these acts of hostility to end.\nWith regard to the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed on Cuba by the United States of America, Burkina Faso believes that it should be lifted, in the light of the great prejudices the Cuban people have suffered for many years.\nInternational peace and security are under threat from the arms race. That is why Burkina Faso supports all multilateral initiatives and actions aimed at achieving disarmament on both weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons. Today there is ever-more evidence that the proliferation of small arms and light weapons poses a threat to international peace and security in various parts of the world, especially West Africa and the Sahel, and hinders the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. I urge States to allocate the resources freed up by disarmament to financing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), official development assistance and the Green Climate Fund. In so doing, we can offer better prospects to millions of disadvantaged people.\nYesterday we held the Climate Action Summit and the High-Level Meeting on Universal Health Coverage, and in the coming days we will hold high-level meetings on sustainable development and Financing for Development. We express our hope that all these initiatives will help generate political momentum and support at all levels to strengthen engagement with the private sector in order to leverage innovative solutions for financing the SDGs.\nIn this regard, we commend the Secretary-General\u2019s launch yesterday, 23 September, of the Global Investors for Sustainable Development Alliance. This group, which will comprise 25 to 30 chief executive officers of major companies from around the world, is intended to leverage their know-how to boost long-term investment in sustainable development; as such, it is a beacon of hope at a moment when funding is ever scarcer.\nBurkina Faso, like all countries, is keenly following the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform, as well as issues relating to the revitalization of the General Assembly and partnerships with the regional and subregional organizations. Regarding the reform, as we prepare to mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of our Organization under the theme \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: Reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism\u201d, Burkina Faso continues to hope that the negotiations, launched more than 20 years ago, will deliver the reform we all so wish to see \u2014 reform that makes the Security Council more representative of the 193 States Members of the United Nations across both categories of membership and with all corresponding privileges and obligations. I take this opportunity to reaffirm Burkina Faso\u2019s full adherence to the common African position as reflected in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. In marking 24 April 2019 as the first International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, the United Nations reaffirmed the importance of multilateralism and showed that it is together that we can tackle and overcome the global challenges of the modern world.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin by congratulating Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I also thank Mrs. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her efforts during the previous session.\nPoverty eradication, quality education, climate change and inclusion are all issues that will be discussed this year. They are at the core of the goals we adopted four years ago and are interconnected, with a direct impact on sustainable development for individuals and societies. Despite the achievements that have been made in the area of poverty eradication, as illustrated in various reports of the Organization and its specialized agencies, much remains to be done, particularly in low-income countries, in order to ensure their ability to respond to those challenges and meet the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe annual general debate in the Assembly is a good opportunity to assess the current situation. Is today\u2019s world better than it was during the previous session? Are we living in a safer and fairer world? What kind of world will we leave to our children? What must we do to end the ongoing assault on nature? All of those questions require that we focus on the meaning of our presence here and remind ourselves of the fundamental principles on which the United Nations is based and through which it seeks a world based on unity and solidarity.\nAlgeria wants to emphasize its commitment to building a world of peaceful coexistence, particularly in our neighbourhood and region. We are committed to a world in which multilateralism is the best and preferred way forward and the United Nations is a source of inspiration and a driving force for a world that is better and safer and that demonstrates greater solidarity and respect for nature.\nHumankind has achieved an unprecedented level of economic development, prosperity and technological development. But that is merely a question of statistics \u2014 the reality is that millions of people are living in poverty, which is a source of concern and resentment. Of the more than 740 million people living on less than $2 per day, many are concentrated in rural areas, which raises the issue of balanced development. The fight against poverty is not limited to charitable institutions. It is a matter of social justice and peace and stability for all.\nSustainable development makes it possible to respond to current needs without diminishing the resources or capacities of future generations. It relies on rational economies, good governance and partnerships that take the protection of the environment into account. Development can be sustainable if policies are aligned with efforts to safeguard the planet and address climate change, which continues to have a large impact on our ecosystems and biodiversity and causes increasingly severe natural disasters.\nAfrica \u2014 particularly the Sahel-Sahara region, to which my country belongs \u2014 is one of the continents that has been most deeply affected by these phenomena, particularly through accelerated desertification and drought. Although it emits the lowest proportion per continent of greenhouse gases in the world, Africa remains among the least prepared to confront the negative effects of climate change. It is the responsibility of industrialized countries to settle their climate debt by providing adequate financial and technical assistance adapted to the needs of the least polluting countries in order to eliminate the environmental disparities between developed and developing countries.\nAchieving the goals set by the international community will depend on the degree to which each country fulfils its responsibilities, taking into account its capacities. Today we must promote the principle of multilateralism and protect it from attempts to weaken it, including those that result from misguided policies. Sustainable development at the international level can be achieved only in the context of a sustainable form of multilateralism that is based on justice, equity and finding the balance that best serves the interests of both developed and developing countries.\nThe challenges of a multilateral world are inextricably linked to the issue of United Nations reform. Reform is of great importance because the Organization\u2019s mechanisms were born from post- Second World War power balances that no longer effectively correspond either to the current composition of the international community or to the challenges facing our world today. For this reason, modernizing the mechanisms and revitalizing the activities of our Organization should be undertaken without further delay, especially in the light of challenges that have direct implications for international peace and security. The double standards and impunity that we have witnessed in past decades have had a profound impact on the moral authority of the multilateral system and the level of respect for the United Nations flag wherever it is raised. That is why we need legitimate and urgent reform of our Organization and reimagined governance. Any acceptable reform will have to recognize the fundamental role played by the General Assembly and promote greater democratization in the composition of the Security Council.\nThe African Union framework for the reform of the Security Council is worthy of consideration. Algeria stands ready to actively contribute to the realization of this process. We are also prepared to make a positive contribution to moving forward on disarmament issues, including strengthening such related multilateral mechanisms as the Conference on Disarmament, which my country will preside over as of 1 January 2020.\nOur Arab region continues to suffer numerous crises, both long term and emerging, which have been worsened by the international community\u2019s failure to adopt approaches appropriate to solving those crises in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. This failure has fuelled the phenomenon of extremism and violence.\nAt the heart of the Arab and Islamic world and for all lovers of peace around the globe, the Palestinian question has emerged as a central issue and one that is closely linked to a number of other crises, including regional security in the Middle East and throughout the world. Despite the numerous binding resolutions adopted by our Organization and the constructive Arab Peace Initiative, we have unfortunately been unable to implement these instruments on the ground, making the possibility of finding a solution in line with the requirements of international legitimacy increasingly remote. Although the majority of the international community condemns the policies and aggression of Israel, the occupying Power, as well as the long- standing historical injustice and continued impunity of the aggressor, the unarmed Palestinian people remain deprived of their most basic national rights, including the right to return to their homeland, while attempts continue to be made to change the status of their capital, Al-Quds Al-Sharif.\nAlgeria continues to support its strategic choice of establishing the Arab Maghreb Union, the first seeds of which we planted three decades ago. My country remains fully committed to translating the objectives to which the peoples of the Union aspire into reality on the ground. Nevertheless, we regret that we have not matched the Secretary-General\u2019s dynamism with respect to Western Sahara. We also regret the resignation of Mr. Horst Kohler, Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara. We hope that the spirit of dialogue will prevail between our brothers in the Kingdom of Morocco and the Frente Popular para la Liberacion de Saguia el-Hamra y de Rio de Oro so that they can reach a final solution that guarantees the ability of the people of the Sahara to exercise their legitimate right to self-determination, in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions.\nWith regard to Libya, Algeria has repeatedly warned of the creation of obstacles to finding a political solution to the crisis. We have consistently stressed to the various parties in Libya, as well as regional and international partners, that the country\u2019s overarching interests should ultimately take precedence over all other considerations. Algeria will stand side by side with the Libyans in promoting dialogue as a means to end the crisis and begin a reconciliation process free from foreign interference, which serves only to threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, as well as the stability of its society. Algeria reaffirms that the Libyan crisis can only be resolved by the Libyans themselves, with the support of their neighbours, and that an approach based on weapons and foreign intervention cannot lead to a settlement.\nIn Syria, we have recently witnessed several positive developments. With the defeat of various terrorist groups, security has been restored in a number of regions, which has enabled the return of the first wave of internally displaced persons from within and outside the country. We must now focus on setting the requirements for a political solution leading to national reconciliation, enabling all Syrians to return to their homes and communities and, with the help of all, to begin the process of reconstruction.\nWe should not omit to mention our brother nation of Yemen, also in the Arab world, where the conflict has had serious repercussions for people\u2019s lives and triggered a serious humanitarian situation. We hope that dialogue between the belligerents in line with respect for national and international legitimacy will prevail and that the efforts to fight terrorism and unacceptable aggression are successful. In this regard, I would like to pay tribute to the work of other brother countries of the region in helping to bring the Yemeni crisis to an end.\nIn Mali, the achievement of lasting peace requires the full and effective implementation of the 2015 Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali that resulted from the Algiers process. Closer cooperation among all the signatory parties to the Agreement must be established. We commend the progress made in this regard, but we must bear in mind that much remains to be done by all Malian stakeholders. As President of the Agreement Monitoring Committee, Algeria affirms its determination to support the Malian parties in addressing the root causes of the crisis and putting a definitive end to it. We are steadfast in our determination to see Mali achieve security, unity and territorial integrity, and we will continue to provide the country with assistance.\nThe lack of security in the Sahel region foments the spread of terrorist groups, whose capacity to do harm has grown. They benefit from a criminal economy based on looting, illegal trafficking and smuggling, resulting in poverty and the creation of fertile ground for attracting young recruits. Given our geographical position in the region and our long-standing experience in fighting terrorism and violent extremism in our country, and given that we are a key pillar of stability in Africa and the Mediterranean region, Algeria has adopted a global policy of working relentlessly to fight this international scourge while introducing far-reaching reforms on the political, economic, social, cultural and religious fronts. Violent extremists\u2019 malign exploitation of religious beliefs, particularly those of Islam, has had a significant impact on the stability of societies in the Arab and Muslim world and has also led to an increase in the hatred of Muslims and Muslim communities around the world. This is an issue that must be tackled through continuing cooperative action based on mutual respect, while countries should also adopt national legislation to eliminate this scourge.\nThe issue of migration also requires greater attention. Respect for people and their dignity must be at the foundation of all policies aimed at organizing migration. It must also be part of a comprehensive and balanced approach that takes into account the interests of countries of origin, transit and destination, as well as the root causes of the phenomenon of migration. In recent years there has been a significant focus on the security and humanitarian dimensions, but the development aspects have not yet received the attention they deserve. Promises related to official development aid must be translated into tangible development programmes that respond to the needs of local communities and prevent individual migration. Unfortunately, the Mediterranean has become a graveyard for many migrants, owing to the sinking of many migrant convoys attempting to reach Europe. Surely it is time for the Mediterranean region to reclaim its role as a model for partnership, cooperation and solidarity. In Algeria, we are confident that this can be done, and we stand ready, with our partners on both sides of the Mediterranean, to make positive contributions to any effort aimed at achieving this goal.\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that Algeria is a State that deeply believes in the purposes and principles of the United Nations and in the ideals of peace and mutual respect. As a State, we are willing to build relationships based on solidarity and stability. Algerians are currently aspiring to develop their country and build its strength so that they can continue their quest to preserve peace, security and peaceful coexistence, not just in the country\u2019s geographical area of the Sahel region and the Mediterranean, but throughout Africa and the world.\n"

        "file_text": "The\tPhilippines congratulates the President on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. He has our full support. We also congratulate Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, President of the Assembly at its seventy-third session, for her success in making the United Nations relevant for all at a time of determined efforts to make it irrelevant. Working here at the United Nations, I witnessed that her heroic efforts brought off brilliant effect. It was a privilege to serve with her.\nSince the first session of the General Assembly, in 1946, States Members of the United Nations have gathered annually to pledge their commitment to peace, because that is what the United Nations was founded for after the Second World War. Peace first; the big words and ideas proposing ways to create the right environment to make peace meaningful and thrive, or not, are secondary. But we know that peace comes for sure when the fighting stops, not just long enough to wash the dead and bury them but long enough for survivors to start over. To be sure, they never get back what they loved and lost, but they start again with what little is left, because hope springs eternal. We are in the United Nations to sustain that hope and fight off despair.\nAs we approach the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, predictions are rife with the demise of multilateralism. One piece of evidence proffered is the democratic election of strong Governments that talk tough and brush aside the demands of the United Nations \u2014 well-meaning for the most part \u2014 about how Governments should do their job more kindly, by standards more honoured in the breach than the observance in the West. Weak Governments, unable to protect their people, appear desirable because they make the case for multilateral intervention at the prompting of conscience of course \u2014 but sometimes at the unilateral prompting of great Powers or violent or civil non-State actors.\nStrong Government is better. That is why Government was invented, to get things done, but always consistently constitutional in its actions. Firm is good and severity is justified, but all within the law. Far from dying or dead, the United Nations is alive and strong, although only as much as its Members make it. Most United Nations States Members are democracies. And do not say there are democracies and \u201cdemocracies\u201d. All democracies are pretentions in some degree. The growing electoral trend towards strong Governments does not change their democratic character. That trend proves the United Nations has achieved one of its key goals for peace \u2014 the spread of democracy \u2014 because they lean more to peace than war, although the jury is still out on that one.\nSome in the rest of the world might not like the electoral result, but the people back home are happy with their choice. It is theirs to make and regret, but it is not the United Nations to decide. The next election might change it more to one\u2019s liking, or not. Still, we are warned of States eroding multilateralism by each asserting too much sovereignty. But in what respect? Perhaps by insisting on carrying out a State\u2019s defining duty to protect its population against harm by any means efficient to achieve that purpose. That may cause dismay among the civil in society \u2014 civil society is free to complain. Better yet, they should run for public office to gain legitimacy and be able to do something about it. But the United Nations is not free to interfere with the State in its defining function of protecting its citizens and stamping out threats.\nIn a reflective mood, my President asked me, \u201cWhen did it happen that the rule of law no longer means the rule of law but the rules of crime. When did the presumption of innocence, which attaches only after arrest and arraignment, attach itself to the perpetrator the instant he is caught? That makes it legally impossible to suspect, let alone arrest him on probable cause. There are no more suspects, only victims of human rights violations when enforcing the law for the protection of citizens.\u201d\nAll I could say was, \u201cI do not know. I just do not know.\u201d\nThe nations herein united should not let this platform be used to threaten others with accountability for taking a tough approach to crime, instead of taking seriously what they cannot, the Western proposition that the sure-fire way to end crime is to legalize it. Then it is no longer criminal. Well, that works after a fashion, not to punish lawbreakers but sit down and talk them out of repeating the only thing at which they are any good \u2014 crime. That is something I learned at the Munich Security Conference on human trafficking \u2014 not as the evil it is but as a regular job. The pay is not bad. Traffickers know only how to traffic \u2014 anything, as a German expert said, and they will not stop, because they cannot stop, until they are stopped.\nThe threat to multilateralism comes as much from its own vain attempts to usurp State functions as from unilateralists attempts to oust it from the world stage and return us to the anarchy of the pre-war period out of whose ashes the United Nations was born. Talk before fighting is what the United Nations is about. And if talk fails, talk some more. War is really the ultima ratio regis.\nIn the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) we are still talking; knowing that talk, so long as we give up nothing vital in the process, does not hurt. We are negotiating a code of conduct with China in the South China Sea. We have had incidents with swarming Chinese ships and lost a reef in our Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). But, so far, we have had no interference in the joint exploration and development of oil and gas in areas within our EEZ, but China claims them as well. I crafted a memorandum of understanding on oil and gas, which China accepted, that allows us to move forward without the slightest compromise or diminution of our respective sovereign and international rights. But who can tell?\nThe code of conduct is a code of reality, the reality of the proximity of the soon-to-be biggest economy in the world in one place, with a commensurate industrial war-making capacity. But war is a totally remote possibility. All parties have built so much and achieved such material progress that none of us, or any outside Power, will risk losing the richest market in the world. It is therefore a code of live and let live with China \u2014 until it is not. We have all asked of each other, ASEAN members and China, for mutual restraint and complete respect for the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which all of us are signatories, binding ourselves unqualifiedly thereto, including China. Then it is something else. We will come to that and cross that bridge when we get there, maybe.\nMultilateralism has come into question because it allows itself to be bent to unipolar purposes \u2014 or worse, to the purposes of non-State actors \u2014 against multilateralism\u2019s reason for being, namely, the protection and safety of the weak and many, against the strong and few. Multilateralism is not owned by a select club of Member States. It is by and for all, or no one. The Philippines believes that the United Nations stands on the single pillar of the aggregated sovereignties of its Members. That is parlous but stable enough for a time. The United Nations is a collection of sovereign States, not a sovereign collective itself. It is only as effective as its Members make it. It harnesses sovereignties, not for some against others but to common purposes of peace and productive cooperation.\nSovereignty is as much a duty of care as it is an assertion of unlimited freedom of action. In the United Nations the two combine in the willing assumption of that duty on the part of States towards the international order to ensure peace and the well-being of \u201cwe, the peoples of the United Nations\u201d. The Philippines is a proud founding Member of the United Nations, present at the creation even before we were independent. Carlos P. Romulo proclaimed in 1946 at the General Assembly during its first session:\n\u201cBy the circumstances of our birth as a free and independent State, we are committed to the aims and purposes of the United Nations.\u201d (A/PV.41, p. 819)\nEven as our State was cloaked with sovereignty at birth, so was it saddled with the duty, commensurate with that power, to use it only for good.\nOur engagement with the United Nations has been in the belief that the United Nations work must reflect the realities of the times, so as to be practical and useful in achieving the aspirations of \u201cwe, the peoples of the United Nations\u201d \u2014 peoples as they are, in the real situations they are in, and not the Member States. The United Nations does not work with abstractions, that is for politicians and professional do-gooders. Only then can the United Nations stay relevant and become effective. The aspiration of the vast majority of my people today, call them short-sighted or just plain wrong, is to be free of drugs and safe from crime. Is that so hard to understand? It seems impossible for some to accept. But the cartel can be persuasive in kind, if not in reason. The United Nations is the core of the multilateral global order. As long as the United Nations exists, none can trumpet the end of multilateralism. But it must be a United Nations strengthened and capacitated in its every Member, so that all, collectively, may achieve its aim of peace and safety.\nAn increasingly complex security and global situation, which is to say an anarchy beyond that of the inter-war years between States, but which now includes non-State actors, both violent and civil, requires the Security Council to adapt, reform and expand its membership, but only of formal States \u2014 throw everything in the pot and nobody can eat it. It needs to be representative, even at the risk of stasis, and democratic, for the sake of legitimacy. It cannot let itself be paralysed when the situation screams for humanitarian action. It must be prompt, yet circumspect and sharply focused, when it takes action, attempting no more than to end the carnage, with just enough rebuilding to enable reason and compassion, not hysteria and the usual self-dealing, to find a good way forward. No one expects the best.\nWe ask the Security Council to provide the General Assembly with multiple candidates \u2014 especially women \u2014 for the post of Secretary-General, with due regard to gender balance and regional rotation. Something is not right with its mindset and system if, after nearly 75 years, the United Nations has failed to have a woman Secretary-General. Do not blame it on the vote. The vote goes only as far as the Security Council lets it. From my experience, women know best how to build, men how to tear down.\nCentral to United Nations reform is funding. The Philippines is deeply concerned with the United Nations deteriorating financial situation. States look to the United Nations to implement their priority agenda \u2014 peace and security, of course, humanitarian assistance foremost, along with human rights, and lately sustainable development, climate action, migrants and refugees. But States will not provide it with the means to meet those mandates. They come to complain about what they expect from the United Nations, but step down from the rostrum without committing what all States can spare, which is far more than even the poorest actually contribute. Almost all the countries of the world can afford to give more to the United Nations, as I know all Governments have the capacity to do so if they are careful not to waste and steal at home what they can well afford to give to the United Nations.\nSome can give more money to peacekeeping, others to personnel. No country can take the lion\u2019s share of credit there: they all wear the same uniform, with the same badges and the same Blue Helmets. They bleed the same colour and give up their last breath like any other. But the United Nations itself must engender trust in its use of funds. The Secretary-General\u2019s financial reform proposals would do well to uphold accountability, transparency and sustainability. The public is awash with stories of fiscal irresponsibility.\nIn 2015, with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we vowed to end poverty. The incidence of poverty in the Philippines fell from 27 per cent to 21 per cent from 2015 to 2018. But, as my President says, the important number is the 6 million Filipinos who are still very poor. It can be done, and it has been done on a far-greater scale than anyone thought possible. The new China lifted 800 million out of utter poverty in 20 years into what is, by any economic indicator, a real middle class. Aligned with the SDGs, our development plan points in the direction of achieving the aspirations of the Filipino people. Their aspirations are no different than those of any other people or nation: getting out of poverty, attaining a comfortable lifestyle, feeling secure about the future, especially for one\u2019s children, and being safe by stopping crime, especially drug dealing, which strikes at the victim\u2019s reason and soul.\nI know that drug dealing falls somewhere between race, religion, political belief and gender as something to be equally protected. Admittedly, the drug experience is a bit religious. Therefore, prohibiting it is a crime against humanity up there with the others. But drugs are the reason my Government was elected by a landslide \u2014 a mandate that has only grown to 80 per cent because of unceasing criticism. In defending it, the public now own it. But that, as I said, is the problem with democracy: you cannot pick and choose the winner based on your delicacy. It depends entirely on the vote. The one with the most votes wins, while the others \u2014 more to one\u2019s taste \u2014 lose.\nWhatever the phraseology adopted to express them, those aspirations are not captured by measuring poverty based solely on income per capita. To truly gauge the progress of our strategies, we have to stop reporting the wrong metric. That is why we have begun to use the Multidimensional Poverty Index. Education is how people lift themselves out of poverty. It does not happen by itself. Philosophers are poor. Charity and social programmes are how we, as individuals and Governments, lift them out faster. Even more Filipinos received basic education this year, with over 27 million enrolled. Over 600,000 out-of-school youth and adult learners are benefiting from an alternative learning system. Tuition is free in State-run colleges, universities and technical and vocational institutions, at both the national and local levels. Tuition is tightly controlled in private institutions.\nI urge all States to implement the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. It is telling that advocates of multilateralism conveniently leave out issues of migration. Migration is as multilateral as it gets. Migration is the pervasive reality today. The positive contribution of migrants fosters growth in countries of origin by remittances and countries of destination by industriousness. Migrant labour raises great cities out of deserts and mans the ships that enable global trade. Migrant health workers care for the sick, the children and the elderly, giving to strangers as much care as they gave their own loved ones back home. Sure, they are paid \u2014 and for that we are grateful to the host countries of our migrant peoples. Migrants themselves are grateful for the love that is sometimes returned, and sad when they are hurt instead.\nClimate change \u2014 or, as Secretary-General Guterres calls it, the climate crisis \u2014 is the defining development issue of our time. Failure to address it nullifies all other endeavours in the long run. As one economist puts it, climate change matters so much for poverty: it is the poorest who are, and will be, hit earliest and hardest. John Maynard Keynes was prophetic: in the long-run we are all dead.\nClimate change has brought my country\u2014already one of the most vulnerable countries to disasters \u2014 extreme weather events of increasing recurrence and strength. Disasters are the reverse of God: they can make nothing out of something already there, built with great sacrifice. They wipe out socioeconomic gains like an eraser wipes the lesson off the blackboard at the end of the school day. Disasters do more \u2014 they reverse economic growth, so that we must start again not just from nothing, but with far less strength and spirit to try again. If climate action does not measure up to what is needed, we all face the same fate, that is, a diminished existence, then extinction altogether. But those who are most to blame will suffer less and much later than those who are least at fault.\nWe already have the global frameworks to address poverty, sustain development and combat climate change. Let us just do it. To borrow from Kung Fu Panda, \u201cEnough talk; let\u2019s fight.\u201d The Secretary-General urges us to actually plant trees rather than plan some more to plant them. I think he is fed up.\nWhen President Corazon Aquino addressed the General Assembly in 1986, after her peaceful People Power Revolution, she said, \u201c[perhaps it is only the tragedy of conflict that teaches us the true value of peace\u201d (A/41/PV5, p. 11). Everything we have, such as it is, everything we work for, everything we wish and strive for \u2014 indeed, the world as it is, with much to be desired and the better world we think we can make \u2014 will all be erased in an instant by nuclear war. We must eliminate that possibility \u2014 and we have tried. The universal ban on nuclear weapons was overwhelmingly adopted at the United Nations and swiftly ratified back home, except in the Philippines, for bureaucratic reasons no one can divine unless they work in Government. Let us not wait for conflict to make us value the peace we have. Let us hope that President Cory Aquino is proved wrong and that we will learn by reading and recollection, rather than living through our violent mistakes all over again.\nTerrorism, with its links to drug trafficking and organized crime, is the most pressing threat to us all. The fight to retake the city of Marawi, which left it looking like Swiss cheese, was triggered by an attempt to serve a warrant of arrest for drug trafficking on the leader of an Islamic jihad. Some would argue that we should have just let him get on with his business. Unfortunately, my President will not oblige. He wants to eliminate the drug trade. I know this is terrible \u2014 where will we get our fix?\nPeace is out of the hands of peacemakers \u2014 it is entirely in the hands of lawbreakers, who have attained a level of organization far superior to poor States like mine. The violent initiative lies entirely with them. But what lies with us is decency. It is in the way we fight, the way we protect, the way we defeat our enemies with arms when we are attacked with arms. We fight with the truth when attacked with lies, and will do so always and forever \u2014 all Constitutions mandate it \u2014 with only victory in mind and refusing anything less. Compromise throws away the advantage gained in a fight for survival, giving the other side time and space to recover and rally. But the fight must always be fought with a decent regard for the civilized opinion of humankind.\nThe fact that the United Nations endures after nearly 75 years is an affirmation of the world\u2019s abiding desire for peace in spite of its failures, which are broadcast, and the dispiriting silence that greets its many successes. With successes, continuing challenges and unceasing criticism, the United Nations has demonstrated its resilience and affirmed its continuing relevance, which cannot be doubted given the alternative: the terrible wars out of which the United Nations was born. Shifting political realities, successive power configurations and the increasing confused nature of global realities should not make the United Nations change its character and goals of peace and democracy, sustainable development, if possible, and climate action for our sake and our children\u2019s. For God\u2019s sake, they are already screaming at us. They see what is there while we refuse to \u2014 none so blind, indeed. Those grim realities teach no values, they only urge surrender by compromise. That is unacceptable to the community of civilized nations. There can be no world order other than the one established with the United Nations as its guardian.\nAs a sovereign country, the Philippines renews its commitment to the ideals of the United Nations \u2014 to end the scourge of war, to uphold justice and, yes, human rights, starting with the right of the many who are good, to be safe and protected from the bad, and to maintain peace and amity among the nations under this one roof \u2014 united."

        "file_text": "English interpretation provided by the delegation): I warmly congratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, on his election to that honourable position. I pledge Poland\u2019s full support for his mission. I also warmly thank Ms. Espinosa Garces for her active work as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session.\nPeace, environmental protection and welfare are the three concepts on which I would like to centre my message today. Those three concepts should also serve as a cement that binds the entire international community: peace through respect for the law, environmental protection achieved through cooperation and co-responsibility, and welfare through engaging for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nOn 1 September, we commemorated in Warsaw the eightieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War, which began with an attack on Poland by two totalitarian States and two criminal ideologies, German Nazi Hitlerism and Soviet Stalinist communism. The Second World War, which violated the fundamental rights of nations and States to self-determination, claimed nearly 18 million victims worldwide and became a long-term trauma for millions more. This extremely painful historical experience has left its mark. Not only has it influenced international relations in the decades since, but it has also greatly affected the cultural and social consciousness, shaping both the ideas that we profess today and the goals that we set and pursue.\nI would now like to repeat what I said during the commemoration ceremony in Warsaw with regard to the outbreak of the Second World War, which is that, despite the progress of civilization, despite that terrible lesson, today, in the twenty-first century, acts of incomprehensible barbarity are still being perpetrated all over the world \u2014 ethnic cleansing, mass murders and even genocide. Moreover, we continue to see assaults on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, and borders are still being moved by force. Looking at this, one cannot help but draw historical analogies. There is also the temptation today to buy time for peace through passiveness and submission, and sometimes even parlaying with aggressors in the name of one\u2019s own interests, submission or appeasement, thereby succumbing to dangerous illusions that one can bargain with an aggressor at the expense of others in order to prolong peace for oneself. Such parlaying, in other words, involves pursuing individual interests, often economic, in one\u2019s relations with aggressors, while at the same time invoking solidarity with the victims of aggression in grandiloquent words.\nWhen creating the United Nations out of the ruins of the previous world order, we were guided by a completely different set of tenets. The guiding principle was \u201cnever again\u201d. It seemed that we had all learned the cruel lessons of the Second World War. Unfortunately, as recent years have shown, that same temptation to deal with the aggressor exists today as it did then. I firmly believe that it is high time to shake ourselves out of the state of lethargy inherited from the past and stop repeating the same mistakes.\nIn this vein, as President of the Republic of Poland, I cannot fail to refer to the situation in our part of Europe. I want to make it clear once again that every country has an equal right to self-determination. Poland has been and will continue to be a champion of independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, both for Ukraine and Georgia. State borders must not be changed by force. Poland, so gravely affected in the previous century, has a moral duty to speak out very clearly on this matter \u2014 and we are doing so. We are making efforts to ensure peace and justice in the name of peace and freedom, which are so dear to us.\nThis year we are coming to the end of Poland\u2019s two-year membership of the Security Council \u2014 an experience we regard as valuable and meaningful. Our tenure has emphasized the role of my country which, as a founding Member of the United Nations, considers itself an integral part of the great international system of cooperation between nations and States. It is primarily common values, objectives and legal norms that bind the system together. The past few years have unfortunately shown that international law is often challenged and disavowed today, even though it is precisely international law that provides the basis for the implementation of principles such as the sovereign equality of States, justice, responsibility and security.\nThe law exists not only for the benefit of States, but for the benefit of humankind as a whole and for the benefit of each individual. A violation of its norms must produce consequences and individuals responsible for such breach must be held accountable. It was in this spirit that, during its presidency of the Security Council in 2018, Poland organized a high-level debate on the promotion and strengthening of the rule of law in the maintenance of international peace and security, which I presided over as President of the Republic of Poland (see S/PV.8262). I would like to make it very clear that international law is the strongest tool that civilized nations have to ensure long-term peace. Peace comes through law \u2014 there can be no peace without the law. Poland, which in its history has tragically experienced genocide and war crimes as a result of acts of aggression from other countries, will always unalterably be on this side of the law and on this side of the victims of violence. We have strongly and consistently emphasize this point in international forums.\nFirst of all, through our work in the Security Council, we emphasize the indisputable role of international law in maintaining the global security architecture that was created after the Second World War and in protecting civilians in armed conflicts.\nSecondly, we remain a consistent advocate of children\u2019s rights. This year we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Poland initiated. It has a special dimension for us. It is a universal and historically unprecedented international document that relates solely and exclusively to children. This groundbreaking Convention has changed the way we think about children. It has given children the protection they need and deserve. Children are the most vulnerable group in terms of exposure to the consequences of conflict. In this connection, we are placing particular emphasis on the problem of the reintegration of children previously enlisted in armed groups and of children born as a result of sexual violence in wars.\nThirdly, we call for strengthening protection for persons with disabilities in conflicts. These people are particularly exposed to a range of negative phenomena associated with conflict and post-conflict situations \u2014 violence, threats to life and health and difficulties in accessing health care, education, rehabilitation and, in extreme cases, life-saving humanitarian aid. In June, on the initiative of Poland, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 2475 (2019), the first ever devoted to persons with disabilities in armed conflicts.\nFourthly, and finally, we promote the protection of the rights of persons belonging to religious minorities. We are concerned about the surge in violence and religious hatred. We are particularly painfully aware of the spreading violence against Christians, and yet freedom of religion is one of the fundamental human rights and freedoms. Enhancing mutual understanding and cooperation among ethnic, cultural and religious groups is more important than ever before. That is why, for several years now, Poland has been calling for the increased engagement of international organizations in promoting full respect for the rights of religious minorities and in ensuring freedom of religion and belief. A living testament to the Polish commitment to the cause is the fact that this year the General Assembly decided to designate 22 August as the International Day Commemorating the Victims of Acts of Violence Based on Religion or Belief.\nToday, as President of the Republic of Poland, I would like not only to take stock of Poland\u2019s achievements in the field of promoting peace in the world, but also to emphasize our contribution to solving the second key challenge of the contemporary world, which is caring for the natural environment. We will soon be handing over to Chile the presidency of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Our term in office has produced a significant contribution to global climate policy. At COP 24, held in Poland, the Katowice Rulebook was adopted. The objective of COP 24 was to provide a manual on how to implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. That is what we achieved. Therefore, I would like at this point to thank all the political leaders for their personal commitment and presence in our meetings, both during the COP 24 leaders summit and in the closing stretch of the negotiations in Katowice. Thanks to the Katowice climate package, the world has at its disposal a set of guidelines on operationalizing the Paris Agreement and taking related action.\nI realize many of us believe that more needs to be done to protect the environment and that our ambitions should be greater. However, I also believe that the essence of the fight to counter the negative processes taking place in the natural environment lies primarily in building international consensus on the issue, and one cannot transgress its limits. Ambitions must be expressed together because only then can they be realized. Only together can we save our natural environment. The fact that the document crowning COP 24 was adopted unanimously is all the more gratifying. After laborious negotiations, part of this arrangement resulted in the acceptance of the Just Transition Declaration. For me, it is a source of great satisfaction that this concept, coined during the Katowice Conference, is now part of the official language used by the European Union and the Environmental Action Program (EAP) of the newly formed European Commission.\nLet me assure members of the Assembly that Poland will support the European Commission in the implementation of the just transition concept, as defined at COP 24. Responding to the call for a higher level of ambition on environmental protection, in conjunction with yesterday\u2019s Climate Action Summit, convened by the Secretary-General, on behalf of Poland I have proposed five initiatives that are either already under way or about to be implemented at the national level. In pursuit of sustainability, the aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their production will be balanced through their absorption by ecosystems and adaptation to climate change.\nFirst, we have created a programme that is aimed at reducing household emissions. Secondly, we will seek to reduce emissions from public transportation. Thirdly, through large-scale afforestation programmes, we want to enhance the absorption of emissions by ecosystems, which should bring us closer to climate neutrality. Fourthly, we have developed plans to adapt cities to climate change. Fifthly, we have drafted a long-term programme to change the economic profile of one of Poland\u2019s strongest economic regions \u2014 Silesia.\nFirst and foremost, Poland emphasizes the issue of a solidarity-based and just, low-carbon transition. We are also convinced that building a green economy is possible only when voices of all social groups are duly taken into account. Environmental policy must be understood as a social policy and cannot be used as an instrument to gain economic advantage derived from the different energy mixes of individual economies or reserves of natural resources at hand.\nThe issue of the environment should be seen in the wider context of debate on sustainable development. In that vein, I believe that the time has come to launch an international discussion on the modern model of welfare policy. It is worth reflecting on the meaning of the term today and how to position it in a globalized world. What goals should we set ourselves on the road to its achievement? What model of a modern welfare State would we adopt \u2014 the model against which we would pitch our political ambitions? In Poland, we have now started that debate, facilitated by the dynamic development of Poland\u2019s economy and extensive social aid programmes implemented by the Polish authorities.\nWelfare policy should be based on the concept of sustainable development, as set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which we have all adopted \u2014 in other words, responsibility, solidarity and justice. At the July session of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, we noted significant progress in achieving the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals. However, the discussion revealed a lag in implementing many of its Goals, as confirmed in the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2019, which indicates that Sustainable Development Goal 4, concerning education, is at risk.\nThat delay is an acute problem and should be eliminated as soon as possible. We all agree that education is fundamentally important.\nSecondly, our citizens also consider health care to be a key aspect when defining quality of life. We must make immense financial investments and achieve a much higher level of fair and effective coverage, both as individual countries and globally. In some parts of the globe, negligence in health care has led to the reappearance of diseases that were already considered to have been eradicated, and in developed countries the level of medical services is still under heavy pressure from social expectations. That is mainly due to an ageing population and the consequent increase in health needs. In Poland, that problem is currently being addressed as one of the most pressing challenges for the country\u2019s social policy.\nThirdly, the harmonization of the standard of living is an equally important element of sustainable development and a welfare State, next to increasing educational opportunities and health protection. Policies should aspire to systematically combat poverty and prevent exploitation, including economic exploitation, and to reduce social disparities through the systematic increase in the average standard of living for families. Only an economy based on respect, honesty, the harmonious cooperation among all social groups and the fair distribution of the fruits of labour, can bring about sustainable development in individual countries and the international community as a whole.\nWe must introduce the concept of commonwealth into the language of economic debate. Those issues are particularly important outside of developing countries as well. Today, even in some rich Western countries, we are witnessing mass protests in which citizens are demanding respect for their social rights and highlighting the deterioration of their living conditions. Instead of respect, they face arrogance and brutal police violence. I believe that a sincere dialogue about welfare policies would help prevent such tensions.\nShared responsibility should be the starting point of our efforts to achieve a better tomorrow for future generations. Poland is determined to continue its endeavours to ensure development, peace and security, respect for human rights and support for vulnerable groups in need of special protection. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to call for the promotion of peace through the law, care for the natural environment through responsibility-sharing and engagement in welfare policy through sustainable development.\nThere is no doubt that as an international community we are faced with mounting and often unprecedented challenges. However, I am convinced that by working together we will be able to meet those challenges.\n"

        "file_text": "It is indeed an honour to participate in the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly, representing Sri Lanka. I bring greetings from His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena, President of Sri Lanka, who regrets very much his inability to have attended this session.\nPermit me to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. Undoubtedly your longstanding experience will guide the work of the Assembly to a successful conclusion. Let me also thank the outgoing President, Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for having successfully conducted the work of the previous session.\nI also wish to extend Sri Lanka\u2019s appreciation to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his sagacious leadership and untiring efforts in achieving the objectives of the United Nations.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s general debate is both timely and significant as we strive to build a world of peace and prosperity by eradicating extreme poverty, ensuring access to quality education and striving to respond to climate change and to promote inclusion. As we complete the first cycle of reviews of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it is clear that we have made substantial progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet the end of the road is a long way off, with the increasingly devastating impacts of climate change threatening to reverse those gains and impede our path to development.\nSri Lanka reiterates its strong commitment to the climate-related global initiatives. It endorses the clear message of the Climate Action Summit, held last week in this very venue, and notes that we are on the brink of a climate emergency. It is imperative to strengthen our collective political will and accelerate global action in stalling its emergence.\nInequality-driven push factors, aggravated by climate change, have a definite negative bearing on individuals and communities, forcing them to leave their usual habitats, resulting in a mass-scale migration of people.\nHaving adopted the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, a voluntary framework for governing migration in a manner that is safe, orderly, regular and responsible, it is now time for us to ensure its full implementation.\nClimate change has also exacerbated the global phenomenon of poverty, undermining human dignity and remaining one of the greatest threats to the achievement of the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Sri Lanka remains committed to the international efforts on poverty eradication, which has been at the heart of our development strategy for several decades now.\nQuality education remains the key to social progress and economic empowerment. Sri Lanka greatly values quality education as a means of eradicating poverty and achieving progress. We have a longstanding policy of providing universal and free education at the primary and secondary levels since 1945, many decades before the introduction of the Millennium Development Goals or the SDGs. Today Sri Lanka\u2019s literacy rate stands at 92 per cent, one of the highest in the world.\nAs we persevere in these efforts to reverse the negative trends, our ability to address global challenges has been compromised in recent times by the increasing threat to multilateralism. As the United Nations approaches its seventy-fifth anniversary, next year, this is an excellent opportunity to assess its successes and failures, including its engagement with Member States. The partnerships fostered between Member States and the United Nations over seven decades, based on trust and equity, must not be compromised or allowed to be hijacked by actors accountable to none and with selective political agendas. Given the changes in the landscape of global politics, particularly the emergence of non-State actors, it is vital that the Organization, which is composed of and driven by sovereign Member States, ensure that primacy and respect be given to the decisions taken by Member States regarding essentially domestic matters.\nIn this context, our quest to strengthen the work of the General Assembly through its revitalization process is extremely important to ensuring that it remains relevant as the main deliberative and policy-making organ of the United Nations. Therefore, it is incumbent upon United Nations policy implementers to refrain from being misled by entities with vested interests. The United Nations must also desist from making decisions without a valid consultative process, as its work must always be Member-State-driven. Failure to ensure this will not only discredit this body and negate the values that it represents but also break the trust of Member States, jeopardizing the partnerships within the United Nations.\nSri Lanka\u2019s commitment to disarmament remains steadfast. With the increasing challenges to the global arms-control, disarmament and non-proliferation regimes, Sri Lanka continues to recognize the pivotal role of the Conference on Disarmament (CD) and urges the resumption of substantive negotiations under its mandate. Decision CD/2119, adopted in February 2018 under Sri Lanka\u2019s presidency of the CD, was a modest contribution towards bridging different viewpoints, focusing on the early resumption of negotiations. We see value in the continuation of this process.\nAdditionally, in recent years, Sri Lanka has acceded to a number of disarmament treaties, including the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. Sri Lanka has also presided over the Meetings of States Parties to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, and of States Parties to the Review Conference of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions.\nThe 2020 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Review Conference will also provide an opportunity for Member States to deliver on their commitments, as the Treaty marks the fiftieth anniversary of its entry into force next year.\nSri Lanka has been contributing to United Nations peacekeeping efforts since 1960, serving in the Central African Republic, the Congo, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Haiti, Lebanon, Liberia, Mali, South Sudan, Timor and the Western Sahara, thereby demonstrating our commitment to global peace and security. We look forward to enhancing our contribution to a more secure and peaceful world, and obstacles must not be placed in the way of Sri Lanka\u2019s long-standing peacekeeping contribution to the United Nations.\nGiven Sri Lanka\u2019s experience of the recent past in low- and high-intensity conflicts with terrorist groups, few countries can qualitatively match the troops sent by Sri Lanka, which have extensive professional experience in all aspects of peacekeeping and providing humanitarian assistance. I take this opportunity to express gratitude for their contribution and wish to particularly salute three soldiers \u2014 Corporal M. Wijesinghe, who made the ultimate sacrifice in Haiti in 2005; and Captain H.W.D. Jayawickrama and Corporal S.S. Wijekumara, in Mali earlier this year.\nSri Lanka is also concerned about the deteriorating situation in the occupied Palestine territory, including East Jerusalem, where the continuing expansion of settlements across the occupied West Bank is leading to the increased demolition of homes. While restating Sri Lanka\u2019s consistent and principled position that the Palestinian people have a legitimate and inalienable right to the natural resources in their territory and to statehood, we further recognize the legitimate and sensitive security concerns of both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. In this context, Sri Lanka reiterates the importance of the early implementation of the relevant General Assembly resolutions on the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to statehood and the attainment of the two-State solution, based on the 1967 borders.\nThere can be no development without peace. Peace is a catalyst for stability, inclusiveness and socioeconomic growth. For nearly 30 years, Sri Lanka was one of world\u2019s worst-affect countries in terms of separatist terrorism, long before the fight against terrorism became an international buzz phrase. With the defeat of terrorism in Sri Lanka in 2009, we experienced an unprecedented peace dividend for nearly a decade. However, on 21 April \u2014 Easter Sunday \u2014 this peace was shattered by a heinous terrorist attack in Sri Lanka, which took the lives of more than 250 of our citizens and foreign nationals and injured hundreds more.\nThe attack was an act of radical extremist terrorists who were inspired by and claimed allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham. It challenged the pluralistic processes in Sri Lanka of normalization, reconciliation and development, which had been arduously rebuilt since the end of the separatist conflict. Despite the attempts of the terrorists to destroy the country\u2019s social fabric, the resilience and trust between our communities and law-enforcement authorities ensured that citizens themselves warned of impending attacks and assisted in apprehending the culprits.\nThe incident also reminded us that no country is immune to the bane of radicalization, extremism and terrorism. It has reaffirmed our resolve to fight these global menaces and urge all countries to work in collaboration to address their root causes. We especially thank the Secretary-General and our friends in the international community who unreservedly condemned the Easter Sunday attacks and supported the Government of Sri Lanka in numerous ways.\nThe events surrounding the Easter Sunday bombing also taught us that fighting terrorism must go hand in hand with protecting human rights. One cannot be compromised for the sake of the other. This very delicate balance has often been elusive, with States veering towards one extreme or the other, applying double standards to similar situations and often politicizing these issues. We as a nation have found ourselves up to the task of overcoming the challenges posed by the violent extremism of Easter Sunday. The citizenry was secured within a relatively short period of time, and law and order restored. Our institutions asserted themselves, each in its respective role, to ensure that the people, communities and society as a whole were able to feel safe again.\nIn fact, the period following the Easter Sunday attack has proven to be a litmus test for Sri Lanka\u2019s resolve to adhere to human rights standards, while fighting terrorism, as well as to determine the strengths and shortcomings of the democratic institutions that have been consolidated in recent years. In this context, a ministerial committee headed by Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana has been established by the Cabinet to study and propose amendments to the draft counter- terrorism legislation currently under consideration by the Parliament.\nConscious of its international obligations, Sri Lanka is also consulting with partners in an effort to bring about domestic enabling legislation that would make it compliant with more recent relevant Security Council resolutions on combating terrorism, including on terrorist financing, border security and returning terrorist fighters and on countering violent extremism. Efforts are also under way to curb terrorists\u2019 use and abuse of the Internet and social media platforms, including by developing legislative measures and law- enforcement mechanisms to counter radical ideologies leading to violent extremism. In this context, it is necessary to develop the critical thinking of youth, strengthen community bonds, inculcate a sense of civic duty and build community resilience to mitigate the effects and influences of extremist ideologies conducive to terrorism that may escape the eye of law-enforcement authorities. In that regard, the role of the community and its resilience against local drivers of extremism are essential to preventing violent extremism.\nThe recovery over the past five months has demanded that we be resolute in governance. If we are to truly overcome these challenges, we must move towards incorporating a whole-of-society approach within a whole-of-Government approach.\nFinally, as Sri Lanka steps into the second decade since the end of its internal armed-separatist conflict, we remain committed to promoting and safeguarding the human rights of our people through a comprehensive process that would deliver permanent peace to our country. Recent events have reaffirmed the independence of our judiciary, as well as the resilience of our democratic institutions, including public services. These events also give form to our public\u2019s trust in democracy and the rule of law, and, despite numerous challenges, the country has progressed in its course towards reconciliation and durable peace.\nIn that context, I am happy to note that there has been significant progress in addressing the many facets of the conflict. The Office on Missing Persons and the Office for Reparations are now fully operational. The Cabinet of Ministers is also discussing the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission. Sri Lanka has maintained constructive and continuous engagement with the United Nations, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and human rights mechanisms, whereby, since the standing invitation of 2015 was made, Sri Lanka has welcomed 10 special-procedures mandate holders and working groups. Independent institutions have also played a critical role in this regard, and it is encouraging to note that the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka was reaccredited as an A status national human rights institution by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions in May 2018.\nOne would have to agree that the foregoing are not simple steps for a country to take, especially when that country has suffered 30 long years of conflict and more recent blows to its economy and polity. Promoting a peaceful and just society reconciled to itself is not only a stand-alone objective, but it is also a prerequisite for a sustainable and inclusive approach to development that leaves no one behind.\nEvery country has its own unique post-conflict situation. While we can learn from the experiences of others as we chart our own path to reconciliation, we are committed to finding innovative and pragmatic solutions to protect the country\u2019s national interest and the well-being of all Sri Lankans, guided by the provisions of our Constitution.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to a rules-based global order. We value the spirit of multilateralism and cooperation. Although humankind faces numerous challenges, I am confident that we are well within our ability to address them in a collective, constructive and cooperative manner for the betterment of all and our future generations."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Sir, I would first like to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I express the hope that, under your able guidance, Mr. President, this session will be crowned with a successful outcome.\nThe current session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when the global focus on and demand for achieving world peace and development are increasing at an unprecedented rate. Peace and development \u2014 a shared aspiration of the present era \u2014 are pillars of the United Nations work and the main goals on which all United Nations activities are predicated. Despite the efforts of a large number of States Members of the United Nations, achieving peace and development continues to face serious challenges stemming from the flagrant violation, within the international arena, of the principles of respect for sovereignty and sovereign equality, enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nUnilateralism, which values strength as the ultimate means for achieving goals, is infringing on the sovereignty of many countries, creating widespread tension in international relations and posing a threat to achieving peace and development. The Security Council, which shoulders the responsibility of ensuring the maintenance of international peace and security, has been reduced to an instrument serving the strategic interest of a specific country that pursues sanctions, exerts pressure and attempts regime change in specific countries \u2014 all in total disregard of international justice.\nIn view of the international situation over the past year, the United Nations must further enhance its role. The prevailing reality wherein principles of respect for sovereignty and sovereign equality are being flagrantly violated stands as a sobering lesson that true peace and security can be achieved only when States possess powerful strength of their own.\nIn his historic policy speech in April, Comrade Kim Jong Un, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, advanced the country\u2019s central tasks at its present stage of consolidating the material foundations of socialism by focusing all its efforts on building the economy and developing an elucidated and reasonable way to ensure peace on the Korean peninsula. The present situation, which is marked by increased hostile acts against our country, demands that we hold higher the banners of self-sufficiency and self-reliance in order to consolidate socialism. We have the solid foundations of a self-supporting economy, reliable scientific and technical strengths, and an invaluable tradition of self-reliance, which are our most precious strategic resources, and we would not trade them for anything. Under the seasoned leadership of Comrade Kim Jong Un, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission, our people are now making devoted efforts aimed at resolutely overcoming difficulties and challenges and at glorifying our Republic as an independent powerful country \u2014 a country of the people, whose ideals are fully realized.\nThe key to consolidating peace and stability and achieving development on the Korean peninsula is in the full implementation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea-United States joint statement agreed and adopted at the historic summit and talks between the two countries that were held in Singapore in June 2018. More than a year has passed since the adoption of the 12 June Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea- United States joint statement. However, the relations between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United States have made little progress so far, and the Korean peninsula continues to experience a vicious cycle of increased tension that is entirely attributable to the political and military provocations perpetrated by the United States, which has resorted to its anachronistic hostile policy against the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\nIn his historic policy speech, Comrade Kim Jong Un, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission, stated his position that the United States needs to put aside its current method of calculation and approach us with a new one, and that we would patiently wait for a courageous decision from the United States. In our assumption that the United States has had enough time to come up with a calculation method that it can share with us, we have expressed our willingness to sit with the United States for a comprehensive discussion of the issues on which we have deliberated so far. Depending on the outcome, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea-United States negotiations can either become a window of opportunity or an occasion that will hasten a crisis.\nThe historic Panmunjom Declaration on Peace, Prosperity and Reunification of the Korean Peninsula, which was well received by our friends in the north, south and overseas, as well as the international community, when it was submitted to the General Assembly just one year ago, is now at a standstill and has not even advanced to the main phase of its implementation. That can be attributed to the double-dealing behaviour of the South Korean authorities, who performed a handshake of peace before the people of the world but behind the scenes introduced ultra-modern offensive weapons and held joint military exercises targeting the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea with the United States.\nThe introduction of the latest offensive weapons and the United States-South Korea joint military exercises targeting the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea constitute flagrant violations and challenges to the implementation of the military agreements outlined in the Panmunjom Declaration, wherein the two sides agreed to completely cease all hostile acts against each other and refrain from building up armed forces. The improvement of inter-Korean relations can be achieved only when the South Korean authorities put an end to their worship of big Power and their policy of dependence on foreign forces that encroach upon the common interests of the nation and fulfil their responsibility to their nation by implementing the existing inter-Korean declarations in good faith.\nThe theme of the general debate for this session, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, reflects the most essential points of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by the States Members of the United Nations by 2030. The Government and the people of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea are now actively striving to fulfil the 2030 Agenda and achieve the SDGs through our vigorous struggle to build a powerful socialist country, uphold the banner of self-reliance, and, in 2020, submit the country\u2019s first voluntary national report on the progress it has made in implementing the SDGs to the United Nations.\nPractical measures should continuously be taken to actively assist developing countries in their sustainable development efforts by enhancing the roles of United Nations and other organizations within its system in economic and social areas. It is vital for all States Members of the United Nations to create a peaceful environment in which to fulfil the 2030 Agenda and achieve the SDGs.\nFrom that standpoint, my delegation extends its full support and solidarity to the Government and the people of Syria in their strenuous efforts to regain the Syrian Golan occupied by Israel, defend their national sovereignty against the destructive and subversive plots of hostile forces and achieve territorial integrity. We categorically reject the application of the Helms- Burton Act and the economic, trade and financial embargo imposed by hostile forces against Cuba and unreservedly support the efforts of the Cuban people to vigorously push forward with the building of their economy and national defence system. We also support the dynamic external activities of the Communist Party of Cuba and the Government of Cuba towards the expansion and development of their foreign relations. In the same vein, we extend our unwavering support and solidarity to the struggle of the Government and people of Venezuela to safeguard their sovereignty.\nMy delegation would like to take this opportunity to express its heartfelt gratitude to the delegations of the many countries that have extended unflagging support and encouragement to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and consistently accorded attention to the peace and development of the Korean peninsula. The Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will develop and strengthen the bonds of friendship and cooperation with all countries of the world that have a friendly attitude in their respect for our sovereignty. We will work hand in hand with all peace-loving forces of the world to establish a regime of lasting peace on the Korean peninsula."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I am pleased to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, and through him to our brother country of Nigeria for the confidence shown to him in his election to preside over the General Assembly at this current session. I wish him every success in this noble task. I would also like to express my appreciation and gratitude to Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her able leadership of the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session.\nI want to express my utmost appreciation to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his valuable efforts aimed at serving the purposes and principles of our Organization and upholding its noble ideals, and I renew my support for his various reforms and initiatives.\nI would also like to express my gratitude to the Secretary-General and the States Members of the United Nations for the kind gesture to Tunisia and its great departed leader of holding a meeting of the General Assembly on 1 August in memory of our late President Beji Caid Essebsi, the first democratically elected President in Tunisia (see A/73/PV.102). President Essebsi was indeed a great statesman who relied on his wisdom, foresight and vast political experience to lead us through dialogue and consensus, and with full respect for the rights and fundamental freedoms of all Tunisians, to the democratic transformation of our country.\nSince 2011, Tunisia has embarked on an irreversible democratic path that was consecrated in our 2014 Constitution. This democratic path is based on the supremacy of the rule of law, State institutions and support for individual and collective rights and freedoms in all areas. In the past few years, Tunisia\u2019s nascent experience has already shown that the path has been well taken, despite difficulties and the ongoing challenges. We saw proof of that in the smooth transfer of power following the death of President Essebsi, in full application of the provisions of our Constitution.\nIn the same context, on 15 September Tunisia held a first round of presidential elections under the supervision of the Independent High Authority for Elections and in the presence of international observers from various countries and regional and international organizations, all of whom attested to the transparency and integrity of the elections. We are confident that the second round of elections, which are to be held in few days, as well as the legislative elections to be held on 6 October, will be just as transparent and impartial, thereby proving that we have come a long way on the path to democracy in Tunisia and that there will be no going back. We hope that the elections will result in the enhanced representation of women and youth as a national choice reflecting the development and maturity of Tunisian society, reaffirming the importance of enabling these two groups to assume the highest positions in decision-making and public affairs.\nThe theme of the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly \u2014 \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d \u2014 reflects our firm belief in the work of multilateral mechanisms, foremost among which is the United Nations, as the best way to fulfil our joint hopes and aspirations for peace, comprehensive sustainable development and prosperity for all. These priorities will receive our most serious attention in the upcoming phase of our national development.\nThe gravity of the common development, social and environmental challenges facing our countries and peoples today confirms our urgent need to work together as an international community to entrench the principle of collective solidarity, with a view to putting an end to poverty and marginalization and to promoting social integration, empowering women, providing better education and fighting the effects of climate change. The States Members of the United Nations recognized this collective responsibility when they adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a common framework for addressing current challenges, securing the basic rights of our peoples and realizing safe, prosperous and sustainable societies.\nTunisia has adopted all these noble objectives and incorporated them into its five-year development plan for the period from 2016 to 2020. Accordingly, at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in July, we presented our first voluntary national review on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nIn the most recent period, Tunisia, eager to realize economic transformation, support social change and protect the path to democracy, has continued to implement its major structural reform programme. We have been able to achieve positive results in terms of improving development indicators, promoting internal and external investment, restoring the tourism sector and raising our standing in the human development indices, despite ongoing difficulties and regional instability. My country relies mainly on its capacities and potential in achieving those goals. We also seek to tackle challenges by developing cooperation and partnerships with all our friends and partners in various fields, with a view to serving mutual interests and contributing to greater security and stability at the regional and international level.\nGiven the particular importance we attach to the African dimension of our foreign policy, Tunisia reiterates its commitment to developing cooperation and partnership on the continent, while we seek to further African economic integration pursuant to Agenda 2063 of the African Union. From this rostrum, I want to renew our call to the international community to continue providing the support needed to help Africa fulfil its promise and potential and by generally strengthening development across the continent. This approach will open new horizons for African youth and enable young people to become active contributors to development and prosperity, while protecting them from falling victim to terrorism and illegal migration networks.\nViolent extremism and terrorism have been on the rise around the world. Their promoters have taken advantage of tensions and unresolved crises to threaten security and stability, targeting countries and community cohesion in order to undermine development and democracy. Efforts made at the national, regional and international level to combat terrorist organizations and abort their plans have led to substantial progress. Nevertheless, terrorist entities have been able to regroup and reposition themselves, exploiting ongoing conflicts and setting up smuggling networks in hotbeds of tension. We must therefore mobilize efforts and coordination activities beyond mere cooperation to root out the sources of terrorism, including working diligently to resolve crises and respect arms embargoes, in line with the relevant Security Council resolutions, as well as to provide adequate support to the countries at the forefront of combating this scourge.\nWe would also like to emphasize that fighting terrorism requires confronting extremist ideologies and shielding communities, especially young people, from social isolation and vulnerability to extremist recruitment. Tunisia has come a long way in implementing its national strategy to combat terrorism and violent extremism, which has helped us to attain significant security successes in fighting these dangerous phenomena, foiling terrorist plans and protecting democracy, security and stability.\nOur Arab region continues to witness unprecedented instability owing to ongoing conflicts and tensions, an increase in current threats and dangers, and the undermining of the capacity of some countries in the region, all of which hampers development. We believe that dangerous developments such as the military confrontations taking place in our sister country of Libya contribute to deepening the suffering of the fraternal people of that country, creating a serious threat to security and stability, not only in Libya, but in the region as a whole.\nGiven the special and deep historic ties between the fraternal peoples of Tunisia and Libya, and in the light of our sense of responsibility and duty to that country, we reiterate our call to our Libyan brothers and sisters to put an immediate end to hostilities and military operations and return to the political settlement process under the auspices of the United Nations. Following the initiative of President Essebsi and in full coordination with Algeria, Egypt and the international community, Tunisia reiterates its commitment to doing everything it can to support our Libyan brothers and sisters in overcoming the current crisis through dialogue, consensus and upholding the primacy of their national interests, with a view to reaching a comprehensive political settlement.\nThe long-standing Palestinian question remains at the top of the list of urgent regional and international issues. We believe that a just settlement of the Palestinian question represents the main path to restoring security and stability in the region.\nTo that end, on 31 March, Tunisia hosted the thirtieth regular summit of the League of Arab States, at which we stressed the central importance of the question of Palestine. Today, Tunisia stresses anew that it is absolutely vital to reach a just and comprehensive solution of the question, in which the fraternal Palestinian people regain without delay their legitimate rights and establish their own independent State within the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem at its capital, based on the agreed terms of reference, resolutions of international legitimacy, the Arab Peace Initiative and the principle of a two-State solution. We renew our call to the international community to shoulder its responsibilities, provide the protection the Palestinian people need, and preserve the legal and historic status of Jerusalem and the other occupied Palestinian territories.\nFurthermore, Tunisia calls for intensifying the international and regional efforts to find a political settlement to the crisis in Syria that preserves the sovereignty and integrity of this fraternal country, ends the suffering of its people and fulfils their aspirations towards living in peace and stability. In this regard, Tunisia welcomes the establishment of the Constitutional Committee, which gives hope for seeing an end to the conflict and the launch of an inclusive Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process, with a view to achieving the long-awaited settlement, in accordance with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015).\nWe also hope that the international community can help our brothers and sisters in Yemen achieve a political solution that preserves the integrity and sovereignty of their country and bring their humanitarian suffering to an end, thereby contributing to strengthening the security and stability in the Arabian Gulf.\nWith regard to the fraternal Republic of the Sudan, Tunisia once again welcomes the agreement reached between the Transitional Military Council and the Forces for Freedom and Change on administering the country during its transitional period. Tunisia stresses the importance of this agreement, which is a significant positive step in this latest phase in the history of the Sudan that will contribute to preserving the country\u2019s security, stability and territorial integrity and will meet the aspirations of its people for democracy, development and peace. In this context, Tunisia calls for lifting the sanctions imposed on the Republic of the Sudan, which will help to support the efforts of that brother country to make a successful transition to democracy and achieve economic and social development.\nTunisia is preparing to join the Security Council on 1 January 2020 as a non-permanent member for the period from 2020 to 2021. It will be the fourth time in our history that we have served on the Council. It is an important task for which we will count on the help and support of all our friends and partners. As a peace-loving nation, my country, which is known for its dedication to international legitimacy, will focus on preventive diplomacy in settling disputes by peaceful means and on promoting the role of women and young people in maintaining international peace and security. We intend to play our role in the Security Council in a constructive and responsible manner and to actively contribute to collective efforts to fulfil the Council\u2019s mandate.\nTunisia will do its utmost to promote dialogue, trust and rapprochement and achieve political settlements to current disputes and conflicts, particularly in the Arab and African regions, as quickly as possible, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the requirements of international legitimacy. As a member of the Security Council, my country will seek greater support for United Nations peacekeeping operations, including by striving to ensure that their missions conform to the desired goals and operate successfully within the means available. We also reiterate Tunisia\u2019s commitment to strengthening its own participation in peacekeeping operations.\nIn conclusion, we emphasize Tunisia\u2019s determination to continue working, in cooperation and coordination with all fraternal and friendly countries, to achieve the lofty objectives of the United Nations in the humanitarian arena and to further entrench the noble universal ideals set forth in the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour to be in this Hall for the opening of the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly. On behalf of the Republic of Nauru, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his recent assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. Let me assure him of my delegation\u2019s full cooperation and support as he steers our important work during this session. I would also like to thank Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her exceptional work as our outgoing President.\nAs it is my first time appearing before this body as the President of Nauru, allow me to recognize the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, and to commend him for his recent trip to the Pacific. I hope that it will be the first of several visits to our region, as the United Nations strives to become more responsive to the needs of the smallest and the most vulnerable.\nThe Secretary-General posed an incredibly important question to us in his opening address: referring to a world of disquiet and a growing fear of the people that they are being left behind, he asked: \u201cDo they believe, as leaders, we will put people first?\u201d (A/74/PV.3, p. 1). More than just a question, it was a poignant reminder that we gather here merely as servants of the people. His words should also serve as a challenge to all of us to build a more equitable and responsive Government at home and a more equitable and responsive multilateral system here at the United Nations.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s challenge resonates strongly in Nauru, where just last month we held elections that saw over half the seats in Parliament change hands. The people of Nauru have spoken loud and clear that they are seeking change. Indeed, after an economic collapse followed by many years of stagnation, far too many Nauruans have been left behind, and they are hungry for improvements in the quality of their lives. It is the highest priority of my Administration to restore to them what has been lost, return what has been taken and deliver on the promises that have gone unfulfilled for too long. By working with our partners towards our Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climate goals, I am confident that my Administration can succeed where previous ones have stumbled. And important work has already begun that promises to transform our country in meaningful ways.\nConstruction is moving forward on a major upgrade to our maritime port, which promises to deliver a much greater measure of food and energy security, as well as unlock new economic opportunities for the country. Our current arrangement requires that ships be moored at sea, with supplies ferried to shore by smaller vessels. This set-up is incredibly costly, and unpredictable weather can delay shipments of basic goods for days.\nJointly funded by the Green Climate Fund, the Asian Development Bank, Australia and the Government of Nauru, the new port has the potential to become a hub of commerce for our small island and the wider Pacific. Value-added services for fishing and shipping vessels will become viable in Nauru. It will become far easier for ships\u2019 crews to disembark, thereby providing local business owners with more business opportunities. The port will also open new markets to our exports and facilitate the development of new trade partners and ventures, all of which will provide a more diversified and reliable revenue stream for our economy.\nOur plan is to move forward with port construction in parallel with the development of the interior of our island. The Higher Ground initiative, as it is known, represents a historic opportunity to build our resilience to climate change and sea-level rise by moving housing and critical infrastructure away from our vulnerable coastal areas. An area equal to 80 per cent of our island, topside, rises many meters above sea level and sits undeveloped, providing a veritable blank canvas to reimagine sustainability on small islands. We are in the early stages of developing a master plan, which we look forward to sharing with committed partners in the near future.\nA new port facility and the Higher Ground initiative, along with an aggressive push on renewable energy and efficiency, serve as the major cornerstones of a sustainable-development strategy that has the potential to create good jobs, generate new revenue streams and radically improve our fiscal situation. More importantly, those efforts will finally create a wealth of new opportunities for our youth, something that has gone missing in Nauru for a generation.\nThe potential upside in Nauru is significant, but there remain some distressing barriers to fully capitalize on that moment. Early this year, Nauru presented its first voluntary national review at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. The voluntary- national- review process helped focus attention on the key gaps and challenges in the implementation of our national strategies. Health and education emerged as two areas that require urgent attention.\nThe President of the General Assembly has highlighted education as a key component of the vision for this session of the General Assembly; so it is too for my country. Teacher retention is a persistent challenge, and student truancy has risen to alarming levels. Also, the lack of good job opportunities that require a diploma has led some families to question the value of a quality education. I will therefore be calling for a review of the education system in Nauru to address the challenges and issues that we face, with a view to putting in place a quality education system that will provide all learners, young and old, with capabilities to become economically productive, develop sustainable livelihoods and enhance individual well-being. But, most importantly, the curriculum will embrace the Nauruan language, cultures and traditions.\nA healthy population is equally important to the health of a nation. Nauru suffers from some of the highest rates of non-communicable diseases in the world. Diabetes has taken the lives of far too many friends and family members. Some of this situation can be attributed to the astronomical price of fresh fruits and vegetables on the island, where even basic produce can cost as much as $16 per kilogram. Our water supply does not meet the standards of the World Health Organization, and we need to upgrade and climate-proof our health-care facilities. We are losing our loved ones and their expertise. We are losing our history. We will require multilateral assistance, or we risk losing our future as well.\nThe climate crisis is another challenge to our medium- and long-term viability, which is why climate action has been fully integrated into our development strategy. We take our international obligation to reduce emissions very seriously, but as a small and vulnerable country, our overriding priority must be resilience. Nauru already sits in a drought-prone region of the Pacific, and the frequency of droughts is projected to increase in the future. Improving our water security is therefore a key priority. We do not currently have a modern distribution system, so we rely on trucks to deliver water to on-site storage tanks. Installing new tanks and buying additional trucks can improve the situation in the short term, but our priority must be to install a water- and sewerage-reticulation system, as envisioned in our Nauru Water and Sanitation Master Plan.\nEradicating poverty and improving our way of life also revolves around the development of sustainable energy supplies. The importation of fossil fuels is a massive drain on our national coffers. I am therefore pleased to announce that much progress has been made in reaching our target of generating 50 per cent of our energy from solar power by 2020. This is an incredible feat for our small island, and I must attribute its success to the collaboration with our development partners, namely, the United Arab Emirates, New Zealand, the European Union and the Asian Development Bank, all of which I would like to acknowledge. I thank them very much.\nThe small island countries of the Pacific, including Nauru, are highly dependent on marine resources for its sustenance and economic development. The tuna fishery is worth $6 billion annually, and it is one of the best- managed fisheries in the world. I attribute the success to our award-winning organization \u2014 the parties to the Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Management of Fisheries of Common Interest \u2014 and the combined efforts of the Forum Fisheries Agency and the Pacific Community. I must also recognize the contributions of the outstanding men and women of the Nauru Agreement and its member countries, who have been persistent in their efforts and bold in their vision. However, as a word of concern, this fishery is projected to disperse and disappear from the waters of the nine member countries and territories of the Nauru Agreement in the not-too-distant future \u2014 another effect of the climate crisis. Sea-level rise is not only about an existential threat to our small and low-lying island. Climate change also threatens an economic Armageddon if the tuna fishery disappears.\nWith regard to small island developing States (SIDS), we have a very useful plan for improving our efforts in the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway, which highlights our special circumstances and development challenges. As small island developing States, we have always called for genuine and durable partnerships. Partnerships are certainly part of the solution, but they need to be mainstreamed, tailored and SIDS-friendly. Treating everyone the same does not mean that everyone is treated fairly, and this is why we continue to stress the special case of the small island developing States.\nWe applaud the efforts of the Secretary-General in spearheading the reform of the United Nations development system to be more effective and fit for purpose. The recent review of the multi-country office brings special attention to small islands, including in the establishment of the multi-country office in the North Pacific. For our subregion, this has been long overdue and is a positive step in the right direction towards ensuring longer term in-country engagement for durable institutional-capacity development. We look forward to working closely with the United Nations and our development partners in shaping the future that we want \u2014 one that is risk resilient and one where our children have a future.\nAs already mentioned, Nauru is taking very ambitious domestic action to address climate change, and while there are similar pockets of activity around the globe, the sum total leaves us far short of our goals as set forth in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. After decades of inaction and delay, many dangerous impacts are now unavoidable, all of which are well captured in the special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, entitled Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0 C. In small island developing States, many of those effects have been with us for quite some time. Climate change will be the defining security challenge of the century, and it requires a similarly robust multilateral response. For that reason, Nauru supports the proposal by the Pacific small island developing States to appoint a United Nations special representative for climate and security, whose work must begin with an assessment of the capacity of the United Nations to respond to climate disasters.\nIt is not enough to proclaim the virtues of multilateralism if we do not strengthen the commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals for citizens everywhere. Development is not sustainable if it is not fair and inclusive. We therefore call on the United Nations to embrace willing and capable partners like Taiwan in its SDG endeavours. Taiwan is ready to share the experience it has accumulated in reaching its level of success with its partner countries, including Nauru. In 2018 alone, Taiwan carried out development projects in various SDG fields.\nIt is high time that the United Nations lived up to the ideals it espouses. On that note, I want to thank the Government of Cuba for strengthening my country\u2019s health sector through the deployment of its very able medical brigade. Yet while that brigade is saving lives in Nauru, its own people continue to suffer extreme and unjust hardships under the economic, commercial and financial embargo that the United States has imposed on Cuba for nearly six decades. We call on the United States not to forget the friendly people of Cuba, who are hurting under its sanctions.\nThe work of the International Law Commission on the topic of sea-level rise in relation to international law is of tremendous importance and interest for the Pacific region. The issues around baselines and rising seas are critical, and we believe that it is in the interest of all States to give serious consideration to the effects of sea- level rise on the livelihoods of their peoples. Ensuring the security of our oceans is another problem that we must all tackle. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing represents a great threat and serious losses for our small economy. Those issues are enshrined in SDG 14, and in that regard we look forward to the convening of the second United Nations Ocean Conference in Portugal in 2020.\nMy administration is determined to give more than it receives and committed to being a champion for the weak, the vulnerable and the voiceless, taking nothing from them but rather giving them a better education system, a better health-care regime and renewable energy resources, while helping to equip them to navigate a future that is hopeful yet unpredictable. And while we cannot build that better future alone, we are looking forward to forging the strong partnerships and powerful multilateral system that we require. I am fully aware of the challenges that we face as a Pacific small island developing State, but I can also see the great opportunities that are now within our grasp. Here I would like to recall the words of the Secretary-General, when at the opening of the general debate (see A/74/ PV.3) he said, \u201cWe the leaders must deliver for we the peoples\u201d. May God bless the Republic of Nauru and may God bless the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Norway is a firm supporter of a rules-based multilateral order. We are a consistent partner in efforts to promote sustainable development, peace, security and human rights. The world needs strong multilateral cooperation and institutions to tackle global challenges such as climate change, cybersecurity and terrorism, and the United Nations needs to be strengthened so that we are better equipped to respond to the current challenges.\nNorway wants to take part in that responsibility. That is why we are a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period from 2021 to 2022. We are ready to serve and to build a more effective and transparent Council that will help us to solve our common challenges in a better way. We must all work to forge new partnerships. Those partnerships must build on common interests and objectives, regardless of geography or tradition. Norway supports a more representative Security Council that better reflects global realities. That includes the expansion of both permanent and non-permanent seats for Africa. We need reforms that ensure greater legitimacy and lead to better results for more people. The Secretary-General has shown great leadership in reforming the United Nations, and Norway will continue to support the implementation of his reforms, both politically and financially.\nThe consequences of instability affect us all. Areas of conflict and instability are breeding grounds for violent extremism and international terrorism, and those threats are not limited to the conflict areas themselves. Terrorist propaganda, incitement and resources can move across borders, both real and virtual, and there is no single ideology, religion or belief behind them. Global security threats require global responses. Broad international cooperation is essential among States, international organizations, non-governmental partners and the private sector. We also need to work within our communities to prevent radicalization. We must prevent the spread of terrorist content online without undermining human rights or freedom of expression. Norway is committed to the Christchurch Call to Action. We too have experienced the deadly outcome of online radicalization.\nCreating durable peace is crucial to long-term security. Norway\u2019s extensive experience in conflict resolution and peacebuilding guides our work in the United Nations. Since the end of the Cold War, mediation and conflict resolution have been cornerstones of our foreign policy. At the request of the parties, we have been engaged in efforts to resolve conflicts all over the world, in Colombia, Venezuela, the Philippines and Afghanistan, on the African continent and in the Middle East. We always seek lasting solutions. There is so much to be gained if we succeed. That is why Norway is willing to take the political risk of engaging early and why we persist in our efforts over time.\nFor example, we remain committed to a negotiated two-State solution between Israel and Palestine. As Chair of the International Donor Group for Palestine, Norway remains committed to strengthening the institutional foundation for a future Palestinian State. Norway also supports an inclusive peace process in Afghanistan. We welcome the progress made in talks between the United States and the Taliban and urge the parties to finalize an agreement, thereby opening the way for peace negotiations among Afghans.\nIn our international peace efforts, we do not work alone. We need partnerships and cooperation with the United Nations and other international organizations, with civil society and various interest groups. We know that the inclusion of women and minorities leads to stronger agreements, better implementation and greater legitimacy. Above all, the parties to a conflict must own the process. Norway is always impartial, but we are never value-neutral. We promote dialogue, listen to all parties and conduct pragmatic diplomacy. If we are elected, we will take that approach with us to the Security Council and put conflict resolution and peacebuilding high on the Council\u2019s agenda.\nIn a world where insecurity is increasing, United Nations peacekeeping must be adequate and relevant. Peacekeepers do the essential job of protecting civilians. Norway is an active supporter of the Secretary-General\u2019s Action for Peacekeeping initiative. We must develop innovative solutions to ensure that the United Nations has the quality and predictability it needs. One example is the rotational concept for military transport aircraft, which Norway initiated. By providing camp facilities, we also reduce costs for the United Nations and our rotation partners. Norway will continue to deploy high-end niche capacities on the ground, examples of which are our transport aircraft and specialized police team in Mali. We also provide staff officers and police advisers to the United Nations missions in South Sudan, Colombia and the Middle East, and will soon do so to the mission in Yemen.\nA strong relationship with the African Union (AU) is key to the success of United Nations peacekeeping in Africa. We should strengthen the strategic partnership between the United Nations and the African Union and secure sustainable and predictable financing of United Nations-mandated AU peace support operations.\nNorway is a champion of women and peace and security. We will continue to push for a better gender balance at all levels and in all fields of peacekeeping activities. The participation of women is a priority in all of Norway\u2019s peace and security efforts, our work in mediation and peacekeeping, our humanitarian response and our peacebuilding efforts, and will remain a priority for us at the United Nations. Conflict and insecurity increase the need for humanitarian efforts. We are all responsible for supporting those in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, but we must do more. We must work to ensure compliance with international humanitarian law and to strengthen protection efforts. The scale of sexual and gender- based violence in today\u2019s humanitarian crises is totally unacceptable. These terrible crimes, which too often go unpunished, must be stopped. Norway is working actively with partner countries to that end.\nIn recent years, we have seen an increase in the use of mines and in numbers of civilian casualties. The Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention remains as relevant as ever. Norway currently holds the presidency of the Mine Ban Convention and we are also a major donor to mine action.\nThe record numbers of internally displaced people around the world show no sign of decreasing. We need better strategies for addressing and reducing internal displacement and closer cooperation between the humanitarian and development sectors. Norway welcomes the forthcoming establishment of a high-level panel on internally displaced persons. We were one of the initiating countries, and the Secretary-General can count on our support. Norway has increased its humanitarian budget by more than 65 per cent since 2013, and we will maintain that high level of funding in the years to come.\nSecurity is closely linked to sustainable development. Conflict can reverse years of social and economic progress. Conflict prevention, peacekeeping and disarmament are vital if we are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and sustainable development is crucial if we are to reduce insecurity and conflict. Looking ahead to 2030, we have made encouraging progress, especially in terms of access to education, health services and clean energy, but we are still not on track. As the Secretary-General has pointed out, we must step it up. Norway is a consistent partner in this endeavour, allocating 1 per cent of its gross national income to international development aid. National ownership is crucial to the achievement of the SDGs, as is the mobilization of national resources. Stimulating the private sector, boosting job creation, building fair and effective tax systems and curbing illicit financial flows and corruption are paramount for success.\nNorway is proud to hold the current presidency of the Economic and Social Council, and financing for development is the main priority for our presidency. At the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is the pledge to leave no one behind. If we are to deliver on that commitment, development must be inclusive. We must reach the most vulnerable and marginalized. Norway is increasing its efforts to target those groups. We have consistently met the United Nations target of allocating 0.2 per cent of our gross national income to least-developed countries, and we have decided to increase that support further.\nIf elected to the Security Council, we will strive to ensure that the oceans do not become a new area of conflict. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides a legal framework for the oceans, ensuring predictability and stability and promoting peaceful international cooperation on the conservation and sustainable use of the world\u2019s oceans. It ensures freedom of navigation at sea. It is vital to ensure that all States fully implement it. The threats facing the oceans are unprecedented \u2014 loss of biodiversity, marine pollution, climate change and the overexploitation of marine resources are just some of the challenges we are seeing. At the same time, the oceans holds the key to achieving many of the SDGs. They are a vital source of food, energy, medicine and employment. If managed wisely, they offer huge potential for human development. Safeguarding the oceans is a shared responsibility and a matter of global urgency. That is why I initiated the High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy two years ago. Next year, at the second United Nations Ocean Conference, we will present a to-do list for the oceans. In October, we will host the Our Ocean conference. Norway has also launched a development aid programme to combat marine litter. We believe that ocean-based climate action can be a key to achieving our commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nIn Paris, we made a commitment to delivering results and outlining new ambitions for significant reductions in carbon emissions by 2020. That is what Norway is doing. Almost 30 years ago, we introduced a carbon tax in Norway, including in our petrol sector. My Government\u2019s budget proposal, to be presented next week, includes a 5 per cent increase in the tax on carbon emissions. With European Union emissions trading and our carbon tax, we are actively using market mechanisms to speed up the green shift in our economy. We are making it cheaper to be green and more expensive to pollute. The tax revenue will be used to reduce other taxes.\nWith close to 45 per cent of our new passenger cars now zero-emission vehicles, we are going from black to green in our passenger transport sector and we are also starting to reform our goods transport system. As a major shipping nation, we are working in the International Maritime Organization to reduce emissions from ships, and we are scaling up the construction of offshore floating wind developments. We must all do our part, and Norway will strengthen its nationally determined contribution by 2020.1 urge all other countries to do the same, because it is no longer possible to ignore the fact that climate change affects security. I am not talking about a scenario in the distant future. These security risks are already a reality for millions of people around the globe, and they are not going away.\nNorway supports the call to appoint a special representative for climate and security, and we believe that the Security Council must address climate security issues. Hurricane Dorian has reminded us of the devastating effects of the climate crisis, and Norway will continue to support the call for graduated countries to be eligible for official development assistance if they are severely affected by natural disasters. Some of the countries experiencing the worst effects of climate change are among the world\u2019s lowest emitters. The threat to small island States is existential. Climate-vulnerable countries such as Tuvalu, Dominica and the Seychelles should not bear the burden of adapting to this new reality alone. We are far apart geographically, but the oceans connect us. As an ocean country close to the melting Arctic ice, we share a common concern and can feel the urgency of the crisis. We must invest in resilience. That makes sense in economic terms, too.\nOur forests, and especially the rainforests, have a vital role to play. For many years, Norway has championed emission reductions globally through our climate and forest initiative. We have continued to reduce deforestation by working with a number of countries, including in the Amazon. The initiative agreed on in Leticia by the Amazon countries has our full support. Norway will be working with all of the countries in the region \u2014 including Brazil, I hope \u2014 in order to reach a point where deforestation comes to a halt. But reducing future emissions is of little immediate help to those already affected. Norway is therefore scaling up its support for climate change adaptation, resilience and food security in climate-vulnerable countries. This is an urgent task, and Norway will be an active partner in getting it done.\nMuch has changed since Norway\u2019s previous term on the Security Council in 2001 and 2002. But our commitment to solving common problems through the United Nations has not changed. We are a consistent partner at the United Nations. We will remain a strong supporter of a rules-based international order. Ours is and will continue to be an independent voice, and we will strive to find common ground. Norway is ready to serve again on the Security Council, and of course we hope for the support of all Member States.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour to convey the greetings of His Majesty the King and the people of Bhutan. I am very happy to represent the land of gross national happiness for the first time at the General Assembly. Last year, with aspirations to serve my country, my party and I campaigned on a commitment to narrowing the gap. In the language of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we pledged to leave no one behind. Therefore, the theme identified for the general debate is relevant to me and my country.\nIn order to narrow the gap, all our initiatives and decisions are focused on uplifting the poor. We are convinced that it is only through quality health care and relevant education that we can eradicate poverty in all its forms in the most sustainable manner. Our Constitution mandates free health care and education for all Bhutanese. Although we are a resource-constrained country, our leaders have always insisted on strengthening the social sector. It is an investment. As we all know, it is never an expenditure. I am happy to share that, in July, my Government made teachers the highest-paid civil servants in Bhutan. We aspire to motivate teachers and attract the best and the brightest to that noble profession. It is only through investment in teachers that we can bring about significant improvement in the quality of education, work is under way in schools to encourage learning beyond textbooks and exams.\nWhile it may not be new to many members, we are also in the process of shifting from summative to formative learning. The focus of our education goes beyond imparting skills and knowledge. We would like to ensure that our children learn to become good human beings, with qualities such as compassion, empathy and respect for nature. Those are the main elements of the gross national happiness-based curriculum we have in the schools in Bhutan. We plan to enhance the school curriculum with practical lessons on climate change so that every student becomes a climate champion.\nA nation can grow only on the strong foundations of a good health-care system. Among the many health-care initiatives, my country is gearing up to launch the 1,000 Golden Days Plus package, which will make sure that every child is taken care of, even before he or she is born \u2014 from conception to the antenatal check-ups for mothers, institutional delivery, post-natal care, immunization schemes and exclusive breastfeeding for a minimum of six months. All women civil servants in Bhutan are entitled to six months\u2019 maternity leave, with full pay. We will implement that package through financial incentives to all mothers during the 1,000-day period. That will enhance proper care for both mother and child, including their nutritional requirements. As we all know, the health of the mother is equally important during that critical period. After those 1,000 golden days, the Ministry of Health will hand over the precious child to the Ministry of Education for early child care and formal education. That is in addition to totally free secondary and tertiary health care. Both modern and traditional medicines are housed under one roof across the country.\nFor the services that are not available within Bhutan, we send our patients to high-end medical centres in neighbouring countries. The cost of those referrals are fully borne by the Government. That also includes organ transplants, cardiac surgeries and even joint replacements. I am also pleased to share that universal health coverage should not be too difficult to achieve in Bhutan by 2030.\nWith deepest appreciation and reverence to our visionary monarchs, I claim with pride that Bhutan is carbon-negative. The principles of gross national happiness \u2014 our philosophy of development with values \u2014 prevented us from exploiting our national resources for short-term gains. The Constitution mandates 60 per cent forest cover at all times; we have 72 per cent as of today. When climate change has become the greatest threat facing humankind today, is it not a wonder that a small country such as Bhutan had the foresight to take that path from early days?\nI am pleased to share that my Government has adopted a national human settlement policy that places importance on environment-friendly and energy-efficient construction. Our energy comes from hydropower, which we all know is renewable. We are also taking initiatives to replace fossil fuels with clean energy. For instance, we have launched a package to procure 300 electric taxis, with support from the Global Environment Facility. That may appear to be few as an absolute number, but it is almost 10 per cent of the number of taxis in my capital.\nIronically, those contributions and initiatives are rendered futile by the choices of others. I personally feel that those who can are not doing enough. As a practising surgeon, I always share the following analogy. We advise patients to refrain from ill habits. Some listen but most do not. They later return with a terminal illness. By then it is too late to intervene. Such is the health of our environment. If we do not act now, we will leave an incurable, diseased planet. And none of us wants that.\nOur focus on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) resonates well with the principles of gross national happiness. It is perhaps for that reason that Bhutan is well on track to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We have in place a joint parliamentary committee comprised of members from both the upper and lower houses. In addition, Bhutan presented its voluntary national review of the SDGs in July 2018. At the SDG summit held earlier this week, we committed to submitting another review in 2020. Just as we did for the Millennium Development Goals, Bhutan aspires to be an early achiever of the SDGs too.\nBhutan is set to graduate from the least developed country (LDC) category in 2023, coinciding with the completion of our ongoing five-year development plan. We have charted out a clear transition plan for graduation. To that effect, my Government has identified nine flagship programmes in critical sectors, which target multiple SDGs, including sustainable water management, waste management, organic agriculture, digital transformation, quality education and health care and, most important, economic diversification. We are mindful that Bhutan was found eligible for graduation based on social and income indicators during two consecutive triennial reviews. However, Bhutan did not meet the economic vulnerability index threshold either time. Today, as we prepare to graduate from LDC status, our last-mile challenges include eradicating poverty, addressing income inequality and ensuring that vulnerable segments of the population do not fall back into poverty due to climate-change hazards and natural disasters. In addition, we are also confronted with inadequate resources and a lack of institutional capacity. I personally feel that the targets of SDG 17 will help my country graduate on a sure footing; I request our development partners to consider that.\nAt a time when the relevance of multilateralism is often questioned, Bhutan\u2019s faith in the United Nations remains unwavering. The challenges we face as a global community are too numerous and multifaceted for individual States to tackle on their own. In order to move ahead, we must work together as one global community, with the United Nations at the forefront. From our perspective, there is no alternative to multilateralism. At the same time, the United Nations must also evolve and keep up with changing realities. In particular, Bhutan considers that the existing structure and composition of the Security Council do not reflect the current realities and circumstances of the world. The reform of the Security Council must go hand-in-hand with the wider reforms of the United Nations system in order for the Organization to remain legitimate, effective and credible. Bhutan has long supported the aspirations of the Group of Four to serve as permanent members of an expanded Security Council, with, of course, Africa also appropriately represented.\nSimilarly, in our interconnected world, we realize that international peace and security are shared responsibilities. Despite our constrained resources and other limitations, Bhutan joined the fraternity of troop-and police-contributing countries in 2014. Since then, our engagement in peacekeeping operations have gradually increased. As the first country to sign the Rapid Deployment Level agreement in December 2017, our pledged contingent is ready to be deployed to serve United Nations interests unconditionally.\nA few hours from now, I will board a flight for the long journey back home. I return with renewed confidence that Bhutan continues to enjoy goodwill and support from the international community. On behalf of my King, my Queen and the people of Bhutan, I offer sincere prayers for world peace."

        "file_name": "ALB_74_2019.txt",
        "file_text": "Over the more than seven decades since this rostrum was raised to bear the weight of the entire world\u2019s concerns, and the more than half century since the gloomy past of the Cold War began, we have heard in this Hall bright promises of democratic reconstruction \u2014 such as in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall \u2014 and of caring for people in need, as was the case with the Kosovo Albanians facing genocide in the late 1990s. Yet even here, in the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, this Hall has once again been witness to a dozen complaining voices, various diverging world views and a substantial number of predictions of looming threats.\nMany years after the end of history was announced and vast enthusiasm for globalism prevailed, we have been through the worst economic recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s, experienced a rise in violent extremism and terrorism that began on 11 September 2001, when Al-Qaida killed nearly 3,000 innocent people, and been exposed to climate change, whose effects are felt in the air we breathe in the twenty-first century. While globalism can be criticized or endorsed, that does not actually matter in the end. What matters is that it exists. Nationalism might sound like an attractive alternative at times, and it can sometimes seem so, especially nowadays. But the range of issues that we face together is essentially transnational. Willy-nilly, we find ourselves in a context in which the distinction between national interests and global priorities is largely blurred if not entirely erased.\nWe live in a world in which, alongside its increasing opportunities, new threats are emerging on the horizon and new risks coming to the fore. Even worse, many of those threats and risks, however clearly they are expressed, do not usually meet with the right response. We live under an ozone layer that is thinning and in a climate that is melting icebergs. While security mechanisms are increasingly sophisticated and intelligence mechanisms have been improved, illegal migration, radicalization, extremism, organized crime and human smuggling have challenged not merely our security environment but the quality of our democracy. The range of issues clearly requires not just the mobilization of national capacities but much more efficient interaction at the transnational level.\nLast Friday I had to interrupt my flight to New York after landing in Frankfurt, because Albania had been struck by a powerful earthquake. My country was severely damaged, but no lives were lost, thank God. As if that were not enough, just before the aftershocks subsided, we were assailed by a storm and a torrential downpour that made the situation even more horrible for our vulnerable citizens.\nScience has progressed a great deal, and whether for good or bad goes well beyond the scope of this discussion, but it has not progressed to the point of being able to predict the arrival of earthquakes. However, while that may be the case with earthquakes, it is certainly not the case with regard to climate change, whose destructive effects can be tackled in advance in a number of ways. Needless to say, no country on Earth is immune to nature\u2019s distorted hostilities or strong enough to cope with them alone. I am therefore pleased to be able to inform the Assembly that Albania has been working hard to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 45 per cent in the next decade and achieving net- zero emissions by 2050, in accordance with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In addition, we have adopted a national climate change strategy, a mitigation action plan for greenhouse-gas emissions and a national climate-change adaptation plan, making Albania the first and so far the only country in the Western Balkans with a consolidated strategy on climate change.\nWe have undertaken many other initiatives to keep our skies blue and make our future horizon greener. New energy-efficiency standards in construction, a forthcoming ban on non-degradable plastic bags, a moratorium on hunting and logging and a growing tree-planting campaign are only a part of our ambition to make Albania a leading example for the green agenda. Those endeavours also serve as a reminder that climate action requires daily commitment. Not only is that true of action on climate change, it is certainly also true of the other great concern that we all share in today\u2019s world \u2014 security.\nAn experienced army general once said that there are two types of countries in the world \u2014 small countries, and countries that are not aware that ultimately they too are small. Albania might be a small country from a global perspective, but it is aware of its global responsibility. During Albania\u2019s decade of NATO membership, and regardless of the vast challenges we have faced, we have deployed troops to Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Latvia, Mali and Afghanistan in order to make our mark in a world that should be safer and in hopes of a brighter future. Only a few months ago, two Albanian soldiers serving in NATO\u2019s Enhanced Forward Presence in Latvia lost their lives in the line of duty while dismantling explosives. Albania proudly remembers them today, at the world\u2019s largest gathering of nations. Their martyrdom is a universal reminder of the noblest of causes, the protection of freedom and security and the provision of security to maintain freedom.\nDespite that tragic loss, which cut deeply and has left a void in our souls, Albania is still firmly willing and ready to take up new responsibilities in Iraq in support of that country\u2019s efforts to achieve stability. Even after the triumph of the defeat of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant was declared, every country in the Assembly should be aware of the risks that come with post-caliphate metamorphosis. The small terrorist groups that may seem to have finally disappeared can still retain their capacity to launch brutal attacks. Neither the size of their territory nor their geographic location should prevent the world\u2019s nations from carrying out their responsibilities and meeting their obligations.\nAlbania is particularly concerned about Iran\u2019s destabilizing behaviour in the Middle East, but also by its often disruptive actions with regard to the Iranian opposition community, which has suffered despicable massacres and which my country is now generously hosting. We have had to respond firmly to various illicit activities against our national security interests and we stand firmly with countries that have been hurt by such activities, whether at sea or on land. No country is too small to take on its global responsibilities, regardless of its population, size or geographic location.\nAlbania will build on its multilateral experience by taking on and increasing its multilateral commitments. Next year Albania will chair the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for 2020, with a special focus on the protracted conflicts in and around Ukraine, Nagorno Karabakh and Transnistria, to mention only a few. Albania will also devote special attention to fighting any form of discrimination, particularly anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, by relying on its exemplary interreligious tolerance, and by strengthening the role of women in peacebuilding activities, reflecting our nation\u2019s feminist spirit. For a century Albania has provided a historical example of how harmony among Muslims, whether Sunni or Bektashi, Christians, whether Catholic or Orthodox, and Jews is not only possible but also socially fruitful. Though we are often regarded as a Muslim-majority country, we are also the land of Mother Teresa, now Saint Teresa, who is our highest national symbol and most distinguished daughter. Perhaps it is her human solidarity and commitment to universal goodness that should still guide us as we face the great threats to peace and security all over the world today.\nGiven its exceptional historical record and now very mature multilateral experience, Albania is no longer concealing its ambition to serve as a non-permanent member of the Security Council in 2022 and 2023. I therefore call on all nations here today to take positive note of our Security Council bid for 2022. However, having global ambitions does not mean ignoring regional issues. My region of the Western Balkans has a long history of oppression and conflict and suffered under two of the cruellest evils of the twentieth century, communist dictatorships and inter-ethnic wars. As a result, while in the heart of Europe, the Western Balkans is its most underdeveloped region, with a number of disputes that still continue. We especially celebrated the Prespa agreement, which ended a decades-long dispute between Greece and North Macedonia. Albania was actively engaged in making it possible, and we see it as an inspiring example for the settlement of other ongoing disputes.\nIn order to build stronger ties and streamline cooperation by building a road map for connectivity and mobility in our region, Albania is working closely with Kosovo, Montenegro and North Macedonia, and looks forward to working with Serbia, too. However, while the climate for regional cooperation has improved significantly, the open dispute between the Republic of Kosovo and Serbia is still an obstacle to the entire region\u2019s potential for development. Regardless of the issues that a young democracy like that of Kosovo might naturally face, it is quite clear that more than a decade after declaring independence, the Republic of Kosovo has managed to build a vibrant democracy and prove itself a reliable regional partner that has never wavered in its Euro-Atlantic commitment.\nThe time has come for all members of the Assembly \u2014 above all our Serbian friends \u2014 to recognize Kosovo\u2019s independence, do justice to history and acknowledge reality, as the only reliable basis for building a better, common future. I therefore call on Serbia to recognize that an independent Kosovo is a reality that cannot be reversed and therefore to stop living in denial and make history \u2014 for themselves and for the world \u2014 by accepting reality. It is also important that Kosovo be given the opportunity to join all international and regional organizations that any independent sovereign country in the world has a right to join.\nIt is my sincere hope and daily commitment that the countries of the Western Balkans will manage to break once and for all with their past and work together to build their economies, integrate their markets and provide a better future, thinking and working for their children and ceasing to talk about their ghosts from the past. In that regard, I must underline a fact that I have stressed repeatedly to my European colleagues, which is that it is inexcusable that Kosovo, a country of just 2 million people, remains the only country in Europe today whose people remain isolated from the entire network of the visa-liberalization regime.\nSince 2014, more than 100 million people have been added to the multitudes of people who can enter the European Union (EU) without a visa. How is it possible that the EU can still hold 2 million people hostage who have fought hard for their freedom and are firmly committed to the EU perspective? I urge the EU to stop this nonsense. On that note, I must also emphasize that the stability, security, prosperity and democracy of the region can be guaranteed only by adopting the European perspective. For this reason, a positive response to Albania and North Macedonia\u2019s ambitions for opening accession talks will not be a mere acknowledgment of their merits, but also strategically the wisest decision by the EU for the EU.\nWhen the first man stepped on the moon in the late 1960s \u2014 which, by the way, was a sign not only that humankind was expanding the limits of its universe, but also that it was heading into its future \u2014 Albania\u2019s universe was extremely narrow and its orientation was backward. As the most isolated country on earth, Albania was the North Korea of Europe of its day. While the heritage of the past still affects the dynamics of our country in multiple ways, Albania has today joined the nations of the world in trying to build a brighter future by carrying out its institutional tasks in accordance with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. My Government considers the implementation of the 2030 Agenda to be an important part of Albania\u2019s vision for development and integration. Indeed, we see it as an important complement to the agenda determined by our efforts to join the European Union. Our national strategy for development and integration combines our agenda for European integration with the 2030 Agenda.\nWe are committed to both these agendas for a very simple reason. We believe that they constitute a road map for modernizing our country and institutions and for elevating our society. Among the most important milestones of that agenda are our action plans on Roma \u2014 Egyptians \u2014 and on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and persons with disabilities. They contain concrete plans that are being implemented in order to guarantee the rights of these groups, which have very often been unfairly and unjustly marginalized. In addition, we have made great progress in terms of gender equality, with more women than ever before represented in Government, Parliament, regional councils and public administration. I am very proud to say that there are more women than men in my Government, which a good indicator of success.\nIn his memorable visit to Tirana in 2014, Pope Francis advised the youth of Albania to fly higher and higher and higher but never to forget their nest. While that sounds almost like divine advice, it is also an absolutely realistic demand, not only for Albania but it would seem for the entire region. In the context of our broad ambition to convert the brain-drain phenomenon into a process of brain circulation, we are pursuing special programmes to enable the members of our diaspora to anchor their futures in their country of origin.\nThere is one more element that I would be remiss not to mention, which is Albania\u2019s unprecedented justice reform. The process of conducting a major clean-up by removing corrupt judges and prosecutors from the system, as well as establishing new judicial institutions tailored to tackling corruption and organized crime at the highest levels, is transforming the entire face of the country. The decades of corruption in the judiciary not only prevented justice from being served, it also became an impediment to ensuring that justice was the rule of our daily existence as a society. As the new justice system gradually takes shape and becomes fully operational, we hope that it will seriously curtail all acts of corruption and abuse of power and that it will finally ensure the triumph of a sense of justice and the rule of law throughout my country, a country I love deeply and am proud to represent in this Hall today.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an immense honour for me to address the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. When the United Nations was established by our predecessors back in 1945 the main purpose was to reduce tensions and avert another conflict after the Second World War.\nToday, our Organization faces the multiple challenges confronting humankind. The United Nations should give hope to the people of the world and be alive to the multifaceted issues through the promotion of safety, peace and security. The past seven decades have shown us that multilateralism is an essential ingredient of a peaceful world. In pursuing that mandate over the years, the United Nations has developed into an important organ for fostering collective action to respond to today\u2019s global challenges. It is that collective endeavour that has brought about cooperation and supported a global economy aimed at lifting more than a billion people out of poverty.\nHowever, as we are all aware, threats to peace and violent conflicts, including mass atrocities, still exist in different regions of the world. We note with sadness that some of those conflicts and other inhumane suffering are sponsored by those who believe they have the right to dictate and impose their ideologies on other nations of the world. We call upon the Secretary-General to act swiftly and discourage such behaviour because it is against the objectives of our Organization. We are all equal, irrespective of country size and economic power.\nThe States Members of the United Nations must speak in one voice to defuse all tensions, while encouraging dialogue and protecting civilians and the innocent victims of conflict. My plea is particularly directed to the regions of the world where there are still pockets of conflict. We should all work towards an integrated, prosperous, peaceful and multilateral world.\nThe urgency of the theme of the general debate for the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, cannot be overemphasized. In effect, the theme underscores and reiterates the inescapable need to make the United Nations even more relevant to all people at times like these.\nWe encourage the Secretariat to note the proposals made by the leaders of the world and put them into action. Humankind is looking to us to change its living landscape for a better future. It is imperative that we take up the multilateral agenda with a renewed commitment to ensuring peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies for future generations.\nMost contemporary challenges such as terrorism, climate change, migration, transnational organized crime and many others, cannot be effectively addressed without multilateral cooperation. That will require the inclusion and participation of all Member States through cooperation, dialogue and the reform of existing organs where needed. We therefore implore the General Assembly to play its role in bridging the gaps and promoting collective action. That can be achieved only through close coordination and collaboration with the Organization and all its agencies to address all international issues that deserve our attention.\nGlobally, eradicating poverty remains our priority and a daunting challenge, especially in the face of climate change and food insecurity, to mention but a few obstacles. We acknowledge and appreciate the actions taken by the international community to mitigate the situation. We want to stress that more investment is required to build strong societies and social protection systems that will ensure the inclusion of special-interest groups affected by poverty. While we have a responsibility to channel a significant proportion of national expenditures into social protection programmes, developing countries actually need financing for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in order to transform their economies and social fabric.\nAs an example, financing development for a country such as Eswatini may become challenging over time with global economic austerity. That reality places constraints on the extent to which our nation can mobilize resources for development at a time when massive investments are needed to achieve the SDGs by 2030. Eswatini is enhancing its resource mobilization strategies by exploring cooperation with the global community, and we seek the support of the United Nations in that endeavour. It is evident that the integration of African economies, through innovative approaches, creates many opportunities to achieve the SDGs. Such efforts are important in generating new ideas, projects and ways to enable voices to be heard and to drive innovation and promote development.\nThe recent launch of the African Continental Free Trade Area will greatly assist in the fight to eradicate poverty on the continent. Likewise, with the launch of the African E-trade platform anticipated in the next few weeks, we are confident that steps such as these will usher in a new era in the lives of our people. They will bring the impetus we need to change the landscape and economies of Africa. As a continent, we are focusing on building and growing our economies, and with those new initiatives well established, we will be able to increase our trade with the entire world and become self-sufficient. We therefore urge the United Nations to lend its full support to the initiatives launched by Africa to ensure that the continent improves the lives of its people and becomes the Africa we want.\nThe African continent continues to face challenges beyond conflict, and those are health issues, including diseases such as Ebola, HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and many others, and to overcome them we need significant funding. After making some progress in our fight against those pandemics, we are unfortunately sometimes confronted with new outbreaks, reversing the gains made. Yet our vision as African States is that all those epidemics should be eliminated so that we can focus on our development goals. Unfortunately, developing countries continue to face significant gaps in funding, making it difficult to adequately detect and respond to problems while still providing basic health services and building the capacity of the health sector.\nAfrica carries a high burden of malaria cases. Although there have been improvements, Africa needs additional funding if it is to make progress in eradicating malaria on the continent. The Kingdom of Eswatini is among 21 countries globally with the potential to reverse indigenous malaria transmission by 2020, thereby achieving the goal of malaria elimination. In my capacity as Chair of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, I am delighted to announce that early this year we launched the End Malaria Fund, a public-private partnership aimed at closing the funding gap and putting an end to the disease by 2022. We are pleased to note that in the wake of Eswatini\u2019s establishment of a malaria fund, many more African countries have followed suit and are actively launching similar funds. We are also proud to inform the world that the Kingdom continues to make progress in ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2022. However, we still need support in our prevention efforts and in prolonging the lives of those who are already living with the disease. We are grateful to the friends of the Kingdom who continue to support us in addressing those challenges, particularly the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. They support our initiatives to eliminate AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, while building stronger health systems that will enable us to achieve universal health coverage.\nClimate change has serious implications for development prospects everywhere, and even more so on the African continent, where climate extremes have continued to intensify. As we have witnessed in the Southern African Development Community region, natural disasters know no boundaries, and the worst affected countries lack the resources and capacity adequate to ensuring preparedness and responding to the devastation and impact of such disasters, including with respect to infrastructure and lives lost. It is Eswatini\u2019s view that countries should work together to devise sound contingency plans aimed, first, at establishing a permanent regional disaster fund to help create a cushion against the effects of natural disasters, and secondly, at setting up subregional humanitarian hubs that will be equipped to respond swiftly to disasters. That will mitigate the impact, save lives and ensure that the countries affected can recover rapidly. The price of not taking prompt action to address climate change is too high.\nThe Kingdom of Eswatini is fully involved in working towards a knowledge-based economy through science, technology and innovation infrastructure in a bid to facilitate research and enhance development. Our Royal Science and Technology Park is doing notable work in advancing scientific research and also promotes start-up enterprises and innovation labs. We appreciate the friends of the Kingdom of Eswatini who support us in those initiatives. We are still seeking more support to strengthen our knowledge-based programmes, as they will help us to attain our national Vision 2022 and the Sustainable Development Goals.\nWe are committed to becoming a leading pioneer and role model in achieving the SDGs in Africa. We remain confident that the SDGs and the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 will continue to give us the proper guidance and the impetus we need to eradicate poverty and create inclusive and sustainable development for all. We commend the close partnership between the United Nations and the people of Eswatini, which guarantees that the SDGs are fully integrated into our planning processes. In that regard, we have launched a five-year strategic road map for the period from 2019 to 2023 that will ensure sustainable economic development, financial stability and growth, with a view to improving the quality of life of Emaswati. The road map outlines five key sectors based on their ability to grow our gross domestic product, create employment and mobilize revenue \u2014 manufacturing, agriculture, mining and energy, tourism and education, and information and communications technology.\nNo nation can develop beyond its educational capacity, particularly that of its teachers. As we all strive to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all, we must also give the necessary assistance to countries that need help in developing their educators\u2019 capacities. In that regard, we must guarantee access to free and quality primary and secondary education, as well as affordable and inclusive vocational and technical education, while working to make opportunities available to disabled boys and girls. I am pleased to share with the global community that the Kingdom of Eswatini has embarked on those initiatives, and we are seeing positive results.\nAs we all know, young people face a variety of challenges that require a comprehensive, coordinated and multilateral response. We are a youthful world, with more than half the global population aged under 30. We therefore need strategies to encourage the labour market to absorb the growing young working class and ensure that it is appropriately trained for the needs of our markets. We also have to develop programmes aimed at increasing the opportunities for our young people to start their own businesses.\nThe United Nations bid to leave no one behind will remain elusive if we continue to deprive other nations of the world the opportunity to play a pivotal role in the affairs of this universal Assembly. We firmly believe that Taiwan is essential to the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Its inclusion is a crucial step in realizing the pledge stipulated in the preamble to resolution 70/1, adopted on 25 September 2015. We once again call on the United Nations to uphold the principle of universality, continue its multilateral efforts towards total inclusion and allow Taiwan to participate in relevant efforts on a dignified and equal footing.\nI want to reiterate how keen my Kingdom is to prioritize the overall implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Africa\u2019s Agenda 2063. Like other middle-income countries, one of the challenges we face is a decline in official development assistance due to our categorization, which has worked against our development and poverty-reduction efforts. To that end, we strongly advocate for a reassessment of realities on the ground when official development assistance is allocated to the countries most in need.\nFinally, we pledge our support to an effective multilateralism aimed at ensuring inclusion, promoting quality education, peace and security for all and lifting countries up from all forms of poverty. Addressing all the challenges that the United Nations family is facing is our first commitment. We want to recognize the Secretary-General and his entire staff for continuing to steer the affairs of the Secretariat with a focused commitment to United Nations efforts in pursuit of global peace and security, equity, justice and inclusiveness in all matters of the Organization. We are firmly convinced that together we will overcome every issue that seems impossible, as we continue to strive for unity, solidarity and mutual benefit and, above all, to galvanize all our efforts to achieve a better world for everyone, everywhere.\n"

        "file_text": "I am honoured, on this occasion, to represent His Excellency Mr. Andry Nirina Rajoelina, President of the Republic of Madagascar, and the entire Malagasy people. Taking the floor before the General Assembly is both a privilege and a duty, as our exchanges and contributions will forge the way forward and the future of our shared vision of a world of peace, prosperity and a United Nations of peoples.\nI join those who spoke before me in sincerely congratulating the President of the General Assembly on his election. I am convinced that his conviction in the merits of, and commitment to, multilateralism will ensure concrete progress in addressing the various challenges that face the Organization, in line with the main theme of the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly.\nLet us no longer bury our heads in the sand. Our world has been torn apart for several decades by unprecedented crises, conflicts and ever-increasing inequalities. Every day, our planet is incrementally further threatened by our reckless excesses and irresponsible actions. Of course, we are committed to marshalling our strength to end all forms of poverty, combat inequality and address climate change, while also ensuring that no one is left behind. We have undeniably worked hard at all the major summits and conferences to achieve equitable and lasting human and economic development. However, the reality is that that is no longer enough.\nTogether we will need to redouble our efforts to eradicate poverty and promote and ensure quality education and inclusion. We will need to strengthen and coordinate our efforts to combat climate change, the consequences of which have become increasingly felt, and which unfortunately greatly worsen poverty and inequalities among peoples today. Compensating for decades of hesitation, and even inaction, is a responsibility incumbent upon every one of us.\nBeyond words and statements, it is our obligation to do as much as humanly possible in terms of our initiatives and work. We will have to walk together to breathe new life into multilateralism, in which we believe, so that we, the peoples of the United Nations, can continue to always know what we stand for through the Organization, its values and, above all, its work.\nWith regard to my country, Madagascar, it is integrating ways of meeting the global challenges, with which it is familiar as a Member of the United Nations, within its own national ambitions and projects. I therefore reaffirm that, under the leadership of His Excellency President Rajoelina, Madagascar has set for itself the major goal of achieving emerging country status in the coming years in order to close the development gap.\nMadagascar faces considerable challenges. Major structural and sectoral reforms are currently being launched, which we will pursue with unprecedented commitment and determination. The first challenge is that of consolidating the democratic process and governance and strengthening national unity. The Government is committed to and is implementing a policy of promoting and respecting individual and collective freedoms, respect for the separation of powers and the emergence of a responsible and dynamic civil society in which young people and women play an active role. Since the beginning of his term, the President of the Republic of Madagascar has deemed governance issues a national priority \u2014 based on the promotion of democracy, human rights, the fight against corruption, and social justice. That is clearly stipulated in our new general State policy, the urgency of which is undisputed. That is why the Government fully supports and takes action to implement it.\nThe State acts today as institutional guarantor to ensure respect for human rights in Madagascar \u2014 one of its main policy areas. To that end, the Malagasy Government is working assiduously to ensure that such issues are addressed appropriately and responsibly, both in terms of one-off news events and of fundamental issues related to the political and strategic dimensions of the issue of respect for human rights in Madagascar, such as security in rural and urban areas, the judicial and prison system, decentralization, the health-care and nutrition system and the education system. That involves complex undertakings that require new strategic guidelines and innovative and coordinated initiatives, as defined in our general State policy.\nOne of the first measures taken by the current Administration was restoring peace and security, in particular to protect those living in rural areas from the scourge of the dahalo, bandit fighters who steal cattle in the remote areas of Madagascar. Dahalo use deadly and unacceptable practices, and nothing stopped them until recently. They attack villages, rape women and girls, kill men and boys and steal herds to fuel an illegal zebu-trafficking network. It must stop. Fortunately, law enforcement officers are shouldering their responsibility to protect the lives and possessions of the population by making the ultimate sacrifice to win that fight.\nI reaffirm the full commitment of the President of Madagascar and the entire Government to respect and promote human rights. The Government\u2019s action is therefore in line with the need to guarantee the safety of the people and property and ensure equitable justice for all. We strongly condemn all forms of violence, regardless of the source, perpetrated outside of the law, and all forms of abuse of authority. That is why any deviation from those standards, in particular by some law enforcement officers, has led to criminal, administrative and disciplinary sanctions.\nPrevention is also one of the pillars of our peace and security policy. Multiple initiatives and actions have been taken, in particular through the reform of the security sector, the redeployment of security forces, along with the construction of new local operating bases, the improvement of equipment for intervention units, the development of a bovine microchip programme, providing location-tracking devices for cattle, an export ban on zebus and the construction of new prisons to meet international standards for better prison conditions that are respectful of human rights.\nIn line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, education and health are also among my country\u2019s national priorities. Madagascar recognizes that its development capacity is based on its capacity to educate. To ensure that every citizen can participate in the life of the nation, the Malagasy Government is committed to ensuring education for all. Inclusive, equitable and high-quality education for all is an inalienable human right. It is also a measure of a society\u2019s harmonious and sustainable development and the stability of a country.\nWe are committed to ensuring that all girls and boys, equally, complete quality primary and secondary education, which guarantees that their education was genuinely useful. With that in mind, we took the decision to build new local schools across the country, continue recruiting and training teachers, provide students with textbooks and tablets and continue the school-canteen programme for vulnerable schools to ensure good school retention rates. In addition, Madagascar is now voluntarily committed to making health care accessible to all, by building new local hospitals, improving the quality of medical facilities and services through existing training in health-care, recruiting health-care personnel, strengthening the skills of medical teams and improving the management of the public health system, in particular by implementing the universal health coverage policy.\nThe second challenge faced by emerging economies is that of ensuring inclusive economic growth that seeks to reduce poverty and inequality. Our Government firmly believes that economic development is possible because human capital remains a priority and is now at the heart of all our initiatives and actions. Madagascar is a young, dynamic nation, led by a strong, visionary and inclusive leadership. With that conviction, Madagascar therefore aims to put an end to the paradox of being a country with recognized potential but marked by unprecedented poverty, insecurity and inequality. Making up for lost time in our national development process, which the country has endured for nearly 60 years now, lies at the heart of the vision and commitment of President Rajoelina.\nThe Madagascar plan for the period 2019 to 2023 will lead our country in its structural and dimensional transformation to accelerate its economic growth. Based on a five-year strategic framework, Madagascar essentially seeks to double its electricity production by developing its renewable energy capacities; develop 100,000 hectares to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production; support a diversified industrialization programme to ensure added value in priority value chains, such as tourism, transport, mines, agroindustry, fishing, animal husbandry and cultural industries; promote entrepreneurship among women and young people; build 50,000 new homes across the country; build and rehabilitate roads, including in rural areas, ports, airports and markets throughout Madagascar; provide the population with access to drinking water and sanitation; build new sports and cultural infrastructure; promote decent work for all, with social protection mechanisms for all workers, and constantly improve the business climate, while ensuring that savings are passed on not only to private investors but also the people and the State.\nMadagascar genuinely seeks to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. My Government is working to ensure the effective use of methods and approaches and the efficient use of resources. The State made the decision to rely on its own strength to mobilize domestic resources to fund its development plan. Nevertheless, Madagascar also relies on international solidarity, support and opportunities in order to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.\nThe third major challenge is the environment. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change enabled all signatory countries to make a concrete commitment to combating rising temperatures through nationally determined contributions. However, one cannot but note that all the contributions to which the signatory countries have so far committed themselves are not sufficient to achieve the objectives set out in the Agreement. Based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, I call on the signatory countries to assume their responsibilities so as to ensure that the necessary efforts and resources are mobilized with a view to reverse the current trend, because the most vulnerable countries are often the ones that bear the brunt of climate change.\nDespite being responsible for less than 1 per cent of the world\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions, Madagascar is feeling the full impact of climate change, including increasingly frequent and violent tropical cyclones, drought, flooding and disruptions to the agricultural calendar. However, Madagascar is aware of its responsibility and is now showing firm political will in the collective effort to mobilize against climate change. In that context, Madagascar is relentlessly pursuing efforts to preserve and conserve biodiversity and existing natural and environmental resources while committing to the implementation of a bold and ambitious reforestation programme covering an area of at least 200,000 hectares over five years, by planting 20 million trees each year, so that Madagascar can return to its former self, namely the Green Island.\nIt is worth pointing out the multiple consequences of climate change in the south of the country and the Government\u2019s strong political will to provide structural and ambitious responses to them. The upcoming round table on the implementation of the integrated development strategy for the South, with the United Nations co-chairing alongside the national authorities, will undoubtedly constitute a concrete commitment to enhance the value of global partnership.\nIn dealing with national challenges, my country strongly supports the promotion of the values of peace, social justice, human rights, responsible governance, inclusiveness and the fostering of pride and dignity among the entire Malagasy population. All this is the basis for our long-awaited emergence.\nThe United Nations is a major partner for Madagascar and has always been an indispensable ally in the course of my country\u2019s contemporary history. The recent electoral process was a major step that illustrates once again the determination of an entire population to catch up on its development.\nBefore ending my statement, let me say that we have a common mission, which is to find, together, a model of mobilization, partnership and cooperation that strikes a new balance so that, together, we can achieve our common goal of sustainable development. We face the same challenges and we will have to work together, as our best interest is the same, namely, our shared planet. I believe that this is a unifying vision that will constantly guide our steps and inspire each and every one of us to strive for a better, fairer and more forward-looking world, a world of dialogue, cooperation and shared prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "Forty years ago, forty years after Europe had been divided between those with power \u2014 between those who never hesitated to use their power to the benefit of their own nations and to the detriment of others \u2014 45 people from the Baltic\nStates sent out an appeal to the United Nations, the European Union and the countries involved. Their appeal, later known as the Baltic Appeal, carried the hope that multilateral cooperation based on the rule of law could deliver for the small occupied States located between the two global blocs \u2014 the liberal democratic world and the Soviet Union. Just 12 years later, the three Baltic States rejoined the world of free and independent States. This was a victory for democracy and multilateral cooperation.\nThis year, Estonia celebrates the fortieth anniversary of the Baltic Appeal by undertaking a responsibility that we could not even dream about during the occupation \u2014 becoming an elected member of the Security Council of the United Nations. We took this responsibility because we care. We care about the weaker and the weakest among States and within societies. We care about those whose voice needs amplification by the multilateral world in order to be heard. We care about nations facing genocide and we care about their women and children. We care about nations facing long-term conflicts and suffering from terror and we care about their generations of boys for whom the only known profession is that of a soldier. We care about nations facing extinction through a slow weapon of mass destruction \u2014 the climate catastrophe. We care about nations facing famine and famine-induced disturbances due to climate change. We care about nations depending on this multilateral cooperation, based on the rule of law, which is the United Nations. We care because we know that true harmony for humankind \u2014 which has not yet been achieved \u2014 depends on our capacity to show compassion for the fate of others.\nMultilateralism is nothing but showing compassion for the fate of others. Compassion was shown to us when we regained our independence and rebuilt our State. We are now ready to return this compassion shown to us. We are ready to take an elected seat for the period of 2020-2021 behind the most difficult table of international cooperation \u2014 the Security Council. We are ready to serve our electorate and all others, too, as true service for humankind in a multilateral system always demands. We will talk with countries, not just about them.\nRespect for the international rule of law and the efforts made by those who preceded us in implementing it will guide our actions, our decisions and our debates. We have nothing but respect for varied yet sincere positions and opinions on how to resolve the pressing issues we are facing to support our decision-making. Those steered by compassion for humankind and for the planet we inhabit can always rely on Estonia. The moral authority of the United Nations as the global carer for humankind is dear to our hearts.\nWe have a lot of long-standing and painful issues to tackle, such as the fate of women and children in conflict zones, but we also have new, emerging challenges related to new technologies. Estonia is to this day the world\u2019s only digitally transformed nation, running its Government totally online, but many are following us into the cybersphere. New threats to our sovereignty are emerging, related to cybercrime, as well as cyberspace as the new military domain. While Estonia contributes globally to the leapfrogging efforts based on e-governance, we also recognize our responsibility to protect cyberspace as well. Hence, we are striving towards a better application of international law in the digital space, as well as in our work in the Security Council. Estonia has already declared its own intention to apply national and international law where cyberspace is concerned. We invite all nations to do the same in order to clarify how international law applies in the digital sphere.\nWe support and also actively participate in the reform efforts of the United Nations, led by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. We want the United Nations to be ready to lead in the twenty-first century, fully benefiting from the technological advances of humankind that have made it much easier for those who are not big and powerful \u2014 the majority of United Nations Member States \u2014 to follow and contribute to the Organization\u2019s various bodies and numerous discussions.\nWe support the thematic consolidation of United Nations actions and regional focus on its aspirations, such as the High-Level Steering Group for Every Woman Every Child, or the better common management of United Nations actions in various countries. We also support those, like the African Union, that say they want to be much more independently responsible yet supported by the United Nations in taking steps towards a collective regional approach to long-standing problems.\nThrough the United Nations Development Fund, UNICEF and other United Nations bodies, we participate in resolving global miseries. We also strive to use our own development resources, leveraged by those of the European Union and the United Nations, to suggest State-building based on digital solutions, seeing the potential of the Internet and mobile access even among the poorest. It allows States to provide for their people, starting with population registries, effortless access to online birth registration and online learning tools for those whose access to classical schooling is limited by geography, ongoing conflict, social stigma or disability. We see the Internet as a wonderful tool for educating girls and offering jobs for women globally, thereby reducing global population growth by emancipating women.\nWe support the view that saving our planet is also the civic responsibility of each and every one of us. Nowadays, with the help of technology, we can shoulder this responsibility and feel the serious global effect of the action of each and every person. World Cleanup Day took place just last Saturday, when for the second year in a row the civil movement born in Estonia spread to 179 countries and territories, including Antarctica, and involved over 20 million people and counting.\nEncouraged by this, the Estonian start-up sector underwrote a memorandum with global ambitions, promising to be climate neutral in all their actions by 2030. They bring some serious market power and start-up thinking to the table, including their ability to quickly and globally mobilize masses of people. Sometimes we associate their ability to change our world only with the negative \u2014 closed bubbles, an antagonistic debate style, disruption of work patterns and risks to our social service provision by allowing a global jobs market incompatible with our industrial era tax models. But this ability can also be used to mobilize the masses for good, making a real difference. Estonia\u2019s pledge to become climate neutral is open to all start-ups and other green-minded companies ready to support grass-roots movements to save our planet. I urge everyone to join. Today, one week after initiating the process, the number of signatories has already more than doubled and spread beyond Estonia, now covering more than 70 companies across Europe.\nWe need these civic movements, among other things, to encourage policymakers to see that idealism and a readiness to act for the benefit of humankind today and the children yet to be born still exists. That allows us politicians to set aside resources for stopping climate change, which will inevitably reach and probably exceed 1 per cent of the global gross domestic product.\nThe main reason we are not globally efficient in putting existing technologies for green energy production into practice is due to the fragmentation of our actions. It is an obstacle to global grid development and it is an obstacle to harnessing solar energy for the benefit of us all, even though we know that a surface smaller than the territory of Spain is all we need to cater for the global energy needs of us all. It is an obstacle to making each and every microgrid globally rely on renewables and to developing access to electricity among those who currently have none.\nOnly the United Nations can help us overcome this fragmentation. We welcome the first global Climate Action Summit as a sign that the United Nations is ready for this challenge.\nClimate change remains the greatest existential challenge that the world is facing. In this light, it is disturbing to note that we still keep subsidizing, to the tune of trillions of dollars, its source \u2014 the fossil fuel industry.\nThe destructive force of climate change is not evenly distributed around the world. Some places are more vulnerable than others. However, no place on Earth will be untouched, and none of us can escape it. Many people across the globe are already experiencing threats regard to their livelihoods and, indeed, lives.\nThe Himalayan glaciers have been melting at double the rate since the turn of this century, threatening water supplies throughout Central, South and East Asia. Arctic permafrost is melting decades earlier than even worst-case scenarios had predicted, threatening to unlock vast amounts of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.\nMany people in small island developing States live in constant fear of inundation by rising seas. The situation will only get worse unless we address it now, with ambition and urgency. Yet our efforts and progress are far from being sufficient to avert the obvious adverse effects of this global crisis, a crisis that no country can solve alone. Security issues related to climate change are addressed further by the Group of Friends on Climate and Security, in which Estonia participates.\nScience tells us that climate change is happening and imminent, and it also indicates the best practices to tackle it. In our quest for the best solutions, we must rely on science. There is a common perception that replacing fossil fuels with biomass is carbon-neutral, whereas science has told us that this is not entirely correct.\nRenewable energy is not necessarily carbon-neutral. In fact, burning wood can actually increase carbon dioxide emissions and would make it even harder for us to reach climate-neutrality goals by mid-century. Instead, it is more efficient to use wood for making products, which is not only carbon-neutral but carbon-positive, as such products store carbon for their entire lifetime. We in Estonia appreciate this, and every fourth wooden house exported globally is made by Estonians.\nClimate change and environmental degradation is an area where we need to share collective responsibility. In this battle we are all on the same side; that is the only way we can win. We have one good example from the past where our collective efforts once paid off. It was back in 1987, when we agreed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out numerous substances that were responsible for its depletion. As a result, the ozone hole in Antarctica has been slowly healing.\nNext year we will be celebrating the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. I would encourage us all to take the 12 months leading up to the birthday party as an opportunity to think about what we can do, both individually and jointly, to safeguard and strengthen the United Nations and multilateralism.\nThe reality is simple; this global, interlinked and globally warming world cannot survive unless our goodwill and positive actions go beyond the artificial limitations created by the various fragmentations of global society, which from the viewpoint of humankind as a whole are artificial \u2014 fragmentations that have dogged us and keep dogging us.\nIt is the lack of true multilateralism and of true and idealistic thinking for the benefit of humankind as a whole that continues to undermine the positive effects of our global efforts. We must overcome this obstacle, and the United Nations is our tool to do so. This tool has to be sharpened, it has to be supported by new technologies, and it has to be connected to civil societies through digital means, allowing individual efforts to join with global movements; but it can never be replaced.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour for me to once again address the Assembly, a few months before completing my first term as President, in order to share the path that Argentina has taken regarding its links with international society. That path has been characterized by the constructive role we have played in collectively addressing global challenges, focusing on the quest for consensus and collective action, acting in the belief that the world as a whole represents much more of an opportunity than a threat, and working to build international trust, diversify our partners, expand spaces for cooperation and seek areas in which Argentina can play a relevant and leading role. And most importantly, it is a path that aligns with the deep desire of Argentine society to take its place in the international order of the twenty-first century, because we are a diverse, multicultural country in which different origins, beliefs and religions coexist peacefully in a pluralistic identity, and because we value dialogue and respect as ways of building a shared future.\nBeginning in 2015, when I took office as President, we made a decision to leave behind the preceding period of confrontation with the world and work in an intelligent way to integrate ourselves internationally. In a complex global context full of uncertainties and growing geopolitical tensions, we decided to take responsibility and contribute to strengthening multilateralism and global governance. That has been reflected in the meetings of the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in 2017, the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 summit in 2018 and the Second High-level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation, all held in Argentina within the past three years. Those three events put Argentina on the world stage and brought the world to Argentina, where we demonstrated our ability to cooperate in building an international order that includes all of us. But our responsibility to multilateralism and seeking consensus has gone much further. Over the past few years, Argentina has also reinforced its positive role in strengthening international peace and security, contributing to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, space development and the fight against terrorism and transnational organized crime, among many other things.\nWe want to once again express here our firm commitment to non-proliferation, which has been a pillar of democratic consensus in recent decades in Argentina and has guided our development of nuclear technology. In 2020 my country will preside over the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and we also hope to make a contribution through our candidate for the position of Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nArgentina\u2019s commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms is greater than ever, and was reflected this year in our organization of the Second Western Hemisphere Counterterrorism Ministerial Conference. With the support of other countries and international organizations, we have strengthened the exchange of information and measures for preventing terrorism financing. We also created a database to expedite the freezing of assets suspected of being linked to terrorists, which, for example, enabled the Argentine Financial Information Unit to freeze assets of persons and entities related to Hizbullah.\nDespite all of those efforts, we Argentines still have open wounds. We continue to fight the impunity that has persisted for the attacks we suffered in 1992 on the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires and in 1994 at the headquarters of the Israeli-Argentine Mutual Association, which took the lives of 107 people and left hundreds more wounded. We want all those involved in perpetrating the attacks to be brought before Argentine courts so that they can be tried and ultimately sentenced. Twenty-five years after the most brutal terrorist attack ever experienced on our territory, we once again urge the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate with the Argentine judicial authorities to advance the investigation of the attack on the Association. And we reiterate our call for cooperation from friendly countries to prevent the accused from being hosted or sheltered under diplomatic immunity.\nSince assuming the presidency of Argentina, I have wasted no time in advancing the fight against drug trafficking and money-laundering. We have increased the amount of drugs seized, stepped up captures of national and international fugitives, dismantled criminal drug networks and reduced the number of homicides linked to drug trafficking throughout the country. Last year, for example, we immobilized more than 500 billion Argentine pesos, around $8.5 billion, linked to organized crime. We also speeded up the process of bringing money-laundering and corruption cases to trial and seized goods and property belonging to those accused of such crimes. We also continue to work with other Governments in Latin America and the Caribbean on reaching the consensus needed to create a regional legal body capable of addressing this and other types of transnational organized crime.\nIn the past few years, we have demonstrated a renewed and ambitious commitment in the fight against climate change and dedicated ourselves to sustainable development. We are aware of the climate emergency, and we must act in accordance with the commitments of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. That is why we have taken the decision to implement a plan for a long-term low-emission strategy that will enable us to take the necessary steps to achieve more ambitious targets, such as carbon neutrality by the year 2050. That initiative is underpinned by the efforts that we are already making today, for example with regard to cleaner energy \u2014 particularly renewable energy \u2014 energy efficiency, the conservation of ecosystems, doubling the area of national parks, creating marine protected areas, caring for our forests and increasing our afforestation efforts, capturing carbon in our soil, promoting technologies for sustainable agriculture and good livestock practices and reducing emissions in the transport sector.\nDuring these past few years, equality between women and men has been much more than a mere slogan in Argentina. We have been firmly committed to continuing to empower girls and women and eliminate gaps in employment, education and political participation. We have implemented a plan for equal opportunities and rights and built a system aimed at preventing women from becoming victims of violence as well as assisting such victims. We have established a parity law for posts in the legislature and designed our national budget with an egalitarian strategy in mind. We know that much remains to be done, but we are sure that there will be no going back on the rights and opportunities that women have in my country today.\nFor a more efficient multilateral system and global governance and a safer and more peaceful world, we need regions that are more stable, better integrated with one another and connected to the rest of the world. We therefore decided to make a firm commitment to the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR), thereby confirming the importance that we have attached to regional integration since day one of our Administration. Through the four members\u2019 concerted efforts we have set in motion a plan to adapt it to the twenty-first century so that it can be a competitive and dynamic bloc with clear rules of the game. We have given our internal and external agendas a renewed, ambitious boost with concrete actions and achievements designed to benefit our citizens. After more than 20 years of negotiations, we have reached an agreement with the European Union that is unprecedented for both trade blocs and hugely important globally. It will enable us to enhance trade and investment with positive effects for our people\u2019s quality of life. And while that in itself is an important step, what is most relevant, as in life in general, is the direction taken, which is towards a MERCOSUR that is modern and open to the world.\nI firmly believe that a country\u2019s path to global integration requires core values guiding its action. Our history and geography unite us in a region that deeply values democracy, freedom and human rights both as a way of life and for peaceful coexistence. That is why, since the beginning of our Administration, we have led the condemnation of the very serious situation of human rights violations in Venezuela, as evidenced in the annual report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (A/HRC/41/18/ Add.1). The dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has plunged Venezuela into an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. The mass exodus of millions of Venezuelans has seriously affected the stability and governance of our region. I want to once again call on the international community to use all available diplomatic and legal tools to reverse this situation so that Venezuela can be free and democratic once more.\nArgentina reaffirms its legitimate and imprescriptible sovereign rights over the Malvinas, South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas, and we maintain our position and call for the United Kingdom to resume bilateral negotiations that will enable us to find a peaceful and definitive solution to the dispute. We have nevertheless created a new relationship framework with the United Kingdom, thereby improving the conditions for moving towards a solution. Part of this, working with the International Committee of the Red Cross, was to identify the majority of Argentine soldiers buried in the Darwin cemetery, thereby paying a historic debt to their families. We have also resumed scientific cooperation in the fisheries sector, including by carrying out joint scientific maritime missions, and we have promoted greater rapprochement between the islands and continental Argentina by establishing a new weekly flight to the Malvinas.\nBefore concluding, I want to convey to the Assembly that today, in the uncertain situation that we Argentines are facing, my absolute priority is to be there for all of them and bring them relief to get through these difficult times. But without wanting to neglect that responsibility, I decided to come to share with the Assembly this assessment of Argentina\u2019s international integration over the past four years. Because amid the current trends of fragmentation, I believe that the best response enabling us to move towards a prosperous future is greater cooperation and more and better multilateralism. Because I am convinced that in order to grow and develop, to have the life that we Argentines deserve, we must be better integrated into the world and deploy all of our labour and talent to that end. I know we can do it. It depends on us.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session on behalf of 1.3 billion Indians. It is also a very special occasion because this year, the entire world is celebrating 150 years since the birth of Mahatma Gandhi. His message of truth and non-violence is still very relevant for us today for peace, development and progress in the world.\nThis year we witnessed the holding of the world\u2019s biggest election in the world\u2019s biggest democracy. The largest number of voters ever voted my Government into power for a second term, with an even stronger mandate than before. It is thanks to that mandate that I am once again standing here before the Assembly.\nHowever, the message that my Government\u2019s mandate conveys has an even greater, wider and more inspiring significance. When a developing country is able to successfully implement the world\u2019s biggest sanitation campaign as part of the Clean India mission, building more than 110 million toilets in just five years for its people, its achievements and outcomes constitute an inspirational message for the entire world. When a developing country successfully runs the world\u2019s biggest health insurance scheme, giving 500 million people access to annual health coverage worth 500,000 rupees at no cost to them, the achievements and response systems that result from that scheme show the world a new path.\nWhen a developing country successfully runs the world\u2019s biggest financial inclusion scheme, opening more than 370 million bank accounts for those in poverty in just five years, the systems that result from that scheme build confidence in those affected by poverty across the entire world. When a developing country launches the world\u2019s biggest digital-identification programme for its citizens, giving them a biometric identity that ensures their rights and saves approximately $20 billion by reducing corruption, the modern systems that result from that programme give the world new hope.\nAs I entered this building, I noticed the call on one of its entrance walls to make the United Nations free of single-use plastic. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that, as I am addressing members today, a very large campaign is being initiated across the entire country to make India free of single-use plastic. In the next five years, in addition to promoting water conservation, we are going to ensure a water supply to 150 million homes and build more than 125,000 kilometres of new roads. By 2022, when India celebrates its seventy-fifth independence day, we plan to have built 20 million houses for the poor. While the world has set itself the target of eradicating tuberculosis by 2030, in India we are working towards eradicating it by 2025.\nThe question that arises is how we have been able to achieve all that. How is it that such rapid changes are occurring in India? India is a great culture that is thousands of years old, has its own vibrant traditions and has encompassed universal dreams. Our values and culture see divinity in every being and strive for the welfare of all. The very core of our approach is therefore public welfare through public participation, not just for India but for the entire world. That is the reason why we draw inspiration from our motto, \u201cCollective efforts for the growth of all, with everyone\u2019s trust\u201d \u2014 a motto that is also not confined to the borders of India.\nOur endeavours are neither an expression nor an act of pity nor a pretence. They are inspired by a sense of duty and duty alone and are all focused on 1.3 billion Indians. However, the dreams that those efforts are trying to fulfil are the same dreams nurtured by the entire world, by every country and every society. The efforts are ours, but their fruits are for all and the entire world to enjoy. That conviction of mine grows stronger every day, when I think of those countries that, just like India, are striving for development, each in their own way. When I hear about their joys and sorrows and when I learn their dreams, my resolve to develop my country at a faster pace becomes even stronger, so that India\u2019s experience can also be beneficial to those countries.\nApproximately 3,000 years ago, a great poet of India, Kariyan Pungun-dra-naar, wrote in Tamil, the most ancient language in the world, \u201cWe belong to all places and to everyone\u201d. That sense of belonging beyond borders is unique to India. Over the past five years, India has worked to strengthen its centuries-old great tradition of fraternity among nations and working for the welfare of the world, which is indeed in line with the key objectives of the United Nations. The issues that India raises and the kinds of new global platforms that India has come forward to build seek collective efforts to address serious global challenges and issues.\nIf we take a historical and per-capita emission perspective, India\u2019s contribution to global warming is very low. At the same time, India is also one of the leading nations when it comes to taking steps to address the issue. On the one hand, we are working to achieve the target of 450 gigawatts of renewable energy; on the other hand, we have also taken the initiative to create the International Solar Alliance. One of the effects of global warming is the increasing number and severity of natural disasters, which are also appearing in new areas and in new forms, in response to which India initiated the formation of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. I invite all countries to join the coalition, which will help to build infrastructure that can withstand natural disasters.\nOf all the soldiers from all countries who have made the supreme sacrifice for United Nations peacekeeping missions, India has given the most. We belong to a country that has given the world Buddha\u2019s message of peace, not war. That is why our voice rings out with seriousness and outrage against terrorism in order to alert the world to that evil. We believe it is one of our biggest challenges, not for one single country but for the entire world and humankind. The lack of unanimity among us on the issue of terrorism undermines the very principles that were the basis for the creation of the United Nations. For the sake of humankind, I therefore firmly believe that it is absolutely imperative that the world unite and stand as one against terrorism.\nThe face of the world is changing today. Modern technology in the twenty-first century is bringing about sweeping changes in our social and personal lives, the economy, security, connectivity and international relations. In such a situation, a fragmented world is in no one\u2019s interests. Neither do we have the option to confine ourselves within our own borders. In this new era, we will have to give new direction and strength to multilateralism and the United Nations.\nThe great spiritual guru Swami Vivekananda delivered a message to the world 125 years ago during the Parliament of the World\u2019s Religions in Chicago. His message was one of harmony and peace, not dissension. Today the message from the world\u2019s largest democracy to the international community remains the same. It is a message of harmony and peace.\n"

        "file_text": "Next year, we will celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, which was born from the ashes of the Second World War to maintain peace and promote prosperity and human rights for future generations. The Organization was created to resolve differences, prevent violent conflicts, learn lessons from the past and meet international threats through cooperation. It was established to enable nations, no matter their size, to achieve these goals by acting together. The anniversary is an opportunity to celebrate many significant achievements \u2014 most recently, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and the sustaining peace agenda.\nAt the same time, the United Nations and other multilateral institutions, such as the World Trade Organization and the International Criminal Court, are increasingly being questioned. This is a disturbing trend that threatens to weaken international cooperation, accountability and our nations\u2019 growth, trade and development.\nThe climate crisis is the defining issue of our time. Millions of young people are now demonstrating and demanding urgent action. Their commitment and engagement have inspired school strikes and protests around the world. They have left few of us unmoved. Their voice was raised, once again, loud and clear at last Saturday\u2019s youth summit. We must not let them down. We cannot let them down.\nTo keep global warming under 1.5\u00b0C and prevent the most extreme impacts of climate change, we need to halve global emissions by 2030. Scientists, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change included, warn of devastating consequences if we do not take immediate action.\nClimate change is a driver of conflict. Action is about the survival of our peoples and our nations. The world cannot afford the cost of inaction. The challenge facing us is enormous, but we can turn this challenge into an opportunity.\nI would like to raise two main points. First, we need long-term policy at all levels. The European Union has put in place a legally binding climate framework, sending a clear message to the international community about our commitment. In Sweden, our Climate Act and net-zero emissions target also send a clear signal. But we can and will do more. Our goal is to be the first fossil-free welfare nation in the world. At the Climate Action Summit, together with India and the World Economic Forum, we announced the launch of the Leadership Group for Industry Transition. This initiative will speed up industry transition to pathways that will ensure that we deliver on the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. The role of trade and labour unions is essential in this transition.\nSecondly, transforming financial flows is key. We are proud to see the commitment of our businesses and financial institutions to aligning with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Through our development cooperation, Sweden is investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency and climate-sensitive agriculture. We are the world\u2019s leading per-capita contributor to the Green Climate Fund and have now decided to double that contribution.\nToday, in many parts of the world, democracy is losing ground. Inequalities are growing. Social and economic gaps are feeding into nationalistic narratives. Anti-democratic forces are creating uncertainty and division. Corruption is a threat to democracy, to economic and social development, and to trade and investment. Together, we must do more to counter these forces because democracy is the bedrock of open and free societies, and of equality and prosperity. Democracy invites all citizens to take part in building sustainable societies and societies free from oppression. Sweden will increase its support for democratic and vibrant civil societies. Voices of democracy need our support.\nHuman rights around the world are under attack. We must act against all attempts to weaken the respect for human rights and restrict their universality. Sweden will continue to be a strong voice for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. No one should suffer discrimination, violence or oppression because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\nSweden will continue to champion the independence and integrity of the human rights system. Persecution of religious and other minorities occurs in many parts of the world, which is unacceptable. Sweden is strengthening efforts against anti-Semitism. Next year, we will host an international forum on Holocaust remembrance and combating anti-Semitism.\nWe will continue to protest when the freedom of expression is restricted, whether online or off, when journalists and media actors are silenced, and when human rights defenders are harassed or even killed.\nI am proud to be the Foreign Minister in Sweden\u2019s feminist Government and to pursue a feminist foreign policy. Gender equality is an issue that concerns us all. It is about human rights, democracy, development and peace and security for all. We are encouraged by the considerable advances made in certain areas, but progress remains uneven. Every day, in many parts of the world, women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights are still being violated.\nWe are also witnessing growing opposition to women\u2019s and girls\u2019 human rights. This must stop. Every woman and girl should have the right to make her own decisions about her body and her life. These are basic human rights. Sexual and reproductive health and rights, including the right to safe and legal abortion, are fundamental human rights.\nNext year marks the anniversaries of several gender-equality commitments. The tasks laid out in those commitments remain unfinished and need our urgent attention. Implementing the women, peace and security agenda and the Beijing Platform for Action is not only the right thing to do but it is also key to achieving sustainable peace and development. On International Women\u2019s Day this year, Sweden and France launched a diplomatic initiative to combat trafficking and prostitution, focusing on reducing demand and protecting the victims of prostitution, in Europe and globally.\nEmpowering women and increasing their political and economic participation are crucial for global development. Sweden fully supports the ongoing efforts of the United Nations to mainstream a gender perspective throughout the United Nations system and its reform agenda. The Secretary-General\u2019s determination to ensure gender parity in the Organization is an important part of these efforts.\nIn adopting the 2030 Agenda, we all committed to taking on significant responsibilities. I am pleased that the political declaration adopted earlier this week (resolution 74/4, annex) not only reinforces the 2030 Agenda, but also sets the course for faster action on the Sustainable Development Goals. The United Nations plays a central role in this endeavour. With the reforms initiated by the Secretary-General, the United Nations will become more effective and enable action on all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Sweden will continue to allocate 1 per cent of its gross national income as official development assistance. At present, more than 50 per cent of this assistance is channelled to or through the multilateral system. This demonstrates our strong commitment to international cooperation and the importance we attach to the 2030 Agenda for our shared future.\nI am encouraged by the high level of engagement from the business sector. Together, as partners, we will achieve the Goals. The business benefits of science-based climate action are clear. We look forward to the launch of the Global Investors for Sustainable Development Alliance in October.\nTrade is an important tool for sustainable economic development and poverty reduction, and for the 2030 Agenda as a whole. We need more trade, not less. A strong rules-based and transparent multilateral trading system is vital. Support to developing countries to increase their capacity for international trade is also crucial. Free trade is a powerful engine for growth. We need to make growth sustainable and inclusive and to promote decent work for all. Sweden will continue to be an active partner in the Global Deal for Decent Work and Inclusive Growth partnership, with its vision of a world of decent work and inclusive growth that guarantees workers\u2019 rights.\nSecurity must be built collectively. Current security threats leave no nation or person untouched. Sweden\u2019s membership in the Security Council focused on conflict prevention, early action and respect for international law. Our membership has ended but our commitment is ongoing.\nThis week, Sweden co-hosted a meeting with key partners in support of peace in Yemen, based on the Stockholm Agreement. The United Nations-led process is key. We emphasize that international law must be respected. International law serves as a basis for conflict resolution and prevention, as in the case of Israel and Palestine. An end to the occupation together with a two-State solution within secure and mutually recognized borders is the only way to resolve this conflict.\nThe illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol and the aggression in eastern Ukraine challenge core principles of international law. We will continue to work with international partners until Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty have been fully restored.\nThe Security Council needs to adopt a comprehensive approach to peace, and to include new risks, such as climate change, on its agenda.\nWe are a year away from the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the cornerstone of the global nuclear-disarmament and non-proliferation regime. The Treaty has been successful in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. However, the deteriorating international security environment has once again increased the threat of the use of nuclear weapons.\nThe situation on the Korean peninsula remains a cause for concern. We must continue to pursue our common goal of complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization and of peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula through diplomatic means.\nWe need full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. We must act urgently and pursue dialogue to restore trust, which is presently lacking in this part of the international arena.\nThe termination of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, essentially as a result of Russian non-compliance, is a further setback. In June, Sweden, together with 15 countries from various regions, launched a nuclear-disarmament initiative. This initiative aims at building political support for a successful outcome of the NPT Review Conference in 2020. Concrete measures to reduce nuclear risk and increase transparency can serve as stepping stones and unlock disarmament diplomacy. Full and constructive engagement by nuclear-weapon States will be a necessary ingredient if we wish to move forward.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency is an essential part of the NPT. On 23 September, Sweden took over as Chair of the Agency\u2019s Board of Governors for the 2019-2020 period. We are honoured to shoulder this great responsibility in these challenging times.\nMillions of people are struggling to survive and live just another day. Currently over 140 million people need life-saving humanitarian assistance, most of whom are women and girls. Sweden is proud to be one of the largest contributors of humanitarian assistance in the world in order to save lives and ease human suffering. We stand behind the Secretary-General\u2019s vision that tensions and crises can be prevented from escalating into major conflicts.\nThe role that the United Nations plays in resolving conflicts, through political and diplomatic efforts or peace operations, is crucial for securing inclusive and sustainable peace. Post-conflict reconstruction can be successful only when all segments of society are included. This is especially important when it comes to women\u2019s participation. We are firmly committed to supporting the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative to strengthen peacekeeping. We will continue our engagement in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and other peace operations.\nThe late poet Claes Andersson once wrote: \u201cFear those who say they only want to be left alone \u2014 for they fear no means.\u201d History has shown us that isolationism, populism and nationalism are all paths to failure. Sweden\u2019s foreign policy rests firmly on democracy, international law, respect for human rights, gender equality, a humanitarian perspective, and free, fair and sustainable trade.\nThe United Nations system is a global public good, and it is in our shared strategic interest to keep investing in it. The long-term gains are far greater than any short-term costs. The prosperity of one nation is not part of a zero-sum game in which nations either win or lose. On the contrary, we can and must choose a path that will ensure that we continue to rise together."

We come here in recognition of a simple reality \u2014 the General Assembly is vital to meet the dangers and seize the opportunities of our world.\nCollective action \u2014 that is the promise of the United Nations. Nearly 75 years ago, this Organization was created by the specific, individual actions of Member countries, coming together to shape a better future, and today we still urgently need each and every Member country to act, and to act together, with our global neighbours and achieve the better, safer world all of us need.\nFor if we do not act, what hope do we have? What will our future look like if millions of the world\u2019s young people continue to be denied the rich fruits of new technology and global wealth? Can we afford to ignore the crisis of exclusion? Or will we do the right thing, support the energies and talents of all the world\u2019s youth and drive all economies forward, through fair and inclusive global growth? What will our world look like if we do not work together for a healthy and safe environment? Water-scarce countries like Jordan already know the dangers of climate change. A global crisis demands global action. How can we excuse delay?\nLet us ask ourselves why, in the twenty-first century, crises are still displacing millions of people across our world. There are more forced displacements today than at any time since the Second World War. What will tomorrow\u2019s world look like if we do not help end those crises and give refugees and hosts alike the support they need to meet the future?\nHow is it that people today can still be disrespected and victimized for their faith? Atrocities at mosques, churches, synagogues and temples have shocked the conscience of the world, but so should the dark, criminal ideas, from across the ideological spectrum, that drive those and other attacks. Hard work by all of us is needed to defeat those groups and their message of hate and mistrust, but no effort stands a chance unless young men and women everywhere have a stake in a positive future. The forces of violence seek out the vulnerable and excluded. Can we afford to abandon the world\u2019s young people to extremism and despair?\nCollective action is also vital for ending bitter crises and conflict, and no crisis has done more global damage than the core conflict in my region, the Palestinian- Israeli conflict. Neither side has achieved the durable peace that a secure future depends on, while regional and world stability have continued to pay the price.\nIt is a terrible irony that a land holy to three faiths that share the great commandment to love one\u2019s neighbour should ever be a place of conflict. That is the land where prophets have walked and where generations of Muslims, Christians and Jews have sought to live in obedience to God, teaching their children compassion, mercy and respect for others. Segregation, forced displacement, violence and mistrust do not belong in that Holy Land.\nForty years ago my father, His Majesty the late King Hussein, who loved peace, stood in this very Hall and decried the occupation and attempts \u201cto eradicate from the world\u2019s memory centuries of history and tradition and of spiritual, moral and cultural ideals\u201d (A/34/PV.7para. 22).\nIt is a global moral tragedy that the occupation continues, yet no occupation, no displacements, no acts of force can erase people\u2019s history, hopes or rights or change the true heritage of our shared values among the three monotheistic faiths \u2014 and nothing can take away the international rights of the Palestinian people to equality, justice and self-determination.\nYoung people ask me, Why does the world not stand up for Palestinian rights? Is it not time to answer them by showing that global justice and human rights belong to them too? It begins with respect for the holy sites and rejecting all attempts to alter the legal status of East Jerusalem and the authentic historical character of the Holy City, Jerusalem. What lessons do we teach young people when armed personnel enter Al-Aqsa Mosque/Haram Al-Sharif, even as Muslim worshippers gather to pray? As a Hashemite Custodian, I am bound by a special duty to protect Jerusalem\u2019s Islamic and Christian holy sites, but all of us have a reason and a moral obligation to uphold religious freedom and human rights. Let us therefore safeguard the Holy City for all humankind as a unifying city of peace.\nWe must also press forward towards an end to the conflict and a just, lasting and durable peace through the realization of the two-State solution \u2014 a solution that is in accord with international law and the relevant United Nations resolutions, provides an end to conflict and creates a viable, independent and sovereign Palestinian State, on the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital and living side by side with Israel in mutual peace and security.\nThe two-State solution is the only genuine solution, because what is the alternative \u2014 one State, segregated, with unequal laws, dependent on force, betraying the deepest values of the good people on both sides? That is a formula for enduring conflict, not a path to stability, security and peace.\nTolerance, compassion and the equality of all human beings are the values that make global harmony and collective action possible. Those are the values that permeate the Charter of the United Nations \u2014 to live together in peace as good neighbours, to honour the rights and equality of all and to combine our efforts and unite our strengths, not only in order to maintain peace and security but also to improve human life through justice, prosperity and greater hope for humankind.\nThose are the moral obligations that the United Nations founders set forth. Now they are our responsibility. We must not fail. May peace and God\u2019s mercy be upon everyone.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset I would like to congratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, and to pledge Barbados\u2019s support throughout his tenure. I also want to thank his predecessor for her able and astute leadership over the course of the past year. Like other delegations, Barbados supports the very timely theme of this year\u2019s session: \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d.\nWe could not have chosen a more relevant and appropriate theme. Barbados has premised its own development on education and inclusion so that we can eradicate poverty from our landscape. But while we have made good progress, our gains are being jeopardized by one main challenge that we all know only too well, that of climate change. Denying the existence of climate change does not diminish its reality. I want to take this opportunity to join my fellow leaders on this platform in expressing my country\u2019s deepest sympathy and empathy with our brothers and sisters of the Government and the people of the Bahamas, following the awful devastation visited on them by Hurricane Dorian on the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama. That catastrophe represents an unfortunate new normal for many people in small island developing States (SIDS). From my own firsthand knowledge, I can say that it was horrific.\nThe world in which we live can no longer ignore the reality of climate change. It is not about hurricanes and floods. It is about droughts, wildfires, sargassum and our ability to provide drinking water, feed our people and provide them with shelter. We are facing those problems in our own nation today, from drought to sargassum. And while hurricanes may be viewed as heart attacks, sargassum and droughts are truly like diabetes \u2014 insidious and wearing us down. It is the world of our children that is absolutely at risk.\nLast Friday, young people of the world across 150 countries chose to champion the cause of climate justice. Greta Thunberg spoke from this rostrum, and she must be comforted and told that when humankind cannot answer, it will attack. People play the man and not the ball. I want to say that for me it is significant that when young people engage in battle, the war is usually won. We saw that in South Africa, and we will see it now in the battle against climate change. I am therefore confident that the battle will be won. The question \u2014 and each of us here knows it \u2014 is whether it will be in time for our people who live in small island developing States. Will our small States survive this climate catastrophe before humankind finally finds the solution that can halt and reverse climate change? It is we in the Caribbean and the Pacific \u2014 small islands in the oceans of the world \u2014 who are on the front line. But as I say all the time, make no mistake, because others are in line behind us. As we would say in my own country, \u201cToday for me, and tomorrow for you\u201d.\nWhat is really preventing us from following the science \u2014 science, by the way, that is exceedingly compelling? I ask that we as leaders be real \u2014 real with ourselves, our people and the young. It is about political will. That is it, nothing more and nothing less. We have been discussing the challenge of climate change for more than three decades, from the time when small island developing States first raised the global alarm in 1988. The Commonwealth gave us a vulnerability index in 1989. The Barbados Programme of Action on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States came 25 years ago, followed by the Mauritius Strategy of Implementation and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway. How many more? How much more talk? And we are still here today, some of us singing the same chorus as if many among us were deaf and blind. I find it ironic that after our Climate Action Summit on Monday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released another special report on oceans and the cryosphere stating that some of the more severe consequences of climate change can no longer be avoided. How many times have we been told this? How many times has science reinforced that our very survival is threatened? Some will go up into high altitudes and remain there as if that can insulate them \u2014 but for how long? The destructive behaviour continues.\nToday in this Hall, I ask the Assembly, where is the moral leadership of our world? Where is the constructive action by the countries responsible for carbon emissions that believe that it is okay to continue to build coal-power plants and not decommission them, and that do not understand that the world is providing us with prospects of new industries and new jobs while enabling us to save the world for our young people? Do they not see what is happening? Why are they not acting? Do they not care? We are told, and I believe the science, that we are the last generation that can deal with this existential threat, which comes week by week \u2014 this past weekend it was Tropical Storm Karen. In the Atlantic we were lucky that Jerry and Humberto did not go the way of Dorian. How many more must stand on this rostrum? How many more must speak in the corridors of power? In the name of the people who have sent us here and who expect us to create the new industries that can transition them from coal, from destructive behaviour, from diesel- and gasoline-powered cars, we must change how we build and how we transport ourselves. We can make that difference. It is within our power. It is within the political will of the leaders. The time to act is now. Never in the history of humankind has one generation had such responsibility to protect this planet.\nUnfortunately, today the Caribbean also finds itself on the front line of too many other major challenges. That is why I constantly ask who sees us and who hears us. We continue to be confronted by the problems of blacklisting, which pale in significance when compared to climate change but which destroy our financial sector. Then there is the illicit flow of weapons, which has meant that the ease with which people can go into public spaces and shoot and kill others is now just another item on the news. We promote profit in the manufacturing and trade of guns weapons, and through the non-communicable diseases that strike down our people in the most insidious ways because we allow diets that promote the prosperity of a few multinational corporations to become the norm of the day through the food that we eat and the lives that we live.\nWithin our own community, Belize and Guyana continue to face challenges to their territorial integrity. I suppose people feel that because we have talked so long about Belize and Guyana and Cuba, we can continue to talk about climate change and those other things and that it is okay for it to be just another check mark on a General Assembly speech. Those are all threats to our stability, the stability of the people in our lands. But since last we met, other instances and circumstances not of our making have arisen that may yet destabilize us. We say it over and over, and we ask who is listening.\nBut we do not come only with tales of woe. The Caribbean has produced excellence, it really has. It has produced Nobel laureates, sportsmen and artists who have excelled and are the best in the world of their type, leaders who have inspired previous and current generations. We do not come here as a proud people asking for handouts. We do not want to be mendicant, and we will not be. What we want \u2014 no, what we need \u2014 is the fiscal and policy space to achieve sustainable development, to be nimble, to adapt and innovate in ways that enable us to be true and faithful to the task of bringing prosperity to our people or, as is the theme of this session of the Assembly, to eradicate poverty, educate our people and include all so that some are not outside and others inside. We want an international order that recognizes that there must be different policy prescriptions to suit the circumstances that each of us has, and we can still be friends \u2014 small and large, North and South, Christian, Hindu, Muslim, all different races and all genders. We want an equitable and just international order that is truly built on the principles of justice and fairness for all and not just for some. We want a United Nations that recognizes that at 74 years old, we must be able to have difficult conversations as mature people and solve problems.\nMany in the developing world were persuaded or required to abandon policies that were designed to transform the majority of our populations, and that were then fashioned to conform to a consensus that was settled in Washington and named for it. That, ultimately and regrettably, was about the consolidation of wealth in the hands of a very few. That is the reason for the growing inequality that we have seen in the world over the past few decades. That is why too many people the world over have become cynical about Governments and the benefits they can bring to them. The fuelling of the greed of a few threatens to undermine what little gains we have made since independence, and we judge ourselves harshly because independence is a recent phenomenon for us. Others, who have taken 150 years to get to where they are, are still stumbling and falling, and they want to judge those who have had less than 50 or 60 years to operate in a world that has not been made in their image and that does not reflect their interests? That is the fate of simply too many.\nDespite our small size, the 14 countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) have been able to play leadership roles of international import. I cannot stand here today without talking about Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, which has become the smallest nation in the world ever to be elected to sit on the Security Council. We are proud of them. In addition \u2014 and I want to speak to this \u2014 when CARICOM was confronted with the unfolding situation in Venezuela, I accompanied the then-Chair of CARICOM, the Prime Minister of St. Kitts and Nevis, as well as the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, to meet in this building with the Secretary-General in January of this year. We also met with many delegations. Some said that we were wasting our time and some said that the time for talk was already over. We said then, as we say now almost nine months later, that the time for dialogue can never be over in a world that wants peace and prosperity.\nWe do not take sides, but what we know is that one cannot elevate war over dialogue. The people of Venezuela must be allowed to decide their own future in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, that is, the principles of non-intervention, non-interference, the prohibition of the threat or use of force and respect for the rule of law, human rights and democracy. It is regrettable that other multilateral organizations have not followed their own charters. That is what makes the actions of the Secretary-General of the United Nations even more laudable for refusing to breach the Charter and take actions even though Member States have hurried to recognize the unelected.\nThat is why Barbados readily agreed to the request by Norway, and I salute my colleague, the Norwegian Prime Minister, who just left the rostrum, to host the talks between the Venezuelan parties. We salute the Government of Norway for walking the walk and taking leadership in facilitating those talks. We also regret that the talks have broken down. We remind people that dialogue remains critical if there is to be a meaningful outcome and benefit for the Venezuelan people and its neighbours not only on the Latin American continent but in the Caribbean Sea, because people forget that Trinidad and Tobago is less than seven miles from the coast of Venezuela. Our Caribbean Sea must remain a zone of peace. We will fight for that.\nI speak plainly and without fear because, since independence, the foreign policy of Barbados has been premised on the principle of friend of all, satellite of none. Barbados has therefore always remained and will remain proud to have Cuba as a treasured friend. Barbados established relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China when others failed to. We may be small but we are principled. Our relationship with Cuba is based on a historical foundation rooted in solidarity, cooperation, complementarity and our common Caribbean civilization. We say that the long-standing economic embargo on Cuba continues to be a cause of serious concern. I reaffirm the strong opposition of Barbados to that unilateral action and even more so to the recent activation of article 3 of the Helms-Burton Act, imposing new restrictions and further exacerbating the situation. And to what end, I ask? The continued attempt to stop the people of Cuba from living with basic human dignity is unacceptable.\nIt is time that the global community recognized that small island developing States are equal partners in the international arena and that our special development needs must be taken into account in multilateral forums. We contend that growth in the economies of developed States must not come at the expense of the very viability of small developing States. Small children have a phrase for that. They call it cowardice, bullying and crowding out. We ask for fairness, equity and the opportunity to take our legitimate place in the global community. That is all. That was the promise underpinning our membership of the Organization.\nI know that today I have a duty to acknowledge and commend the heroic efforts of the Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, who is swimming against the rising tide of anti-multilateralism and anti-globalism, navigating the dangerous currents of dwindling resources and resisting the efforts to set adrift all the excellent work done over the past seven and a half decades by leaders across the world and his predecessors to ensure development, peace and the dignity of the human family.\nAs a small nation, we are not only committed to multilateralism, we also understand that it is the one thing that protects our sovereignty and our ability to navigate in this world. It is our buffer against the display of might and it is our shield against tyranny. We continue to view the United Nations as an important mechanism for achieving international peace and security and sustainable development for all countries, but in particular for the most vulnerable.\nHistorical examples have proved that national interests are best advanced by pursuing collaboration, partnership and a multilateral approach. No country trades or grows its economy on its own. A multilateral trading system and an international economic order that respond to the needs of all nations, even the smallest, are therefore of critical importance. All of us in this Hall know that. It is for that reason that Barbados intends and hopes to host the fifteenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in October 2020.\nWe will be the first small island nation ever to host UNCTAD. Barbados welcomes the unique opportunity to work with others, our partners, to shape the trade and development agenda of the Organization for the next four years, conscious that if ever small island developing States needed to be at the centre of those discussions, it is now in order to discuss trade and climate, trade and the blue economy and sustainable development for our people. We look forward to forming those critical partnerships with all United Nations Member States to make UNCTAD XV an inclusive and successful event.\nThe United Nations exists to identify the commonalities that will help us get past our working differences. As I said earlier, there is no progress without communication and there is no progress without talking to each other. If the consequences of not talking to each other are a little less sleep, then that is okay and we can accept it, but when the consequences are the loss of life and loss of livelihood, then we are in trouble. That is why there are those who believe that we are invisible because those who should know better and can do more are turning a blind eye with impunity.\nIf the truth be told, how many times have we been ignored on too many matters? And I ask myself how many times are we really going to come and make the same speech from this rostrum? SIDS are the canaries of the international community. The international community will ignore us at its own peril.\nWe are the canaries. Regrettably, we are noticed only when it is time to garner votes or to support seats on the Security Council or when a person wants a candidate to head an international organization. It is indeed only then that real value is placed on us. One asks oneself how people can be so transparent and so lacking in dignity and conscience. As I had cause to do earlier this week, I would like to remind Member States that the Alliance of Small Island States represents 20 per cent of the membership of this body \u2014 43 States \u2014 and our votes and our voices count. They count but our lives and our dignity count more. We are committed to taking the action needed to overcome the deleterious effects of what threatens to destroy us \u2014 climate change. As Dylan Thomas wrote, \u201cWe will rage, rage against the ... light [and] not go silent into that good [or, should I say, dark] night\u201d.\nThe world is at a crossroads, and we continue to be reminded of it as recently as this morning in the statements we have heard. The United Nations will survive only if it remains relevant to the needs of our people and to finding solutions, not to all the problems of our time, but to the great problems and challenges to humankind \u2014 saving where we live, living with others with respect and dignity in peace and supporting equality, not the dominance of any one race, religion or sect. The only way that the mission of this entity can be guaranteed is if, country by country \u2014 and multilaterally, I might add \u2014 we stand on principle, the principles that have protected us from another great war for the past 74 years \u2014 and thank God for those principles and our avoidance of that great war \u2014 and that have inspired us to continually work to achieve and maintain human dignity and prosperity, as we set about meeting the Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe baton is now with us. It is our turn. Will we hold it firmly and continue the race to help the marginalized, those unseen and without voice, truly the forgotten of this world, or will we drop the baton \u2014 even when we know better from the experiences of the past century, during which so many died needlessly? My country and region are clear about where we stand. No war is worth it. No profit is large enough to be worth the price of war or the destruction of our planet. The people of Barbados, and I, as their leader, choose to honour our legacy, our great civilization and our freedom fighters who fought for better. Barbados chooses to fight for the path of peace, prosperity, planetary protection and hope. Barbados chooses love of self, love of neighbour, love of planet and love as a virtue. Barbados chooses a spirit of love, courage, hope and brotherhood for all humankind. We pray that everyone here will make the same decision.\n"

        "file_text": "Denmark is an old nation, full of new ideas. We may not be a big country, but we have big ambitions. In today\u2019s world I believe we need both new ideas and big ambitions if we are to solve the issues facing us, including climate change, delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and ensuring fair globalization.\nWe live in a world smaller than ever before, a world where our futures are bound together as at no other time in human history, an unpredictable world where the growing interdependency of nations and peoples has made international cooperation more necessary than ever before. And yet today\u2019s headlines are overflowing with ideas of division, exit, unilateralism and self-interest. While it is paradoxical that such ideas are thriving precisely when they are least needed, it would be a critical mistake to dismiss them as irrational or irrelevant. We, the decision-makers of the world, must understand the realities and perceptions that have caused such ideas to grow.\nThe rules-based international order has fostered globalization, giving many of us a world of opportunities and social progress and a belief that tomorrow will be better than today. Enormous wealth has been created, but it is not fairly shared. Not all have shared in the benefits of globalization or been shielded from its negative sides. When some of the wealthiest companies and individuals in the world break their societal contract, when they do not pay their fair share of taxes, how can we in fairness ask those of lesser means to do so? We must ensure that everyone carries the burden, especially those with the broadest shoulders. We must fight for fair and sustainable globalization. That requires a global approach. Denmark believes in multilateralism and in the inherent value of universally agreed rights, standards and obligations. The SDGs and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change serve as our common point of departure. They prove that we can still deliver ambitions and plans as a global community. But now multilateralism must deliver more than plans and ambitions. We must deliver action.\nThe SDGs are not only a vision of the world we want. They are also a blueprint for how we get there. It remains the primary responsibility of countries to deliver the SDGs at home, but no one should face the responsibility alone or find that a sincere request for help goes unanswered. We clearly live in a world where solidarity is needed, and not just words of solidarity. For more than 40 years, Denmark has delivered on its promise made in this Hall (resolution 2626 (XXV)), providing at least 0.7 percent of our wealth in official development assistance. We are proud to maintain that dedication on the road to 2030.\n\u201cWe the peoples\u201d are the first words of the Charter of the United Nations. Our efforts must similarly start and end with the peoples. That means doing our utmost to solve what the Secretary-General has rightly called the defining issue of our time. Getting the climate under control can no longer be the problem of the next generation or even the next Government. It is up to us. The time is now, and action is needed. Denmark has set one of the most ambitious climate targets in the world, a 70 per cent reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 and climate neutrality with net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. Make no mistake, that will not be easy. We have a massive task ahead of us. But Denmark is determined to be a leader in the fight against climate change.\nDenmark would like to thank the Secretary-General for hosting the Climate Action Summit. We were proud and honoured to co-lead the energy transition track for the Summit. Together with Ethiopia and Sustainable Energy for All, and joined by a cross-regional coalition, we have focused our energy on energy. The reason is obvious. Energy accounts for roughly 80 per cent of global carbon-dioxide emissions. We need to scale up renewable energy. We need to increase energy efficiency. We need to electrify the industries that today rely on fossil fuels. But let me be clear. Almost 1 billion people are currently living without electricity. The clean- energy transition will be neither socially sustainable nor fair if we leave those people in the dark. We have to fulfil the promise of SDG 7 on delivering affordable and clean energy to all. We must leave no one behind on our path to a carbon-neutral world, at peace with the planet. Nor can we address climate change effectively without protecting the natural environment. Deforestation and forest fires in the Amazon and across the planet are global climate crises and must be addressed as such. Denmark is committed to reducing deforestation and is ready to assist if needed and requested.\nWhile Governments must lead in this journey, we cannot walk alone. Partnerships with all relevant actors are crucial if we want to meet the ambitious goals that we have agreed to so that we can meet a deadline that has been set not by us, but by the planet. In true partnership, Denmark intends to work with the international investment community to mobilize much- needed private capital for green energy by 2020. At the Climate Action Summit, we were proud to announce that Danish pension funds are also taking action, committing the Danish people\u2019s hard-earned savings to significant new international green-energy investments. We also announced our intention to double our support to the Green Climate Fund. And our industries are committed too. The Getting to Zero Coalition, which includes the Danish shipping company Maersk and other partners, illustrates how shipping is showing leadership. With the aim of creating carbon-neutral vessels as early as 2030, the Coalition is bringing together the entire value chain. We must ensure that the ships connecting our world are not a danger to our planet.\nBut partnerships must not only be built across sectors and across borders. They must also be forged across generations. We must include young people, and we must empower them and hear their voices. We must enable their action so that they can shoulder their part of the responsibility to deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. And our youth will deliver if they are given access to the quality education we promised them. They will need an education not only to learn but also, as the Secretary-General has said, to learn to learn. Technological advancements, not least in the private sector, have provided extraordinary tools and possibilities. But only together can the public and private sectors lift future generations to levels of education unimaginable today. Not only because it is right, but because we need the innovative and pioneering thinking of future generations to ensure a world that continues to prosper. To quote a young Danish delegate who attended the Youth Climate Summit last Saturday, \u201cWe want you to hear us when we say we want to be part of the solution. We know our climate is threatened, we know what needs to be done. But we also know that none of us can make the needed changes on our own.\u201d\nLet us show the hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of young people who have taken to the streets recently to protest for climate action that we are listening. And let us do more than that. Let us act. We owe it to them. It is our common responsibility.\n\u201cWe the peoples\u201d means a just world where harmful social and economic inequalities are abolished, where decent jobs are available to all and universal human rights prevail without discrimination of any kind. It certainly does not mean \u201cwe the men\u201d. Today I am addressing the Assembly as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark, but also as a proud father of two wonderful little girls. Since we opened the seventy-fourth session, more than 300,000 girls have been born \u2014 ideally into a world of no discrimination, but in reality into a world where actively promoting gender equality and the right of every woman to make decisions about her own body is seen as a battleground.\nSexual and reproductive health and rights are fundamental for all women and girls, no matter where they are born. The fight for the rights of women and girls is an everyday part of Denmark\u2019s policy as a member of the Human Rights Council, in the General Assembly Hall and as an incoming member of the Commission on the Status of Women. Later this year, together with Kenya and the United Nations Population Fund, Denmark will proudly chair a conference in Nairobi to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Cairo Programme of Action. It is high time that we delivered on the promise made 25 years ago and ensured that these rights can become a reality for all, not just a privilege for some.\nAs I mentioned, Denmark has worked in close partnership with Ethiopia on energy and with Kenya on gender equality, in two examples of the partnerships across regions that we need to ensure sustainable development for all. We must realize the full potential of all continents, including Africa, where a proud history, natural wealth and a young, energetic population form a powerful base for progress. Denmark will support closer partnerships between our continents on multiple issues, including trade, development and stabilization.\nAll States have a responsibility to prevent conflict and protect people. Hiding behind sovereignty while committing crimes is not acceptable. That is why Denmark supports the Secretary-General\u2019s focus on prevention, early response to conflicts and the inclusion of regional actors. We remain concerned about the serious threat to regional security posed by the recent attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. Denmark calls for dialogue, restraint and de-escalation.\nDenmark has contributed significantly to the Peacebuilding Fund and we will continue to support the training and education of United Nations peacekeepers. More than 50,000 Danish women and men have served in peacekeeping operations since the creation of the United Nations. Even as I speak, my countrymen and -women are hard at work in challenging operations from Mali to the Middle East, serving \u201cwe the peoples\u201d.\nTo deliver on global challenges, we need a strong United Nations that is fit for purpose. Denmark continues to be a steadfast supporter of all three reforms initiated by the Secretary-General. The next year will be about implementation. Across all those reforms, we will focus on the ability to deliver on core challenges. Our embassies will engage in implementation and maintain a close dialogue with the United Nations teams on the ground. We urge the Secretary-General to ensure a human rights-based approach to all areas of the work of the United Nations. It is more important than ever to promote a culture of human rights within the United Nations. Alarms about serious human rights violations around the world must always be heard across the Secretariat and at its top as well.\nOur ability to deliver as \u201cwe the peoples\u201d will determine whether people will continue to look to this Organization for answers and solutions. In order to continue to be the place for solving the global issues of our times, the United Nations \u2014 all of us, that is \u2014 must deliver on climate action, sustainable development, human rights and peace and security. We know the challenges and we know what is needed. Now let us show the necessary will and act together.\n"

I assure him and the members of the Bureau of the support of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas during his tenure. I also extend our congratulations to his predecessor, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her leadership of the Assembly at its seventy-third session.\nIt is my privilege to address the Assembly on behalf of the people of the Bahamas. In the context of the global climate emergency, it is also my responsibility, as a citizen of a vulnerable State, to speak on behalf of the community of small island developing States (SIDS), the peoples of the Caribbean and the Caribbean Community, and the coastal and other communities around the world that are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels and increasingly powerful storms.\nI commend Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his extraordinary leadership in focusing the attention of the international community on the global climate emergency. This global emergency poses myriad and dire risks for all of humankind, especially the poorest in the global commons. I thank Mr. Guterres for his visit to the Bahamas in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, one of the most destructive the Atlantic has ever generated, and a generational tragedy for the Bahamas, since it has decimated and devastated great swathes of Grand Bahama Island, as well as Abaco and the Abaco Cays, which are our second and third most populous centres. I also want to thank the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. Mark Lowcock, for his visit in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane.\nThe Bahamas is an archipelago of many islands and cays stretching more than 750 miles from off the south-east coast of Florida in the United States to the north-eastern tip of Cuba. We inhabit approximately 180,000 square miles of ocean and 16 principal islands whose cities, towns and settlements have names such as Marsh Harbour, Hope Town, Eight Mile Rock, West End and Sweetings Cay, reflecting the rich and diverse heritage of our country. The Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield once noted, \u201cFrom space, the Bahamas is the most beautiful place on Earth\u201d, adding, \u201cThe Bahamas are gorgeous. The deep trench in the ocean floor called the Tongue of the Ocean, which comes between the islands, is the most beautiful deep indigo colour.\u201d\nWe delight with great pride in sharing our archipelago, vibrant culture and natural wonders with millions of visitors from around the world.\nTourism is our principal industry. We are stewards of this natural treasure for ourselves and for humankind. But this surpassing beauty, and our very existence as a country, composed of many low-lying islands and more than 2,400 cays, is under grave threat. It is a threat that we did not cause. It is a threat that we cannot survive on our own. While many countries have coastal cities and zones, the Bahamas in its entirety is a coastal zone of many cays and islands forming an extensive archipelago. Over the past three decades, hurricanes have grown increasingly lethal throughout our region. In the words of the Secretary-General, they have become turbocharged. The Bahamas experienced major hurricanes in 2015, 2016 and 2017, but on 1 September 2019, we experienced something far beyond anything we had seen before. In an unprecedented destructive force of wind, rain and sea surge, Hurricane Dorian ripped into the islands of the northern Bahamas.\nThe naturally warm aquamarine and jade waters of the Bahamas, made even warmer by earth-warming carbon-gas emissions, were rapidly whipped up into action as instruments of death and destruction. With unrelenting fury, Hurricane Dorian lingered for painful hours on end, its deadly force laying waste to communities where children were preparing for the beginning of a new school year. The hurricane and its destructive winds, storm surges and rain remained stationary over Grand Bahama and Great Abaco; the 30-hour fixed position of the storm\u2019s eye wall over some communities exacerbated these hazards. At its peak, Hurricane Dorian had maximum sustained winds of 185 miles per hour and gusts of more than 220 miles per hour. There were storm surges of 18 to 23 feet above normal tide levels, roughly three times my height of 6\u2019 1\u201d. Officially, there were 56 lives lost, but we know that the accurate number is considerably higher because 600 people are still missing as rising and receding ocean waters have swept young and old from their homes. The picturesque and industrious principal town of Marsh Harbour on Abaco has disappeared. Nothing is left of it but heaps of rubble. East End, on Grand Bahama, is in ruins. The hurricane was a physical apocalypse for some communities.\nOur hearts still ache as I address the Assembly here today. Thousands in our country continue to suffer and will face great difficulties in future as we struggle to recover and rebuild our broken towns and settlements and mend our spirits. At the same time, however, our hearts are filled with gratitude for the many friends and neighbours who came to our assistance even as the wind and water were still threatening us, and we thank those who continue to support us through these trying times.\nIn addition to the brave men and women of our Royal Bahamas Defence Force and the Royal Bahamas Police Force, we were aided by officers from the United States Coast Guard, our Caribbean Community friends and partners, including security personnel from Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, the Royal Canadian Air Force, the British Royal Navy and the Royal Netherlands Navy, which also transported troops from Germany, France and Belgium. Furthermore, the support that the Bahamas has received from fellow States Members of the United Nations, global and local non-governmental organizations, religious institutions and individuals, including school children, is a powerful demonstration of what it means to come together as a nation. To help focus and coordinate recovery, reconstruction and development assistance, we have created a new Ministry of Disaster Preparedness, Management and Reconstruction.\nThe small island countries in the Caribbean, the Atlantic, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean and elsewhere around the world are on the front lines of being swallowed up by an abyss, initially created by human activity and increasingly exacerbated by human inaction. Our vulnerabilities as States on the front line are profound. Because of the geographic distribution of the Bahamas, extending from Cuba and parallel to Florida, any number of hurricane trajectories may result in dire and protracted implications for our inhabited islands.\nGlobal warming increases the severity and frequency of hurricanes for our archipelago and destroys our natural defences against such storms. Coral and mangrove degradation, land erosion, increased tidal movements and a myriad other consequences of global warming increase our vulnerability and hinder our ability to develop and implement effective resilience measures. We cannot make meaningful progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals if, as forecasters are predicting, recent cyclonic and other extreme climate events are poised to become the new norm and may worsen. When one storm can obliterate an island State or a number of States in one hurricane season, how will we survive? How can we develop? How can we continue to exist?\nI therefore add my urgent plea to the cries and voices of many other leaders and citizens of the global commons for the nations of the world assembled in this Hall to treat the global climate emergency as the greatest challenge facing humankind. It is a challenge that if not treated with the greatest urgency will continue to ravage small island States such as the Bahamas, and will also have a devastating impact on more developed States.\nThe Bahamas fully supports the Secretary-General\u2019s comprehensive strategy to address the global climate emergency \u2014 which will eventually devastate the entire planet \u2014 including his plea to international financial institutions to provide concessionary financing to countries severely affected by the external shocks occasioned by climate change. The United Nations Development Programme is already working with three of our Caribbean neighbours \u2014 Saint Lucia, Dominica and Antigua and Barbuda \u2014 on various measures. The Bahamas encourages an expansion of this approach to include the Bahamas.\nWe urge the implementation of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA Pathway) and enhanced financing for sustainable development. We support the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure promoted by the Government of India, which I also thank for its recent assistance. Owing in particular to its many islands and cays requiring basic infrastructure, the Bahamas has major vulnerabilities and resilience deficiencies. We must urgently address these vulnerabilities in order to secure our citizens and protect vital public and private infrastructure.\nFor many years, the Bahamas and countries with similar characteristics have urged an alternative to per capita gross national income as the sole indicator of a country\u2019s level of development and eligibility for concessionary financing. When we call for consideration of a country\u2019s unique local circumstances in determining its financial worthiness, it should be remembered that access to financing is also a condition and requirement for our resilience. The Bahamas is a testament to the ability of SIDS to manage debt, despite such external setbacks.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to invite potential travellers from throughout the world to come and visit one or more of the 14 other major islands in the Bahamas that were not affected by Hurricane Dorian, including Nassau, on the island of New Providence. The revenue from tourists visiting the Bahamas will help to play a vital role in reconstructing and rebuilding the affected areas.\nTo help rebuild and restore Abaco, the Abaco Cays and East Grand Bahama, the Government of the Bahamas has announced that those areas will be designated as special economic recovery zones for an initial period of three years, which will enable the communities affected by Hurricane Dorian to benefit from an extensive range of tax breaks and incentives for Bahamians and international investors.\nAmid the decimation and devastation, there has been a symbol of hope and resilience in Abaco, from which we may draw inspiration, renewed energy and optimism. The iconic red-and-white-striped lighthouse in Hope Town on Elbow Cay, which is featured on the back of the Bahamian $10 bill, survived Hurricane Dorian. Built in 1863, over the decades this 89-foot lighthouse has helped to warn mariners of the dangerous reefs below. It is a symbol of pride for Abaconians and Bahamians. Soon after Hurricane Dorian, some of the residents of Hope Town placed a temporary light that shone in the darkness, with few other sources of light on the horizon. The Bahamas will restore the Hope Town lighthouse as a symbol of resilience, a source of unity and a beacon of hope. May it also serve as a symbol of resilience, unity and hope for a global commons willing to summon the courage and the imagination to act with justice and urgency to save our shared home.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a pleasure for me at the outset to extend to President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande my most sincere congratulations on his outstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I take this opportunity to assure him of my full support for him in the discharge of his mandate.\nI wish also to pay well-deserved tribute to Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for the excellent work she did during her term, which will go down in history as a successful presidency. Her unflagging energy and effectiveness do honour to all women.\nWe live in a world that is replete with of challenges of all kinds \u2014 inequality, armed conflict, terrorism and violent extremism, global warming, natural disasters, intolerance and the phenomenon of migration. A world that is more just and characterized by greater solidarity has always been one of my aspirations, first as a young revolutionary student and later as a political activist, at a time where the dream of a better world was our raison d\u2019\u00eatre. I often look back with nostalgia at that time, when we put human beings, their future and their status at the heart of our concerns. A sense of ethics and moral considerations were fundamental to our system of values.\nBut everything is different today; why and how did we lose sight of our values and reach a point where we no longer respect anything or anyone? Our situation today is a reflection of that transformation. Look at how we treat our fellow human beings, be they migrants or religious or ethnic minorities; what has happened to us? We forget that we are all here only temporarily and that our mission and duty is to protect and respect our neighbour and to preserve this Earth, which we inherited from our ancestors and which we must in turn pass on to future generations.\nWe must get back to our values. A perfect world is perhaps a pipe dream. But if each and every one of us takes a step with the goal of improving our welfare and that of our brothers and sisters, a better world is possible. For my part, I have tried to make my modest contribution throughout my life, particularly since my election to lead my country. Throughout my life it has been my ambition to contribute fully to a more just Guinea, one with greater solidarity, where all citizens, irrespective of their background or social status, can flourish in a healthy environment. The first years were hard; the coffers of the State were empty, and our country found no sympathetic ear at, or credibility with, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank or other international organizations. We had to set out on the long and difficult path of negotiating and convincing. We managed to cancel the debt and make the necessary reforms. For example, we had to force more than 4,000 army officers into retirement. We had to make difficult choices and give the country a boost in the context of the emergence of Ebola. We went through a very difficult period that we overcame thanks to the sense of responsibility and collaboration of all Guineans, to whom I pay tribute. Believe me, they are a great people who have always had the courage to get themselves back on their feet.\nPutting Guinea back on the investors\u2019 map has not been easy either, but today we are at last seeing strong growth in private investment in Guinea across all sectors. With regard to the fight against poverty, the Guinean Government has established national agencies for financing local authorities and social inclusion, which are facilitating a better distribution of wealth, particularly through the allocation of 15 per cent of mining revenues to local authorities and direct cash transfers to vulnerable populations in remote areas of the country.\nSince I have dedicated my mandate to young people and women, their participation in the decision-making process is central to our Government\u2019s actions. The establishment of a microcredit programme has enabled the transfer to women of more than 100 billion Guinean francs in the form of revolving credit. We have built modern empowerment centres for women and thousands of women are benefiting from training across every sector. In the field of employment, 6,857 women were recruited into the civil service between 2010 and 2018. In the agricultural sector, 3,314 women farmers have been trained in improved agricultural production techniques. Those measures naturally also benefit people with disabilities, who are encouraged to participate in active working life. In terms of the environment and the fight against global warming, Guinea has committed to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 13 per cent, and a vast reforestation programme covering 2 million hectares throughout Guinea\u2019s territory is planned by 2030.\nGender equality is one of my Government\u2019s priorities. In addition to ensuring parity in school and university enrolment, as well as the elimination of early marriage and other discriminatory practices, I want to emphasize projects that will help women to become self-sufficient economically, keep girls in school and ensure that they have access to technical and scientific fields. To combat unemployment, we have also set up public-private partnership programmes for young people and women that have disbursed $140 million so far, and we expect that amount to rise significantly.\nWe have managed to launch many projects in the area of infrastructure that have changed the face of Guinea, and with the participation of our public and private partners, we have established a programme for launching significant construction projects in social housing and road, rail and port infrastructure, including the establishment of special economic zones, which will enable Guinea to finally become an exporter of finished products.\nUnder my presidency of the African Union, the African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) was launched at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That transformative initiative, launched and led by Africa, is designed to accelerate, intensify and exploit the continent\u2019s immense potential in renewable energy resources, sustainable development and respect for the climate, which are the watchwords of that initiative. Despite the great scepticism that accompanied the creation of AREI in a general context in which we have become accustomed to never fulfilling the goals we set, today I have the pleasure and honour to announce to the Assembly that on 23 September the AREI Board of Directors confirmed that our target of funding 10 gigawatts of electricity, set for 2020, has been achieved, as we are already at 9.99 gigawatts.\nI am also pleased to inform the Assembly that 92 other projects are at the technical evaluation stage and in the course of being approved. That will enable us to provide clean energy to millions of households across every geographic regions of the world. We can therefore say that with that renewable energy initiative, Africa is acting in the fight against climate change for both our continent and the world, better positioning Africa for participating in the world\u2019s open trade networks. Two- thirds of Africans do not have access to electricity. I am making an appeal here to encourage and solicit the involvement of more public and private partners from around the world to invest in the renewable energy sector in Africa. That will enable our continent to use its resources more efficiently and make life more enjoyable and attractive to our young people so that they can finally see emigration as a choice and not an unavoidable constraint. When Africa wins, the world wins, because Africa is the future of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "We are getting ever closer to the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, which was established thanks to victory in the Second World War and our recognition that a collective mechanism for maintaining international peace and security was essential. Unhappily, the events of the Cold War, which began soon after, prevented it from unleashing the full extent of its potential for good. The hope re-emerged almost 30 years ago with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the symbol of two irreconcilably opposed systems. It was the hope that perhaps at last we could turn the page on the pain of wars, cold and hot, and unite our efforts for the benefit of all humankind.\nHowever, we have to admit that despite the fact that thanks to the United Nations we have succeeded in preventing a third world war, there are no fewer conflicts and enmity on the Earth, and new and terrible challenges have emerged \u2014 international terrorism, drug trafficking, climate change, illegal migration and a growing gap between rich and poor. Coping with these and many other challenges becomes harder and harder every year, and the international community is only growing ever more fragmented. We believe that the chief reason for this state of affairs is the unwillingness of the countries that declared themselves the victors in the Cold War to consider the legitimate interests of every other State and to accept the objective realities of the course of history. The West is finding it difficult to come to terms with the fact that its centuries-long dominance of world affairs is disappearing. New centres of economic growth and political influence are springing up and becoming stronger, and without them it will be impossible to find sustainable solutions to the world\u2019s problems, which we can address only through the firm foundation provided by the Charter of the United Nations and by balancing the interests of every State.\nThe leading Western nations are trying to prevent the establishment of a polycentric world, restore their positions of privilege and impose standards of conduct on everyone else based on their own narrow interpretation of liberalism. To put it in a nutshell, they say, \u201cWe are liberals and can therefore do anything we want\u201d. In its desire to achieve this, the West recalls international law ever more rarely, and ever more often and more insistently argues for a so-called rules-based order. The aim of the concept of this kind of order is obvious \u2014 it is to rewrite the norms of international law that no longer suit the West and replace them with rules that conform to their self-serving schemes, devised based on political expediency, while the West proclaims itself, and itself alone, the undisputed source of legitimacy. For instance, when it is advantageous, the right of peoples to self-determination is important, but when it is not, it is declared to be illegitimate.\nThese revisionist rules are justified by manipulating the public consciousness, disseminating false information, creating double standards for human rights, suppressing unwelcome media outlets and banning journalism. The West also has apt pupils among its client States in post-Soviet territory. Collective work on an equal footing is being replaced by closed- format meetings held outside the legitimate multilateral frameworks, with approaches agreed on behind closed doors by a select few that are then declared to be multilateral agreements, accompanied by attempts to privatize the secretariats of international organizations and use them to advance non-consensus ideas in order to circumvent universal mechanisms.\nThe attacks on international law are reaching alarming levels. There has been much talk about the withdrawal of the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, endorsed by Security Council resolution 2231 (2015). Not only has Washington repudiated its obligations under the resolution, it has started demanding that everyone else also play by the United States\u2019 rules and sabotage its implementation. The United States has taken a hard line in its efforts to erode United Nations resolutions on the international legal foundations for a settlement in the Middle East. It has proposed that we await some so-called deal of the century while at the same time it takes unilateral decisions on Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. The possibility of a two-State solution to the Palestinian issue, which is of key significance for satisfying the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people and ensuring the security of Israel and the whole region, is under threat.\nWhen members of NATO bombed Libya in open violation of Security Council resolutions, it was clear that they too were guided by the logic of their so-called rules-based order. The result was the destruction of Libya\u2019s statehood, while to this day the international community is grappling with the mess created by the pernicious legacy of NATO\u2019s adventurism, especially for the countries of Africa.\nThe hidden agendas continue in the counter-terrorism arena. Despite the universally binding Security Council resolutions on listing terrorist organizations, some countries have made it a rule to shield terrorists and even work with them on the ground, as we have seen in Afghanistan, Libya and Syria, for instance. The United States is already saying openly that Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham is a quite moderate group that it can do business with. It also wants to get other members of the Security Council to go along with its unacceptable reasoning, as the recent discussions on the situation in Idlib in Syria showed. And the West also applies its own rules with regard to the Balkans, where it is openly working to undermine Security Council resolutions on the settlements in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nTogether with the resolutions of the Security Council, our universal conventions are integral to international law. The West would like to replace them with its rules, too, as happened with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, whose Technical \u2014 and I stress the word \u201ctechnical\u201d \u2014 Secretariat was illegally granted so-called attributive functions as a result of unlawful manipulation and unscrupulous pressure, in direct violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the exclusive prerogatives of the Security Council.\nThe game-playing continues around conventions that require all countries to uphold the linguistic, educational, religious and other rights of their national minorities. Even here our Western colleagues are guided by their rules. They turn a blind eye to blatant efforts to deny national minorities such rights and continue to condone the shameful existence of statelessness in Europe.\nRevisionist tendencies with regard to international law are increasingly evident in the sustained attempts to rewrite the history of the Second World War and to justify the growing manifestations of neo-Nazism and the vandalism of monuments to the liberators of Europe and the victims of the Holocaust. The strength of key principles of the United Nations Charter such as non-interference in the internal affairs of others and the inadmissibility of the use or threat of force is also being tested. Attempts are now being made to add Venezuela to the list of countries whose statehood has been violated before our eyes through aggression or foreign-inspired coups. Like an overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations, Russia rejects any attempt to resurrect the rules of the Monroe Doctrine era in Latin America and to effect regime change in sovereign States from outside without shrinking from military blackmail, unlawful coercion and blockades, as is the case with Cuba despite numerous United Nations resolutions.\nNext year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, which was adopted on Russia\u2019s initiative. To this day, however, a number of western States are still clinging to the old rules, ignoring the Declaration and other General Assembly resolutions on decolonization that pertain directly to them by retaining their control over former overseas territories.\nThis November marks another anniversary \u201420 years since the Charter for European Security and the Platform for Cooperative Security were adopted at the sixth Summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Those documents set out the principles of cooperation for every country and regional organization in the Euro-Atlantic area. Our Heads of States and Governments solemnly declared that no country should pursue its own security at the expense of another. Today, regrettably, the consensus reached back then at the highest level is being replaced by the practices that NATO has adopted as its rules, as it continues to think in terms of seeking out enemies, moving its military infrastructure eastward towards Russia\u2019s borders and increasing its military budgets, although they are already more than 20 times larger than those of Russia. We call for a return to the agreements that establish equal and indivisible security within the OSCE area, which some of Europe\u2019s responsible politicians have spoken out in favour of recently, as was the case at the August meeting of President Putin of Russia and President Macron of France, for instance.\nWe also need a reliable and open architecture in the Asia-Pacific region. It would be dangerous to yield to the temptation to divide it into conflicting blocs, which would be at odds with the goal of uniting the efforts of every country of the region to respond effectively to the continuing threats and challenges there, including that of resolving the whole complex of issues on the Korean peninsula by exclusively peaceful means.\nTremendous damage has been done to the decades- old system of global strategic stability by the actions of the United States, which, after withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, has now destroyed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, with the obedient support of every member of NATO. Now the future of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) is in question. On top of that, the United States refuses to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear- Test-Ban Treaty and has lowered the threshold in its doctrinal documents for the use of nuclear weapons. It is also on a course to transform cyberspace and outer space into arenas for military confrontation.\nRussia has put forward a number of initiatives to prevent the further escalation of tensions. President Putin announced the decision to refrain from deploying land- based intermediate- and short-range missiles in Europe and other regions as long as the United States does the same. We have urged the United States and NATO to sign up to a moratorium in that regard. We have also repeatedly invited Washington to begin negotiations on extending the New START Treaty. Together with China, we support an agreement on a legally binding document on the prevention of an arms race in outer space. So far the reaction of the United States and its allies to all of these proposals has not been encouraging. We are also disturbed by the protracted lack of a response to a proposal we made to our American colleagues a year ago to adopt a high-level Russian-American declaration on the unacceptability and inadmissibility of nuclear war, a war that by definition no one can win. We call on all Member States to support that initiative.\nToday I would like to announce that during the current session of the General Assembly we will introduce a draft resolution on strengthening and developing the system of agreements on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation. We invite everyone to constructive negotiations. The adoption of such a resolution would represent a major contribution to creating the conditions for a successful Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons next year.\nRussia will continue to work diligently to strengthen global security. We are acting with the utmost responsibility in this area by exercising restraint in building our defence capacity, although obviously not at the expense of effectively guaranteeing national security, and in full compliance with international law. We support the consolidation of efforts to combat international terrorism under the auspices of the United Nations. In the interests of mobilizing the potential of regional organizations to suppress the threat of terrorism, Russia convened a ministerial meeting of the Security Council (see S/PV.8626), with the participation of representatives of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Commonwealth of Independent States.\nOne of the most crucial tasks of the international community is developing generally acceptable approaches to regulating the digital arena and understanding the processes related to the development of artificial intelligence. Last year, the General Assembly endorsed the start of substantive work to agree on rules for responsible State behaviour in the information space. On Russia\u2019s initiative it also adopted resolution 73/187, on combating cybercrime. It will be important to work to reach legally binding agreements on every aspect of international information security.\nWe should also ramp up our efforts to settle the many crises and conflicts all over the world. The main point is to get the parties involved to comply with existing agreements and not to allow them to invent pretexts for refusing to fulfil commitments they have already made. Of course, that also applies to conflicts in the post-Soviet space, including the importance of strict compliance with the provisions of the Minsk package of measures for resolving the crisis in eastern Ukraine.\nIn Syria, where there have been major successes in the fight against terrorism, the priority now is further advancing the political process, led by the Syrians with the assistance of the United Nations. With the decisive contribution of Russia, Turkey and Iran as guarantors of the Astana format, the Constitutional Committee has been established, as Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced a few days ago. On the agenda are post-conflict reconstruction and the creation of conditions conducive to the return of refugees. The United Nations system should play a much more active role in this.\nIn general, however, there are still many problems in the Middle East and North Africa. We have seen what is happening in Libya and Yemen. The prospects for a resolution of the Palestinian peace process and the realization of the Arab Peace Initiative are on the verge of collapse. The attempts to play the Kurdish card, which is potentially a combustible issue for many countries, are alarming. The tensions in the Persian Gulf are being artificially escalated. We call for resolving the existing disagreements through dialogue, without resorting to baseless accusations. This summer we contributed by presenting Russia\u2019s renewed concept for collective security in the region.\nYesterday, in support of the efforts of African States to end the conflicts on their continent, Russia held a Security Council meeting on strengthening peace and security in Africa (see S/PV.8627). In Sochi, at the end of October, we will host the first-ever Russia-Africa Summit, and we hope that its results will enable us to improve the effectiveness of the fight against the current challenges and threats, as well as of the work on the development issues that African countries face.\nThe reform of the Security Council is aimed at improving the anti-crisis and peacekeeping activities of the United Nations. The realities of our multipolar world mean that our chief task is finding a formula that can end the obvious geopolitical imbalances in the Council\u2019s current composition and expand the representation of African, Asian, and Latin American countries on it, with the broadest possible agreement of Member States.\nDividing lines are damaging to the world economy as well as world politics. The economy\u2019s inclusive growth is being limited as a result of the fact that other rules are replacing the norms of the World Trade Organization \u2014 methods involving unfair competition, protectionism, trade wars, unilateral sanctions and blatant abuse of the status of the American dollar. That all leads to the fragmentation of the global economic arena and has a negative impact on people\u2019s lives. We believe that it is essential to return to working constructively together both in entities of the United Nations system and in the Group of 20. We will help to create conditions conducive to that, including through the potential of the BRICS group of countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, of which Russia will assume the pro tempore presidency in 2020.\nTogether with other like-minded countries, we support harmonizing integration processes. That approach is at the core of President Putin\u2019s initiative in establishing a greater Eurasian partnership made up of the member countries of the Eurasian Economic Union, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and which is open to all States in Eurasia, including the European Union member countries. We have already made progress in that direction by linking development plans for the Eurasian Economic Union and the Chinese Belt and Road initiative. The consistent implementation of those efforts will enable us not only to speed up economic growth but also to lay a solid foundation for building a space of peace, stability and cooperation from Lisbon to Jakarta.\nIn the run-up to the next anniversary of the United Nations, I would like to underline that despite all its trials, the system of a world order centred on the United Nations remains stable and has considerable capacity for resilience. It is a kind of safety net, and if we respect the Charter, it will guarantee humankind\u2019s peaceful development by finding a balance of what are sometimes the very contradictory interests of various countries. Perhaps the main conclusion to be drawn from those 75 years is that States\u2019 experience of non-ideological cooperation in the face of a common threat, gained in the course of that cruellest of wars, is still relevant. Today\u2019s challenges and threats are no less dangerous. Only by working together can we respond to them effectively. Half a century ago, the great Russian scholar, public figure and Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov wrote, \u201cThe division of mankind threatens it with destruction ... If mankind is to step away from the brink, it must overcome its divisions\u201d.\nThe founding fathers of the United Nations saw its chief task as one of uniting. Let us show ourselves worthy of their legacy and their memory.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to congratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his commendable election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. We firmly believe that his diplomatic skills, erudition and extensive experience will enable him to manage the Assembly\u2019s heavy workload. In that regard, I wish to express the firm commitment and full readiness of my delegation to cooperate with him and his office during the current session.\nAllow me also to express our sincere thanks to Ms. Maria Espinosa Garces and her team for their outstanding work during the seventy-third session of the General Assembly. We will build on the passionate dedication to promoting multilateralism that she demonstrated during her term as President. In statements steeped in rich vocabulary and culture, she always inspired us and showed that poetic speech and political thought can be intimately connected. I also wish to express our deep gratitude to the Secretary-General for the commendable actions and efforts that he, his special representatives and all United Nations personnel are undertaking in very difficult situations and environments throughout the world.\nWe gather today in a troubling context in which multilateralism, itself firmly based on international cooperation, is under constant attack. That crisis situation is all the more paradoxical as it comes at a time when the interdependence among the countries of the world has never been as close. Global challenges therefore require global collective action. Multilateral action is vital and urgently needed.\nIt is only collectively that we can find solutions to the global challenges of poverty, inequality and climate change. Although those challenges affect everyone to varying degrees, the poorest countries are the most vulnerable owing to their insecurity. The current geopolitical upheavals, the rising tensions caused by the trade war and forecasts of declining global economic growth have generated risks and are raising doubts about our ability to mobilize the necessary resources to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.\nThe reports of the World Bank highlight a worrisome weakness in the volume of investment and the negative impact that it could have on the implementation of the SDGs. Those developments are regrettable given that, when the potentially transformative agenda was adopted, we were aware that we should not only adopt a radically different approach but also secure a volume of funding in the trillions of dollars. It is therefore incumbent on us all to share resources, while taking into account the effectiveness of their impact on sustainability.\nGovernments must improve their business climates to attract investment that will foster sustainable development. The private sector must focus its efforts not on short-term but long-term investments. It will also be a question of us seeking together innovative solutions to secure financing for the SDGs.\nAs early as February 2014, Djibouti introduced compulsory health insurance for the working segment of its population and a social health-care assistance programme for all persons who are known to have no source of income. Over the past five years, significant efforts to shore up that insurance and make it available to migrant and refugee populations residing in Djibouti have been made.\nDjibouti therefore reaffirms its commitment to meeting target 3.8 of the Sustainable Development Goals, \u201cAchieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all\u201d, of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Djibouti is also determined to transition to an integrated, patient-centred, computerized healthcare system in its development of universal health insurance leading to universal health-care coverage, thereby creating the necessary conditions for a more effective health-care data system.\nDjibouti is further determined to combat all forms of inequality, especially those relating to gender inequality, by placing that goal at the core of its political agenda. Through structural reforms, the Government is pursuing its vital work towards the eradication of the political, economic and social obstacles faced by women. In that connection, we enacted a law at the beginning of the year that raised the quota of women in the National Assembly of Djibouti from 10 to 25 per cent.\nClimate change is the most threatening and serious challenge of our time. Our thoughts turn in particular to our brothers and sisters in the Bahamas who have been devastated by the destructive hurricane that caused death and desolation on an unprecedented scale. We reiterate our gratitude to the Secretary-General for the many initiatives that have been taken to continue drawing attention to a phenomenon whose consequences are catastrophic. The extensive discussions that were held at the Climate Action Summit made it possible to identify the concrete actions to be taken.\nThe holistic shift towards peace in the Horn of Africa continues. Our countries\u2019 determination to consolidate the gains that have been made is growing stronger every day. Our conviction that total and lasting peace in our region is possible is also becoming stronger every day. The latest good news comes from the Sudan, a neighbouring and brother country. We welcome the success of the negotiations that led to a peaceful resolution of the crisis and the signing of a power-sharing agreement.\nThe progress that has been made with regard to the peace process in South Sudan is encouraging. The various talks held between President Salva Kiir Mayardit and Mr. Riek Machar constitute a significant development. We note in particular the renewal of their commitment to forming a transitional Government by 12 November. In its capacity as a member of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, Djibouti will continue to urge the parties to pursue efforts to break the political deadlock and implement the commitments that have been made.\nWith regard to Somalia, despite the tensions related to political dynamics in the context of elections in the member states of the Federal Republic and the acts of violence perpetrated by Al-Shabaab, we are encouraged by the progress that has been made on the economic and security fronts. We must redouble our efforts to help Somalia achieve its primary objectives \u2014 holding federal elections, enhancing security, implementing ambitious economic reforms and obtaining debt relief. We must do everything possible to ensure that the positive regional momentum contributes to efforts to stabilize the country and implement its ongoing transition plan, thus helping to create an environment conducive to national reconciliation.\nWe remain confident that relations between Djibouti and Eritrea will improve even further and that the outstanding issues will be definitively resolved. Djibouti remains deeply committed to peace and the promotion of sound and robust bilateral solutions with all its neighbours. We must work tirelessly together to accelerate efforts to promote regional integration. In that regard, we commend the dedication with which Mr. Abiy Ahmed, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, is working to bring the views of Djibouti and Eritrea closer together.\nTerrorism is an existential threat to the peace and security of our countries. We cannot allow innocent civilians to be massacred and mutilated under false pretences. As Africans, the situation in the Sahel is of the utmost concern to us. We reaffirm our support for, and solidarity with, all the Sahel countries that are faced with that grave danger and are making significant efforts within the framework of the Group of Five for the Sahel. We urge the international community to mobilize the necessary financial resources to support those efforts. In that regard, we welcome the outcomes of the Extraordinary Summit of the Economic Community of West African States that was held on 14 September.\nWe strongly condemn the 14 September attack that targeted oil processing facilities in Saudi Arabia. That serious incident directly undermined the de-escalation that the international community has been advocating.\nWe are also extremely concerned about the deteriorating health situation and the increased risk of fragmentation in Yemen. We reiterate our solidarity with the legitimate authorities of Yemen and commend their political will to continue their efforts to implement the Stockholm Agreement in spite of the negative developments that have harmed the political climate. Djibouti will continue to welcome its Yemeni brothers and sisters, whose country is facing an unprecedented humanitarian tragedy. Djibouti has been generously welcoming Yemeni refugees to its territory since the crisis began and will continue to do so.\nThe surge of violence in the occupied Palestinian territories is increasingly clouding the prospects for a two-State solution. Those settlements constitute a violation not only of international law, in particular article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, but also of the human rights of the Palestinians. We also strongly condemn Israel\u2019s recently announced plans to annex the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea to extend its sovereignty in the occupied West Bank.\nIn June 2020, the Assembly will hold elections for five non-permanent seats on the Security Council for the term 2021-2022, one of which is allocated to Africa. In line with the African Group\u2019s tradition of subregional rotation, that seat should be occupied by an East African State. In accordance with African Union law, it is undisputable that Djibouti be the African Group\u2019s candidate for the seat on the Security Council for the term 2021-2022. The principle of rotation ensures that all African States, large or small, have equal opportunity to serve on the Security Council and other United Nations bodies.\nIn that regard and out of respect for the sovereign equality of States, Djibouti respectfully urges all Member States to support its candidature for the Security Council for the term 2021-2022. If elected, Djibouti will resolutely promote the obligation of all States to uphold international law and maintain peace and security, and will advocate for the recommitment to a multilateral, rules-based international order.\nWe must pool our efforts and resources and create safe and stable conditions in order to consolidate multilateralism. Failure is not an option. That is why we support the Alliance for Multilateralism, an initiative launched by Germany and France.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate Ambassador Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. Indonesia stands ready to contribute to the success of the Assembly at this session. I would also like to extend my appreciation to Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, who presided over and led the seventy-third session. On this occasion, I would like to convey five points.\nFirst, I want to underline the importance of multilateralism, which is closely related to the theme of this year\u2019s session. The United Nations is a result of multilateralism. The success of its mission will be determined by how the Organization is able to strengthen multilateralism to achieve global peace and prosperity. We live in a world of increasingly complex and serious challenges. At times like this, we must all unite and stand together to strengthen multilateralism. No country, big or small, will be able to solve those challenges alone.\nFor that, we have to work together. We must share our responsibilities. That is what multilateralism is all about, and that is its essence. For more than seven decades, multilateralism has saved us from the tragedy of a world war. It has also delivered economic prosperity and unprecedented technological advances to the world. Indonesia believes that the world will become more stable, peaceful and prosperous by upholding multilateral values. We also believe that only by reinforcing multilateralism can the United Nations fulfil its obligations to maintain world peace and security, realize development and protect the human rights of all.\nSecondly, I want to convey the importance of maintaining world peace. Seventy-four years ago, we agreed to establish the United Nations because we wanted to achieve world peace. Here let me cite the opening of the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations: \u201c[...] to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind.\u201d\nWar and conflict have always brought misery to humankind, in particular women and children. War and conflict have destroyed years of development, ruined infrastructure and disrupted economic activity, education and the provision of health care. In short, war and conflict will destroy our hope of achieving all of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nWe are all concerned about the ongoing wars and conflicts in the world. Old ones remain unresolved, while new ones are arising, including in the Middle East. The attacks that have wrecked civilian facilities and infrastructure in the Middle East not only threaten peace and stability in the region, they also steal the hopes and futures of the communities affected, particularly women and children. Peace in the Middle East will be possible only if we resolve the issue of Palestine. We will not give up on a settlement to the conflict based on a two-State solution, and the international community must unite to find that solution. At the same time, I also urge the establishment of a united Palestine. Unity is the basis of the Palestinian struggle. Without unity, the struggle will only drain our energy and will never be won.\nWhen we talk about peace it is important to be grateful for our peacekeepers. Indonesia pays a lot of attention to its peacekeeping forces. Among other things, that commitment was realized when we became one of the largest personnel contributors to United Nations peacekeeping forces. The challenges that our peacekeepers face are becoming ever more complex. They must therefore be well prepared in order to properly perform their task. Deployment preparation should be better managed, including by ensuring that peacekeepers master soft skills.\nWe also see the need to strengthen female peacekeepers. Indonesia therefore supports efforts to improve women\u2019s involvement in peacekeeping forces. Indonesia is actively contributing to tackling the issue of women and peace and security. This year, for the first time, we hosted regional training on women and peace and security in order to strengthen the role of women in the peace and mediation process. Women are agents of peace. Indonesia is also active in providing capacity-building to women, including female refugees in Palestine and Afghanistan.\nThirdly, I want to convey the importance of strengthening regionalism and sustainable regionalism. The stability, peace and prosperity of regions are the building blocks for achieving world peace. We must therefore strengthen our regional institutions. For more than five decades, Indonesia, along with other countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), has cultivated a culture of dialogue, cooperation and peaceful settlement of disputes in South-East Asia. We want to reinforce and expand this culture, including within the Indo-Pacific region. ASEAN wants to see a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. In that context, ASEAN leaders adopted the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific in June. The Outlook will be a guideline for ASEAN to develop cooperation with countries in the Indo-Pacific region.\nFourthly, I want to highlight the importance of working together to achieve the SDGs by 2030. Our hard-earned peace will not be sustainable without improvement in global development. We have only 11 years left to achieve the SDGs. Although we have been making headway on some goals, we still have plenty of work to do. Many countries have a limited capacity to achieve the SDGs in areas such as education, health and women\u2019s empowerment, for example. Global partnerships must therefore be reinforced.\nIndonesia is striving hard to achieve the SDGs. The expansion of access to education and universal health care continues, particularly for those affected by poverty. Infrastructure development in rural and suburban areas has multiplied. We have to support those afflicted by poverty and the less advantaged. Thankfully, signs of improvement have been apparent. Last year, for example, poverty figures dropped to single digits for the first time in Indonesian history. We have also experienced a narrowing in inequality; our assessment on the Gini index of income inequality is down from 0.414 to just 0.384. A total of 223 million Indonesian have access to national health insurance and approximately 18 million school-age children receive financial student assistance.\nIndonesia does not work solely for the good of Indonesia. We continue to strengthen our development partnerships with friendly countries, including in Asia and Africa. This year Indonesia held two events aimed at strengthening development partnerships with the Pacific region, the Indonesia-South Pacific Forum, in Jakarta, and the Pacific Exposition, in Auckland. Those events ushered in a new era of Indonesian partnerships with countries in the Pacific, which we refer to as the Pacific elevation. Going forward, the partnership between Indonesia and the Pacific will be more strategic and structured.\nIndonesia is also strengthening its development partnership with Africa. After holding the Indonesia-Africa Forum last year, this year Indonesia is focusing on infrastructure cooperation through the Indonesia-Africa Infrastructure Dialogue. With their various challenges and characteristics, Indonesia is willing to advance and grow together with friendly nations in the Pacific and Africa.\nThe fifth and final point that I would like to raise is the importance of upholding the Charter of the United Nations. The principles and values of the Charter must be respected by every country. As we mark the seventy-fourth anniversary of the United Nations, Indonesia is concerned about the fact that many Charter commitments remain unimplemented or even breached by Member States, such as the commitment to respecting the sovereignty of other countries. Respect for sovereignty is a fundamental commitment and the principle that underpins relations among nations. It must and should be respected. Indonesia\u2019s foreign policy position is clear. While Indonesia will always respect the sovereignty of other countries, it also expects other countries to respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Relationships among nations must be based on mutual respect.\nFinally, I am putting forward Indonesia\u2019s candidacy for the Human Rights Council for the 2020-2022 period. As one of the founding countries of the Human Rights Council, Indonesia is deeply committed to promoting and advancing human rights through dialogue and international cooperation. We are working actively to strengthen ASEAN\u2019s human rights mechanisms through the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights. In the Organization of Islamic Cooperation,\nIndonesia is also actively encouraging the strengthening of the Independent Permanent Commission for Human Rights. By championing the motto \u201ca true partner for democracy, development and social justice\u201d, Indonesia wants to be a true partner in advancing and protecting human rights for all.\nIn closing, I would like to once again emphasize that today we need a commitment to the values of multilateralism more than ever. Indonesia is firmly convinced that many countries still cherish that belief. Let us build a global coalition in support of multilateralism for a more peaceful, stable and prosperous world. Indonesia is ready to lead and become part of such a coalition. To cite a famous African proverb, \u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election to lead the General Assembly at this session and to wish him every success in the future. I would also like to thank his predecessor for her important role as President of the previous session.\nWe are meeting today at a moment when the global outlook may seem bleak. The foundations of the international relations system on the political, economic, legal and security fronts are facing threats that are unprecedented in the history of our Organization. Conflicts and threats to international peace and security are on the rise. The prospects for war are far more likely than the prospects for peace. The possibility of a balanced global economy has become uncertain. Violations of international conventions and treaties are commonplace, while the use of illegal means that go outside international law, such as support for terrorism and the imposition of economic embargoes, has got out of hand. All of that only creates chaos around the world and gradually replaces the rule of law with the law of the jungle. It jeopardizes our countries\u2019 future and makes our people pay the ultimate price, sacrificing their security, the lives of their children, their stability and well-being.\nToday we are at a crossroads. Either we work in good faith to build a more secure, stable and just world, a world free of terrorism, occupation and hegemony, a world based on international law and a culture of dialogue and mutual understanding, or despite everything we do nothing, leaving the fate of our people and of future generations uncertain and flouting the purposes and principles set forth by the founding fathers of our Organization. That is the issue that the Assembly must address.\nTerrorism remains one of the main threats to international peace and security, a danger to all of us without exception. Despite the extraordinary achievements that we have made in Syria, thanks to the sacrifices and heroism of the Syrian Arab Army and the support of our allies and friends, our people have suffered for more than eight years from that scourge, which has brutally murdered innocent people, caused a humanitarian crisis, destroyed our infrastructure and plundered and ruined our country. History will undoubtedly remember the heroism of the Syrian people in their war against terrorism. Syrians have defended not only themselves, their country and their culture, they have defended the whole of humankind. They have defended civilized values and a culture of tolerance and coexistence against the extremism and the ideology of hatred and death that terrorist groups such as Da\u2019esh, the Al-Nusra Front and their sponsors and supporters are trying to spread.\nWe are determined to continue the war on terrorism in all its forms until we root out the last remaining terrorist on Syria\u2019s land. We will also take every measure necessary to ensure that it does not re-emerge. However, we need genuine international will if we are to put a definitive end to that global nightmare, which haunts us all. We do not need to reinvent the wheel to do that. We already have a large number of related Security Council resolutions adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. But while they focus on fighting terrorism and drying up its resources and funding, the problem is that they remain a dead letter.\nUnfortunately, countering terrorism is not yet a priority for certain countries, which have remained deathly quiet in the face of the brutal terrorism confronting countries like my own. While some of those countries merely issue empty statements, others actually invest in terrorism, using it as a tool to impose their suspect agendas on the peoples and on the Governments that reject their external diktats and insist on making independent national decisions. The situation in Syria is a vivid example of that. Tens of thousands of foreign terrorist fighters have been brought to Syria from more than 100 countries with the support and cover of States that are known to all. Moreover, those same States deny us the right to defend our people against terrorists, whom they consider freedom fighters, or against the so-called Syrian armed opposition. However, they seem to have forgotten that if they continue with that approach, terrorism will re-emerge stronger than ever and will threaten everyone, without exception, including its supporters and those who have invested in it.\nThe clearest example of what I am talking about is the situation in Idlib. It is well known to all that Idlib currently hosts the largest collection of foreign terrorist fighters in the world, as is detailed in the reports of the relevant Security Council Committees. The time I have been allotted to speak today is not enough to list all the crimes that these terrorists have committed. However, I should not fail to mention their continuing rocket and mortar attacks on civilian areas close to Idlib and the fact that they use civilians in Idlib as human shields, preventing them from leaving through the Abu Al-Duhur humanitarian corridor that the Syrian Government has opened.\nWhat I want to ask the members of the Assembly is whether their Governments would stand idly by and watch if they were faced with a similar situation. Would they ever forfeit their right and duty to defend their peoples and liberate their countries from terrorists and foreigners? The Syrian Government has engaged in political initiatives to resolve the situation in Idlib, and we have allowed more than enough time for them to be implemented. We have welcomed the memorandum creating de-escalation zones and the Sochi agreement on Idlib in hopes that such steps would complement the efforts to eliminate the Al-Nusra Front and the remnants of Da\u2019esh and other terrorist groups operating in Idlib with the lowest possible loss of civilian lives.\nWe have also announced a suspension of military operations more than once. Meanwhile, the Turkish regime has failed to fulfil its commitments under those agreements, instead providing terrorists with every kind of support, including more sophisticated weapons. Al-Qaida\u2019s Al-Nusra Front controls more than 90 per cent of Idlib, and the Turkish observation points established inside Syria have been used to support them and block the advances of the Syrian Army and its war on terrorism in Idlib. With the support of some Western countries, the Turkish regime is now rushing to protect the terrorists of Al-Nusra Front and other terrorist groups there, just as it has done every time we confront the terrorists. It is hard to imagine a country directly intervening to protect the Al-Nusra Front of Al-Qaida, the same terrorist group that Security Council resolutions considers to be a threat not only to Syria but also to international peace and security.\nThe United States and Turkey maintain an illegal military presence in northern Syria. They have been arrogant enough to hold discussions and reach agreement on establishing a so-called safe zone on Syrian territory as if such a zone would be created on United States or Turkish soil. That is a violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. Any agreement about any part of Syria without the consent of the Syrian Government is to be condemned and rejected in form and in substance. Moreover, any foreign forces operating on our territories without our assent are occupying forces and must withdraw immediately. If they refuse to do so, we have the right to take all measures against them under international law.\nIn that regard, I would like to briefly mention the terrorist, criminal and aggressive practices of the secessionist militias known as the Syrian Democratic Forces against Syrians in Hasakah, Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor governorates. With the support of the United States of America and international coalition forces, they seek to impose a new reality that serves the agendas of the United States and Israel in the region, prolonging the terrorist war against Syria.\nTurkey\u2019s policies, whether in Idlib or in north-eastern Syria, and its multi-track political manoeuvring undermine all the achievements made in Astana. Turkey cannot claim to uphold Syria\u2019s unity and territorial integrity, while at the same time being the first to actually undermine them. If Turkey is truly committed to the security of its borders and the unity of Syria, as it claims to be, it must determine its options. Either it must respect the Astana agreement and the bilateral counter-terrorism agreements between our two countries, in order to guarantee the security of its borders, and withdraw its forces from Syrian territories, or it must choose to be the aggressor and occupier and face the consequences. The safety of the borders of one country cannot be secured at the expense of the security, sovereignty or territorial integrity of neighbouring countries.\nAlong with our fight against terrorism, we are committed to moving the political process forward. We have continued to participate in the Astana meetings, the results of which have proved to be effective on the ground. We are dealing positively with the outcome of the Congress of the Syrian National Dialogue in Sochi, and the establishment of a committee to discuss the Constitution. To that end, we have engaged seriously and constructively in a dialogue with the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria in forming the committee. Indeed, it was Syria\u2019s determination to establish the Constitutional Committee upon the persistence of President Bashar Al-Assad that led to this important national achievement for the Syrian people and thwarted any attempt to obstruct it by other parties that have consistently supported foreign forces and imposed preconditions to prevent any return to normalcy in Syria.\nDuring his recent visit to Damascus, we reached agreement with the Special Envoy, Mr. Geir Pedersen, on the terms of reference and core rules of procedure of the Constitutional Committee, as well as the principles governing its work. Those include the following.\nFirst, the whole process should be owned and led by the Syrians themselves, who have the exclusive right to determine their country\u2019s future, without any foreign intervention.\nSecondly, the full and strong commitment to fully respecting the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic must not be compromised in any way.\nThirdly, no preconditions or conclusions may be imposed on the Committee and its recommendations should not be prejudged. The Committee must be independent. Its recommendations must be made independently without interference from any other country or party, such as the so-called small group, which has declared itself the guardian of the Syrian people and has already prejudged the outcome of the Committee\u2019s work.\nFourthly, no deadlines or time frames must be imposed on the Committee. Each step taken must be prudent since the Constitution is to determine Syria\u2019s future generations. We remain fully committed to making constructive progress based on sound foundations in order to meet the aspirations of the Syrian people.\nFifthly, the Special Envoy for Syria must play the role of facilitator of the Committee\u2019s work, using his good offices to bring the views of its members together as required.\nWith those principles in mind, we reaffirm our readiness to engage and work actively with friendly countries and the Special Envoy to launch the Committee\u2019s work.\nAt the same time, Syria is making tremendous efforts to improve the humanitarian situation on the ground and to rebuild what the terrorists have destroyed. Significant progress has been made despite the illegal and inhumane economic blockade that some countries have imposed on our people, limiting access to medical equipment, medicines and oil products necessary for electricity, household gas and heating fuel. The United States of America has even threatened companies that participate in the Damascus International Fair in order to stifle any economic activity in Syria. Having failed to achieve their goals through armed terrorism, those countries have resorted to economic terrorism, which is an equally brutal form of terrorism, by imposing a blockade and unilateral coercive economic measures. We therefore call on all peace-loving countries that respect international law to come together and adopt effective measures to counter that phenomenon, which not only is used against Syria but also has become a weapon of political and economic blackmail against many other countries in the world.\nFrom this rostrum, we once again call for the lifting of such illegal measures imposed on the Syrian people and on all other independent peoples, in particular the peoples of Iran, Venezuela, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Cuba and Belarus. We stand with China and Russia against the unjust United States policies pertaining to them.\nOn several occasions we have emphasized that the doors are open for the voluntary and safe return of all Syrian refugees to their homeland. To that end, the Syrian Government is providing the necessary help while rebuilding and rehabilitating the service facilities and infrastructure in their areas that have been liberated from terrorists. However, Western and some other countries of destination for refugees continue to obstruct such initiatives. We have seen a strange change in the position of such countries. Instead of using every opportunity to call for the immediate return of refugees to Syria, as they have always done, those countries are now imposing flimsy conditions and arguments to prevent such returns, using this purely humanitarian issue as leverage to serve their hidden political agendas. It is truly reminiscent of the theatre of the absurd. However, what is happening is a manipulation of the fate of nations and a hideous exploitation of their suffering.\nInstead of working for peace and stability in the region, Israel has launched yet another phase of escalation, fuelling regional tensions to unprecedented levels. Israel not only occupies Arab territories, including the Syrian Golan, but also continues every day to violate international law and human rights law and to support terrorism. It has even launched repeated attacks on Syrian territories and on those of neighbouring countries under false pretexts in flagrant violation of international law, the Charter of the United Nations and relevant Security Council resolutions. Such Israeli violations would not continue to escalate were it not for the blind support of certain countries that are fully responsible for the consequences of Israel\u2019s actions.\nSuch ugly manifestations of this support became extremely clear when the United States decided to recognize Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the occupied Syrian Golan and, before that, to recognize the occupied city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocate its Embassy there, not to mention the intensive United States efforts to liquidate the Palestinian question. All those decisions are null and void and represent a complete disregard for international legitimacy. Certain people must understand that the era of acquiring the land of others by force has long passed. It is a delusion to think that the crisis in Syria will compel us to give up our inalienable right to fully restore the Golan to the borders of 4 June 1967 by using all possible means under international law. Moreover, it is a delusion to think that the decisions of the United States Administration regarding the sovereignty over the Golan will alter historical and geographical facts or the provisions of international law. The Golan has been and will always be a part of Syria.\nIsrael must be forced to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions, notably Security Council resolution 497 (1981), on the occupied Syrian Golan, and to halt its repeated attacks on the countries of the region and to cease its settlement activities. Israel must be compelled to allow the Palestinian people to establish their own independent State, with Jerusalem as its capital, along the 4 June 1967 borders and to ensure the return of Palestinian refugees to their land.\nSyria once again expresses its full solidarity with the Islamic Republic of Iran against the irresponsible United States measures, in particular the United States withdrawal from the Nuclear Agreement. We also warn against policies that seek to foment crises and conflicts in the Gulf region under false pretexts. We believe that the security and stability of the Gulf can be achieved only through cooperation and dialogue among the countries of that region, without any external interference that could escalate tensions in the region and run counter to the interests of its people.\nIn conclusion, I say that Syria, supported by its allies and friends, has stood firm against the externally supported organized terrorism that has targeted Syria, its people and its culture. Today we are ushering in a new era that will bring us closer to our final victory in this war. We aspire to a bright and safe future for our people after the long suffering. We are conscious that the various challenges and difficulties that we are facing today or will face in the future are not less ferocious than the terrorism which we have faced. However, we are determined to overcome them. We have always had excellent relations with various countries. We have never sought to antagonize anyone. Today our hand is extended for peace. We continue to promote dialogue and mutual understanding, while staying true to our national constants, which we will never give them up.\nOf course, there are Governments that have clearly offended Syria and its people. However, we will never hold a grudge or seek revenge. We will engage with others, taking into account the interests of our country and our people, in line with our desire to achieve peace, stability and prosperity in Syria and the region. In exchange, those countries that have antagonized Syria must reconsider their positions and correct any mistakes. They must abandon their delusions and let realism and common sense prevail for the common good."

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to convey greetings of peace and brotherhood from His Excellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, Head of State of Equatorial Guinea, to all Heads of State and Government, along with his wishes for every success at the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly. We congratulate His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, on being unanimously elected to direct the work of the seventy-fourth session of the Assembly. We would also like to acknowledge and congratulate his predecessor, Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, on her work, and His Excellency Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, for his remarkable achievements during the year that is ending.\nThe meeting of the General Assembly is held every September for the purposes of seeking and debating solutions to the main problems and challenges affecting humankind and, to the extent possible, for greatly improving our existence and coexistence through positive and useful proposals. It is no coincidence that it is precisely here, in New York, that the United Nations was established for that purpose 74 years ago. The curious thing is that the problems that adversely affect human coexistence and existence have the same author and origin, namely, human beings. It is therefore imperative that together we strengthen the United Nations and make its work more effective as, thus far, even with its limitations, the Organization has proved to be the most valuable tool in the search for solutions to the important challenges facing humankind.\nSince the creation of the United Nations, there has not been a single day that there have not been human casualties resulting from the various armed conflicts in the world. Let us begin with the fact that the United Nations itself was born from the rubble of one of the bloodiest armed conflicts in history, the Second World War, which in itself must have served as an example and warning of what a destructive malevolent action by human beings can be, costing more than 60 million lives. We do not appear to have drawn positive conclusions from that tragedy.\nThe efforts deployed by the United Nations to resolve each of the problems that has arisen have been colossal. However, we believe that these efforts cannot yield positive results as long as the basis of the self-serving interpretation of the United Nations philosophy remains the one born of the Second World War. Let us approach the issue at its source by allowing for equitable and inclusive participation in decision-making and by making cross-cutting changes to an outdated conception of our Organization so that it can act in full solidarity to save humankind from the situations of destitution and abuse in which most human beings find themselves.\nIn order to operate more effectively, the United Nations must be reformed to ensure its own survival as a useful and beneficial entity working for humankind, whose ultimate purpose should be to increase its legitimacy, effectiveness and acceptance through substantial changes that cannot be postponed, such as the reform of the Security Council, currently at an impasse, to make it more representative and redress once and for all the historic injustice of depriving the African continent of all the privileges and the permanent voice that membership in it confers. Let us not forget that African issues make up two thirds of the Security Council\u2019s agenda. In short, as we continue our struggle until justice is done, we are not in a position to abandon the Ezulwini Consensus of the African Union, which embraces and justly reflects all of the legitimate aspirations of the African continent.\nReform should not be limited to the Security Council. The ambitious programme to reform the United Nations peacekeeping operations undertaken by the Secretary-General deserves our attention. If implemented, it would make peace operations more effective, as the main goal is to reduce fragmentation so as to provide a better response, making the pillar of peace and security more coherent, agile and efficient by prioritizing conflict prevention and maintaining and sustaining peace, in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as the Secretary-General himself points out.\nPeacekeeping operations must enjoy the strong support and backing of the various levels and partners of the United Nations. It is important to motivate host countries, troop-contributing countries, troop contingents and funds. The benefits of being familiar with the environments covered by regional and subregional economic communities should be acknowledged and fully exploited, and closer and more trusted partnerships forged. There is no doubt that achieving these goals would have a very positive impact on the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations. Financial contributions to the United Nations are vital for it to perform its important work.\nWe agreed with the Secretary-General about convening a summit on a subject as important to humankind as climate change at this session of the General Assembly. As we all know, climate change poses a clear threat to the safety and preservation of the human species on Earth. We believe that the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is essentially the efficient solution to the threat of global climate change. Africa, in particular, is deeply concerned about the very negative effects of climate change on the continent, especially when, together with other causes, such as armed conflicts, it leads to the forced displacement of people, who are then concentrated in major camps and subjected to inhumane conditions. It is a human tragedy, which Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, witnessed during his visit to a refugee camp near Assosa, Ethiopia.\nClimate change leads to the destruction of Africa\u2019s meagre infrastructure, a decline in agricultural production, high food prices, rising sea levels, declining water resources, reduced livelihoods of people living on the coast and an increase in the number of conflicts. Such effects all have a negative impact on the development of our countries. Current statistics show that there are now millions of internally displaced persons in Africa. The situation, along with the aforementioned problems, should be addressed at the international level, particularly given that the General Assembly has mentioned the need to strengthen multilateral efforts to address the effects of climate change, poverty and sustainable development.\nAlthough the Republic of Equatorial Guinea is a peace-loving nation, we remain the target of threats and attempts to destabilize the country by overthrowing its legitimate authorities in order to seize natural resources and wealth that belong only to the people of Equatorial Guinea. It is not the first time that we have drawn the attention of the Assembly to the dangers and risks of destabilizing Equatorial Guinea and the dire consequences that it could have on the entire region. Our perpetual detractors and enemies do not welcome the signs of economic recovery and good prospects for my country\u2019s future. The unity of the people and the strength of our national institutions and security and defence forces, along with cooperation with friendly countries, provide vital support, despite the turmoil.\nOur country has been experiencing an economic crisis because of the drop in oil prices on the international market. The current situation has compelled us to diversify our economy and use the profits in other sectors that are not as vulnerable to fluctuations. We have taken note and learned our lessons so that reforms we undertake will make us stronger and assist us in attempting to take full advantage of the vast opportunities and potential offered by other sectors of the national economy.\nOur term as a member of the Security Council has given us an excellent opportunity to show the world that the trust it has placed in our country has enabled us to demonstrate the best we have to offer. We have tried to serve the noble objectives of the Security Council \u2014 particularly, that of maintaining international peace and security \u2014 and we do so with conviction and honour. We are now more familiar with the complex issues of the world in which we live, which has led us to reaffirm our belief in the sacred principles of international law outlined in the Charter of the United Nations. Given our views, there can be no doubt as to our sense of independence, freedom and justice. Once again, we are very grateful for the trust placed in our country.\nIn that regard, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 2457 (2019), on silencing the guns in Africa, submitted by Equatorial Guinea, on behalf of the African Union, during its presidency of the Council in February. I take this opportunity to extend an invitation to all those present to participate in the conference on the subject, which we will host in Equatorial Guinea in November. It should provide us with a platform to realistically address this serious issue, which is one of the factors that hinders the development of the vast potential of the African continent.\nAs we have said on other occasions, silencing the guns in Africa must not be a question solely of aspirations or desire. The potential for conflicts in our countries results from the nearly insurmountable obstacle of our own underdevelopment. We believe that it is important to prioritize the peaceful resolution of conflicts, by creating the necessary conditions for development in post-conflict environments. Some of these multisectoral approaches should constitute the path we take together in order to achieve the stability required to ensure the development of our countries.\nThat is the spirit that guides our relations with the countries with which we share borders. We sign agreements to establish good-neighbourly relations and establish standing joint committees on consular issues and cross-border security. Equatorial Guinea has always upheld the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in the internal affairs of others, equality, reciprocal benefits and peaceful coexistence in its relations with its neighbours. Similarly, we are members of subregional organizations and structures, which reveal the pan-African spirit that guides our ideals and principles in foreign policy.\nI would like to end my address by appealing to the need to put an end to the economic, commercial and financial blockade that weighs on Cuba and by calling for positive developments to be resumed, which has given rise to great optimism in the international community. I hope that the spirit of peace, harmony and solidarity will guide our debates.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour to address the General Assembly as the President of the Republic of Serbia \u2014 a country of good and honest people who gave me their trust and honoured me to with the task of representing them before the Assembly and in a world where, through their hard work, they have regained the place that belongs to them. When I was last in this Hall, two years ago (see A/72/PV.11), it was said that the situation in the world was harder than that of the prior year, 2016. I would not say that in 2019 it is any easier, for it is the contrary that is true.\nMembers have noticed that, like children, all of us gather in this big Hall when we need to hear what the great Powers think about us and our future. A bit scared and worried, we are happy when it is over and that we have not been mentioned in their speeches. Unfortunately, it is with mockery that we look at those who were mentioned because we were not in their shoes. And, in this way, we survive another year. I am not speaking about just one great Power but about all the great Powers. I come from a small country, albeit the largest in the Western Balkans, which suffered the most in the First World War. I come from a people who survived the most egregious suffering and the Jasenovac genocide in the Second World War and a people who, above all, want peace, stability and the possibility to move forward in the twenty-first century.\nThe former Yugoslavia \u2014 and its legal successor, Serbia \u2014 was one of the founders of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Today, we are on the path towards membership of the European Union (EU), which is a strategic commitment of our country. But in this Hall and in any other place we will advocate more strongly than ever not only for respect for the rights, independence and sovereignty of small countries but also for the ability always to preserve equality and our right to freedom and independent decision-making by acting together.\nThat is why I am going to speak about Serbia and the region because one does not go without the other. Let me paraphrase Ernest Hemingway. Serbia is not an island, but, I proudly say, a part of the Balkans and it is stronger if those around it are stronger. That is why I strive for the region, almost to the same extent as I strive for Serbia. That is why we are so eager for the Balkans to accept a policy of cooperation and that is why we will always strive to talk to each other. We will always advocate a policy of peace and cooperation because it is the only way to create the necessary stability, without which there is no economic growth and progress.\nI come from a country that had to face very difficult reforms in 2014. We were on the brink of bankruptcy and complete ruin. Today, Serbia has no problems with its public finances, and I want to report wonderful news to the citizens of my country. We expect one of the largest global credit agencies, as early as tomorrow, to increase not only the outlook but also the credit rating of our country. According to projections by experts of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the gross domestic product of Serbia will cumulatively grow by 12.5 per cent, or 4 per cent a year, over the next three years. That result will not be achieved by any other country in the region.\nThe IMF envisages that the GDP per capita, which is a reliable indicator of the standard of living, will be $10,394 in 2023. That is an increase of approximately 45 per cent as compared to $7,207 last year. It will therefore have almost doubled in only five years.\nPrecisely because of its stable economic situation, in the first seven months of this year Serbia attracted \u20ac2.32 billion in foreign direct investment, which is much more than in the same period last year. It was the most successful year for Serbia.\nFinally, Serbia has by far the lowest unemployment rate in the region, at 10.3 per cent. In addition, we invest in the future of Serbia through knowledge, and we are now known for the export of information technology products and software. Last year, that export exceeded \u20ac1 billion.\nHere is an important question: do we live well? Do people in the region live well? The answer is no. We need decades of peace, hard and diligent work and great successes in order to bring ourselves closer to the developed European countries. Nevertheless, under such conditions and due to the economic progress, Serbia chose an independent foreign policy and independent decision-making as its path towards the future.\nThat is why we do not hide anywhere, not even in this Hall, but we praise the good and friendly relations that we have with the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Russian Federation and the better and better relations with the United States of America because our task is to take care of our people. We do not care what someone else in the world may tell us, whether we were buying gas or chocolate, we chose the highest quality and the most affordable goods. We do not care what other big Powers think of that because we believe that we are entitled to think and to decide our own destiny and what is best for our own people, not do what other big and powerful ones think.\nMembers all know that we face problems regarding the territorial integrity of Serbia, that in fact we face the pending issue of Kosovo and Metohija. The unresolved problem of Kosovo and Metohija affects above all the economic progress and future of the young people in the region and in Serbia. That is why I will speak about efforts to resolve that despite all the obstacles.\nThe Serbian writer and diplomat Jovan Ducic said that enemies are only our friends in disguise, who distance themselves from us only because of some kind of misunderstanding or prejudice. The centuries-long problem of Kosovo and Metohija is far from a misunderstanding or prejudice, but we have courageously and realistically, with will and faith, started the quest for a lasting solution.\nNo one cares more about resolving this difficult burden than Serbia because it would provide not only our country but also the entire region with peace, stability, cooperation, economic prosperity and progress on our EU path. That is why we expect the world, especially the big Powers, to see, understand and support our positions and arguments, as well as not to support moves in the opposite direction, as they did in the crucial years from 1999 to 2008.\nAs the United States President John Kennedy said, we cannot negotiate with people who say what is mine is mine and what is yours is negotiable. That is why, as I see it, a lasting solution should be reached in such a way that neither of the parties would gain everything but they would gain enough.\nEven though we do not recognize the unilaterally declared independence of the so-called Kosovo, just as fewer and fewer countries do \u2014 because in accordance with the legally binding Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), Kosovo and Metohija is an autonomous province within the Republic of Serbia, under the administration of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) \u2014 in the desire for peace and stability, we had a dialogue with the Albanians who live there, facilitated by the European Union. Through our concessions, we made certain progress and witnessed it by signing the First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalization of Relations. However, the obligations assumed under the respective Agreement were met only by Serbia. We continued the dialogue despite frequent tensions and incidents in Kosovo and despite the various unilateral moves of Pristina, which made it difficult, until it stopped due to the most unreasonable unilateral move of all, that is, the imposition of a 100 per cent tariff on the import of Serbian goods, which actually means the full termination of the flow of goods.\nBetween the time when Kosovo imposed tariffs, on 21 November 2018, and 21 August of this year, we lost approximately \u20ac350 million. The tariffs, which are still in force, also jeopardize the normal and dignified life of the Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija. Throughout this time, Serbia reacted moderately and responsibly to Pristina\u2019s unilateral acts, not imposing countermeasures and trying to calm the situation.\nIt is not only the interests of Belgrade and Pristina that are intertwined through the problems of Kosovo and Metohija but also those of various international stakeholders. As long as it continues like that, Kosovo will be a source of endless political manipulation and instability. That is precisely why the presence of the United Nations, through the work of UNMIK, is necessary as a guarantee of safety for the Serbs living there.\nDespite everything, I believe that the agreement between Serbs and Albanians is of the utmost importance to the stability of the Balkans and that those two nations have a role in our region that Winston Churchill intended for France and Germany when he spoke of uniting Europe. We are ready to continue to make efforts to reach a solution to the issue of Kosovo and Metohija. If that were not the case, we would not be starting to build the highway section from Nis to Pristina next year.\nSerbia has always been a crossroads and, as such, it became the seat of the Southeast Europe Transport Community. We have just finished the highway towards North Macedonia. At the beginning of November, we inaugurated a highway towards Bulgaria. We are building a highway towards Montenegro, and there is an ongoing plan to connect with Romania with a better road. We are building railways towards Hungary and modernizing the railways towards Montenegro and North Macedonia. It is my wish to revive the railway between Belgrade and Sarajevo.\nThree days ago, I had an important meeting with the Prime Ministers of North Macedonia and Albania. We agreed to start working for ourselves, for our region, not to unite but to enable the free flow of goods, capital and services and to start creating a common market \u2014 to start something a little revolutionary because nations in the Balkans do not have to serve only others, but together they can achieve the best and greatest things for themselves.\nUntil today, we fought for who would support one, two or three big Powers and which Power would create a better future for us. I am not at all naive, and I know that in the future we will to a great extent depend on the big Powers. But everything that we can do ourselves we should not, and will not, leave to others. That is why the Balkans should belong to the Balkan nations \u2014 a sovereign and free people, who will know how to fight in the best way for their own future. We want the same for all other nations worldwide and we will always fight for that in this noble institution.\nIn approximately 10 days, Serbia will also start to build a highway between Belgrade and Sarajevo, just as we have already built, or are building, many roads and railways because we want to be closer to all our neighbours so as to get to know and understand each other better. We are also building a highway towards Banja Luka to help reduce political tensions resulting from cross-border provocations and to lead to an increase in cooperation.\nOne of the ways to achieve that cooperation is through the establishment of a regional economic zone. No one should be afraid that a new Yugoslavia is hiding behind this idea, or that it is an expression of, or a desire for, Serbian hegemony, just because it is coming from Belgrade. I believe that our small divided markets in the Western Balkans would be of far more interest to everyone if we were to act together. A regional cooperation and economic zone would not be a substitute for the European Union, but it could be an expression of our concern for ourselves, at least until we finalize the long process of achieving European integration.\nSerbia respects all States Members of the United Nations and their territorial integrity and sovereignty. We have never asked, nor will we ever ask, for something that is not ours. We expect to receive the same level of respect. We do not grant ourselves the right to divide the world into who is good and who is bad, nor to evaluate what is right and what is wrong. We are proud of our freedom-loving tradition and our historical contribution to the fight to uphold law and justice. We advocate that all outstanding issues in the world be resolved in a peaceful manner through dialogue and in line with international law and the relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions.\nWe want to cherish old friendships and build new ones, which is why we are proud to say, here, in the most important Hall in the world, that we will do our best to improve our cooperation with all African, Asian and Latin American countries. That is also how we see the future of Serbia and the future of the world. However, friendship is not something that can be given once and last forever \u2014 it should be continuously maintained and nurtured. In that regard, the countries of the world can always rely on Serbia.\nAs I said before, we are on our path towards joining the EU and we have partnerships and relations with Western countries, including increasingly intensive cooperation with the United States of America. We are also proud of our excellent relations with Russia and China, and cooperation with friendly African, Asia-Pacific and Latin American countries is another focus of Serbian foreign policy.\n\u201cIf there is anything that a man can do well, I say let him do it. Give him the chance.\u201d With those words, often attributed to the great statesman Abraham Lincoln, I would like to thank the Assembly for its attention and conclude by saying a few words in Serbian, which will be very well understood by an entire region: \u201cBalkan, balkanskim narodima; zivela Srbija\u201d.\n"

        "file_text": "We gather once again at humankind\u2019s most important multilateral Organization to collectively reflect upon and analyse the global problems that affect the people of the world. We note with concern the deterioration of the multilateral system as a result of the unilateral measures promoted by some States that have decided to act in bad faith and ignore the commitments and global structures set up for healthy coexistence among States, within the framework of international law and the basic principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\nWe meet in this forum to discuss and seek solutions to the serious threats to humankind and life on the planet. Our home, Mother Earth, is our only home and is irreplaceable. Fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, droughts and other disasters are becoming increasingly frequent. Each year is hotter than the previous one, global melting is increasing and ocean levels are rising. Every day we suffer the disappearance of species, land erosion, desertification and deforestation.\nWe have been warned that, if we follow this course of action, by the year 2100 the global temperature will have increased by 3\u00b0 Celsius, with concomitant massive and devastating changes. According to data from our Organization, the consequences of climate change will condemn millions of people to poverty, hunger, lack of drinking water, the loss of their homes, forced displacement, more refugee crises and new armed conflicts.\nWe have been surprised in recent weeks by the forest fires that have broken out in different parts of the planet \u2014 in the Amazon, Oceania and Africa \u2014 affecting the flora, fauna and biodiversity. In recent weeks, Bolivia has experienced literal hot spots, which we have been battling with financial, technical and human resources. Our country has spent more than $15 million to date to mitigate fires. We thank the international community for its timely cooperation in our fight against the fire, as well as its commitment to participate in post-fire relief.\nThe arms race, military spending and technology in the service of death and the unscrupulous arms trade have all increased. The financial system continues to be anti-democratic, inequitable and unstable. It promotes tax havens and banking secrecy, which subjugate weak countries and force them to accept conditions that perpetuate their dependence. We note with sadness that the great social asymmetries persist. According to Oxfam data, currently 1.3 billion people live in poverty, while 1 per cent of the richest held 82 per cent of the world\u2019s wealth in 2017. Inequality, hunger, poverty, the migration crisis, epidemic diseases and unemployment are not merely local problems, they are global problems.\nNevertheless, humankind\u2019s creative ability surprises us every day with new inventions and new technological applications, which have provided great solutions to very complex problems. Technology has meant a qualitative leap for humankind. However, it is necessary for this multilateral body to establish agreements in that domain with the participation of all States.\nIt is essential that we talk about the structural causes of the various crises. Transnational companies control food, water, non-renewable resources, weapons, technology and our personal data. The aim is to commercialize everything in order to accumulate capital. The world is being controlled by a global oligarchy; a mere handful of billionaires define the political and economic destiny of humankind. Twenty- six people possess the same wealth as 3.8 billion people. That is unjust. That is immoral. That is inadmissible.\nThe fundamental problem lies in the production model and consumerism, the ownership of natural resources and the inequitable distribution of wealth. Let us put it very clearly \u2014 the root of the problem lies in the capitalist system. That is why the United Nations is more relevant and important than ever despite individual efforts, which are insufficient, because only joint action and unity will enable us to overcome those problems.\nAs we have already said, our generation\u2019s responsibility is to pass on to the next generation a fairer and more humane world. That will be achieved only if we work together to build a multipolar world with rules common to all, while defending multilateralism, the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.\nWe have taken some very important steps in Bolivia. We are the country with the highest economic growth in South America, averaging 4.9 per cent in the past six years. Between 2005 and 2019, the gross domestic product increased from 9.574 to 40.885 billion dollars. We have the lowest unemployment rate in the region, which fell from 8.1 per cent in 2005 to 4.2 per cent in 2018. Extreme poverty fell from 38.2 per cent to 15.2 per cent over 13 years. Life expectancy has increased by nine years. The minimum wage rose from $60 to $310.\nThe gender gap in land titles owned by women has been reduced \u2014 only 138,788 women had received land by 2005, while 1,011,249 women had received land by 2018. Bolivia has the third-highest participation of women in Parliament in the world \u2014 more than 50 per cent of its representatives are women.\nBolivia declared itself an illiteracy-free country in 2008. The school dropout rate fell from 4.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent between 2005 and 2018. The infant mortality rate has been reduced by 56 per cent. We are in the process of implementing a universal health- care system that will guarantee that 100 per cent of Bolivians \u2014 women and men \u2014 have access to free, quality services that are caring and that respect their dignity. We have adopted a law on free care for cancer patients.\nThe data I have just mentioned are part of the achievements of our democratic and cultural revolution, which have brought political, economic and social stability to Bolivia. How did we achieve that in such a short time? How did Bolivia embark upon the path to defeating poverty and underdevelopment?\nIt was thanks to the conscientiousness of the people \u2014 social movements and indigenous people, campesinos, workers, professionals and rural and urban men and women. We nationalized our natural resources and strategic businesses. We took control of our destiny. We built a communitarian and productive socioeconomic model that recognizes basic services as a human right, not as a private business. Today we can say with pride and optimism that Bolivia has a future.\nThere is one outstanding issue in the region, and that is the sea. The sea is indispensable for life, integration and the development of peoples. For that reason, Bolivia will not give up its right to sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. In 2015 and 2018, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled on the following elements in its judgments.\nFirst, in paragraph 19 of the 1 October 2018 judgment in Obligation to negotiate access to the Pacific Ocean (Bolivia v. Chile), the Court stated that \u201cBolivia had a coastline of over 400 km along the Pacific Ocean\u201d.\nSecondly, in paragraph 50 of the 24 September 2015 ruling in the same case, it stated that \u201cthe matters in dispute are matters neither \u2018settled by arrangement between the parties, or by arbitral award or by decision of an international court\u2019 nor \u2018governed by agreements or treaties in force\u2019\u201d.\nThirdly, in paragraph 176 of the 1 October 2018 ruling, it also stated that \u201c[nevertheless, the Court\u2019s finding should not be understood as precluding the Parties from continuing their dialogue and exchanges, in a spirit of good neighbourliness, to address the issues relating to the landlocked situation of Bolivia, the solution to which they have both recognized to be a matter of mutual interest. With willingness on the part of the Parties, meaningful negotiations can be undertaken\u201d.\nThat judicial decision did not put an end to the controversy; on the contrary, it explicitly recognizes that the controversy persists and emphasizes that it does not exclude the possibility of both States finding a solution. Therefore, the United Nations should monitor the situation and demand full compliance with the Court\u2019s decisions, so that both peoples continue negotiating in good faith to close open wounds. It is possible to promote a spirit of good neighbourliness and to open a new chapter in our relationship in which mutually acceptable and lasting solutions can be forged.\nOur countries face diverse and contentious situations that must be approached in a sovereign manner and for which solutions must be found through dialogue and negotiations that benefit the interests of our peoples. Bolivia, in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations, ratifies its rejection of the economic and financial blockade imposed against Cuba, which violates all human rights.\nFinally, I take this opportunity to thank all the member countries for their support in the various initiatives promoted by Bolivia, such as the International Year of Indigenous Languages, the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Peasants and other People Working in Rural Areas and the recognition of 21 June as the International Day of the Celebration of the Solstice.\nTo conclude, we ratify our commitment to consolidate a new world order of peace with social justice, in harmony with Mother Earth, with a view to living well while respecting the dignity and identity of the world\u2019s peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "Our world is changing rapidly. The values that have long served as guideposts are being challenged. The result is chaos \u2014 what can we cling to if nothing lasts? Can we still trust politics, the economy, international organizations? These are questions that will have to be answered in the context of our General Assembly.\nLet us start with our values. In that regard, the Charter of the United Nations is our compass. In its Preamble, it affirms the fundamental rights and equality of all persons. It also speaks of the equality of nations. Relations between States should be governed by shared standards.\nAllow me, as a representative of a small State, to dwell on this point. Several small countries have found that the principle of equality is too often violated. We are concerned about that trend. Often the strength of the large countries prevails over the rights of the small ones. Let me be clear \u2014 I did not come here to complain. I am simply reminding the Assembly that this is a reality that affects us all. Indeed, the smooth functioning of the international community depends on compliance with those principles \u2014 and it is not words but actions that count. Small States only have laws and rights to rely on, but it is up to the international community to uphold them for its own good.\nLet me say a few more words about fundamental rights. This year will be the seventieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions \u2014 an incontestable landmark. Thanks to Geneva, Switzerland is the depositary of the Conventions. Humanitarian engagement is therefore at the heart of our foreign policy. As dedicated as we are to the cause of international humanitarian law, the list of its violations is long \u2014 too long. It is now up to all of us to make those values a reality. There is no more important or noble mission for us.\nLet me also mention the pressing issues at hand \u2014 combating hunger, meeting water and energy needs, providing training for all, fighting climate change and reducing armed conflict. Those are just some of the challenges ahead. Periods of hope are succeeded by periods of despair. Our efforts in the past were often been rewarded when we were able to take advantage of the latest technological developments to benefit everyone. In large part, the progress of our civilization depends upon such innovations and how we share them.\nInvesting in research and training creates the conditions for a world that offers more opportunities for all. If we want to have enough food, drinking water and energy for all in future, if we want to successfully fight climate change, we do not need declarations of intent \u2014 we need technical innovations. We must therefore invest in training and research. Knowledge must be freely shared. Technical progress must be encouraged, not stifled. The development of digital technologies could quickly generate considerable benefits.\nDigital technology makes it possible to simplify processes. It also contributes to greater transparency. Digital technology will transform our world, our way of living together and our way of working. It can help us to accelerate the advent of a sustainable development model. The international community has set itself ambitious objectives in that respect in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. New technologies and innovation will give us the tools to achieve them.\nAs everyone knows, Switzerland is one of the most important financial centres. We are committed to ensuring that our financial sector is beyond reproach. The financial sector has the ability to influence sustainable investment choices and to set an example. Together with a sensible use of new digital technologies, it can develop innovative, sustainable and attractive products. Let us have the courage to try something new and to say yes to the promises of tomorrow.\nDigital technology also involves certain risks. Illicit practices and cyberattacks have become part of everyday life. The protection of privacy is also a fundamental right. It is up to the politicians to act and monitor the use of data. In that connection, I note that three weeks ago in Geneva we launched the Swiss Digital Initiative Foundation. It brings together the world\u2019s leading suppliers of computer equipment and software, as well as several heavyweights in the industry, but also the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Facebook, Google and many others. What is it about? We want the new digital society to adopt common ethical rules. New technologies must inspire and win our trust. Any organization can join the initiative and demonstrate its commitment to progress and strong ethical values. It is evident that Switzerland is banking on digital technology and sees it as an opportunity in all areas. The initiative must follow clear rules that are in line with our common values. We invite all gathered here today to share our experience and cooperate with us.\nFinally, let us talk a little bit about ourselves. I mean the United Nations. We want a strong Organization because it is the only global exchange platform that can help us meet the challenges ahead together. Certainly, the institution must be reformed, along lines we know well. In that regard, we assure the Secretary-General of our support to ensure that the Organization becomes more effective and focuses on its core missions. The United Nations depends on the trust placed in it \u2014 that trust is our capital.\nSwitzerland declares its readiness to contribute to the smooth functioning of the United Nations. Geneva is an ideal platform in that regard \u2014 for decades it has been one of the capitals of humanitarian aid. It is the headquarters of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. It is home to more than 400 non-governmental organizations and is now also the home of a global initiative dedicated to the ethical issues linked to digital technology.\nThe world is changing, and that change sometimes causes confusion. Fortunately, we have values that help orient us. We call for equal rights for all \u2014 individuals and States. Law must prevail over force. That is our motto. In addition, thanks to new technologies, we have a tool that will enable us to meet the challenges of tomorrow. We are determined to be actively involved in addressing these challenges in future. Switzerland and Geneva stand at the ready.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to express my sincere condolences to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas for the loss of life and the terrible destruction caused by Hurricane Dorian. I urge the international community to mobilize resources in order to provide assistance.\nI want to denounce, before the Assembly, the fact that in the past few months the United States Government has begun implementing unusual and criminal measures to prevent fuel supplies from reaching our country from various markets, by threatening and persecuting the companies that transport it, the flag States where the ships are registered and the shipping and insurance companies involved. As a result, we are finding it extremely difficult to ensure the fuel supply that our country needs for its daily activities, forcing us to adopt temporary emergency measures that are possible only in a well-organized country with the solidarity of a united people ready to defend themselves from foreign aggression and preserve social justice.\nOver the past year, the United States Government has ramped up its hostile actions and its blockade of Cuba. It has erected additional obstacles to foreign trade and intensified its persecution of the banking and financial relations that we have with the rest of the world. It has imposed extreme restrictions on travel and on any sort of interaction between our two peoples. It has also obstructed the relations and contacts with their home country of Cubans living in the United States.\nTo this very day, its strategy of anti-Cuban imperialism has been guided by the infamous memorandum issued in 1960 by then Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Lester Mallory, which states that\n\u201c[there is no effective political opposition ... The only foreseeable means of alienating internal support [from the Government] is through disenchantment and disaffection based on economic dissatisfaction and hardship ... [Every possible means should be undertaken promptly to weaken the economic life of Cuba ... denying money and supplies to Cuba, to decrease monetary and real wages, to bring about hunger, desperation and overthrow of Government\u201d.\nThe illegal Helms Burton Act of 1996 guides the aggressive behaviour of the United States against Cuba. Its essence is a stark attempt to question the Cuban nation\u2019s right to free determination and national independence. It envisages the imposition of United States legal authority and the jurisdiction of its courts on Cuba\u2019s commercial and financial relations with any other country, thereby trampling on international law and the national jurisdictions of Cuba and third States, while establishing the alleged supremacy of United States law and political will over them. The economic, commercial and financial blockade continues to be the main obstacle to our country\u2019s development and the advancement of the process of updating the socialist socioeconomic and development model that our country has designed for itself. The new measures particularly affect our economy\u2019s private sector.\nEvery year the United States Government allocates tens of millions of dollars from the federal budget to political subversion, with the purpose of creating confusion and weakening the unity of our people, which it combines with a concerted propaganda campaign aimed at discrediting the revolution, its leaders and its glorious historical legacy, denigrating our economic and social policies in support of development and justice and destroying the ideas of socialism.\nThis Thursday, the State Department announced, based on gross slanders, that General Raul Castro Ruz, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, would not be granted a visa to enter the United States. That action, which has no practical effect, is designed to offend Cuba\u2019s dignity and our people\u2019s feelings, a vote-catching crumb tossed to the Cuban-American far right. However, the open and offensive falsehoods that are being used in an attempt to justify it, which I firmly repudiate, are a reflection of the baseness and rottenness that the current United States Administration resorts to, drowning as it is in a sea of corruption, lies and immorality. All of those actions violate international law and the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe most recent excuse, reiterated on Tuesday right here in this Hall by President Donald Trump of the United States (see A/74/PV.3), blames Cuba for the failed plan to overthrow the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela by force. With the aim of denigrating the feats of the Venezuelan people, the Yankee spokespersons repeat over and over again the vulgar slander that our country has between 20,000 to 25,000 troops in Venezuela and that Cuban imperialism controls it. Just few minutes earlier on the same day, from this rostrum, the President of Brazil read a script of false allegations drafted in Washington, which increased that shameless figure to around 60,000 Cuban troops in Venezuela (see A/74/PV.3).\nAs part of its anti-Cuban obsession, the current United States Administration, echoed by Brazil, is attacking the international medical cooperation programmes that Cuba shares with dozens of developing countries, designed to assist the neediest communities and founded on sentiments of solidarity and the free and voluntary will of hundreds of thousands of Cuban professionals, and which are being implemented according to cooperative agreements signed with the Governments of those countries. For many years now they have been recognized by the international community, the United Nations and the World Health Organization as a model of South-South cooperation. The upshot is that many Brazilian communities have now been deprived of the free, quality health care that they were offered by thousands of Cuban professionals under the Mas Medicos programme. And this period has seen plenty of the most shameless threats, blackmail and brazen urgings aimed at getting our country to betray its principles and international commitments in exchange for oil on preferential terms and with dubious friendships.\nIn commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the triumph of the revolution, when Cubans achieved true and definitive independence, First Secretary Raul Castro said,\n\u201c[W]e Cubans are ready to resist a situation of confrontation, which we do not desire, and we hope that the most lucid minds in the United States Government can avoid it.\u201d\nWe have reiterated that even in the present circumstances, we will not renounce our determination to develop civilized relations with the United States, based on mutual respect and recognition of our profound differences. We know that is the desire of the people of Cuba and that the feeling is shared by the majority of the people of the United States and the Cubans who live there. I also want to confirm that no amount of economic aggression, threats or blackmail, no matter how harsh, will extract a single concession from us. Anyone familiar with the history of the Cuban people in their long struggle for emancipation and their steadfast defence of the freedom and justice they have achieved will understand, beyond any doubt, the significance, sincerity and strength of the beliefs and attitudes of our people.\nThe bilateral relations between Cuba and Venezuela are based on mutual respect and true solidarity. We have no hesitation in supporting the legitimate Government, headed by our comrade Nicolas Maduro Moros, and the civic and military union of the country\u2019s Bolivarian and Chavista people. We condemn the behaviour of the United States Government towards Venezuela, focused as it is on encouraging coups d\u2019etat, assassinations, economic warfare and the sabotaging of the country\u2019s power supply. We reject its implementation of severe unilateral, coercive measures and the plundering of Venezuela\u2019s assets, companies and export revenues. Those actions constitute a serious threat to regional peace and security and a direct attack on the Venezuelan people, in an attempt to break them in the cruellest of ways. We call on everyone to recognize those facts, demand an end to the unilateral coercive measures, reject the use of force and advocate respectful dialogue that is grounded in the principles of international law and the constitutional order of Venezuela.\nA few days ago, the United States and a handful of other countries decided to reactivate the obsolete Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, which provides for the potential use of military force. That is an absurd decision that represents a historic setback and poses a danger to regional peace and security, as it seeks to use legal artifice to justify interference in the internal affairs of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. It is also a gross violation of the Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace, signed by Heads of State and Government in Havana in January 2014. Of similar significance is the United States decision to revive the disastrous Monroe Doctrine, an instrument of imperialist domination under which military interventions and invasions, coups d\u2019etat, military dictatorships and the most horrific crimes were perpetrated in our America.\nAs we witnessed a few days ago in the Assembly, the President of the United States likes to attack socialism in many of his public statements, clearly for vote-getting purposes, while promoting a McCarthyist intolerance of those who believe in the possibility of a better world and entertain hopes of living in peace, in sustainable harmony with nature and in solidarity with everyone else. President Trump ignores or tries to conceal the fact that neoliberal capitalism is responsible for the increasing social and economic inequality that today affects even the most developed societies and that by its nature fosters corruption, social marginalization, increasing crime, racial intolerance and xenophobia. And he forgets, or does not know, that out of capitalism emerged fascism, apartheid and imperialism.\nThe United States Government is spearheading the flagrant persecution of political leaders and popular and social movements via defamation campaigns and outrageously manipulated, politically motivated judicial processes, in order to undo policies that, through sovereign control of natural resources and the gradual elimination of social differences, built more just and supportive societies that represented a way out of economic and social crisis and brought hope to the peoples of America. That is what it did to former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose freedom we demand. We reject Washington\u2019s attempts to destabilize the Government of Nicaragua and we reaffirm our unwavering support for President Daniel Ortega. We stand in solidarity with the Caribbean nations demanding legitimate reparations for the horrific legacy of slavery, as well as the fair, special and differential treatment they deserve. We reaffirm our longstanding commitment to the free determination and independence of our brother people of Puerto Rico. We support Argentina\u2019s legitimate claim to sovereignty over the Malvinas, South Sandwich and South Georgia islands.\nThe behaviour of the current United States Government and its strategy of military and nuclear domination constitute a threat to international peace and security. It maintains almost 800 military bases around the world, promotes projects to militarize outer space and cyberspace and foments the covert and illegal use of information and communication technologies to attack other States. The withdrawal of the United States from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and its immediate commencement of intermediate-range missile tests, can be seen as an attempt to initiate a new arms race.\nIn his address to the General Assembly last year, the President of the Councils of State and Ministers of the Republic of Cuba, Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez, affirmed that\n\u201c[mjultilateralism and full respect for the norms and principles of international law to advance towards a democratic, equitable multipolar world are necessary to ensure peaceful coexistence, maintain international peace and security and find lasting solutions to systemic problems.\u201d (A/73/PV8, p. 33)\nWe reiterate our unrestricted support for a comprehensive, just and lasting two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which can enable the Palestinian people to exercise their right to free determination in a sovereign, independent State based on pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. We reject the unilateral action of the United States in establishing its diplomatic representation in the city of Jerusalem and condemn the violence inflicted on the civilian population by Israeli forces in Palestine and the threats to annex the occupied territories in the West Bank.\nWe reaffirm our unswerving solidarity with the Sahrawi people and support the quest for a solution to the issue of Western Sahara that will allow them to exercise their right to free self-determination and live in peace in their territory.\nWe support the quest for a peaceful and negotiated solution to the situation that has been imposed on Syria, without foreign interference and in full respect for its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We reject any direct or indirect intervention without the consent of the legitimate authorities of that country.\nWe express our solidarity with the Islamic Republic of Iran in the face of the aggressive escalation undertaken by the United States. We reject the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. We call for dialogue and cooperation on the basis of the principles of international law.\nWe welcome the inter-Korean dialogue process. Only through negotiations can a lasting political solution be achieved on the Korean peninsula. We strongly condemn the imposition of the unilateral and unjust sanctions against the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. NATO\u2019s continued expansion towards the borders with Russia poses serious dangers that have been aggravated by the imposition of arbitrary sanctions, which we reject.\nWe support with admiration the recent so-called student and youth marches. Climate change, some of whose effects are now irreversible, is a threat to the survival of the entire world, particularly the small island developing States. Capitalism is unsustainable. Its irrational and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, along with the growing and unjust concentration of wealth, are the main threat to the ecological balance of the planet. There can be no sustainable development without social justice. We cannot continue to overlook the separate and differential treatment subjected to the southern countries when it comes to international economic relations. The emergency in the Amazon compels us to search for solutions through universal cooperation, without exclusion or politicization, and with the full respect for the sovereignty of States.\nCorruption is spreading among political systems and electoral models, as is their disengagement from the will of the people. Powerful and exclusive minorities, particularly corporate groups, decide the nature and composition of Governments, parliaments, and judicial and law-enforcement institutions. After failing in its attempt to subdue the Human Rights Council, the United States Government opted to abandon it and is consequently further hampering international dialogue and cooperation on the subject.\nThat news should come as no surprise to us. The United States is a country where human rights are violated systematically, and often deliberately and flagrantly so. In 2018, 36,000 people \u2014 a hundred per day \u2014 died in that country by firearms. Meanwhile, the Government protects those that produce and trade firearms at the expense of the safety of its citizens. Every year, 91,000 people in the United States die of heart disease due to a lack of adequate treatment. Infant and maternal mortality rates among African Americans double those among Caucasians. Twenty-eight million people do not have health insurance or real access to health services. Thirty-two million people are functionally illiterate. A total of 2.2 million people are incarcerated, 4.7 million people are on probation and every year 10 million people are arrested. It therefore makes sense that the President of the United States is busy attacking socialism.\nWe reject politicization, selectivity, punitive approaches and double standards when it comes to addressing human rights. Cuba will remain committed to the exercise by all individuals and peoples of all their human rights, in particular the rights to peace, life, development and self-determination. We must prevent the imposition of a single, totalitarian and overpowering cultural model that destroys national cultures, identities, history, memory, symbols and individuality, and that silences the structural problems of capitalism that lead to ever-increasing, lacerating inequality.\nSo-called cognitive capitalism also lends itself to that reality. Digital capital dictates global value chains, concentrates the ownership of digital data, exploits identity, information and knowledge and threatens freedom and democracy, which have already been analogically eroded. We need other forms of self-propelled, humanist and counter-hegemonic thinking, as well as decisive political action, to coordinate mass mobilization in our networks, in our streets and at the polls. Independent States need to exercise sovereignty over their cyberspace, break free of the illusions of the so-called network society and the era of access and, instead, democratize Internet governance.\nThe powerful and universal thought of the apostle of the Cuban independence, Jose Marti, continues to inspire and motivate new generations of Cubans. The words he wrote a few hours before he was killed in battle are particularly relevant today:\n\u201cI am in danger each day now of giving my life for my country, and for my duty ... to prevent in time, with the independence of Cuba, the United States from extending itself across the Antilles and falling with that much more force upon the lands of our America. Everything that I have done thus far, and all I will do, is for that purpose.\u201d\nSimilar strength is found in the words of Antonio Maceo, who wrote in 1888 that \u201cwhoever tries to conquer Cuba will gather the dust of her blood-soaked soil, if he does not perish in the fight\u201d.\nIt is this same and singular Cuban Revolution that was commanded by Fidel Castro Ruz and is now headed by the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, Raul Modesto Castro Ruz, and President Miguel Diaz Canel Bermudez. And if, at this point, someone still intends to make the Cuban Revolution surrender or expects the new generations of Cubans to betray their past and renounce their future, we will repeat with the vigour of Fidel, \u201cOur country or death! We shall prevail!\u201d"

        "file_text": "The current General Assembly meeting is occurring at a very auspicious time for the Horn of Africa. Positive developments are under way in the region. The sad, painful chapter of domestic turmoil and regional conflicts is giving way to new vistas of internal resurgence and regional cooperation.\nIn global terms, this is a sensitive and delicate period, when the world is at a crossroads \u2014 on the cusp of a new world order, so to speak. All vital parameters indicate that the unipolar world order has come to an end or is in its twilight years. The economic power balance is inexorably changing, with a spike in attendant intense rivalries and upheavals. The current session of the General Assembly cannot but grapple with such issues and chart out a viable path for the way forward.\nAfrica\u2019s lot over the past quarter of a century has indeed been onerous. Africa\u2019s resources were plundered wantonly. Despite hollow phrases of \u201cconflict prevention\u201d and \u201cconflict resolution\u201d, wars and upheavals continue to increase and fester. Almost 1 billion Africans remain marginalized through the collusion of external predators, their local surrogates and corrupt special-interest entities. That tragic reality requires the utmost and urgent attention for effective remedies, beyond sincere expressions of concern and understanding.\nIn that context, the Horn of Africa and Middle East regions have been immensely and inordinately afflicted in the past 25 years by externally instigated, intractable, internecine ethnic and clan conflicts, as well as discord and wars among neighbouring countries. As a result, they have been, and remain, hotbeds of instability and impoverishment.\nThat grim reality is in stark contrast to the promising events and hopes engendered in the early 1990s. However, the external and internal complications have obstructed and reversed the laudable initiatives for regional cooperation and integration that were expected at the time. Furthermore, such conditions have created vacuums and favourable climates for terrorist and other subversive forces to proliferate and expand. Here again, a large part of the blame falls on corrupt local actors that avidly sought to promote their narrow interests at the expense of their peoples.\nAll those tribulations notwithstanding, the numerous challenges and impediments that afflicted the Horn of Africa region have been overcome at this time. A new promising chapter is indeed likely again.\nAs always, we in the region are ready to work more resolutely with the requisite political will and determination to promote our collective growth through robust coordination and cooperation. We therefore wish to underline that ill-advised, obstructive and detrimental external interferences must cease fully in order to allow the region to effectively address its own matters.\nIn Eritrea, in addition to shouldering our regional responsibilities, we have embarked on a substantive and sustainable programme for economic and social development. We are building our human capital, improving our infrastructure and developing key productive and service sectors. We are also intensifying our efforts and significantly increasing investment to ensure that all citizens throughout the country enjoy adequate basic services of water, health care, education and transport, as well as a decent livelihood.\nEritrea has been making modest strides towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in their three dimensions \u2014 economic, social and environmental \u2014 with its long-standing policy of a balanced and integrated approach to development. In the past two decades, we have already achieved significant results in several pillars of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) despite limited material resources as well as crippling external adversity, including imposed war and sanctions. Most notable is Eritrea\u2019s achievement in the four health-related MDGs.\nThe Horn of Africa region is prone to drought and erratic rainfall. Eritrea\u2019s soil and water conservation strategy to mitigate the effects of climate change and achieve food security include building small, medium and large dams across the country and terracing its mountainous topography. Eritrea has been able to harvest adequate water, but it will require incorporating innovative water technologies to distribute that water efficiently. Eritrea\u2019s sustained tree-planting project, which also began in 1994, continues with the full participation of the population.\nThe international community will have to glean important lessons from the recent past to ensure that the current period, which many have termed a transition towards a new global order, will lead to and enhance global stability and prosperity. In that regard, it is both timely and proper to reform and strengthen the United Nations so that it can shoulder its obligations and responsibilities with greater effectiveness."

        "file_text": "I, Israel Katz, son of Holocaust survivors Meir and Malka Katz \u2014 may they rest in peace \u2014 am proud to stand here today, at the rostrum of the United Nations General Assembly, as the Foreign Minister of the State of Israel. For me, this is a very moving moment. In 1947, the United Nations recognized the right of the Jewish people to their own State in the land of Israel and, 71 years ago, we established the State of Israel. Since then, we have defended and developed our homeland, and today the State of Israel is strong and advanced, a start-up nation that leads in many fields.\nIsrael is a real democracy for all its citizens, Jewish and non-Jewish alike. But Israel is, first of all, the nation State of the Jewish people, based on thousands of years of Jewish history and the right of the Jewish people to their own homeland, just as the United Nations decided 72 years ago.\nI wish to thank the President of the United States, Donald Trump, for his historic and brave decision to recognize Jerusalem, the eternal capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years, as the capital of Israel, and to relocate the American Embassy to Jerusalem. I call on all countries to follow the example of the United States in recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. No one can separate the Jewish people from our historical homeland and no one can separate us from Jerusalem, our eternal capital.\nIsrael wants peace with all its neighbours. We have signed peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan and are working today to advance our relations with many Arab States in the region. We call on the Palestinian Authority to stop incitement, stop encouraging and financing terrorism and recognize the right of the Jewish people to their own State. We call on the Palestinians to return to direct negotiations without any preconditions.\nIn Gaza, the terrorist organization Hamas is holding two Israeli citizens, Avraham Mengistu and Hisham Al-Sayed, and the bodies of two Israeli soldiers, Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul. I call on the United Nations to implement the decisions that it took on that issue and not allow any country to provide aid to Gaza until Hamas returns them to their families.\nRecently, I heard President Erdogan attack Israel (see A/74/PV.3), and I want to say to him: \u201cYou, who brutally oppress the Turkish people, slaughter the Kurdish minority and support the terrorist organization Hamas, are the last person who can lecture Israel. You are not the Sultan and Turkey is not the Ottoman Empire. Shame on you.\u201d\nThe main problem threatening stability and security in the Middle East is Iran, which threatens to destroy Israel and works against the regimes of many countries in the region. Iran uses its proxy terrorist organizations, Hizbullah in Lebanon, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen and the Shi\u2019ite militias in Syria and Iraq, against not only Israel but also other States in the Middle East. We recently saw a serious escalation in which Iranian missiles were launched from Iran against Saudi oil facilities in order to destabilize world oil supplies. That terrorist attack against Saudi Arabia was carried out on the direct orders of Iranian leader Ali Khamenei. Iran is the leading terrorist State and the principal sponsor of terror in the world.\nI call on the international community to unite to stop Iran. The world cannot allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons and to develop ballistic missiles and it must stop Iran from supporting terrorist organizations in the region.\nThe United Nations must declare Hizbullah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as terrorist organizations. They promote terror in the Middle East, Europe, Latin America and all over the world and the world must stop them.\nI call on the international community to support President Trump\u2019s maximum pressure policy against Iran. That is the way to stop them. We must stop Iran today in order to prevent war tomorrow. To the Iranian leadership, I say, in their own language: \u201cDo not count your chickens until they hatch.\u201d It is not over until it is over.\nThe reality in the Middle East also presents opportunities for cooperation and advancing the economies of all countries. In recent years, Prime Minister Netanyahu and I developed the Tracks for Regional Peace initiative, which will connect the Arab Gulf States by rail through Jordan to the Israeli ports in Haifa. It will provide them a faster, shorter and safer outlet to the Mediterranean. We are also going to connect the Palestinian Authority to this project, which will boost their economy. I presented the initiative to the Secretary-General at our recent meeting in Abu Dhabi and invited him to take part in the important project. Israel has a clear policy to advance ties and normalization with the Arab Gulf States. We have no conflict with the Gulf States and common interests in the field of security against the Iranian threat as well as in developing many joint civilian initiatives.\nIsrael has great capabilities in many areas, including high tech, innovation, agriculture and water technology, which can help the Gulf States, while the Gulf States in turn have many capabilities that can help Israel as well. I hope that such cooperation will lead to the signing of peace agreements between our countries, as we signed them with Egypt and Jordan.\nI should like to conclude with the words of the prophet Isaiah, who, thousands of years ago invited all the nations of the world to come to pray in Jerusalem: \u201cEven them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all people.\u201d (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 56:7)\nAs we are about to celebrate the Jewish new year, I would like to close with a traditional Jewish blessing to all present here today, to the people of Israel and to the Jewish communities around the world: a happy and sweet new year to all.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, allow me to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of Nigeria on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I assure him of Vanuatu\u2019s support during his mandate. I firmly believe that his presidency will be successful and effective.\nI would also like to express my deep gratitude to Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, outgoing President, for her leadership and the exemplary manner in which she steered the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session.\nLet me express Vanuatu\u2019s solidarity with the Government and the people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, who are affected by the destruction caused by Hurricane Dorian.\nAt the start of the month, the Pacific region lost one of its leaders \u2014 the Prime Minister of Tonga. I would like to convey to the people and the Government of Tonga our deepest condolences and sympathy. I would also like to convey my sincere condolences to the Government and the people of France following the death of Mr. Jacques Chirac, a friend of Vanuatu and a well-known figure in the fight against global warming.\nThe theme of the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly \u2014 \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d \u2014 is relevant, given the challenges currently faced by the international community, and fully in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nWe meet as the world faces complex challenges: conflicts with humanitarian crises are on the rise, there is an increased risk of an arms race, terrorism remains a threat, human rights violations are widespread, the environment is undergoing rapid change due to the impacts of climate change, the technological revolution is redefining the future of work and the global economy is increasingly uncertain. Such complex global challenges come at a time when the multilateral environment is under enormous pressure owing to the increase in populism and xenophobia, which calls for more multilateral. These developments reflect the erosion of trust in multilateral institutions, including the United Nations, to provide lasting solutions for peace, security and development.\nWe all know that the world is increasingly interconnected and that global challenges cannot be solved by any one country alone. Multilateral institutions \u2014 first and foremost, the United Nations \u2014 are becoming increasingly necessary to address those challenges. Continued unilateralism will lead to an unsafe world. We witnessed it in Europe during the twentieth century, with its two world wars. We are also in a world where, while some fear the effects of climate change, many are dying of hunger, the atrocities of wars, natural disasters and non-communicable diseases. To address these challenges effectively and to build confidence in the current multilateral order, it is essential that multilateral institutions, such as the United Nations, continue to undergo reform in order to become more inclusive.\nIn its 39 years of existence, Vanuatu has been a small open island economy and, in recent years, we have experienced sustained economic growth, underpinned by good macroeconomic stability and a responsible and effective Government. Our growth projections remain promising. While we are satisfied with such achievements, Vanuatu still has a long way to go to achieve its stated objectives. And that is complicated by the fact that we are extremely vulnerable to natural disasters and external shocks in the global economy. The United Nations has described Vanuatu as the most vulnerable country in the world and, given this harsh and complex reality, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be difficult.\nThe recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted that the world is moving towards a rise in temperature of 3\u00b0C and that small island developing States, such as Vanuatu, will continue to face natural disasters, sea-level rise, droughts and ocean acidification. For small island developing States, climate change remains the greatest threat to achieving the goals we have set. The challenges we face were presented to the Secretary-General during his recent visit to the Pacific Islands, including to my country, Vanuatu. I would like to sincerely thank the Secretary-General for his visit and I hope that our concerns will be integrated into the agenda of the United Nations and that the appropriate measures will be taken to resolve our challenges.\nOur extreme vulnerability means that we will be increasingly dependent on the multilateral system. Even though we are not a major contributor of greenhouse gases, we are committed to working with the international community to redouble our efforts to reduce the rise in global temperatures, so that, by 2030, 100 per cent of our electricity will be generated by renewable and sustainable energy. This effort is part of our nationally determined contributions.\nThe health of our oceans is threatened by irresponsible human activities and climate change, which is particularly worrisome for Vanuatu, a part of whose economy depends on marine resources. Vanuatu therefore developed an ocean policy in 2017. We put in place a planning process for the marine space to help balance the need for the protection and sustainable use of our marine resources. We have also banned the use of single-use plastics and will intensify our efforts in that area. Vanuatu will submit a report at the second United Nations Ocean Conference, to be held in Portugal in 2020. In addition, there are some maritime conventions that Vanuatu will ratify before the end of the year.\nIn view of the complex sustainable development challenges that small island States must face, I would like to highlight five main areas, which I believe require that substantive partnerships be forged among the United Nations and other multilateral forums. First, we must ensure that vulnerable countries, such as Vanuatu, continue to have access to subsidized funding. Secondly, we must increase funding for addressing climate change, provide for the rapid replenishment of such financial facilities as the Green Climate Fund, and simplify access to those funds. Thirdly, we must establish innovative instruments for financing the risks of natural disasters. Fourthly, we must find solutions to better manage the risk-reduction measures adopted by major international banks, which prevent correspondent banking relationships with our national banks. These measures limit our trade with the world and slow our efforts to achieve the SDGs. Fifthly, we must propose innovative solutions to the challenges faced by the markets in small island States, which, in particular, prevent other key players from participating in our economies and contributing to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.\nIn August, the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum met in Tuvalu and adopted the Kainaki II Declaration on the need to act quickly to combat climate change. Vanuatu supports regional commitments endorsed by the Blue Pacific and made 10 global appeals for urgent action on climate change. We seek the support of our development partners in order to achieve these objectives, in partnership with multilateral bodies.\nThe role of the multilateral system in managing our challenges through the United Nations remains, above all, broad and crucial. It is therefore essential to provide unstinting support to the Secretary-General in his efforts to reform the Organization, strengthen its role and provide it with the means to enable it to carry out its mandate appropriately. Similarly, we support the establishment of a United Nations office in the North Pacific, which will enable the Organization to strengthen its presence and extend its services to Pacific island countries.\nVanuatu is a young country, with 60 per cent of the population under the age of 15. Given the young population, we are fortunate to be able to harness the genius and potential of this young generation so that it can make a significant contribution to the development of our country. My Government\u2019s current priority is to ensure that our young workforce is well equipped and productively integrated into the labour market. We are realizing that by investing very heavily in technical and higher education. The Government\u2019s policy of universal access to education through public subsidies covers preschool, primary and secondary education and will help us achieve the SDGs and be well prepared to meet future economic requirements.\nSince our country is an archipelago, it is very expensive and difficult to provide affordable universal health-care services to our population. Vanuatu is facing an increase in non-communicable diseases that is weighing heavily on our meagre financial resources, competing with resources that should have been invested in primary health care. We have an important task ahead of us to train our health professionals and improve our medical infrastructure to meet the growing demand for health care. Even with a promising economy, we must ensure that our growth is sustained and inclusive. Inclusiveness remains my Government\u2019s priority, particularly to ensure that women and persons with disabilities participate fully in the economic and political development of our society.\nMany countries in the world are now free from colonial rule; however, in my region, New Caledonia, French Polynesia and West Papua are still struggling for self-determination. Vanuatu calls on the administering Powers to respect the processes established by the United Nations that allow peoples to express their views on the self-determination of their country, such as in the recent referendum in New Caledonia. The same process should be followed in the case of French Polynesia.\nHuman rights violations are taking place in the world today. Vanuatu strongly condemns the human rights violations committed against the indigenous people of West Papua. We call for the United Nations system to be used to find solutions to these human rights abuses. Accordingly, the resolution of the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum calls on the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit the province of West Papua to conduct an assessment, supported by concrete evidence, of the human rights situation. Vanuatu supports this resolution, and calls on Indonesia, as a neighbouring and partner country in the region, to do the right thing and to act responsibly and authorize such a mission. I would like to recall the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights, the dignity and worth of a human person and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small.\nI firmly believe that we have an obligation to work together towards lifting the economic, trade and financial embargo imposed on Cuba. Lifting the embargo will, inter alia, allow the Cuban people to have access to and enjoy fundamental human rights.\nIn recent years, the world has undergone rapid and profound changes that present complex challenges, including climate change. These challenges urge us to collaborate and create innovative and sincere partnerships in order to achieve our SDGs. We must raise our ambitions and renew our commitment through concrete actions if we are to win the fight against poverty and climate change and to ensure inclusive economic growth that takes into account our people\u2019s aspirations to well-being.\nThe development concerns of small island States, whether in regard to climate change, the ocean or poverty, are real, and we will resolve them only at the global level. These challenges make us extremely vulnerable. As small countries, we do not have an army or nuclear weapons. The world community may mock us, look down on us and not consider us as strategic partners, but one thing is certain: our development concerns are also those of humankind. Shying away from the challenges hindering our development also means ignoring humankind\u2019s hope.\nAfter all, the global community as a whole stands together if it collaborates for the well-being of the vulnerable and the most disadvantaged. Such efforts will ensure peace, security and prosperity in the world. The United Nations Charter is our moral compass \u2014 a compass that, among other things, reminds us that we must save future generations from the scourge of war, reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights, and promote social progress and better standards of life in a freer world. Let us all work together to realize the hope embodied in the United Nations Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a privilege to address the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. Every year at this time, Heads of State and Government from all over the world make the annual journey to the United Nations to deliberate on the current state of our world, highlight concerns that keep us awake at night and seek consensus on how best to create a world that is peaceful, prosperous, inclusive and integrated.\nWe all come ready to speak out and represent, but the fundamental question is whether we have also come to listen. Even as we forcefully articulate our views, this global gathering will be useful only if we listen with equal intensity to the concerns and proposals of others. It was Ralph J. Bunche, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who stated: \u201cThe United Nations exists not merely to preserve the peace but also to make change \u2014 even radical change \u2014 possible without violent upheaval. The United Nations has no vested interest in the status quo. It seeks a more secure world, a better world, a world of progress for all peoples.\u201d\nThe people of Saint Kitts and Nevis agree. For us, the United Nations is a force for good, a shining light in a sometimes dark and difficult world. It is through multilateralism at the United Nations that smaller States can have their voices heard. However, we are concerned about the weakening of the multilateral system. Small nations are committed to meeting their Sustainable Development Goals, but developing countries are often not supported by sufficient resources.\nWe need a more coherent, system-wide approach to sustainable development at the United Nations, both in terms of policies and through operational practices in processes and country programmes. Developing countries often lack the capacity or capability to capitalize on the latest global trends in public-sector innovation, Government reform and technology in addressing development challenges. The United Nations role must be to help and stimulate the developing world and provide support in critical areas such as education, training and human-resource development.\nOne of the issues that is a clear and present danger to small and developing nations is climate change. As we all seek to attain the Sustainable Development Goals, our Governments cannot focus on achieving such goals when the very existence of our countries and peoples is constantly threatened. Let us be absolutely clear. Climate change is a product of developed nations\u2019 push for economic growth and industrialization.\nFor far too long and with far-reaching consequences, rich countries have been allowed to emit greenhouse gases unimpeded. Yet the brunt of climate change is borne by developing nations. Small States such as Saint Kitts and Nevis find themselves on the front line of a war they did not start and that they do not want. This is unfair and unjust. People in developing countries will feel the impact first and worst because of vulnerable geography and their lesser ability to cope with damage from severe weather and rising sea levels. We therefore need and are owed support, solidarity and greater assistance.\nWith increasing vociferousness, the leaders of the Caribbean, and indeed of small island developing States (SIDS) from every corner of our globe, have raised the issue of climate change and the grave and present danger that it poses to all of us. We speak out, and we speak loudly, because of the existential vulnerabilities that we suffer in the face of this growing threat.\nTwo years ago my colleague the Prime Minister of Dominica, Mr. Roosevelt Skerrit, was at this rostrum (see A/72/PV.19), dispirited but dignified. He had come straight from the front line of the devastation that had been wrought by Hurricane Maria. Yesterday it was Dominica; today it is the Bahamas. Each hit is more devastating than the one that preceded it. Hurricane Maria passed over Dominica with extreme ferocity, killed 65 people and wiped out 200 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).\nHurricane Dorian sat over part of the Bahamas chain and unleashed Armageddon, with the number of dead still unknown, leaving incalculable destruction in its wake. The people of Saint Kitts and Nevis extend their deepest sympathy to their brothers and sisters in the Bahamas. My country has responded by providing security personnel and financial support to help the Bahamas in its recovery efforts. We appeal to other nations to provide tangible expressions of solidarity and support to the people of the Bahamas.\nWith every disaster comes a crisis of conscience in the international community that results in pledges and promises, few of which are fulfilled. Today I join my voice with that of the Prime Minister of Saint Lucia, Mr. Allen Chastanet, to support the effort to establish a SIDS foundation for climate adaptation and mitigation.\nWe are tired of those who posture as champions of our cause but are essentially promoters of their own conceit. We are tired of the agencies whose brokerage of climate funds is more centred on implementation fees than on adaptation impact. Rebuilding has to start as soon as the disasters have passed, and we require a quicker process that is sensitive to recovery. We are tired of empty promises.\nNow is the time for us to take hold of our own destiny. We are almost out of time, and we are short of options and lost for patience. The scientific community has further reinforced our call to limit the increase in temperatures to 1.5 C\u00b0 if we are to stabilize the global climate. Exceeding 1.5 C\u00b0 will mean ever-increasing climate risks such as extreme weather, sea-level rise, increased poverty and a threat to hundreds of millions of lives. Limiting global warming to 1.5 C\u00b0 for SIDS is not optional. It is a matter of our collective survival.\nThe unfair practice of categorizing countries based on their per capita GDP and denying them access to concessionary funding continues to pose a major challenge to our quest to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and our economic development. We continue to demand that consideration be given to our vulnerability to internal and external shocks. I call for similar concern and protection for our threatened seas. In the face of global warming, we need a blue strategy to preserve and protect what is so important to our food security, the livelihoods of our fisher folk and our economic growth and development. There is huge untapped economic potential in our seas, and it must be protected and nurtured. To put it simply, we need to protect the ocean. I call on the developed countries of the United Nations to offer their support to smaller countries so that together we can protect and nurture our planet.\nThe health of our citizens is becoming critically important to us as we continue to grapple with the high prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Just one year shy of our commitment to preventing and controlling NCDs, our Government is happy to approve new commitments to building a healthier world through universal health coverage. Saint Kitts and Nevis believes that universal health coverage is key to reducing social inequities and a critical component of sustainable development. It will provide greater access to health-care services that will ensure a healthier population and financial risk protection to ensure that people are not pushed further into poverty.\nInternational support is crucial to helping to build the economies of smaller countries. The European Union\u2019s unfair practice of blacklisting is a burden from which SIDS must be freed. De-risking by correspondent banks is an equally harmful practice. It has now become an existential threat to the economies of small island States. Expanding diplomatic relations in order to pursue strategic alliances is beneficial to trade, development and global security.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis has nurtured relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan, and that has been of immense benefit to us, given Taiwan\u2019s experience and expertise in such areas as technology, renewables and health care. I call on the United Nations to utilize Taiwan\u2019s experience, resources and expertise and to enable other developing nations to benefit from it as well. Our experience over the past 36 years is that the Republic of China on Taiwan offers true friendship and solidarity to its allies and is prepared to assist the rest of the global community.\nThe Republic of Cuba has been a long-standing friend of Saint Kitts and Nevis. We will continue to support the call for removing the economic and financial embargo on it, which has caused untold suffering for Cuba\u2019s citizens.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis continues to monitor the situations in Venezuela and Nicaragua. We adhere to the Inter-American Democratic Charter and urge all States members of the Organization of American States to comply with it. The ongoing crisis in Venezuela in particular occupied virtually all of my time as the previous Chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Saint Kitts and Nevis continues to support the CARICOM position, enunciated at Basseterre in Saint Kitts, that the Venezuelan people must find a peaceful resolution to their crisis through dialogue and restore peace, safety and security in their country. Saint Kitts and Nevis welcomes the recent dialogue facilitated by Norway between the contending parties in Venezuela and we urge all parties to resume those talks without delay. Saint Kitts and Nevis notes with deep concern the content of the report on the situation in Venezuela (A/HRC/41/18), dated 5 July 2019, by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the maintenance of human rights and human dignity. We can resolve many issues domestically, but regional and international solidarity and cooperation are critical. I salute the United Nations and the international community for the contribution that they have made to peace, understanding and welfare for more than 74 years. We must all resolve to strengthen our efforts and endeavour to ensure that we are ready to deal with the challenges and opportunities facing us in the twenty-first century. In moving forward, we must help the vulnerable members of our societies, particularly the poor, to improve their lives, give hope to young people and help all countries reach their potential. That was the vision of the United Nations that invited all nations, small and large, to become involved. Let us therefore commit to delivering on the vision of peace and prosperity for all peoples and nations. May God bless us all.\n"

        "file_text": "As we approach the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations next year, it is timely to reflect on the role of the United Nations and the relevance of multilateralism.\nThe open and integrated international order that emerged after the Cold War has benefited all countries. Multilateral institutions, systems and laws are critical to the survival of small countries such as Singapore. They give us a stake in the global commons and a means to defend and advance our interests. A rules-based system imposes responsibilities on all countries and creates a stable environment for all. That is why Singapore is a staunch advocate of the United Nations, international law and the multilateral system.\nThe world is now going through a complex transition. The strategic balance is shifting. More countries are keen to enhance their international roles and are competing fiercely for influence. At the same time, the global consensus on the benefits of globalization has eroded and support for multilateralism has declined. In many countries, nationalist, isolationist and protectionist sentiments have intensified and have reshaped domestic politics, giving rise to inward-looking and nativist policies. The result is a more polarized world.\nContinuing along that path will lead to an even more fragmented and unstable world. And yet, despite the increased friction and greater potential for conflict, countries have, in fact, become much more interconnected. Actions by one country are having a greater and faster impact on others, the consequences of which may eventually rebound. In such a world, a multilateral approach is not an option but rather a necessity in order for countries to deal with complex global problems, including poverty eradication, pandemics and climate change. Those are some of the themes of this year\u2019s General Assembly debate.\nSustainable development has become a priority for all countries. We all face common challenges \u2014 creating jobs, raising standards of living and eradicating poverty. However, it is very difficult for any country to develop and progress on its own. Growth requires trade, investment and technology and all those activities depend on working with others, within an open and orderly international framework of rules.\nThat has been how many countries have progressed in the past 70 years since the Second World War. Developed countries opened up their own markets and benefited in return from access to new markets in the developing world for their industrial products, such as aircraft, electronic devices and machine tools. China\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 presaged two decades of dramatic economic growth, which lifted more than 850 million people out of poverty. India, too, has grown steadily since the 1990s, as its economy has gradually liberalized and become more integrated with those of its partners. Before that, other smaller economies in East and South-East Asia, including Singapore, travelled that same path.\nMany developing countries in Africa and Latin America are now making the same journey. However, if global markets become less open and conditions for trade and investment more uncertain and disorderly, their progress will become much harder. Traditionally, developed countries help developing countries with foreign aid and technical assistance, but a much more effective way to help them is for developed countries to keep trade and markets open so that developing countries become more productive and can raise their standards of living on their own, providing good jobs at home and eliminating the pressure on their populations to emigrate to seek better lives elsewhere.\nToday there is strong pushback against an open and integrated global economy. The view that globalization and free trade have worsened inequality has grown. However, the truth is that globalization and free trade have improved the lives of billions of people around the world, and not only those living in poor countries. Indeed, there have been winners and losers in every country and not all countries have succeeded in balancing the benefits and costs of globalization domestically. In those cases, the international system often becomes their scapegoat. However, a fragmented world with less growth and prosperity will create fewer jobs and make everyone\u2019s prospects even dimmer. Worse, closed global markets will create tension and instability in the international system.\nThat does not mean that multilateralism is working perfectly \u2014 far from it. The post-war multilateral institutions have serious weaknesses. For example, the World Trade Organization has found it increasingly difficult to reach meaningful trade agreements, since any deal requires full consensus among its 164 member countries, which have widely differing interests and philosophies. Furthermore, the WTO\u2019s rules were designed for an agriculture- and manufacturing-based world economy, and we now need new and better rules for services, particularly digital services and intellectual property. Still, the solution should be to reform those institutions rather than to bypass or dispense with them without first putting in place a better solution.\nHowever, countries cannot afford to wait indefinitely for such reforms. Meanwhile, new regional mechanisms and frameworks for cooperation are either emerging or have developed. For instance, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will lower barriers and raise standards for trade in goods and services. In the area of finance, the Chiang Mai Initiative helps Asian countries to manage short-term liquidity problems via a multilateral currency- swap arrangement and complements support from the International Monetary Fund. Those are practical ways for countries to work together to help one another through the vagaries of the global economy.\nInfrastructure development is another area that is ripe for regional cooperation. All over Asia, the demand for infrastructure far outstrips supply. Most of the time, Governments cannot fund all the infrastructure they need and international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, do not have enough resources to go around. That is why new initiatives, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the United States Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act, have a role and are welcomed by many countries.\nThose regional or plurilateral arrangements may be second best to multilateral ones, but in an imperfect world they address real needs and help us to make progress step by step. The key is to keep those arrangements open and inclusive, so that they can overlap and complement one another and allow other countries to join when they are ready. We need to avoid creating rival economic blocs or a bifurcated global economy that forces countries to choose sides and undermines the international order. Multilateral cooperation is also essential for dealing with wicked global problems. Those are problems that no single country can solve alone, but that if not tackled will have disastrous consequences for all countries.\nOne salient example is climate change. That is an issue with which our young people are seized, and rightfully so, because it is about their future and their lifetimes. This week, hundreds of thousands of young people demonstrated peacefully all over the world, including in Singapore, to demand climate action from their leaders. We have a responsibility to them to act and they deserve our full support.\nFor its part, Singapore takes climate change very seriously. Climate change is an existential issue for us. Like other low-lying island States, we are most vulnerable to rising sea levels. However, we will also suffer from climate change\u2019s other effects, whether those are new diseases, more extreme weather events, food shortages, forced migration or even wars. Being so small, Singapore contributes only 0.11 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, we are disadvantaged in alternative energy, with limited sources of renewables other than solar energy. Nevertheless, we are committed to doing our full share under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to reduce emissions and mitigate global warming. We have implemented significant measures in that regard, including a carbon tax, which is the first in South-East Asia and is applied economy-wide with no exemptions.\nWe are working with the United Nations to offer technical assistance to other countries. We will collaborate with partners to improve our understanding of climate change and its impact through research and institutions, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Specialized Meteorological Centre, which is based in Singapore. We will also contribute to the efforts of international organizations such as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Maritime Organization to reduce emissions. In that regard, I would like to commend the Secretary-General for convening the Climate Action Summit this week. It was both timely and necessary.\nMost importantly, we have to inculcate in our populations the mindset that each one of us has a responsibility to live sustainably and in harmony with the environment. We are under no illusions that the Paris Agreement target of 1.5\u00b0C global warming or less will be easy to achieve. Moreover, even if we do achieve that, the problem will not be completely solved, as such action will only slow down the rise in sea levels and will not stop it. However, we must try our best and over time all countries will have to do more to mitigate climate change. At the same time, we must be serious about preparing early to adapt to climate change. Adaptation efforts will be costly, but they are an essential investment for protecting not just our coastlines but also our communities, our future and our very existence. It is the responsibility of our generation to leave future generations with a habitable planet, both through mitigation and adaptation.\nAdapting multilateralism for today\u2019s world calls for new approaches that are open, inclusive and transparent. As Member States, we all have to work together to find solutions to global problems and build support for multilateral institutions among our peoples. A rules-based multilateral system is still far preferable to any other way to secure peace and prosperity and solve global problems. I call on fellow Member States to support the multilateral approach, push harder against the tide and demonstrate leadership in that endeavour.\n"

        "file_text": "Thanks to the dedication of the United Nations and its Member States, many of the world\u2019s problems have been resolved, and their efforts towards achieving peace are coming to fruition. I would like to convey my deepest respect and appreciation.\nLet me offer my congratulations to Ambassador Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly. I am confident that, under his outstanding leadership, the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly will become a catalyst for promoting multilateral cooperation. The United Nations and the Korean peninsula share the same goal of sustaining peace. I would like to pay tribute to the endeavours of Secretary-General Guterres to sustain peace through a virtuous cycle of peace and development.\nThe commitment of the United Nations to the peace of all people and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will certainly bear fruit. The world\u2019s countries are joining forces to help one another in disaster and emergency relief operations, as well as in peacekeeping efforts. The United Nations must continue to play a central role in fostering cooperation within the international community.\nThe Republic of Korea is a country that has benefited immensely from the United Nations. It was liberated from colonial rule in the year in which the United Nations was founded. It was able to overcome the scourge of war with the assistance of the United Nations and the international community. In assuming a sense of responsibility commensurate with the progress that it has made, Korea is now working together with the international community to bring about peace and prosperity in East Asia and the whole world.\nThe Olympic Truce resolution adopted by the General Assembly in November 2017 was of great help to us once again. In accordance with the resolution, the joint military exercises between the Republic of Korea and the United States that had been planned for the spring of 2018 were suspended, thereby creating an environment that enabled the North Korean Olympic delegation to come to Pyeong Chang. Despite initial concerns about security, the Pyeong Chang Olympic Winter Games were transformed into peace Olympics that served as an invaluable opportunity to resume dialogue between the two Koreas. Inter-Korean talks subsequently led to dialogue between the United States and North Korea.\nThe decisions made by President Trump and Chairman Kim provided the momentum behind the dramatic change in the situation on the Korean peninsula. Compared to the past, when only a few rounds of gunfire were sufficient to instigate major political unrest, the current situation on the Korean peninsula has undergone a distinct change The negotiating table for achieving peace on the peninsula remains accessible. The two Koreas and the United States are setting their sights not only on denuclearization and peace but also on the economic cooperation to follow.\nThe Republic of Korea intends to create a peace economy in which peace can lead to economic cooperation, which in turn will reinforce peace for all who work in a virtuous cycle. The examples of how the European Coal and Steel Community and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe had a positive impact on peace and prosperity within Europe provide an excellent model for us to emulate.\nAchieving peace on the Korean peninsula remains an ongoing challenge, and achieving peace on the peninsula and peace in the whole world represent two inseparable goals. We will continue dialogue with North Korea and will find and forge a path leading towards complete denuclearization and permanent peace, while maintaining cooperation with United Nations States Members.\nPeace can be created only through dialogue and can be considered as genuine only when underpinned by agreements and the law, while only peace that has been accomplished based on trust will last. Dialogue and negotiations over the past year and a half have produced significant results on the Korean peninsula. Panmunjom, which used to be a symbol of division, has now become a demilitarized area in which not even a single pistol can be found. The two Koreas have withdrawn their guard posts inside the demilitarized zone, thereby transforming the very symbol of confrontation into a peace zone.\nIn the past, repeated breaches of the Korean Armistice Agreement gave rise to military tensions and at times escalated the threat of war. But no confrontation has occurred since the Inter-Korean Comprehensive Military Agreement was signed, on 19 September 2018.\nIn particular, I would like to inform the Assembly of the fact that a total of 177 sets of remains have been recovered so far from Arrowhead Ridge \u2014 the site of the fiercest battle waged between South Korean and United Nations troops, on one side, and those of North Korea and China, on the other. In addition to the remains of South Korean soldiers, the presumed remains of soldiers from the United States, China, France and the British Commonwealth have also been recovered.\nSixty-six years after the Korean War, the remains of three South Korean soldiers, whose identities were confirmed, have been returned to their families. That was truly a rewarding achievement made possible by the efforts to build peace, which also made it possible for President Trump to become the first sitting American President to cross the Military Demarcation Line and set foot on North Korean soil. The easing of military tensions and firm trust among the leaders of both Koreas and the United States set the stage for a momentous trilateral meeting at Panmunjom.\nPresident Trump\u2019s action in taking Chairman Kim\u2019s hand and stepping over the Military Demarcation Line was in itself a declaration of the true beginning of a new era of peace. It was a remarkable step that will go down in the history of peace on the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia. I hope that both leaders will take yet another huge step from there.\nThe principles that I have firmly held on to in the course of resolving issues related to the Korean peninsula remain unchanged. The first principle is zero tolerance for war. Korea is still in a state of armistice. The war has yet to come to an end. The tragedy of war should never be repeated on the Korean peninsula. To that end, we must end the longest-running armistice in human history and achieve a complete end to the war.\nThe second principle is a mutual security guarantee. South Korea will guarantee the security of North Korea. I hope that North Korea will do the same for South Korea. When the security of both sides is ensured, it will be possible to accelerate denuclearization and the establishment of a peace regime on the Korean peninsula. At the very least, all hostile acts must be put on hold while dialogue is under way. I hope that the international community will also work together to alleviate the security concerns on the Korean peninsula.\nThe third principle is co-prosperity. Peace does not simply mean the absence of conflict. Genuine peace is all about enhancing mutual inclusiveness and interdependence, while working together to achieve co-prosperity. A peace economy in which the two Koreas take part will solidify peace on the peninsula and, at the same, time contribute to economic development in East Asia and the whole world.\nToday, based on those three principles, which are in complete accord with the values upheld by the United Nations, I would like to propose to the United Nations and all Member States the idea of transforming the demilitarized zone that cuts across the middle of the Korean peninsula into an international peace zone. The demilitarized zone is a colossal green zone that stretches 250 kilometres from the east to the west and four kilometres from the north to the south.\nIts borders define the tragedy spawned by 70 years of military confrontation, but, paradoxically, it has become a pristine ecological treasure trove. It has also become a symbolic space steeped in history, which embraces both the tragedy of division, as embodied by the Joint Security Area, guard posts and barbed-wire fences, as well as the yearning for peace. The demilitarized zone is the common heritage of humankind, and its value must be shared with the whole world. Once peace has been established between the two Koreas, I will work together with North Korea to have the demilitarized zone listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nIf we were to designate the area connecting Panmunjom and Gaeseong in North Korea as a peace and cooperation district and transform it into a zone in which both Koreas and the international community could jointly explore the path to prosperity on the Korean peninsula, and if the demilitarized zone were to host the United Nations offices already stationed in the two Koreas, and other international organizations related to peace, ecology and culture, and emerge as a centre for research on peace, peacekeeping, arms control and confidence-building, it could become an international peace zone in name as well as substance.\nThere are approximately 380,000 anti-personnel mines in the demilitarized zone, and it is expected to take 15 years for South Korean troops to remove them on their own. However, cooperation with the international community, including the United Nations Mine Action Service, will not only guarantee the transparency and stability of demining operations but also instantly turn the demilitarized zone into an area of international cooperation.\nIf North Korea makes sincere efforts to implement denuclearization, the international community should also reciprocate. The establishment of an international peace zone will provide an institutional and realistic guarantee to North Korea\u2019s security. At the same time, South Korea will also be able to enjoy permanent peace.\nChairman Kim and I agreed on the peaceful use of the demilitarized zone, and on-site inspections of the current state of North Korea\u2019s railroads were conducted after the two Koreas embarked upon the reconnection of the severed railroads and roads. In addition, the groundbreaking ceremony to mark their reconnection and modernization already took place. All of those efforts constitute a process that will help solidify the foundation for peace on the Korean peninsula, as well as contribute to peace and stability in North-East Asia.\nWhen the demilitarized zone that cuts across the midriff of the Korean peninsula is turned into a peace zone, the peninsula will evolve into a bridging nation that connects the continent and the ocean and facilitates peace and prosperity. The vision of an East\nAsian railroad community in which six North-East Asian countries and the United States take part could also become reality.\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War, East Asia has made historically unprecedented progress through close mutual exchanges, the division of labour and economic cooperation by overcoming the pain of invasion and colonial rule. The free-trade order marked by fair competition has served as its very foundation. We will be able to make further progress through cooperation, while safeguarding the values of free and fair trade based on an earnest reflection of our history.\nThe Republic of Korea intends to expand a people-centred community of mutual prosperity throughout the Korean peninsula, East Asia and the entire world by working in partnership with its neighbours. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations-Republic of Korea Commemorative Summit and the Mekong-Korea Summit to be held in Busan in November, will provide an opportunity to lay the foundation in that regard.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change are major tasks that we must achieve through multilateral cooperation. After formulating our own mechanism for the implementation of the SDGs, we are channelling considerable efforts into their implementation, in keeping with our pledge to the international community. We have enacted related laws, such as the sustainable development act, the framework act on low-carbon green growth and the framework act on international development cooperation. And we have established a presidential commission on sustainable development to ensure the institutional implementation of the Goals.\nTo date, Korea has dispatched 17,000 military personnel to United Nations peacekeeping operations and has stood alongside people suffering from diseases and natural disasters throughout the world. Korea supports the Action for Peacekeeping initiative and the Declaration of Shared Commitments on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations, led by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. We will add to the virtuous cycle of peace and development by increasing the amount of our official development assistance.\nIn particular, Korea will actively participate in the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)m on women and peace and security, which will mark its twentieth anniversary next year, and the Elsie Initiative for Women in Peace Operations, which was adopted in Vancouver in 2017. We will also host the next Peacekeeping Ministerial in Korea in 2021.\nKorea will host the second summit on the Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G) initiative next year. The second P4G summit will provide an opportunity to strengthen the international community\u2019s solidarity for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. I hope that many stakeholders from Governments, international organizations, business and civil society will take interest and participate in that event.\nThis year is very special for Korea. One hundred years ago, the Korean people launched the 1 March Independence Movement against Japan\u2019s colonial rule and established the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. After 100 years, Korea is now leading the efforts to achieve peaceful coexistence and equality based on love for humankind. Korea will continue to fulfil its responsibility and role in realizing the United Nations goals of peace, human rights and sustainable development, while standing together with the international community. We will also work together to ensure that the ultimate goals of the United Nations of international peace and security are realized on the Korean peninsula. I hope that the international community\u2019s support and cooperation will enable swords to be beaten into ploughshares on the Korean peninsula.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the President of the Republic of Cote d\u2019Ivoire, His Excellency Mr. Alassane Ouattara, I would like to extend our warm congratulations to the President on his election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session and to wish him every success in the conduct of his mandate. His election is a true source of pride for his country, Nigeria, for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and beyond, indeed, for the entire African continent. We also congratulate his predecessor, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her outstanding leadership during the seventy-third session of the General Assembly, which was a great success. Finally, allow me to pay a special tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his leadership and commitment to peace and development worldwide.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s general debate, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, underlines the importance that every Member State should attach to multilateralism as a key tool for collectively addressing the major contemporary challenges. However, the multilateralism enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations is today under strong pressure, which jeopardizes the many achievements of dialogue and international cooperation. That is why, given the scale of the current challenges, including the persistence of antagonisms and the temptation of unilateralism, we must renew our unwavering commitment to multilateralism, which, since the creation of the United Nations, has proven its effectiveness in the quest for peace and stability in the world.\nCote d\u2019Ivoire therefore welcomes the adoption in the General Assembly by a large majority, on 12 December 2018, of resolution 73/127, establishing 24 April as the \u201cInternational Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace\u201d, beginning in 2019. The resolution invites us to reclaim the three pillars of United Nations action \u2014 peace and security, development and human rights. Cote d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s accession to the various initiatives for building a better world, in particular the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063, on sustainable and inclusive development, is a testament to its commitment to strengthening regional and international partnerships.\nFour years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the challenges and issues remain the same \u2014 the persistence of hunger, malnutrition and poverty in the world; the increasingly worrisome impact of climate change; migration crises, with their socioeconomic effects on migrants\u2019 countries of origin and destination; and exclusion of all kinds. Those challenges require us to act in synergy with greater speed and determination.\nAs part of its strategy for implementing the 2030 Agenda, Cote d\u2019Ivoire has included the Sustainable Development Goals in its national development plan, as well as in its sectoral and local policies, and allocates a significant part of its budget to them. Indeed, President Ouattara has made improving people\u2019s living and working conditions a priority. Accordingly, through budgetary leverage, Cote d\u2019Ivoire increased the level of spending on the poor from $1.7 billion in 2011 to $5 billion in 2019. In other words, it has tripled in eight years.\nIn the same vein, Cote d\u2019Ivoire declared the year 2019 to a year to strengthen social momentum through the roll-out of a major social programme over the 2019 to 2020 period, with a cost of $1.45 billion, subsequently raised to $2 billion. In addition, universal health coverage, introduced in 2014, will be extended next year, and a programme of productive social safety nets will be implemented in collaboration with the World Bank, at a cost of $150 million, which will enable 125,000 households to receive regular income over the 2015 to 2024 period. All of those actions, which are in support of the various sectoral plans for electricity, health, nutrition, education, training, drinking water, housing, sanitation and social protection, have made it possible to make significant progress on those main social issues, leading to a significant reduction in the poverty rate. However, all those poverty-reduction strategies can produce the desired results only if they are supported by adequate funding from stakeholders, in particular the United Nations system.\nCote d\u2019Ivoire welcomes the celebration, on 24 January 2019, of the very first International Day of Education, established by the General Assembly in 2018. Education, Goal 4 of the Sustainable Development Goals, is indeed one of the responses to major contemporary problems and to the challenges of transforming our societies. In that context, priority must be given to investment in human capital, through education, training, literacy programmes, capacity-building and regular skills acquisition. To that end, the Ivorian Government has introduced free public primary education and education kits and made schooling compulsory across the country for children aged between 6 and 16. Doing so required massive recruitment of teaching staff and an expansion of school and university infrastructure. In addition, our strategic literacy plan, covering the period 2019 to 2024, is aimed at significantly reducing the illiteracy rate to less than 10 per cent by 2024.\nIt should be stressed that African countries can reduce social inequalities, especially gender inequalities, and make up lost ground only if they have well-trained and well-nourished men and women. Our people will also need to be in good health and have easy access to innovation and information and communication technologies as a strategic tool for accelerating their development. In that context, UNESCO should play a more prominent role in improving our education systems, because only by offering our people, and our young people in particular, opportunities to forge a future can we contribute to tackling such scourges as illegal immigration, drugs, organized crime, youth radicalization, terrorism, obscurantism, unemployment, marginalization on the basis of social inequality and, particularly, gender inequality.\nThe effects of climate change are increasingly being felt in all regions of the world on a general scale, and in developing countries such as Cote d\u2019Ivoire in particular. The main consequences of the shifts brought about by climate change are drought, deforestation, coastal erosion, natural disasters, declining agricultural yields, the displacement of populations and the consequent abandonment of livelihoods. Climate change threatens entire ecosystems that support food and nutritional systems for hundreds of millions of people, degrading the soil and thereby reducing the nutritional value of the food we grow. It also has a disruptive impact on water and sanitation systems. All of those consequences pose a major threat to both the health of our populations and the food and nutritional security of our societies. That is one of the greatest challenges facing present and future generations.\nWe must also promote a green economy that centres around protecting ecosystems, promoting clean technologies and improving the productivity of our resources. In that context, it is more crucial than ever to ensure the effective and prompt implementation of the international commitments made at the meetings of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and to adopt a global pact for the environment in the near future.\nFor its part, Cote d\u2019Ivoire will resolutely respect its climate commitments within the framework of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which was adopted in 2015. To that end, our country has pledged to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by 28 per cent by 2030, relying on the energy, transport, agriculture and waste-management sectors to do so. Particular emphasis has therefore been placed on the transition to renewable energies, the development of a circular economy and sustainable forest management, with a view to achieving 20 per cent national forest coverage between 2030 and 2035. In that context, the Government adopted its 2015 to 2020 national strategy to combat climate change \u2014 in order to include this particular theme in its sectoral policies. Accordingly, both developed and emerging countries should be invited, within the limits of their responsibilities, to contribute further to mobilizing financial resources pursuant to the recommendations of the 2015 Paris Agreement.\nThe persistence of many conflicts around the world, the resurgence of terrorism and mass crimes, and the ongoing threat posed by weapons of mass destruction unfortunately jeopardize the achievement of our ambitious development programmes. It is well known that there can be no development without security and peace \u2014 both are prerequisites for sustainable development. Sadly, many hotbeds of tension persist across Africa, particularly in North and West Africa. A number of terrorist groups continue to cause significant loss of human life, not to mention destruction of infrastructure, thereby contributing to the weakening of peace and stability in several countries.\nNo sustainable solution to the challenges I have mentioned can be envisaged without a global approach taken within a multilateral framework and with the collaboration of all. That is the meaning of the undertaking made at the Extraordinary Session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS on Terrorism, held on 14 September in Ouagadougou, where the leaders of ECOWAS, Mauritania and Chad committed to a $1 billion four- year plan of action to contribute to defeating terrorism in both West Africa and the Lake Chad basin.\nAs Cote d\u2019Ivoire prepares for the end of its term as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, my country reiterates its commitment to peace, security and development within the other organs of the United Nations, with a view to harnessing the experience gained and the core values that underpin its diplomatic efforts.\nIn conclusion, I applaud our shared determination to work in full synergy to address the many challenges of today and tomorrow, in order to ensure a world of peace and shared prosperity for all peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "My country has been a Member of the United Nations since 1993. Yet today I address the General Assembly for the first time as the representative of the Republic of North Macedonia. The Prespa agreement entered into force this year, thereby settling a 27-year difference with Greece. That bilateral difference had serious negative implications, in both regional and multilateral settings, becoming regretfully infamous as a difficult and irresolvable problem.\nHowever, today we can see nothing but benefits from settling the difference. We finally have a complete country profile at the United Nations. The name of our country, the Republic of North Macedonia, is followed by the name of our Macedonian language, while the nationality section reads Macedonian/ citizen of the Republic of North Macedonia. We now have exceptionally good relations with Greece. Our bilateral cooperation has advanced. We have therefore contributed to regional stability and to encouraging the development of the Western Balkans.\nThe Prespa agreement, along with the treaty of friendship with Bulgaria, has accelerated our NATO integration and has helped to eliminate the greatest obstacles towards our European Union accession.\nHere I would like to underline our appreciation to the United Nations for the support throughout the settlement process, embodied in the 20-year dedicated and unselfish work and efforts of the Personal Envoy of Secretary-General, Mr. Matthew Nimetz, who worked closely with us to find a solution. We believe that the Prespa agreement is a demonstration of the power of diplomacy and dialogue. It is an instrumental example for the settlement of many other unresolved issues. All problems throughout the world are different and have their specific features, yet dialogue and diplomacy are still the best approaches to their settlement. As leaders of our countries, we owe it to our citizens to work to resolve problems, to maintain peace and to create conditions for development and a better life for all.\nI have the honour to address this important body at a time when it is of great importance to reunite in confronting the present and emerging challenges and to recommit to our common values \u2014 peace, democracy, human rights, the rule of law and sustainable development. The world is at a crossroads. We therefore need a stronger United Nations to stand and deliver for all and to leave no one behind. A rules-based international order and effective multilateralism, with the central role of the strong and action-oriented United Nations, are necessary in a world of daily uncertainties. Responsible governance, whether at home or in international organizations, requires new skills, as well as multifaceted and diverse, but also bold, approaches and solutions, established on the strong observance of the principles and norms upon which we agreed.\nThe world continues to struggle with phenomena that transcend borders, which are clearly beyond our individual control. In August, for the first time in its history, Iceland lost a glacier to climate change. A bronze plaque was mounted on a rock in Iceland to commemorate a once seemingly eternal glacier that had been lost to global warming. That should be a global warning for all of us.\nEarlier this week, we discussed the urgency of fully implementing our commitments to mitigating climate change. The Climate Action Summit, organized by the Secretary-General on the theme \u201cA race we can win: a race we must win\u201d, has provided us with the opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, expand our ambitions and recognize the impact of climate change on the security and stability of the world and its devastating consequences for human beings.\nIt also provided an opportunity to mobilize the energy of different stakeholders in the climate change arena and to recognize that our undertaking is of a global nature. But what we all do at home is crucial to our success. In that regard, the nationally determined contributions are key to accelerated climate action. The Republic of North Macedonia has increased its national contributions to the Paris Agreement and has incorporated them as targets in national laws and policies.\nOn a related issue, we have also debated and are implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are essential to genuine changes and a sustainable future for all. Achieving the goals of eliminating poverty, as well as reducing inequality and the negative impact of climate change and environmental degradation and all the other important goals and targets, which are all cross-cutting and interlinked, provides vast opportunities for countries and international organizations to act to secure the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The Government of North Macedonia is fully committed to implementing the 2030 Agenda and is working on the integration of the SDGs into its national strategic documents and local plans.\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization (A/74/1) outlined the state of affairs in the world and United Nations efforts in that context, providing a clear picture of the successes and failures, as well as the primary concerns and the way forward. The Prespa agreement concluded between my country, now known as North Macedonia, and Greece, is one of the bright spots of the recent past that was rightly mentioned by the Secretary-General. Two years ago, I declared before the Assembly (see A/72/PV.17) our determination to find a solution with Greece over the so-called name issue. We signed the agreement in June 2018 and it entered into force on 14 February. Reaching that milestone required good faith and above all vision; it also required diplomacy, resilience and mutual trust.\nThe agreement aims to overcome a history of distrust and a difficult relationship by establishing the foundations of a new era \u2014 one of friendship and future partnership. We decided to abandon the trenches of the past and turn to new bright perspectives and progress through partnership and collaborative solutions. Our success was not guaranteed. We made it happen together with our Greek colleagues. That is a milestone that should serve as a catalyst for the transformative processes in the Balkans. It can also serve as an example for overcoming difficult deadlocks worldwide.\nThat compromise has opened the gates for my country and people to reach their long-term goals of becoming a member of NATO and the European Union. On the issue of our NATO membership, we expect to become its thirtieth member in the very near future. I remain confident that the substantial progress we have made on reforms at home, as well as the resolution of outstanding issues with our neighbours, are strong arguments in favour of the European Union opening accession negotiations with the Republic of North Macedonia.\nMy country is an active partner in the international anti-terrorism coalition and will continue to contribute to the multilateral efforts aimed at combating terrorism and all its related ills. We commend the Secretary-General\u2019s work and commitment in that area; he deserves our full support. In that context, the serious situations in Syria, Yemen, Libya and Afghanistan, as well as the complexities of the Middle East and the grave situations in parts of Africa, deserve our full attention and effective diplomacy.\nYet another challenge facing us today is mass migration. We have been on its front lines for years now and have experienced its impacts at first hand. The migration crisis also serves as a warning to us that we cannot operate in a vacuum. Its duration shows that we cannot rely on the snooze button. Through the United Nations and other regional organizations, we should join our efforts, while through strategic vision, cooperation mechanisms and initiatives we should address the underlying causes, filter out the positive aspects of migration flows and turn the crisis into an opportunity. We are going to be an active collaborator in that process, just as we have been in the past.\nMisinformation and disinformation, along with other targeted campaigns, continue to challenge and damage global democratic governance and test the resilience of democracies worldwide. Hybrid threats are a danger for the future of our democracies. We need to pool our resources, streamline our efforts and apply multi-stakeholder approaches to combat those challenges. We should also build on some of the few existing examples of dealing with those challenges. The promotion and protection of human rights, democracy and the rule of law remains one of the core pillars of United Nations values and action. Notwithstanding the existing robust human rights architecture, the gross human rights violations around the globe, along with the widespread impunity and lack of accountability, remind us that there is much to be done nationally, regionally and globally. North Macedonia continues to support all actions aimed at countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the illegal arms trade and supports all aspects of disarmament efforts.\nI also wish the President much success in galvanizing positive energy and debates on a wide array of challenging and divisive issues. He may count on the full support of North Macedonia in his endeavour. The Republic of North Macedonia remains a strong supporter of multilateralism. In today\u2019s fragmented world, we will continue to work with all stakeholders. This is our shared world. We call on Member States to strengthen their efforts to maintain international peace and security. The commitments that we make in the General Assembly echo across the globe. However, it is our actions at home that secure the protection of human rights and the well-being of individuals. Let our actions be true to our commitments so that we can create a better world for all.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to extend to all participants a special greeting from a beautiful land called Honduras.\nI will begin by telling the story of my country. The last few decades have seen a major tragedy in relation to the history of our republic. Corruption prevails with impunity, creating a vicious circle in which criminal gangs has managed to infiltrate all sectors. We are tackling and will continue to tackle this impunity until the last day of our Government. At one point, we were the most dangerous country in the world; that is no longer the case. We had one of the highest homicide rates; today, we have more than halved it. We purged the police, set up investigation mechanisms, dismantled organized crime networks and built maximum security prisons, with the result that we now have much stronger institutions.\nGangs have been the armed branch of drug traffickers. They have committed extortion and terrible assassinations and massacres. They have managed to infiltrate demonstrations, turning them violent and engaging in looting, arson and attacks on society. They have attacked the media and the security force. These criminal groups are the allies and friends of some politicians who have admitted to being their friends and close collaborators. This enemy\u2019s goal is to supplant the rule of law. It is a legacy of mourning and pain, with the loss of more than 67,000 lives in the last decade and a half, more than those killed in the Viet Nam war on the United States side. The violence displayed by these illegal groups affect the economy, security and national sovereignty. We must consider such transnational groups, including the Salvatrucha and 18th Street gangs, as non-State entities that violate fundamental rights.\nIs what I have just described not a true abuse of fundamental rights? And I ask myself \u2014 and I leave the Assembly to ponder the question \u2014 why it is that, today, we still cannot find grounds under international law to hold gangs, organized crime and drug traffickers accountable?\nWe have set up a new system of institutions. We have also restructured some of our institutions to make them robust and prepared to confront organized crime. In this Hall, I would like to thank justice officials in my country, be they public prosecutors, the judiciary, the police, the military, intelligence agents and all those Hondurans who have undertaken the fight with us. They are brave, highly effective men and women who have given up everything, including, for some, their lives. We have taken up the fight on land and on sea in order to counter drug trafficking. We have created an extradition process, extradited the biggest drug lords and adopted laws against money-laundering, among other important measures. We have reformed the prison system and today have special anti-extortion and highly effective anti-gangs task forces.\nIt has not been an easy fight. Today, I decry the fact that, owing to the fight we have begun and continue to lead against organized crime, I am the subject of attacks and a smear campaign led by drug traffickers, gang members, corrupt police officers who have been terminated, confessed killers, certain business people who abet the criminals by funding their activities, even politicians. It is truly an international political structure that does not shy away from working with the criminal world, promotes hatred and instils fear in social communicators, leading them to self-censorship out of fear. Others serve to undermine our society through, inter alia, social networks and fake news.\nToday, I want to highlight what some scholars and friendly countries call \u201cfourth-generation warfare\u201d. We must be on our guard, as it is a destabilizing force, causes chaos and intimidation, undermines the economy and institutions and generates transculturation and a misinformation war. We are the victims of these political attacks with obscure interests aimed at destabilizing the country. The attacks are also coming from Venezuela, led by the regime of Nicolas Maduro, with his partner in Honduras named Mel Zelaya. This story is not new, nor am I the only one who has experienced it. It is a subject with global dimensions.\nDrug trafficking, gangs and organized crime generate violence. Violence slows down development and violates human dignity, which, in turn, generates forced and irregular migration. Criminal organizations, human traffickers, unscrupulous non-governmental organizations and politicians seeking to destabilize the Government organized migrant caravans in which thousands of children, fathers, mothers, including pregnant women, have risked their lives on a path of cruelty, exploitation and false promises. I ask: Is this not a crime? Of course it is, because the freedom and lives of human beings are at risk.\nAt the beginning of my presidency, in 2014, I said that irregular migration should be addressed by attacking the root causes, by taking shared but differentiated responsibility, strengthening institutions and increasing security and prosperity. To that end, States must promote opportunities to support the excluded and vulnerable. Honduras is doing its part, with responsible macroeconomic policies designed to make the economy more certain, thereby generating stability that allows us to promote investments, create jobs and access to edit at concessional rates from multilateral organizations so as to develop productive and social infrastructure.\nIn that regard, as an aside, I also want to express my gratitude to the Government and the people of Mexico for the support pledged to us to create opportunities for entrepreneurs and massively promote reforestation through the Sowing Lives programme. I would also like to thank Secretary-General Guterres for committing, at our bilateral meeting yesterday, to the fight to mobilize green funds and convene a pledging conference to finance the Comprehensive Development Plan for Central America.\nWe in Honduras have set up a scheme to encourage the creation of small businesses and their access to soft credit, in order to support those that generate 70 per cent of jobs in our economy but only account for 3 per cent, if that, of the loans granted by the financial system and have been historically excluded from the financial system. In a short amount of time, over 3,000 small businesses have been created under a programme entitled \u201cMy business online\u201d.\nWe have also built the \u201cBetter life\u201d platform for social protection, which seeks to ensure minimum wage, food security, decent housing, job creation and competition. In the past five years, we have reached 4 million beneficiaries \u2014 almost half of our population \u2014 with at least one intervention for each of those beneficiaries. We are on the path to reaching the Sustainable Development Goals.\nWe are continuing to support our young people in order to guarantee a future for the building of our Honduras. We have an innovative programme of more than 15,000 students on national scholarships attending national universities, and hundreds are now obtaining graduate degrees in various specialties at the best universities all over the world.\nI would like to touch upon a very important theme that we discussed this morning. One of the causes of migration is the coffee crisis, which is driven by low prices and the effects of climate change. Honduras is the fifth largest coffee producer, and coffee production makes up 5 per cent of its gross domestic product. Our coffee-bean harvest decreased by 15 per cent, and we have lost revenue amounting to more than $400 million over the past two years. But the impact is also social because 90 per cent of those who produce coffee are small-scale coffee farmers.\nI would like to ask a question to all coffee consumers worldwide \u2014 would any of them dare to ask the sellers from whom they buy their cup of coffee whether they, the sellers, are paying a fair price to the coffee producers? We should think about it because I am sure that if the seller can answer in the affirmative, that would be a very powerful thing. It would be so powerful that it could change the lives of the more than 120 million families of coffee growers worldwide.\nI now want to bring up a topic that everyone talks about but does not yield any concrete results. Let us not fool ourselves \u2014 there are no concrete results. Will we continue to wait for floods and droughts to devastate us and for thousands of people to be displaced without a future and even lose their lives? This is the reality. Whoever needs proof, whoever wishes to experience those phenomena need only come to Central America, to Honduras. There are destructive rainfalls, protracted droughts, diseases and plagues like never before. They call this climate change and climate crisis.\nThe Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index indicates that Honduras, Puerto Rico and Myanmar are the three places in the world most affected by extreme climate events. Nevertheless, neither Honduras, Puerto Rico nor Myanmar are among the greatest contributors to environmental degradation. This is not fair. We have to pay for the irresponsibility of other countries, which, I believe, is one of the greatest injustices of the twenty-first century. In some fraternal countries, being able to obtain a glass of water can mean the difference between life and death \u2014 survival itself. I wonder if we have to wait for that to be the case in Honduras and in the rest of the world? I leave it to the Assembly\u2019s conscience.\nWe in Honduras cannot wait. We in Honduras have decided to not wait. In my country, there are places where water is so scarce that it provokes violence. The Assembly should take note of it. Wars have been fought over oil. In the future, wars will be fought over water. Must we wait for that to happen?\nHonduras has begun its fight against climate change. We have allocated national resources to combat it because we could not wait. One decade ago, the Green Climate Fund was established with great fanfare, but poor management and bureaucracy makes access almost impossible. In my country, I am asked if this an ugly joke. I also leave that to the Assembly\u2019s conscience.\nIn Honduras, we are promoting systems of agricultural production that are adapted to climate change, with our own resources. We are implementing new technologies and establishing centres for agricultural research and innovation. We are also building such protected agricultural structures as greenhouses, intelligent irrigation systems and water reservoirs. In addition, we are leading reforestation initiatives, creating jobs and encouraging our young people and children to preserve our forests. We fund all these efforts ourselves.\nIt is now or never. Let us move from words to deeds. We must hold accountable those who are truly responsible for climate change. We must put an end to organized crime, youth gangs and other gangs, and drug traffickers that undermine the fundamental rights of people. We must form a common front in order to generate prosperity and promote sustainable development. We must take action to combat climate change if we wish to live, if we wish to survive.\n"

        "file_text": "I am indeed delighted to participate in the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I take this opportunity to congratulate the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, a son of Africa and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. You, Sir, can count on the full support of Kenya. I also take this opportunity to commend your predecessor, Ambassador Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, who, throughout her tenure, remained steadfast in her promotion of, and commitment to, a rules-based international system and multilateralism.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s session, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, is timely. It helps us to engage with a range of complex and intertwined global challenges that confront humankind today. We, collectively, have a solemn duty to ensure that the world is a better place for future generations.\nWe must bequeath our children a politically stable, environmentally healthy and socially cohesive world. We, the leaders gathered in this great Hall, are and must be the bridge to that future world.\nOur actions today will determine whether that future is bleak and depleted of resources, with higher poverty levels and fragmented warring nations, or whether we bequeath to our children better living standards and prosperous, vibrant and cohesive societies that are endowed with sustainably managed resources. Never have we, the global leaders, faced such a stark choice \u2014 to either redeem the future or destroy it. That prosperous future we envisage calls us all to take bold actions that give meaning to the theme of this year\u2019s session of the General Assembly. In that regard, allow me to reflect on a number of actions that can contribute to our desired future.\nFirst, we must put people at the core of development. We must support our populations, in particular young people, in being productively engaged, shaping the future rather than falling victim to it. In that regard, we must accelerate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Critical to that is the generation of big, disaggregated data, which can help us to plan targeted interventions and monitor their implementation.\nIn Kenya we have invested heavily in education and health in an effort to achieve social inclusion, develop knowledge and competencies and secure the future by not leaving anyone behind. We have now achieved a 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary school and free secondary school education for all day scholars. To enhance equal opportunity, we have also provided re-entry for girls who drop out of school after falling pregnant. We provide free sanitary towels to all girls attending school, and Kenya\u2019s children now enjoy an average of 10.7 years of schooling, the highest in our region.\nTo drive its economy, Kenya is tackling the burden of disease and is on a path to achieving universal health coverage by 2022. We provide access to a health benefits package that prioritizes primary health-care interventions, reduces the cost of medicine and increases the number of people with insurance coverage.\nSecondly, development cannot occur without sustainable peace. Many complicated factors have led to multilayered threats to peace in the Horn of Africa in the past three or so decades. They are exacerbated by the disruptive effects of climate change, which introduce ecological vulnerabilities into a very delicate security context. The ability of terrorist organizations to execute their plans with impunity has added another dimension to the security terrain in our region.\nA commitment to pursuing peace and security remains at the core of our foreign policy, and I am pleased to say that our combined efforts to advance peace and security in the region continue to bear fruit. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Sudan on arriving at a path to sustainable peace, which it negotiated internally with the help of the African Union. Kenya shares the optimism of the people of the Sudan, and we believe that the transitional process will pave the way for democratic elections in 2022. And I warmly commend the role of women in the Sudan in driving and facilitating an excellent outcome laden with lessons that makes the entire African continent proud.\nI am also encouraged by the progress made in South Sudan. Security has improved, with a decrease in violence across the country, since the signing of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan. I am convinced that pending issues can be resolved in a consultative and collaborative manner. I commend Mr. Riek Machar for travelling to Juba for a face-to-face meeting with his brother and colleague President Salva Kiir in order to engage on the outstanding issues. Kenya supports the creation of an all-inclusive transitional mechanism and institutions for undertaking the required political processes and reforms. That will ensure a smooth transition to the next phase of the peace process.\nIn the same spirit, my administration continues to reach out to the Federal Republic of Somalia in an effort to find an amicable and sustainable solution to our maritime boundary dispute. In that regard, I welcome the decision on 3 September of the African Union Peace and Security Council urging both parties to engage. As we all know, the Charter of the United Nations privileges the use of negotiation as the preferred mechanism for the settlement of disputes. Similarly, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides for the amicable delimitation of maritime boundaries between States. It is in that normative framework that Kenya calls for the dispute to be resolved through negotiation. We remain hopeful that the Federal Government of Somalia will be amenable and committed to the quest for a mutually acceptable and sustainable solution.\nThirdly, we must act together to protect our shared destiny. Pressure from population growth, diminishing resources and climate change puts stress on natural resources such as water, food, arable land and energy. We leaders must turn to sustainable resource-management models to help restore the balance in our ecosystem. I congratulate the Secretary-General on convening the Climate Action Summit. We must implement and scale up affordable solutions that will help us leapfrog to sustainable and more resilient economies that can reduce greenhouse emissions and push global warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Kenya and Turkey were the co-leaders of the infrastructure, cities and local action aspect of the Summit, whose aim is to build better climate resilience initiatives for the urban poor. We urge countries to put their vulnerable and poor urban communities at the centre of their climate action plans.\nTogether with 13 other Heads of State and Government and the Special Envoy for the Ocean, Kenya is a member of the High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, which seeks to develop and support solutions for ocean health and wealth in policy, governance, technology and finance. In the Horn of Africa we are witnessing a confluence of climate change and conflict. Cyclical droughts pressure food supply, cause competition over land, water and other resources and become drivers of conflict. We welcome the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s special report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C, which points to the urgent action needed to avert catastrophic global climate change. For its part, Kenya has embarked on programmes for sustainable, proactive climate action. We have banned the use of single-use plastics and intensified our national tree-planting campaigns in order to restore our water catchment areas. We aim to increase our forest cover from the current 7 per cent to 15 per cent by 2022. We are also focused on the development of clean energy. Today Kenya is among the top 10 global producers of geothermal electricity. We recently launched a 300-megawatt wind project, the single largest wind power project in Africa, and have several renewable energy generation projects in the pipeline.\nThe fourth area in which we must secure a better future is financing for development. We estimate that we need between $2.5 trillion and $3 trillion annually to finance the SDGs and climate action and to target the critical needs of our global population. We have to introduce innovative financing models that reorient private capital and create new instruments and modalities that strengthen the regulatory framework in order to de-risk investments. In 2017, recognizing the untapped potential for raising capital by issuing bonds to ordinary citizens, the Government of Kenya, in conjunction with private-sector players, launched a mobile-based Government bond, M-Akiba. With as little as $30, Kenyans can now participate in the Government securities market. We have provided financial facilitation through a revolutionary micro-, small- and medium-enterprise credit-financing scheme, Stawi \u2014 which means \u201cprosper\u201d in Kiswahili \u2014 that enables small business enterprises to overcome constraints, including a lack of collateral and perceived good credit risk.\nThe fifth area is the use of technology to drive development. The digital revolution offers opportunities to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs in multiple ways, including e-commerce, online jobs, improved service delivery, increased transparency, improved targeting for social safety-net programmes and greater financial inclusion. In Kenya, taking advantage of mobile-phone financial services, we have more than tripled financial inclusion from 26 per cent in 2006 to 82 per cent this year. In May, we launched Kenya\u2019s digital-economy blueprint for developing a digitally empowered citizenry living in a digitally enabled society. We hope to champion the growth of an African-wide digital economy.\nFinally, the agenda outlined requires more, not fewer, partnerships and more, not less, collaboration and international cooperation. We must therefore re-energize and reform the multilateral system in order to guarantee our common future. We must reaffirm the values of the Charter of the United Nations, which embraces a common humanity, safeguards a rule-based international order and underscores equality and respect for all humankind.\nI applaud the Secretary-General for his continued reform efforts. Kenya is honoured to host the United Nations Office in Nairobi, the only one of its kind in the global South, and looks forward to facilitating the establishment and hosting of the regional United Nations global service delivery model centre. We also welcome the positive response of the General Assembly to the concerns raised by Member States calling for better coordination on urbanization, human settlement and environmental-governance matters. In that regard, in March Kenya was proud to host a successful fourth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly and, together with France, the third session of the One Planet Summit, as well as the first session of the UN-Habitat Assembly in May. Kenya fully supports the strengthening of governance and Member States\u2019 oversight of the UN-Habitat Assembly.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank the African Union for its endorsement of Kenya\u2019s candidature for the Security Council for the period from 2021 to 2022. Our pursuit of solutions to global challenges has convinced us that we are well placed to contribute constructively to the Council. When the world had given up on our region, we in Kenya opened our doors to millions of people fleeing insecurity. To this day we host hundreds of thousands of refugees. Our investment in negotiations in the Sudan led to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005, and we continue to support stabilization efforts in both the Sudan and South Sudan. When the world had turned away from Somalia, we engaged and invested in the Eldoret and Mbagathi peace processes, which led to the formation and hosting of the Transitional National Government in Kenya and, ultimately, the formation of the Transitional Federal Government in Somalia.\nOver the years we have contributed more than 40,000 peacekeepers and engaged in post-conflict reconstruction and development efforts across the world. We therefore hope that our experience, competencies and unrelenting quest for peace and prosperity in our neighbourhood, on our continent and in the wider world will persuade the entire United Nations membership to support the African Union\u2019s candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council during the elections scheduled for June 2020. I request the vote of each and every State Member of the United Nations family.\nIn conclusion, I invite everyone here to Kenya in November, when, together with the Kingdom of Denmark and the United Nations Population Fund, we will convene the Nairobi Summit on the International Conference on Population and Development. It is our opportunity to reaffirm the recognition of people\u2019s rights, choices and well-being as the path to sustainable and integrated development. Our deliberations in Nairobi will undoubtedly further secure our future and shared destiny.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me start by congratulating His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of Nigeria on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. We have full confidence in his leadership, and he can count on our support in the delivery of his mandate.\nSince the adoption of our founding Charter of the United Nations, the world in general has become a better place. However, new conflicts have emerged; some persist today while others have raged for decades. My country has the sad record of being one of the most bombed nations in the history of humankind, while being at war with no one. Among its great merits, the United Nations is here to help to prevent such conflicts \u2014 modestly called regional conflicts \u2014 from degenerating into a full-scale global confrontation, and that was especially true during the Cold War.\nThe end of the division of the world into two rival blocs gave rise to a new world order, followed shortly by the emergence of new economic Powers. Those dramatic changes paved the way for the new reality of a multipolar world. That new world should enable the peaceful co-existence of countries with different political systems, religious and cultural references and concepts of the economic role of the State, but in which they can all agree to subject themselves to a number of common rules set out in treaties that no State should reject unilaterally. While that multipolarity is undeniable, it continues to face resistance and rebuke. Based on the pretext of the universality of certain values, some Powers are attempting to impose their model of society and governance, thereby fomenting a new form of division in the world that reminds us of the worst moments of the Cold War. Today countries are labelled as enemies simply because they are viewed as competitors or because they refuse to take sides, irrespective of their context and history. Others are pressured to line up behind an ideology, creating a world of us against them. Important treaties are being unilaterally rejected.\nDespite the clear provisions against it enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, interference in others\u2019 affairs is commonplace and proliferating. Under international law, interference in the affairs of a sovereign State is authorized only for humanitarian reasons, and in a deceptive and deceitful practice, humanitarian reasons have now been used as a pretext to interfere in some countries\u2019 domestic affairs and even provoke regime change by undemocratic means. Governments have fabricated claims and accusations, based on false information relayed by the mainstream \u2014 or should we say gaslighting \u2014 media, to justify interference of all kinds, creating instability, tensions and often chaos and suffering. As a result, the world is full of uncertainties. The international community is facing damaging challenges in the form of geopolitical rivalry and armed conflicts, to which are added growing terrorism, extremism, radicalism and other unconventional security threats.\nThe arms race is being revived by the reckless use of threats and by breaking international commitments, to the detriment of the world\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty, combat climate change and promote prosperity and a better quality of life. Free and fair trade is being threatened by new forms of protectionism. Natural disasters related to climate change are becoming more intense, dramatic and frequent, with worsening humanitarian consequences.\nWe have been asked to reflect on how to galvanize multilateral efforts to meet those global challenges. I believe that the answer requires that we address two fundamental issues. The first is how to ensure the peace, security and stability of the world, and the second is how to get multilateralism back on track and make it effective once again. The increasingly serious threats to global security and the future of our planet are a direct consequence of the weakening of multilateralism. It is imperative to reverse that trend.\nDevelopment, when truly sustainable, should be a positive factor in tackling most of the problems facing the world. For nearly a century the globalization of the world economy, driven by effective multilateralism, has greatly facilitated trade, investment, the flow of people and technological advances. Yet everything has a flip side. While globalization supports economic growth, it also widens disparities and raises the issues of equity and inclusiveness. Industrialization has created a level of material wealth we have never seen before, but it has also strained the environment and will cause irreparable damage if allowed to continue uncontrolled. Protectionism and self-isolation will lead us nowhere. We firmly believe that openness can offer us new opportunities and counter the zero-sum-game mentality. Promoting inclusive and shared development therefore requires that we favour dialogue and partnership over confrontation and aggression.\nOther grave threats, such as new environmental pressures, pose serious challenges to sustainable development and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. For far too long we have taken our natural resources, such as fresh air, blue skies, clean water and healthy soil, for granted. We have been unkind to them, and now they are being unkind to us. The global environmental issues cannot be tackled by the efforts of a few countries alone. Nations both large and small must join hands in a concerted effort to engineer innovative funding to help the countries affected finance green growth and build resilience. That is how we can sustain the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which is a milestone in the history of climate governance. As one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, Cambodia will continue to take steps to tackle the issue and fully honour its obligations. A few days ago, we convened the Climate Action Summit here in New York. We hope that international solidarity will now be more forthcoming.\nI would now like to briefly share with the Assembly the major developments in my country. We have reason to be pleased but also to be seriously concerned. Cambodia\u2019s commitment to a liberalized economy and multilateralism has led to unprecedented growth in personal wealth and living standards over the past two decades. With an average annual growth rate of more than 7 per cent for more than 20 years, Cambodia is ranked by the World Bank as the sixth fastest-growing country in the world. We achieved most of the Millennium Development Goals ahead of schedule. Our ranking on the human development index has risen considerably over the past several decades, putting us in the medium human development category and positioning us as the eighth most successful country in the world in this area for the same period. Between 1990 and 2017, life expectancy at birth increased by almost 16 years, from 53.6 to 69.3 years. Cambodia has seen sharp drops in infant and maternal mortality and deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Access to primary education is now almost universal and primary school enrolment rates are close to 100 per cent for both boys and girls. We are translating our commitments \u2014 which can be summed up as being focused on leaving no one behind \u2014 into policies and actions. The adoption of a national strategic framework for social protection for the period from 2016 to 2025 was a turning point that emphasized how important my Government considers social protection.\nAs a country that once benefited from United Nations peacekeeping operations, Cambodia is now one of the most active contributors to those missions, having deployed more than 6,300 Blue Helmets to eight countries in Africa and the Middle East since 2006. As of this year, Cambodia ranks twenty-ninth of the 122 countries contributing troops to peacekeeping operations and third among the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. My Government has two primary objectives. The first is maintaining peace and political stability and consolidating a pluralist democracy, and the second is making a priority of assuring our people\u2019s basic rights, including the right to food, health, education, housing, work and mobility. During our most recent general election, 77 per cent of voters expressed support for those policies.\nI also want to share our serious concerns with the Assembly. The 1991 Agreement on a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict enshrined the establishment of a democratic system based on the Western model in Cambodia, a country that had never had such a system before. As we all know, democracy cannot be decreed but is rather learned gradually. Considering our recent and tragic past, we have made enormous strides in that regard. Our Constitution, legislation and institutions are largely based on Western models. We have held National Assembly elections every five years since 1993, and the voter turnout in this year\u2019s elections was 83 per cent, a number that many Western countries can only dream of.\nHowever, we are being confronted with practices that have little to do with democracy because they fail to respect the law, institutions and individuals. We are dealing with a branch of the opposition that has gained popularity by taking the path of demagogy, racism and xenophobia. Its adherents use universally condemned tactics \u2014 defamation, the publication of false documents, the dissemination of false information and incitement to racial hatred, violence and sedition. A critical point was reached when the leader of this opposition told his supporters that he was getting funding and technical assistance from a foreign Power to overthrow the Government using the same methods that we have seen in the so-called colour revolutions elsewhere in the world. We responded by enforcing existing legislation, which, I want to emphasize, is no different from the rule that the West applies when a political party goes outside the law. That is what we are being reproached for today and what some people think justifies the imposition of sanctions.\nWe are facing interference from Governments and institutions that are going so far as to tell us how to draft and enforce our laws; that are directly or indirectly financing and supporting a political faction; that are attempting to impose people on our political life who have made themselves outcasts in society by repeatedly violating its laws; that are trying to influence the direction of our foreign policy; and that will not hesitate to inflict sanctions on us in the name of values and principles that they invoke when the circumstances suit them and completely forget when they do not.\nLike other peoples, we Cambodians simply want the freedom to be ourselves and make our own choices, and to peacefully defend our essential national interests and sovereignty in accordance with our own values, aspirations and characteristics. The relevance of international law lies not only in equity and justice, but also in the way it is implemented. That is why we expect all countries and international institutions to ensure that international law is uniformly applied and to reject any selective practices of it. Cambodia welcomes genuine cooperation with all countries of the world, with only one condition, which is that its sovereignty be respected. We will not accept interference under any circumstances, and we will not compromise our sovereignty in exchange for any kind of cooperation or preferential treatment.\nI would like to conclude by sharing our belief that in a multipolar world, multilateralism can succeed only if it rejects all forms of interference. From the principles of equality and sovereignty that were established more than 360 years ago in the Treaty of Westphalia to the Charter of the United Nations, the world is equipped with the principles it needs to guide its international relations. The sovereignty of all countries \u2014 rich or poor, large or small, strong or weak \u2014 must be respected. Their domestic affairs do not permit any outside interference. Their social systems and the paths they choose for their development reflect sovereign choices. It is through respect for the right of peoples to self-determination, solemnly enshrined in the Charter, that we can make multilateralism thrive and find paths to peace, stability, solidarity and progress."

        "file_text": "There is much that is wrong in this world. The post-war multilateral order, which this institution helped usher in, shows signs of strain. Trade wars threaten to plunge us into another worldwide recession. Populism, political extremism and nativism have found currency among the disaffected within our societies. The promise of democracy, enshrined in the principle of self-determination on which the Organization was founded, is in retreat. Emboldened by populist rhetoric, racism and xenophobia in various guises threaten to rip our societies apart.\nTerrorism continues to plague and affect all our societies. Meanwhile, the climate crisis looms ever larger, heightened by our collective inability to address it \u2014 which is why the world needs the United Nations now more than ever. We need to remind ourselves of the horrors that led to the formation of this institution. Let me jog our collective memory. The United Nations was formed out of the ashes of two devastating world wars, in which more than 100 million people were killed.\nIt was born out of a belief in the sanctity of human freedom and self-determination, which means that even small nations may have a voice on the global stage. The Charter of the United Nations privileged peace and international cooperation so that we might avoid wars and enjoy the dividends of our peaceful coexistence. We need the United Nations because the problems of our times are extraordinary \u2014 none of us can resolve them alone. We need our collective strength to fix the challenges of our times.\nIn these difficult times, when the great wave of democracy that swept the world during the last century seems to have ebbed, the Maldives represents a remarkable story. It is a story of second chances, people power and how we as a nation managed to reverse a downward spiral towards autocratic rule. Exactly one year ago, in the early hours of 24 September 2018, the results of the Maldivian presidential elections were announced. The elections were significant because they represented our one shot at rekindling democracy in our country.\nAs many here know, our democratic journey, which began in November 2008, was cut short within a few years. Lurking behind the high idealism of our democratic moment were remnants of the old autocracy. The judiciary was hijacked, Parliament was brought to a standstill, the institutions of State were co-opted and the press was gagged. Political opponents were constantly threatened and opposition leaders were either jailed or exiled.\nMany in the international community spoke out against that reversal. As is the wont of autocrats, the regime turned its back on the world. We left the Commonwealth of Nations, insisting that its calls for democracy in the Maldives were an affront to our sovereignty. Isolationism became our default foreign policy.\nThe fact that we won the election last year in the face of such adversity, against odds that seemed insurmountable, is to the immense credit of the Maldivian people. I do not take lightly the responsibility they have entrusted in me. There is much that needs to be done \u2014 from embedding good governance to delivering justice; from educating our young people to uplifting our most marginalized; from creating opportunities for businesses to leverage the benefits of new technology; from protecting our fragile ecosystem and coral reefs to building a vibrant Islamic society that is just and modern in its outlook.\nDevelopment without justice does not work, which is why we have a transitional justice programme where we seek to redress human rights abuses, investigate murders and enforced disappearances and bring to book the endemic corruption undermining all levels of Government. We are engaged in a comprehensive police reform programme and working closely with other institutions of State to reform and modernize our judicial system.\nMeaningful democracy is about more than just holding elections. It is about involving citizens in the decision-making process. That is why we are working on legislation to decentralize our governance structures and devolve power to our local communities.\nAs I said at the start, these are challenging times, which require strong action from us all. This is why, on the international front, we have reaffirmed long- neglected old friendships and commenced new ones. We have begun the process of rejoining the Commonwealth of Nations. It is our intention to be a good international partner and to be part of a shared solution to the pressing issues of our time, from climate change to fighting the scourge of terrorism.\nTerrorism and violent extremism have become one of the biggest threats of the twenty-first century. Their roots are found not only in the disaffection and disenchantment brought on by a rapidly changing world, but also in the active efforts of opportunists who twist religion and poison young minds to do their bidding. As we have come to know, terrorism and terrorists do not recognize national boundaries.\nOn Easter Sunday, we woke up to the shocking news of terror attacks in Sri Lanka, our closest neighbour. The danger of those networks spilling over our borders is all too real. What is required is concerted global action. That involves everything from sharing intelligence and best practices, counter-terrorism training and reforming our financial system to starve terrorist networks of funding. Unilateral attempts to deal with this menace are largely futile without corresponding global coordination, which is why the United Nations remains so relevant in today\u2019s world.\nDespite the best attempts of the United Nations and its Member States spanning a number of decades, the question of Palestine remains unresolved on the Assembly\u2019s agenda. Never before have the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people been so acutely and blatantly dismissed by Israel, and never have the Palestinian people been so marginalized and discriminated against, in complete disregard of international law and the resolutions of both the General Assembly and the Security Council.\nWe are strongly of the view that lasting peace in the Middle East can come to fruition only through a two-State solution driven by genuine and meaningful dialogue between the Arab countries and Israel. We call on the United Nations and its Member States to make every effort to work towards a settlement that would achieve that result. The Maldives will never waver in its support for the Palestinians and their endeavour to achieve an independent and sovereign State of Palestine, based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nFor more than 30 years, we have been struggling to meaningfully address the climate emergency. For 30 years, we Maldivians have been saying that this is the fight of our lifetime because it threatens our very existence as a nation. While the scientific evidence is irrefutable, there has been an alarming lack of global action.\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, if the mean temperatures continue to rise above the two-degree threshold, we will have reached the point of no return. While the Paris Agreement was a breakthrough for what we can collectively achieve, so much more needs to be done. Although this problem is not of our making, the Maldives is determined to drive the solution. We cannot and will not wait for the prescribed timelines of the Paris Agreement. We are revising and upscaling our nationally determined contributions now. We shall work in concert with other island nations, including the small island developing States and fellow members of the Alliance of Small Island States.\nJust yesterday, at the Secretary-General\u2019s Climate Action Summit, the Maldives presented a plan, entitled \u201cClimate Smart Resilient Islands\u201d, that seeks to utilize natural solutions, promote innovation and leverage new technologies to build resilience in our communities. As part of the plan, we are seeking to phase out our usage of single-use plastic by 2023. That will be one of the most far-reaching and ambitious plastics phase-out plans of any nation on Earth.\nFurthermore, you cannot protect the oceans without solving climate change and you cannot solve climate change without protecting the oceans. For us, this is personal. A visit to the Maldives necessitates crossing over miles upon miles of our territory before ever spotting land. A stunning 99 per cent of the Maldives is ocean, with just 1 per cent dry land \u2014 making us a very large ocean State. We can conceive of no climate and resilience plan without a sustainable ocean plan.\nThis week, the Maldives will enter into a partnership with the Blue Prosperity Coalition on an ambitious blue economy plan, including marine protected areas to conserve the ocean resources that sustain our livelihoods and measures to protect them for future generations. We are confident that we will receive the support of the international community to help us achieve those goals.\nOur dependence on our oceans is only one aspect of what it means to be a large ocean State. Our home, the Indian Ocean, has over the past two decades come to the forefront of global geopolitics and rapidly taken its place at the heart of international maritime trade. The peace and security of the Indian Ocean is inextricably linked to the peace and security of the world. Its importance to the global economy cannot be overstated.\nSadly, I note that the Indian Ocean remains, especially in its South Asian core, one of the least integrated regions in the world, lacking regional governance and unable to reap the potential economic benefits of an effective multilateral order. The Maldives intends to promote regional integration through greater cooperation with our neighbours to make the Indian Ocean region peaceful and prosperous.\nThis great Organization has helped foster peace and avert conflict for over half a century. The world order that it helped build represents the pinnacle of what concerted diplomacy can achieve and continues to embody the hopes of all who believe in peaceful dialogue to solve global problems. While all of us present here represent the interests of our individual nations, we also represent something far larger than that. We represent the world community. We represent humanity.\nFor its part, the Maldives shall continue to partner with our many international friends with a renewed spirit of openness and engagement so that together we can overcome obstacles and effectively resolve our common challenges.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me on behalf of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. We are certain that your leadership, Sir, will steer the session in a positive direction. I wish also to convey our gratitude and congratulations to your predecessor, Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for the manner in which she led the seventy-third session of the General Assembly, as well as the strides made in the commitments undertaken.\nOur delegation appreciates and welcomes your choice, Mr. President, for the theme of this session. Both the theme and the priorities established for the session reflect the major global challenges that we face, namely, the eradication of poverty, respect for human rights, inclusion, conflict prevention and climate change.\nWe are deeply grateful to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for convening the Climate Action Summit and bringing the world\u2019s attention to the grave crisis facing humankind. Like all other small island developing States (SIDS), Timor-Leste feels the effects of climate change on our coastal zones, crop yields due to the increasingly prolonged dry seasons, and the destruction caused by the intensity of natural disasters.\nWe need to save our planet from the effects of climate change and global warming. Unfortunately, to date, we have not changed our behaviour enough to prevent climate change on our planet. However, if we work together, we believe that in the few years that remain we can ensure that the Earth will undergo an average temperature increase of no more than 1.5\u00b0C. And although our emissions are below 0.003 per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions, Timor-Leste is committed to contributing to global mitigation efforts by promoting such renewable energies as those derived from hydro, solar or biomass sources.\nMy country\u2019s Government is currently working on policies, laws and regulations related to climate change, including disaster-risk-management policies and a law on renewable energy. Furthermore, in other sectors related to mitigation, we are working on forest\nconservation and promoting organic farming. In the area of adaptation, Timor-Leste has developed a national adaptation action plan, and its priorities are already being implemented at the local and community levels. We call on all nations, especially major emitters, to also adopt the necessary measures to stop global warming.\nFour years ago, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We have a little over 10 years to attain the necessary transformation through the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Unfortunately, we are failing in our progress to meet some of the targets contained in the SDGs. Inequalities persist, as does poverty. We fully join the decade of action for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its fundamental priorities, namely, the eradication of poverty and the promotion of equality and peaceful, inclusive and just societies.\nPoverty eradication is our main goal, which is why it is part and parcel of our national strategic development plan to establish short-, medium- and long-term programmes to implement and strengthen social, economic and infrastructure development and transform institutional frameworks. We will therefore continue to improve our conditions to create investment opportunities and diversify our socioeconomic development, specifically in the areas of education, health care, mortality reduction, child nutrition and job creation for youth. Through this national strategy, we aim to eradicate poverty and unemployment and thereby liberate our people.\nWith respect to the preservation of the environment, including marine conservation, Timor-Leste has adopted a zero-plastic policy, which is just one of our national campaigns against pollution. We are also in the process of establishing a plastic-recycling plant that will enable our country to become plastic-neutral. We have two marine-protected areas that cover more than 586 square kilometres of our seas. We are blessed with extensive marine biodiversity and a cetacean-migration corridor, the protection of which is an integral part of our tourism and blue-economy policy. The second United Nations Ocean Conference, to be held in Lisbon next year, together with the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021- 2030, will provide us with the opportunity to evaluate the progress made on SDG 14 and our continued efforts to protect the oceans.\nMy country fully acknowledges and supports the current bilateral negotiations on the biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. We hope that they will result in collective consensus and that a legally binding international instrument is adopted to ensure the distribution of the benefits from the shared heritage of humankind.\nWe are also gathered at the United Nations in New York for the sake of peace, stability and international security. The delegation of Timor-Leste recognizes that the international community continues to be committed to finding solutions to the issues of Palestine, Western Sahara, Syria, Yemen, the Korean peninsula, and hopefully other conflicts as well.\nWith regard to the Korean peninsula, we commend North Korea and the United States for engaging in political dialogue to achieve peace. We hope that this dialogue will continue and contribute to ensuring peace, security and regional stability, and reduce nuclear tensions in the region.\nTimor-Leste further reaffirms its support for a two-State solution to the issue of Palestine and calls on the international community to redouble its efforts aimed at finding a just, peaceful and lasting solution that enables Palestine to become a full-fledged State.\nThe third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, designated by the General Assembly, will end in 2020. Since Timor-Leste\u2019s independence in 2002, no solution has been found to decolonize any of the other 17 listed non-self-governing territories. We acknowledge the efforts of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara, Mr Horst Kohler. We hope that, upon the nomination of a new Personal Envoy, discussions will resume, and that a political and legal solution will be found to enable the people of Western Sahara to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination.\nTimor-Leste continues to be concerned about the economic, commercial and financial blockade that has been imposed on Cuba for more than six decades and has had a major impact on the country\u2019s people and development. Timor-Leste therefore firmly supports the lifting of the economic, trade and financial embargo and opposes all extraterritorial measures.\nWith respect to Syria, we hope that the agreement reached between the Government and the representatives of the opposition to establish a constitutional committee will produce results and bring an end to a war that has caused terrible suffering for the civilian population, particularly children and women.\nI take this opportunity to briefly update the Assembly on the general situation in my country. Our young democracy continues on the path towards consolidation. Timor-Leste is a determined small nation under ongoing construction. We have held several elections, which confirm our evolution. As a democratic and peaceful country, Timor-Leste remains committed to building a State based on the rule of law and good governance, strengthening State institutions, promoting human rights and gender equality, and combating poverty.\nRecently in Dili, our Prime Minister, Mr. Taur Matan Ruak, and the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. Scott Morrison, concluded the process of delimiting our maritime boundaries through the exchange of notes relevant to the ratification of the maritime-boundary treaty.\nGender equality and parity are fundamental goals of Timor-Leste. We have made significant progress in terms of women\u2019s political participation, with 38 per cent of our parliamentarians being women. We have adopted an action plan to combat gender-based violence, including an integrated victim-support programme, the promotion of economic-empowerment programmes and awareness-raising campaigns. We also adopted a plan of action in line with Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security. The celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action will provide us with an opportunity to both jointly assess the progress made and identify the obstacles and challenges facing its implementation.\nTimor-Leste continues to maintain strong and special cooperative ties with our closest neighbours, Indonesia and Australia. We have deepened our relations not only with those countries, but also with all members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and we are patiently waiting for a decision on our request to join the Association. We also maintain special friendly relations of cooperation with the countries of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, of which we are proud members. We are certain that the Portuguese language, spoken by approximately 268 million people throughout the world, will be the next official language of the United Nations.\nTimor-Leste continues to promote peacebuilding and State-building through sharing its experience in the areas of reconciliation, justice, solidarity and technical assistance related to elections with the States members of the Group of Seven Plus (g7+). The g7+ is an intergovernmental platform comprising countries emerging from or in conflict. We hope that, during this session of the General Assembly, the g7+ will obtain observer status in the General Assembly, and we call all Member States to accede to this request. Timor-Leste is also committed and stands ready to contribute police and military contingents to peace operations.\nOn the 30 August, we celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the 1999 referendum organized by the United Nations. Last week, on 27 September, we celebrated the seventeenth anniversary of our admission as a full State Member of the United Nations. We enjoy a historic relationship with the United Nations, which has a permanent and very special place in our hearts and in the collective memory of the people of Timor- Leste.\nIn conclusion, I emphasize that Timor-Leste continues to be an example of what the United Nations does best \u2014 resolving conflicts and maintaining peace and the international rules-based order \u2014 when its Member States pool their efforts. Five high-level summits \u2014 the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, the high level-meeting on universal health coverage, the High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development, the High-level Review of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway and the Climate Action Summit \u2014 have alerted us to the huge challenges facing us today, which require collective action, cooperation, joint efforts, renewed political will and solidarity so that we can effectively ensure that all our citizens, including women, children and the elderly, can benefit from the promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and live in dignity and peace."

        "file_text": "Here in New York over the past few days, we have all heard a great many speeches \u2014 at the Climate Action Summit, the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, the countless side events, and of course here at the speech-making marathon known as the general debate.\nIf we were to analyse all the speeches, we would probably find that one term, \u201csustainability\u201d, crops up more often than any other. Some think the term is nothing but hype, a marketing trend or a bit of greenwashing for the post-material elite. And as long we do nothing more than talk about sustainability, none of that will change. While we here in New York are talking about sustainability, we risk losing the race against climate change. The Earth is ablaze. While we are talking about sustainability, men, women, and children are suffering from starvation and epidemics. While we are talking about sustainability, people are dying as a result of wars and conflicts that we have been trying to resolve for years without success. Syria, Mali, Ukraine, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Yemen, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea \u2014 the list is far too long. It is time to do more than just talk about sustainability. It is time to act sustainably, including in foreign and security policy.\nA sustainable foreign policy is one that seeks lasting solutions to conflict and involves all stakeholders in order to ensure both acceptance and stability. It focuses on prevention rather than merely reacting to events. It relies on viable agreements, not speedy deals at others\u2019 expense. All who love their countries will be committed to cooperation, because only if we work together will we all have a future. A sustainable foreign policy is a multilateral foreign policy. The United Nations is founded on that very principle, which is also the guiding principle for German and European foreign policy. I would like to provide four examples that make that clear.\nFirst, concerning the situation in the Middle East, the attacks on two oil facilities in Saudi Arabia have shown us how fast things can escalate. Iran bears the responsibility for them, as we Europeans have made clear publicly and also at our meetings with the Iranian Foreign Minister. The only way to ease the tension is to hold talks between the United States and Iran, but that will happen only if no unrealistic preconditions are placed on such a dialogue. There is something else that we emphasized today at our meeting with Iran, Russia and China. We want to continue to adhere to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the goal of an Iran with no nuclear weapons, simply because it creates security and a basis for further talks with Iran on other topics that are important in that context. Ultimately, diplomacy means not getting bogged down in a logic of despair. But it also means sticking to mutual agreements. That is why we expect Iran to meet the obligations it entered into with us and the entire international community with regard to the JCPOA and to respond positively to our current European efforts to make progress on a diplomatic solution.\nSecondly, with regard to Afghanistan, we very much regret that the terrible attacks by the Taliban sabotaged the talks with the United States in Doha. Germany closely followed and supported the talks from the outset. We are convinced that a sustainable solution to the conflict can come about only through political compromise. That is the only way we can ensure that peace endures in the long term. We owe that to all who have been engaged for a peaceful Afghanistan over the past 18 years, in some cases paying with their lives. For that reason, an agreement with the Taliban can also be only a first step. What we would then need would be intra-Afghan peace talks. Germany is ready to support those talks, not least in order to ensure that everything that the United Nations and the entire international community have worked for over almost two decades is not lost \u2014 a constitutional order, a minimum of stability, human rights and the rights of women and girls in particular.\nThirdly, with regard to Ukraine, over the past two years, the Minsk process has more or less come to a standstill. Right there, in Europe, we have seen an aggression that has cost more than 13,000 lives. We will not simply sit back and accept it. The people in Ukraine want peace. President Zelenskyy has said that very clearly and made it one of his priorities, which has provided a new impetus. Take the bridge in Stanytsia Luhanska, for example. For four years it was a ruin. Now it is being rebuilt. Military equipment and soldiers are being withdrawn. At first glance it is a small step, just one piece of the disengagement called for by the Minsk process, but it is a huge step for the people who use the bridge each and every day. We want to seize that momentum. Together with France, we are working hard within the Normandy format to finally find solutions to issues that have been on the table for almost four years. After all, pursuing a sustainable foreign policy also means persistently pursuing goals, step by step. Standing still is not an option.\nLastly, with regard to Syria, now in its ninth year of war, the idea of sustainable peace might almost seem naive, and yet today there are grounds for cautious hope. The creation of the Constitutional Committee is a first important step towards a political process. It will be crucial to ensure that the Committee begins work quickly and implements resolution 2254 (2015). Only when we finally get down to tackling the causes of conflict and address the Syrian people\u2019s desire for social, economic and political participation can there be lasting peace in Syria. And reconstruction will be sustainable only when political progress is visible. Until then, Germany will not take part. Another element that is at least as important is justice. How can thousands of traumatized, tortured and displaced Syrians and victims of poison-gas attacks believe in peace if their tormentors go unpunished? The predominant impression now, and not only in Syria, is that even the worst crimes are not punished. International criminal law is under massive pressure. That is why, before the end of this week, we will establish an alliance against impunity, designed to strengthen international criminal jurisdiction. Without justice there can be no reconciliation or peace.\nThose four examples show that sustainable foreign policy demands stamina, resilience and resolve. Above all, it means working together reliably. When we do cooperate, we are making progress, often outside the glare of publicity. In the Sudan, after 30 years, there is at long last hope of a truly new beginning. I was there recently and I assured those in positions of responsibility that we will continue to support the transformation through mediation, in the Security Council, as a troop contributor to the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur and as a donor. And it is not only in the Sudan that we support peace processes. I am therefore pleased to announce that Germany is doubling its contribution to the Peacebuilding Fund this year, from \u20ac15 million to \u20ac30 million.\nIn Mali, United Nations Blue Helmets, including almost 1,000 Germans, are working to secure a fragile peace on a daily basis. The prerequisite for lasting stability is that the people regain confidence in the local security forces. That is why together with France we have established a partnership for security and stability in the Sahel, and we call on all Member States to join us.\nA solution has yet to be found in the conflict in Libya. We support the United Nations and the tireless efforts of Special Representative Salame. An international process involving the supporters of the parties to the conflict is the only way forward. We want to take on responsibility in that regard, too, and together with the Special Representative, we have launched a process intended to lead to achieving peace.\nGermany has now been a non-permanent member of the Security Council for nine months, and the impression I have is that far too often, crises and conflicts are not discussed in the Council until shots have been fired and people are dying. That is the very opposite of sustainable policymaking, because at that point it is already too late. The Security Council must move from being a crisis-response body to a crisis- prevention body. And, finally, it must also examine the causes of conflicts. That is why we put climate and security on the agenda at the very beginning of our term and will ensure that it remains there. Climate change has long ceased to be merely an ecological challenge for humankind. More and more often it is a matter of war and peace. Climate change is no less than a question of humankind\u2019s survival. If people no longer have access to clean drinking water, if entire harvests are ruined by persistent drought and conflicts break out over the few remaining resources, the wars of the future will be climate wars. Climate protection must therefore become an imperative in a sustainable foreign policy.\nDuring our membership of the Council we are also focusing on the role of women. Sexual violence continues to be used as a tactic of war. That is abhorrent and perverse. With the adoption of resolution 2467 (2019) in April, we were able to help ensure better support for survivors of sexual violence, but more is at stake here. Stable peace is 33 per cent more likely to be achieved if women are involved in the process. We are therefore committed to seeing an increase in the number of women peacekeepers. Only eight of every 100 seats at peace talks are currently occupied by women. That is nothing short of negligent. To put it simply, peace efforts will not work if 51 per cent of the world\u2019s population is excluded. We will therefore continue to do whatever we can to fight for an equal world. That is not just a matter of justice but one of human decency and human reason.\nWe will also continue to fight in the Security Council for disarmament and arms control. It was thanks to us that in April the subject of nuclear-arms control was put back on the Council\u2019s agenda for the first time in seven years \u2014 I repeat, seven years \u2014 although if one thing is absolutely clear it is that we can build security only if we work with and not against one another. That is why many States are calling strongly and with increasing impatience for a return to concrete, realistic steps towards disarmament, especially in the nuclear field, and that is why those States that have yet to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty must finally do so. Following the launch of the disarmament initiative at an international ministerial meeting held in Stockholm in June, we would like to place nuclear disarmament issues firmly on the international agenda ahead of the 2020 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. I am looking forward to welcoming the supporters of the initiative to Berlin next year.\nCollaboration, compromise and the defence of our joint rules and institutions are what we understand by sustainability in foreign policy. More than most other countries, Germany has benefited from the rules-based order over the past 70 years. Peace, prosperity, free trade and a world open to the outside, as well as a liberal society within, are inextricably linked to multilateralism. Never going it alone again \u2014 that is a lesson from our history. Precisely because it was Germany that 80 years ago unleashed fire and destruction in Europe and the world, we must assume a special responsibility today for an order that secures peace. That is why we set up the Alliance for Multilateralism last year. We do not agree with the idea that if everyone thinks only of themselves, everyone has been thought of, because in the end that means only \u201ceveryone against everybody else\u201d. The truth is that not one of the major issues of the future confronting us today can be resolved by one country acting alone. Only if we work together will we find answers to globalization, the digital revolution, migration and human-induced climate change.\nCooperation is not a betrayal of one\u2019s own country. Rather, it creates the prerequisites for our countries\u2019 security and prosperity. In the past 12 months, countries from all parts of the world that share that view have joined together in the Alliance for Multilateralism. Tomorrow, more than 50 of my colleagues will be meeting here in New York to agree on concrete steps to strengthen international law and human rights and to discuss disarmament, crisis prevention, peacebuilding and global issues for the future, such as cybertechnology and climate change. That is multilateralism in practice. That is sustainable foreign policy. Sustainable development is not a principle of lofty discourse or an elite approach that only the wealthy can afford. On the contrary, we can no longer afford not to act sustainably.\n"

        "file_text": "One year ago, we came to the General Assembly for the first time to lay out the road map that we had chosen to build a Colombia based on legality, entrepreneurship and equity (see A/73/PV.8). My country, which will celebrate its 200 years of independence this year, is today on a path towards a future imbued with fairness, in which the only thing that separates men and women from realizing their dreams is the honesty and sacrifice that they invest in their work.\nWe are living at a time that demands that none of us lose sight of our most urgent challenges \u2014 ending extreme poverty, defending democracy, protecting the environment, fostering entrepreneurship, promoting innovation and upholding the rule of law. Those are the ethical, social and political beacons guiding our commitment to Colombia and contribution to an international order based on multilateralism, solidarity and independence. We sincerely believe in legality, entrepreneurship and equity.\nThe greatest challenge facing all of us is climate change and, naturally, what it entails for our oceans, high-altitude ecosystems, known as paramos, snow-capped mountains, glaciers and coasts. As I have said repeatedly throughout this week, Colombia produces only 0.4 per cent of all global greenhouse-gas emissions. We possess the sixth cleanest energy grid in the world. Our country accounts for 50 per cent of the planet\u2019s paramos, and 40 per cent of our territory is considered rainforest, much of which is found in our region of Amazonia.\nColombia is also one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change. All of us must therefore think globally but act locally. A few days ago, we saw the young people of the world demand that we take our own action. The time has therefore come to shift from making speeches to taking action, and I can say that Colombia is indeed taking action.\nWe have declared our biodiversity as a strategic asset, including its protection within our national security policy. It is clear to us, in our case, that deforestation in Amazonia, and in all our forested areas, is directly related to illegal activities, with armed groups acting outside the law, seeking space for their illicit activities fuelled by drug trafficking. In just one year, we have committed ourselves and reduced deforestation by approximately 17 per cent and remain more committed than ever. Furthermore, our goal is to plant 180 million trees by 2022 so that together we can protect our shared home.\nI can proudly inform the Assembly that, earlier this month, together with Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana and Suriname, all of which are Amazon countries, we signed the Leticia Pact, which is an international commitment to protecting the Amazon and which provides us with the means to measure risks and progress related to the actions we take. The Pact strengthens our ability to manage, protect and prevent damages to this important heritage, which is vital to our existence. We will protect the Amazon without compromising our sovereignty, as that is how we must manage shared problems.\nIn protecting nature, combating drug trafficking, criminality and transnational crimes, defending democracy and liberty, strengthening free trade and managing migration, we must unite in order to develop and strengthen multilateral responses involving governance that allow us to come together, recognize problems and develop road maps to move forward in resolving them. We must work to build a society more aware of the fact that our time on this the planet is fleeting but that the damage we cause can be irreversible.\nOur ability to conceive of new development alternatives must be complemented by our creativity to reduce their negative impact. One year ago, when our Government first came to power, barely 0.1 per cent of our energy grid was based on non-conventional renewable-energy sources, such as solar and wind power. We proposed making the leap from less than 60 megawatts that we began with at the beginning of our Government\u2019s mandate to more than 1,500 megawatts by the year 2020. That is a genuine energy revolution, and, at the same time, a major environmental commitment.\nWe know that the challenge is great. Further action is required of everyone \u2014 the international community, entrepreneurs and civil society leaders \u2014 but we remain convinced that together we can successfully arrive at the same end. We believe in the combination of the rule of law, the promotion of entrepreneurship and the search for equity. That is how we will succeed in closing social and economic gaps.\nToday, I am able to inform the Assembly that we have made steady progress towards the transformation of our model of production. Now, as never before, Colombia is advancing on an economic path paved with inspiration, creativity, technology and value-added services. We therefore proudly support the establishment of micro, small, medium-sized and large businesses, the \u201corange economy\u201d, new technological innovations and every endeavour responsible for delivering the products resulting from the ingenuity, effort and optimism of the people of Colombia to every corner of the Earth.\nIn that regard, in keeping with the Sustainable Development Goals and our development plan for the coming years \u2014 \u201cPact for Colombia, Pact for Equity\u201d \u2014 and a legislative package for economic revitalization, we succeeded in reducing the tax burden on companies and create incentives so that our country can compete without hindrance in international markets. As a result of these initiatives, in times of turbulence for the regional and perhaps the global economy, our growth has surpassed the average growth of the countries of the region, which has merited the major recognition of the world\u2019s investors.\nWe are, without a doubt, the resilient Colombia that is enterprising and growing with equity. In facing obstacles today, Colombia therefore persists in building a culture of legality in which we recognize our differences and choose coexistence, and the rule of law is forged as the indissoluble marriage of security and justice.\nOne year ago, I stated in this Hall that my Government would work to successfully advance the demobilization, disarmament and reintegration process. Today, I come again to this Hall to assert that peace with legality is being built with firm steps, with more than 29 productive collective projects, linking more than 1,400 people, who have taken a gamble for a new life, and, in total, more than 13,000 Colombians remain in the reintegration process.\nWith the calm that has come from our tireless efforts, I can say that, today, before this Assembly, a single nation speaks, convinced that violence has been eradicated on the basis of legality. I repeat how valuable the support and work of the United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia has been. The support and validation of the international community has been invaluable in this process of stabilization, and we truly hope that it will continue to witness the path that we are building, the path of peace with legality.\nJust as we have discharged our duty towards those who chose the path of legality, we also warn those who persist in the path of crime of the consequences of that choice. A few weeks ago, a group of criminals, under ideological guise, tried to frighten Colombia. The reality is that for them there never was reintegration or a laying down of arms because they simply never stopped committing crimes. They lied to Colombia and, moreover, allied themselves with the dictatorship oppressing the people of Venezuela. Their threatening intentions ran afoul of a Government that does not give in to threats and, above all, of a people which will not be intimidated and does not suffer the mafia camouflaged as ideology. On that score, there is no doubt that I, as President of all Colombians, will do everything in my power to guarantee for Colombia peace based on legality. On this conviction, we shall not yield even an inch.\nViolence finds support in the illegal economies based mainly on drug trafficking. Our Government has appropriated more than 200,000 hectares of coca plantations and, with great pains, we have managed, for the first time in more than seven years, to stop their exponential growth. To date, my Government has eradicated coca from and replaced more than 90,000 hectares, and we will not stop there. Drug trafficking is a predator for the environment and human society; it is a nest for corruption and fuels terrorism. The more coca there is, the less peace. That is why the fight against drug trafficking and illicit economies is a battle that requires the engagement of all nations against the lure of drug production, distribution and consumption. No country is exempt from this threat. Drug trafficking is a global problem, and we must tackle it as such.\nI can say with conviction that some of the worst effects of drug trafficking are that it feeds corruption, weakens institutions and infects the social fabric. The fight against corruption unites us of all in this Hall today and unites us all Colombians, and we are one in the fight against this scourge. There is no political, social or cultural system that does not face the abyss when its institutions are eroded by corruption. All institutions are doomed to fail if they let corruption knock on their doors. In Colombia today, such effective transparency measures as the Statutory Law on Accountability, which binds all public servants, are already a reality. We are not alone in that struggle either. Together with friendly nations, we are promoting a project to create an international anti-corruption court because, like drug trafficking, the scourge of transnational corruption transcends and ignores borders and the international community needs a strong tool to confront it.\nColombia believes in multilateralism not only as a means of integrating economies, ideas and politics, but also, above all, as the stage for solutions \u2014 solutions that are built on such inalienable principles as solidarity, fraternity, love for freedom, utmost respect for the decisions of peoples and the unrestricted defence of democracy, on the rejection of all forms of tyranny and on the economic pillars of free enterprise, workers\u2019 rights and free trade.\nAt least 4.2 million people have left Venezuela since 2015 on account of the brutal dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro. They are fleeing from a nation that was once rich and today is starved, that was once a democracy and today is an authoritarian regime without means or freedoms, where there are no institutions because they have shut down or been completely co-opted by the dictator. Venezuela is a country that once lived in peace and today suffers oppression, that was once an economic power and today has seen the destruction of all private initiative.\nColombia has received approximately 1.4 million Venezuelans migrants who have fled hunger and despair and has done so with open arms, guided by the ethical principles of solidarity and fraternity. It is precisely because we understand the difference between the brotherly people of Venezuela and the regime that oppresses them that we reach out to our brothers who continue to cross the border. We are aware that solidarity and fraternity must translate into tangible actions and policies. We have set up various instruments to help Venezuelans. We have welcomed the 25,000 children born on Colombian soil to Venezuelan parents since 2017 who were at risk of statelessness. All child in the world have the right to a nationality and, in this case, Colombia has given them one with affection and commitment.\nThe migrant crisis that we warned of a year ago, in this very Hall, is a reality and is made increasingly worse the longer the dictator remains in power. The Venezuelan tragedy has a name and surname, and we all know what they are. Colombia\u2019s position vis-a-vis the dictatorship is not about geopolitical disputes, but about the need of the Venezuelan people to see their democracy completely restored.\nColombia is not alone in clamouring for freedom in Venezuela. The Lima Group and more than 50 nations around the world recognize the legitimate presidency of Juan Guaido and actively participate in denouncing all the crimes committed under the dictator\u2019s leadership. As President of Colombia, I respectfully call for us, together, within the framework of international law and the instruments of multilateralism, to return Venezuela\u2019s democracy and freedom to it.\nIt is time to call a spade a spade. The Venezuelan dictatorship is one more link in the chain of transnational terrorism. Its corrupt structures serve the drug cartels. Its minions work for the mafia and feed the violence in Colombia. They shelter murderers, child rapists and the completely lawless. Of course, those who claim to be unaware of all these facts end up becoming accomplices of the dictatorship.\nMy Government has strong and convincing evidence corroborating the dictatorship\u2019s support for criminal groups and narcoterrorists operating in Venezuela to attack Colombia. As President of Colombia, I will proffer to the President of the Assembly and the Secretary-General evidence that supports these allegations. This 128-page file contains the body of evidence demonstrating the complicity of Nicolas Maduro\u2019s regime with the terrorist cartels that attack the Colombian people. Before the international community, we present the list of a gang of less than 20 criminals who betrayed the generosity of the Colombians, and today reside in Venezuela, taking full advantage of the logistical capabilities provided by the dictatorship.\nIn this report, we also reveal the location of more than 1,400 men in arms belonging to the most dangerous blocks of the National Liberation Army (ELN) and 207 locations controlled by this criminal organization in Venezuelan territory. We also include the testimonies of Venezuelan citizens who complain about the presence of the ELN in their territory, the brazen presence of criminals in training camps, as well as the existence of 20 landing strips at the service of drug trafficking. This unequivocal evidence shows the sponsorship and support of Nicolas Maduro\u2019s dictatorship for the aforementioned criminal structures.\nVenezuela has become fertile ground for criminal structures allied with the ELN, which knows no borders. Those ringleaders who today enjoy Maduro\u2019s protection are the same ringleaders who for years claimed responsibility for attacks on oil pipelines, causing irreparable environmental damage and turning them into the greatest ecocides that humankind has ever known. This is an unacceptable conduct, which as Head of State I must denounce before the international community. Let us not kid ourselves: Colombia is not and will never be an aggressor country, nor will it allow itself to be provoked by warmongering insinuations. But it will always \u2014 always \u2014 raise its voice to denounce tyranny.\nVenezuela needs an end to usurpation, the installation of a transitional Government, a Government that allows for economic and social recovery. And it urgently needs to hold truly free elections and to fully recover the rule of law. Nicolas Maduro\u2019s crimes against his people can be compared only to those of Slobodan Milosevic in the former Yugoslavia.\nWe cannot be idle witnesses of so much pain in our Latin America. That is why, last Monday, 23 September, the Thirtieth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Organization of American States, acting as the consultative body under the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, adopted a historic resolution, which states that the participation of authorities and entities linked to Nicolas Maduro\u2019s regime in illegal activities, in particular drug trafficking, asset laundering, terrorism and its financing, corruption and the violation of human rights, is a regional threat. For 16 Latin American countries, it is evident that the dictatorship is violating the obligations established in Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). We therefore strongly affirm that all these criminal activities, associated with the humanitarian crisis generated by the deterioration of the political, economic and social situation in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, represent a threat to the maintenance of peace and security on the continent.\nI would like to reiterate that this challenge requires constant collective action that develops the principle of global solidarity under the ever-present primacy of multilateralism. We are a strong voice in the region asking the Maduro regime to cease its support for narcoterrorist groups. We ask the international community to adopt all appropriate sanctions to safeguard the rights and freedoms of present and future generations of Colombians and, of course, of our Venezuelan brothers and sisters.\nFor all of these reasons, here, on this world stage, I courageously express to the international community that Colombia will continue to be committed to the defence of democracy in Venezuela, but, my fellow representatives, without the support of this community, without the true support of the States Members of the United Nations, those who left their homes with the desire to return will not easily find their way back. We will continue to work, with all love and passion, for the construction of a Colombia based on the rule of law, entrepreneurship, the promotion of individual initiative and the closing of all social gaps. All \u2014 absolutely all \u2014 of our efforts are oriented towards fairness.\nToday Colombia is telling the world that now is the time for us to find the determination needed to transform our societies. It is the time for us to firmly confront tyranny. It is the time for us to show our greatness, so that all of us, citizens of the world, can live our lives with dignity.\n"

I assure him that the delegation of the Kingdom of Tonga will fully support his able leadership. I also express our gratitude to his predecessor, Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her successful presidency of the Assembly at its seventy-third session, under the theme \u201cMaking the United Nations relevant to all people through global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies\u201d. I also commend His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres for his inaugural visit to the Pacific Islands region in May and his continued stewardship of the Secretariat. Tonga fully supports the ongoing work he is undertaking on reform of the United Nations to ensure its relevance and utility for all Member States.\nMy delegation and I congratulate the President on his four priorities to guide our work during this session, namely, promoting international peace and security, in particular conflict prevention; strengthening global action to tackle climate change, which is integral to the effective implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); accentuating inclusion, human rights and the empowerment of youth and women; and promoting partnerships for advancing the achievement of the SDGs, which are interlinked, very timely and relevant to addressing, during his tenure, the challenges of our time, which we fully support.\nWe welcome the President\u2019s recognition of the challenges faced by small island delegations, such as ours, to ensure we are able to contribute equitably and effectively to the many important high-level meetings to be convened during this session. With five summits this week alone in addition to our general debate, we are grateful for his particular attention to enabling smaller delegations to participate fully.\nTonga continues its commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs, including the small island developing States (SIDS) Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway. We are pleased to participate at the high-level midterm review of the SAMOA Pathway tomorrow to ensure its goals are being met at the halfway point of its implementation. The Government\u2019s sustainable development priorities remain aligned with 13 of the 17 SDGs, namely, Goals 1 to 4, 6 to 9 and 13 to 17.\nTonga\u2019s first voluntary national review report, presented at the United Nations High-level Political Forum on sustainable development, held in July, spoke to the localization of the SDGs and the SAMOA Pathway through Tonga\u2019s strategic development framework. A whole-of-government approach for coordinated and coherent service delivery continues to be a priority. We once again recognize the important contribution to our efforts by the United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States, the United Nations Department for Economic and Social Affairs, and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. We are also grateful for the enhanced engagement in Tonga by the United Nations Office for Project Services through our recently concluded host country agreement.\nTonga welcomed the convening of the Climate Action Summit earlier this week. My country engaged fully in that seminal gathering of leaders to again give prominence to the threats posed by climate change, with its direct links to international peace and security, and thereby to our sustainable development aspirations, in support of SDG 13 and its targets. The 1.5\u00b0C limit is the heart of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and, although my country, along with our Pacific small island developing States neighbours as a whole, contributes not even close to 1 per cent of global warming, we remain committed to the Agreement. Securing climate financing is the main priority for Tonga, as without it no action on our nationally determined contributions is possible. We welcome the announcement by the United Kingdom of its intention to double its contribution to the Green Climate Fund.\nPacific leaders in Tuvalu last month endorsed the strongest statement to date on climate change. The Kainaki II Declaration declared a climate-change crisis in the Pacific Islands region and called for urgent action to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions and prevent catastrophic global warming and disasters. Extreme events like cyclones and typhoons, flooding, drought and king tides are increasingly more intense, inflicting damage and destruction on our communities and ecosystems and putting the health of our peoples at risk. At this time, we are thinking of our fellow islanders in the Bahamas, as they work to recover after the devastating impacts and destruction in the wake of Hurricane Dorian.\nClimate change is not only a political issue for us, but also one of survival. The fact that climate change is an existential threat and a matter of international peace and security was again endorsed by Pacific leaders through their decision to develop the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. We continue to support the work of the Group of Friends on Climate and Security. We continue to recognize the important nexus between the climate and the ocean, and furthermore continue to note with concern the devastating impacts of climate change on our marine environment. We look forward to deliberations on this link in Chile, at the twenty-fifth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, later this year.\nImportant issues of baselines that determine our maritime boundaries, once established under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea, should not be affected and should remain unchanged, despite the effects of sea-level rise. Our sovereignty must not be compromised by the effects of climate change, and we continue to welcome and support the work of the International Law Commission on this critically important and timely issue for consideration of the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly.\nTonga has continued its engagement in this year\u2019s second and third sessions of Intergovernmental Conference on an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ). We look forward to the next revision of the draft instrument, with the hope that the ongoing convergence of understandings by Member States engaging in the process will find completion at the fourth, and final, session of the Conference early next year. We also welcome the establishment of the Friends of BBNJ Capacity Development, which is the cross-cutting issue tying together all elements of the Convention.\nTonga also continues its engagement at the International Seabed Authority. Together with other members of the Authority, Tonga remains committed, including in its capacity as an elected member of its Council, to continuing to work towards the finalization of the important draft exploitation regulations to ensure an appropriate balance between the need to conserve and protect the marine environment and the sustainable use of deep-sea mineral resources. Importantly, we must ensure our work is appropriately informed and properly concluded in support of Sustainable Development Goal 14. The presidency of the Council of the Authority will rotate to the Asia-Pacific Group in 2020 for the twenty-sixth session, and Tonga has presented its candidature for election to that important position.\nAs Tonga was also privileged to host the first International Seabed Authority regional workshop for the Pacific in February, it also remained engaged with the Authority\u2019s Abyssal Initiative for Blue Growth and attended related workshops for sponsoring States in Nauru and Kiribati last month. We look forward to continuing our collective work in the Cook Islands and in Tonga in the coming months, before the second Ocean Conference in mid-2020.\nTonga commends the work of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. We are grateful for the Commission\u2019s recommendations on our first partial submission last month. We look forward to its eventual consideration of our second partial submission in good time. We would like to acknowledge Italy\u2019s ongoing partnership with Tonga through the joint committee in strengthening our capacity in the field of the environment and the ocean. We also acknowledge the work of the secretariat of the Pacific Community, the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Pew Charitable Trust on the regional deep-sea minerals treaty.\nTonga\u2019s priority nationally determined contribution is to achieve 50 per cent renewable energy by 2020. We have been able to negotiate the funding required to achieve this goal and would like to thank our partners that assist Tonga through public and public-private financing to accelerate my country\u2019s transition to renewable energy and resilient infrastructure in support of Sustainable Development Goal 7 and its associated targets. Tonga is also pleased to continue in its capacity as an elected Vice-President of the Assembly of the Small Island Developing States Sustainable Energy and Climate Resilience Initiative, on behalf of Pacific SIDS members.\nFinally, sustainable development, whether it be through good health and well-being, climate action, life below water or affordable and clean energy, inter alia, can be realized only through the achievement and maintenance of international peace and security.\nWe continue to look to the Security Council to protect the innocent from threats to international peace and security in all their forms, be they traditional threats such as armed conflict or newer threats such as climate change, rising sea levels and health epidemics, to ensure that no one is left behind.\nMay Almighty God guide and bless the President of the General Assembly, all the States Members of the United Nations and their respective Governments and peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "Every generation faces its own challenges but no generation has faced a challenge as urgent and formidable as that confronting us in climate change and global warming. This is the mother of all battles, because it is the battle for our very survival. The human being is the most intelligent creature living on planet earth. However, it is also the only creature capable of destroying \u2014 and, at times, it seems, ready to destroy \u2014 its own planet.\nRecent months have seen many prestigious magazines publish photos of planet earth captioned \u201cLet\u2019s save the planet\u201d. I believe they are mistaken: it is not planet earth that is at risk; what is truly at risk is the survival of the human being on planet earth.\nOur planet is over 4.5 billion years old, and during this long history, it has suffered and endured all kinds of phenomena \u2014 such as hurricanes, glaciations, warming, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods, asteroid strikes \u2014 and it survived them all. However, more than 99 out of every 100 species that once existed no longer exist today, and we do not want human beings to join that list of the extinct.\nThe scientific evidence is categorical and conclusive: the situation is now critical. In fact, the latest scientific report, United in Science, published just today, shows that the concentration of greenhouse gases and global temperature are the highest they have been in the past 800,000 years. The last five years have been the hottest in recorded human history. The report states that, even if we implemented the commitments made under the Paris Agreement, temperature would still significantly exceed the limit agreed, reaching an increase of almost 3.4 degrees, which is almost tantamount to disaster. We need to multiple comprises by five to meet the target of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nThe consequences are not theoretical; they are plain for everyone to see. We are enduring heatwaves, major storms and floods, severe droughts, devastating hurricanes, and ice calving and melting, among other things. Sea levels continue to rise by the day, as do the acidification and deoxygenation of their waters. In fact, over the past 30 years, humankind has destroyed 50 per cent of corals, which are the backbone of all marine life. We have burned or deforested large areas of forests crucial to the life and health of our planet. The most serious aspect is that such changes, which once occurred over the course of centuries or millennia, now take place in less than a decade. Nature has long been screaming in alarm and anguish, pleading for the simplest of things \u2014 that we take care of her so that she in turn may take care of us.\nThe 2015 session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP), held in Paris, set the goal of limiting maximum temperature increase to 2\u00b0C, later stepped up to 1.5\u00b0C by the end of the century. But the commitments countries made at that Conference did not, as has just been mentioned, go far enough. They are not even being honoured!\nWe must urgently rise to the challenge. This means that we must prevent climate change and global warming from becoming truly catastrophic. This is not a matter of scepticism, faith, politics or ideology; it is a problem founded in science. And the overwhelming science is telling us loud and clear that we have less than a decade left to radically change the course of history and the way in which we treat our planet. We know too much to remain sceptical.\nThis challenge is not just environmental; it is also a moral challenge, affecting our children and grandchildren, and the generations to come. They too have the right to live on planet Earth. From this same rostrum yesterday, we listened to children and young people raise their voices, urging us to shoulder responsibilities and account not only for what we have done but above all for what we have not done. Those future generations will also want to live on a healthy planet and they will, of course, judge us, and judge us harshly, for the way in which we responded to the monumental challenge of climate change.\nTherefore, if we are to avoid catastrophe, it is now imperative that we recognize that we are on the wrong track, time has run out and we must change course. Facing this scenario, we have heard two options. There are those who say, \u201cLet us wait and see what happens\u201d and accept the consequences; and those who believe that the time has come to tackle this challenge and change the course of history. The good news is that science and technology give us tools and instruments and that we still have time to change course in how we as humankind treat our planet.\nChile has chosen this second path, deciding to tackle the challenge. That is why we agreed to host the COP in December. What are the objectives of the COP to be held in Chile?\nFirst, it is aimed to get countries to make much more ambitious and enforceable commitments than they have to date to combat climate change. There is good news on this front, too. Today, 66 countries, or one in three, have already committed to becoming carbon neutral, which means cutting net emissions of carbon and greenhouse gases to zero. This seemed impossible only weeks ago. We note and welcome this change in attitude, heightened awareness and the stronger commitment to tackling the problem.\nThe Secretary-General tasked us some months ago with leading the coalition for climate mitigation so as to ensure that more countries, business and cities commit to carbon neutrality. As I said at the Group of 20 Summit in Osaka, Japan, where six countries, including Chile, made this commitment, the movement is fast gaining momentum, with 66 countries, more than 100 cities and more than 100 major companies having committed to becoming carbon neutral.\nSecondly, we also need to incorporate the protection and conservation of rainforests and their magnificent biodiversity and, of course, the incorporation not only of rain forests but where they grow, because when rainforests grow, they capture carbon and produce oxygen. This is why, together with the Presidents of France and Colombia, we created the Alliance for Rainforests, which will take the second step of its work at the December COP in Chile.\nAt the same time, we must also incorporate care for the oceans. Oceans capture 50 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions and absorb more than 90 per cent of the temperature increases generated by us human beings. However, they are suffering serious impacts. The United in Science report details the degree of acidification and deoxygenation affecting our oceans and killing marine life. This is why the Chile COP will be the blue COP, because without blue there is no green, and without green there is no life.\nThirdly, it will fully involve regional, municipal and city Governments, non-governmental organizations, businesses, civil society and communities at large in the cause of fighting climate change.\nFourthly, it will put into practice some instruments that were agreed in Paris but are yet to be activated, such as carbon bond markets, to generate more resources for and improve the efficiency of the struggle to reduce carbon emissions.\nThis is why Chile is today announcing the launch of the Alliance for Climate Ambition, which will bring together States and cities, business and civil society on all these fronts. Indeed, Chile committed a few months ago to becoming a carbon-neutral country. We are taking that commitment very seriously. We are implementing a plan to achieve that goal, based on four pillars: the complete decarbonization of our energy grid; the modernization of our public transport system, replacing fossil fuels entirely with electricity; energy efficiency in every sector; and an ambitious protection, conservation and reforestation programme for our forests.\nWe are pursuing all of this through a framework law on climate change, which identifies clear strategies, tools and timelines for upholding our commitment to carbon neutrality. In this great task, we will have to use all the tools that our great allies of science and technology put at our disposal. We must leave behind the culture of the disposable and embrace the culture of the recyclable. We must shift from the concept of a linear economy to one that is circular, repurposing its own waste.\nChange will not be easy; it will require ambition. Ambition requires funding, but it is also true that funding always follows ambition. This is why I call on world leaders and all men and women of good faith to recognize that we have run out of time and must now go from diagnosis and debate to action, pure and simple. We must leave aside the false dichotomy between economic growth and sustainability. If development is not sustainable, there can be no development. The two concepts are not in competition, but complement one another.\nOf course, we will have to significantly increase investment in innovation and technology to better tackle these challenges. Innovation and technology are the tools that will allow us to make crucially needed development compatible with urgently needed care for nature. We will also have to mobilize far more resources than those mobilized or pledged to date if we are to help the most vulnerable countries to join this noble struggle. From the edges of the Earth, the southern reaches of the world, we invite all Governments and all sectors of society to participate in COP Chile and commit to tackling the great challenge of our generation. This battle still depends on us, and we cannot therefore just continue to ignore it. This is the great challenge of our generation: to correct a decades-long course and treat our planet differently in order to guarantee the survival of humankind.\nLast year, in this same Hall (see A/73/PV.10), I acknowledged certain errors and problems in my country and referred to what was happening in so-called sacrificial zones and the serious harm to thousands of people there (see A/73/PV.10). But acknowledgement is not enough; we must also take action. That is why I committed to address the pollution and poisoning endured by so many in the communities of Quintero and Puchuncavi decisively and with determination and urgency. I am pleased to say that a revamped and strict plan is now in place to decontaminate those communities. The plan includes emission standards as exacting as those in the European Union and provides for strengthening the health-care system and State oversight of a modernized monitoring network. In addition, we have obtained the collaboration of the Finnish Meteorological Institute, which is specialized in that area and has conducted an in-depth analysis and made a series of useful recommendations to correct the situation.\nThe same applies to our planet. If we do not do anything very soon, the whole planet might become a sacrificial zone. And that we cannot allow. Just a few days ago, the headline of The New York Times read that a quarter of humankind faces looming water crises. Chile, Mexico, India, North Africa and California are among the most vulnerable places. I want to mention the acute and extensive drought in our country, which has lasted more than 10 years and is reflected in sharp decreases in river flows, water levels in reservoirs and snow accumulation in the mountains, as well as across all other indicators. That is why we are tackling the issue with a sense of urgency, but also one of efficiency. We have issued water scarcity and agricultural emergency decrees with a view to ensuring the population\u2019s water supply and assisting small- and medium-scale farmers, who are so adversely affected by the drought. We are incorporating modern technologies for better use of water in all sectors of our economy, including irrigation technology in the agricultural sector. We have adopted a construction plan that prioritizes 26 reservoirs and are moving forward with a plan to recharge the natural aquifers under our country\u2019s soil. And, of course, we are improving the reuse of water through the treatment of grey water and sewage. However, it goes without saying, that it takes time to resolve those problems.\nI would also like to refer today to a problem that affects the world economy as a whole. We are witnessing a worrisome weakening of the world economy. International trade and investment are stagnating. The trade and tariff war, which has gone on for too long, between the world\u2019s two greatest Powers, the weakening of free trade, areas of long-term protectionism, the growing inefficiency and deadlock at the World Trade Organization, which is unable to prevent or sanction protectionist actions that harm the entire economy \u2014 these impede job creation and limit the quality of life of our peoples.\nToday, at a time of enormous technological progress, we should more than ever advance on the road to integration. We need to rebuild a respected multilateral economic order that is based on rules known and respected by all and promotes free trade, integration and investment flows, combats protectionism, eliminates barriers to trade, harmonizes regulations and establishes universal rules to prevent and sanction unilateral acts that threaten the international order. To that end, it is necessary to modernize the World Trade Organization as soon as possible and to strengthen international collaboration.\nIn November, Chile will host the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, which brings together economies that represent two thirds of the world\u2019s gross domestic product. We hope to achieve great advances on that occasion in the areas of free trade and anti-protectionism. But allow me to make a remark. Today, when the world is most in need of leadership on issues such as climate change, global warming, free trade and integration, it seems unreasonable that the two great Powers, instead of uniting to lead us in effectively addressing those issues, should be fighting each other, resulting in a grave and dangerous leadership vacuum. I would like to comment that there is no incompatibility or conflict between thinking about a global world and being a patriot. There is no conflict there; these are merely two sides of the same coin that enable the balance we want to achieve between integration and national identity.\nBefore turning to the topic of my own country, I would like to refer to a vital point for our continent, Latin America. We must put an end to the ignominious, cruel dictatorship imposed on the Venezuelan people. It is a corrupt and incompetent dictatorship that flouts human rights and freedoms and has undeniable links with drug trafficking. Under the dictatorship, Venezuela, which had been the richest country in Latin America, with the world\u2019s largest oil reserves and a model of democracy for our continent, has become a country mired in a profound political, economic, social and moral crisis, where the very lives of its inhabitants, owing to a lack of food and medicine, are in jeopardy. The only avenue open to the people has been mass migration. More than 4.5 million Venezuelans have left their country because of a lack of prospects in order to seek better development opportunities. Without a doubt, this is a cause that engages all of Latin America.\nI would like to end with remarks concerning Chile. Each generation has a mission to fulfil. Our country\u2019s fathers achieved freedom and independence and bequeathed us a free homeland. The generation that preceded us was able to recover freedom and restore democracy in a very exemplary way. Our generation has a new challenge, that of defeating poverty and achieving development. That should be done in peace and unity, so that all my compatriots may have the opportunity to develop their abundant talents and be secure in their ability to live in dignity. In short, the goal is a homeland where everyone may pursue happiness and seek a fuller, happier life, together with their families and loved ones. That is our mission, and we are committed to it. It will be the yardstick against which the generations to come will judge us. Those generations, who are our children and grandchildren, we cannot and will not fail them.\nI ask God to enlighten our paths and to bless Chileans and all the peoples of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great privilege for me to address this great institution for the first time on behalf of the Republic of Lithuania. I have come with the message that my country is deeply committed to the core values and principles of the United Nations. The responsibility to seek peace, protect human rights and work for the general welfare is our main goal, rooted in our difficult history. Lithuania suffered painful losses during the two World Wars. It experienced two brutal totalitarian regimes, Nazism and Stalinism. After regaining independence almost 30 years ago, we rebuilt our democratic State institutions, created an effective market economy and joined the world\u2019s major political, economic and cultural organizations.\nHistory is a great teacher. It teaches us not to repeat the mistakes of the past and it inspires us to move on to new heights. One month ago, we commemorated the eightieth anniversary of the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. That criminal conspiracy led to the Second World War and the occupation of the three Baltic States. Every year on that same day we also celebrate a moment of great triumph. Thirty years ago, the people of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia joined hands in a 650- kilometre- long Baltic Way, strongly condemning the Pact. That was an important step in our struggle for freedom, and we will never forget it.\nLithuania has always strongly supported and promoted multilateral cooperation. Effective, rule-based multilateralism upholds the world order and contributes to international peace and security. A determination to adhere to international law is often the last barrier separating our countries from unpredictable, and therefore dangerous, disorder. In this world of many uncertainties, we need multilateral mechanisms more than ever before.\nAgainst this background, the Charter of the United Nations plays an exceptional role, as it commits all nations to working together towards a better world for all. We therefore fully support the steps taken by the Secretary-General to reform the United Nations in order to make the Organization more resilient and more capable of addressing difficult global challenges.\nWe need a stronger United Nations to respond more effectively to protracted conflicts and humanitarian crises in the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa and other regions. We also need active engagement on the part of all States Members of the United Nations to eliminate and prevent large-scale crimes against humanity and to find long-term political solutions.\nUnfortunately, in this world rife with crises, Europe is no longer an exception. The illegitimate use of force and serious violations of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity have become part of everyday life in Europe. Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, encouraged by the feeble international response to its 2008 aggression against Georgia, is attempting to further destabilize countries in its environs. Russia\u2019s appalling military actions against Ukraine have been continuing for five years now.\nLithuania strongly condemns that prolonged violation of international law and urges the aggressor to respect the Charter, the Helsinki Final Act and its bilateral agreements with Ukraine. We will continue to support Georgian and Ukrainian independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will never recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea or the occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. We hold that the implementation of the Minsk agreements is an absolute precondition for normalizing relations with Russia.\nSome political leaders are floating the idea of creating a new geopolitical space from the Atlantic Ocean to Vladivostok, drawing Russia in. It may sound interesting, but do we have common ground for it? Do we have shared values? The answer, unfortunately, is no. We have to remember the hard lessons of history. There was a time when left-leaning intellectuals welcomed Vladimir Lenin\u2019s ascent to power during the Russian Revolution. There was a time when the independence-seeking Baltic States were being instructed not to rush so as not to harm Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s perestroika. Both times it all ended with innocent blood being shed.\nAs a matter of principle, we should not endorse unions in which some States become the subjects of history and others just objects. As of today, Russia has done nothing to inspire our confidence. Could this change? Yes, it could. We would be the first to welcome this turn of events, with a democratic Russia respecting international law and the sovereignty of other countries.\nToday we need to realize that open disrespect for international law endangers global security. It is often accompanied by drastic violations of human rights and undermines our efforts to build prosperous societies. We know that there can be no peace or security without responsibility. We have repeatedly seen that impunity breeds fresh violence. Those who have committed crimes against humanity must know that they will not go unpunished.\nLithuania is one of the countries that are still waiting for justice. During the brutal events of January 1991, Soviet military tanks attacked peaceful protesters in newly independent Lithuania. Fourteen civilians were killed and more than 800 injured. Twenty-eight years later, the Lithuanian court convicted 67 former Soviet officers and military personnel for war crimes and crimes against humanity. However, Russia continues to shield the perpetrators from justice and has even initiated criminal proceedings against the Lithuanian judges and prosecutors who investigated the case. We see this as impermissible interference in a sovereign State\u2019s delivery of justice.\nKnowing the true significance of justice, we will continue working to ensure the universality and indivisibility of human rights. Lithuania\u2019s key priorities as a candidate for the Human Rights Council for the period from 2022 to 2024 will be women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, as well as the protection of freedom of expression. We hold that every nation, small or large, has a right and a duty to strive for a better world for all. During Lithuania\u2019s presidency of the Security Council in 2015, we reinforced our commitments regarding the use of small arms and light weapons as well as the protection of journalists in zones of conflict. Responding to violations of international law, we kept the Council\u2019s attention on the ongoing aggression against Ukraine.\nLithuania will continue its active participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations as well as its contribution to military training and humanitarian actions in Mali, the Central African Republic and Somalia. We actively support all efforts to strengthen United Nations peacekeeping forces, including Action for Peacekeeping and the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative to fight sexual exploitation in military conflicts. Recognizing the irreplaceable role played by women in building and maintaining peace, we will work to expand women\u2019s engagement in peacekeeping operations.\nOur common efforts to seek security and justice create the preconditions for fighting poverty, income inequality, social exclusion and the climate crisis. Only lasting stability across societies and nations as well as greater democratic inclusion of all citizens will ensure the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. That is why I launched the idea of a welfare State in Lithuania as a strategic concept for the next five years of my presidency. That initiative is built on the core principles of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals. The most difficult challenge is to translate it into reality. Only specific and streamlined action can bring us closer to success.\nAt the international level, I call on everyone to identify the greatest threats to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and to come up with adequate solutions. In Lithuania\u2019s view, violations of a rules-based global order, the transformation of cyberspace into a new arena for an arms race and disrespect for international environmental and nuclear safety standards, as well as neglect of climate change, should be considered the most serious risks.\nOur commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change remains critical to Lithuania\u2019s long-term strategy. Our climate change mitigation policy is based on the sustainable use of renewables and increased energy efficiency.\nAlong with developing wind and solar energy, we are also determined to switch from fossil fuels to biomass in the heating sector. In only five years, Lithuania has built an effective network of small biomass boilers, demonstrating that cities and towns can easily transform their district heating, and that the local energy potential can be exploited in a sustainable way and green jobs rapidly created. We presented the sustainable heating initiative, supported by a number of countries, at the Climate Action Summit 2019 and we are ready to share our experience with all interested parties.\nIn the upcoming United Nations discussions on environmental issues, we will speak in favour of enhancing climate and security elements. We speak out loudly against the threats and negative environmental effects posed by chemical weapons dumped at sea. Technological development makes it possible to reach the seabed more easily, and that entails new risks. Lithuania will not remain silent and for the fourth time will submit a draft resolution aimed at assessing those risks. We hope that our efforts will encourage the international community to become more engaged in creating a safer, cleaner and more sustainable environment both on land and at sea.\nWe build a better future only by acting together. Our shared spirit of humanity commits us to treating each other with integrity and to treasuring and protecting our planet. I believe that inventiveness and international collaboration will enable us to turn the emerging challenges into new opportunities and to contribute to universal prosperity.\nI would like to conclude my address by quoting former Secretary-General Kofi Annan. \u201cWe will not enjoy development without security, or security without development; ... we will not enjoy either without universal respect for human rights.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "It is a distinct honour for me to address the General Assembly, a unique global forum in which all States have an equal voice. The purpose of our annual debates each September is to assess the state of the world, identify trends and global challenges and exchange ideas on possible solutions.\nThe world order is clearly in transition and international organizations are trying to follow accordingly. However, in trying to adjust to some of the shifting paradigms, it would be a grave mistake to abandon the fundamental principles that have guided us for the past three quarters of a century. They are the sovereign equality of all States, collective security, the progressive development of international law, the fulfilment of obligations in good faith, the peaceful resolution of disputes, friendly cooperation among States and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Respecting those fundamental principles under the umbrella of the United Nations prevents us from sliding into a state of global chaos and war.\nWe live in an integrated world, one in which we all have a stake in each other\u2019s success. Our commitment to multilateralism derives from our values and strong conviction that global issues can only be tackled collectively. Nationalism and populism produce catchy formulas with immediate appeal. However, finding genuine solutions to our problems tends to be complex and challenging and requires a broader consensus. That is precisely why we are here to look for solutions to global and regional problems through dialogue and with mutual respect and respect for diversity.\nThis week, the vast majority of Member States once again reaffirmed their support for multilateralism. I want to add Slovenia\u2019s voice to that call for effective multilateralism, specifically focusing on three particular areas \u2014 the rule of law and human rights, climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals, and the challenges related to new technologies.\nRegarding international law and the universality of human rights and fundamental freedoms, we must constantly bear in mind that, if the system is to work, every State must abide by and defend the rules-based order, as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. Respecting international law is not a matter of opportunism or political will; it is a legal obligation and the sine qua non of the international system. It is therefore imperative to push back against attempts to undermine international law. Respect for international commitments and the implementation of international judicial decisions is fundamental.\nOver the past seven decades, the protection of human rights has seen remarkable progress. However, that progress should never be taken for granted, and we have to resist all attempts to weaken the existing protections. That is one of the greatest assets we can and must pass down to our children. However, we must not only create opportunities for the young, but also adequately address the ageing of many societies and the rights of the elderly. Slovenia will continue to support the idea of a dedicated international legal instrument on the rights of older persons.\nThe shrinking space for human rights activists around the world is alarming. All human rights belong to all people. Any identity-based discrimination and violence is utterly unacceptable. I say this while also looking ahead to next year\u2019s twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. The important advances made in gender equality and the empowerment of women must be protected. Sexual and reproductive health and rights are among the cornerstones of gender equality. We must not forget that women\u2019s potential is still underutilized in too many countries.\nGross human rights violations tend to be early indicators of emerging conflict. A swift and firm response to large-scale human rights violations is therefore vital to preventing crises from developing into full-fledged conflicts. I call on the members of the Security Council to uphold the code of conduct regarding situations involving mass atrocities and to refrain from using the veto in such situations.\nSlovenia is committed to conflict prevention and mediation. Prevention reduces human suffering. We have seen it work. When we take action early and stand united, we save lives. My country is determined to contribute to prevention efforts, in particular by supporting the human rights pillar of the United Nations, international criminal justice and the peaceful resolution of disputes. More specifically, Slovenia will continue to support stability in the Western Balkans and their European integration. While supporting the prospects of those countries for European Union membership, we actively encourage regional cooperation and reconciliation and promote youth cooperation.\nDue to their strong deterrent effect, ensuring justice and accountability for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law is important from an ethical, legal and practical perspective. As a member of the Secretary-General\u2019s Circle of Leadership on preventing and responding to sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations operations, I call for concerted action to end sexual exploitation and abuse across the United Nations system. Prevention and justice for survivors must be our first priority in that context.\nTo assist States in holding perpetrators accountable, Slovenia, together with several other countries, has put forward an initiative to negotiate a multilateral treaty for mutual legal assistance and extradition for domestic prosecution of the most serious international crimes. We thank all 69 States that have expressed their support for the initiative so far. We sincerely hope to obtain further support in the months leading up to the treaty negotiations, which begin next spring.\nI would also particularly like to address climate change, and especially sustainable development. The climate crisis is evolving faster than predicted. In passing several planetary milestones, we have already taken away some of the resources that belong to future generations. The unprecedented mobilization of young people on a global scale, demanding immediate action, followed by the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative to convene the Climate Action Summit, has finally generated a sense of urgency. The twenty-fifth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held later this year in Chile, will be of critical relevance to humankind and our planet. We owe it to our children not to become sidetracked from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nWe must recognize the right to a healthy living environment. Climate change is a case in point of the importance of effective multilateralism. The depletion of natural resources, especially water, perpetuates inequalities and the risk of conflict. It is also forcing us to rethink our current economic models and make them sustainable. The circular economic model, whereby resources are reduced, reused and recycled, is inextricably linked to the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe transition to a sustainable and green economy is a strategic priority for Slovenia. We will continue to support the implementation of the Paris Agreement. In that context, we will pay special attention to the sustainable use and management of natural resources, especially water, the promotion of a circular economy and the preservation and protection of biodiversity. In addition, Slovenia will continue to contribute to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda with a sense of urgency. We will present the progress we have made over the past four years in our second voluntary review at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in 2020.\nWe need to make every effort to eliminate all forms of poverty and inequality, promote peaceful and inclusive societies and mitigate the root causes of migration in developing countries. The issue of mass migration is not a new challenge and cannot be simply resolved overnight. It is an issue that should be addressed responsibly from the point of view of human rights and solidarity, with a clear focus on prevention, by appropriately addressing the situation at its root.\nWe cannot hold this important yearly discussion without acknowledging the significance of new technologies. Technological advancement brings people across the world closer to one another, and to a greater extent than ever imagined. It provides immense benefits in terms of increased productivity and a higher quality of life but also entails new risks for countries and individuals. People are increasingly reaping the benefits of artificial intelligence. According to estimates, as much as 80 per cent of future work will be done using artificial intelligence. It is bound to deeply affect various facets of our daily lives and fundamentally transform our societies.\nWe need to be better prepared for the challenge of algocracy, including by regulating the impact of artificial intelligence on human rights protection. I am particularly pleased to announce the proposal to set up, with UNESCO\u2019s backing, Europe\u2019s first international artificial-intelligence research centre in Slovenia\u2019s capital of Ljubljana. The aim of the centre will be to provide an open environment, focusing on the governance and policies surrounding artificial intelligence. In that respect, I sincerely hope to be able to count on the Assembly\u2019s valuable support at the upcoming UNESCO General Conference in November.\nI believe that at this critical time we must move forward in pursuit of our ideas and ideals, not abandon them. We need to give expression to our best hopes, not our deepest fears. We have to provide leadership that is strong enough to recognize that nations share common interests and people share universal principles and ideas in our common humanity.\n"

        "file_text": "I take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Muhammad-Bande, a distinguished son of our sisterly country, Nigeria, on his election to preside over the General Assembly at this session.\nThis session of the General Assembly sits on the cusp of the seventy-fifth year of the foundation of our Organization, which was forged from the ashes of a devastating world war. Our forebears sought to build a more just and equitable world order, based on the rule of law and guaranteeing fundamental freedoms. The United Nations was charged with upholding the idea that, as a collective, our differences could be resolved through dialogue and international diplomacy.\nOver the past decades, we have maintained the longest period of prosperity in our collective memory. However, as we approach our seventy-fifth year, we also need to be conscious that many of our people have been left behind. Because of our shortcomings and inaction, humankind is today threatened by conflict, economic hardship and climate change. We cannot afford to have disillusioned people who have lost sight of the visions of hope and security that were promised when our Organization was founded.\nEquality is for everyone, regardless of gender or race. In Seychelles, my Government believes in placing people at the centre of development. We continue to invest in them so that they can live in dignity, realize their full potential and contribute to our vibrant democracy. Inclusivity is the key that will drive our nations further towards the goal of a secure and sustainable future. I believe in the human spirit and its unyielding capacity for good. I believe in the founding principles of the United Nations \u2014 that multilateralism is key in bringing nations and people together and ensuring mutual prosperity and lasting peace.\nMore than most, island nations must have faith in the multilateral international order. We are by nature isolated and, by design, our livelihoods are tied to the rest of the world. We rely heavily on that premise, as well as on the actions or inactions of others for our very survival. Climate change has become an existential threat, not only to the lives of people in island States but to the world as a whole. It is clear that we are no longer in a position to indiscriminately plunder the environment under the guise of development for the sake of short-term profits. I am aware that development has lifted our people out of poverty, but through overexploitation we are dooming future generations to a planet beyond their ability to repair.\nFortunately, young people around the world have taken a stand to secure their future. In Seychelles, we are seeing youth-led non-governmental organizations partnering with the Government to prioritize the fight against climate change, pollution and other threats to the environment. Youth-led grass-roots movements led to a ban on many single-use plastics and continue to advocate for ocean protection.\nTo us islanders, the ocean represents not only our livelihood but also a way of life. The Seychellois people are bound to the sea and are cognizant of the untapped opportunities that it represents. Our pioneering development of the blue economy has the potential to unlock multiplier effects that will increase economic opportunities while at the same time protecting the ocean for generations to come. In our view, the ocean is the last frontier. If used responsibly, it will lead to shared prosperity, food security and innovation.\nIn part, we are harnessing the potential of the oceans through the blue economy to meet our sustainable development goals and climate obligations, as dictated by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Samoa Pathway and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Seychelles is also championing the development of the blue economy in Africa and we are working with willing partners towards the international deployment of the blue economy. Seychelles will remain at the forefront of the discourse on climate change. We will fight \u2014 with a passionate sense of urgency \u2014 against inequalities that directly impact us. It is unacceptable that 50 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions are produced by 10 per cent of the planet\u2019s wealthiest inhabitants living in the richest nations.\nWe will continue to voice our concerns as our people demand it. The Seychellois people do not have the luxury of \u201cwhat if\u201d, they require action now. We islanders can no longer afford to see ourselves as dots lost in a sea of blue \u2014 we are sentinels, guardians of two thirds of our common blue planet. The deep ocean is the beating heart of the planet, yet we have better maps of Mars than we do of the ocean floor. That needs to change, as we gather the information available to identify priority areas for protection. That information should be used to take concrete action to preserve our oceans, extending beyond national jurisdictions. It is a global issue and it therefore needs a global approach.\nWe must translate the political will of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement into decisive action. Bringing law and good governance to the ocean is the only way we can ensure our collective survival. Seychelles is 100 per cent committed to the ongoing work of the United Nations to develop a legally binding framework to conserve our oceans in areas outside national borders. If we want to survive, that is the only way forward.\nWe anticipate a transparent and inclusive instrument that offers due recognition of our special circumstances as a small island developing State and an adjacent coastal State, which implies the inclusion of appropriate mechanisms for benefit-sharing, capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology.\nSeychelles has challenged the established model of a donor-recipient relationship through innovative financing that promotes ocean conservation and climate action. Through the use of that type of financing, we have pioneered the world\u2019s first debt-for-adaptation swap, established the world\u2019s first sovereign blue bonds and protected ocean space in our exclusive economic zone, which is approximately the size of Germany. My country, Seychelles, is on track to conserve 30 per cent of its 1.4 million-square-kilometre maritime territory by 2020, thereby achieving the 30-by-30 target a decade early.\nSuffice to say that today, big ideas come from small islands. For too long, we have been relegated to the sidelines of international discourse. We seek to change that dynamic by highlighting what is most important. Earlier this year, Seychelles partnered with the Nekton mission and the Oxford University to conduct research in a bid to conserve our maritime spaces and the Indian Ocean. In April of this year, I was proud to deliver a speech, broadcast live from 407 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface, calling for greater worldwide effort to protect the beating blue heart of our planet \u2014 our oceans. But the novelty of the event should not overshadow the message. Safeguarding the oceans and marine life from climate change, overfishing, plastic pollution and other threats is an urgent global responsibility.\nToday, here at the United Nations, I say that we are the guardians of two-thirds of this blue planet\u2019s surface. We must act accordingly. The issue is bigger than all of us and we cannot wait for the next generation to solve it. We are running out of excuses to not take action and we are running out of time.\n"

        "file_text": "Four generations of our people have been waiting with hope. Beware, beware and beware of making them lose that hope. I trust that the General Assembly will not make them lose their hope.\nA week prior to the recent Israeli elections, Israel\u2019s Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, arrogantly announced that, should he prevail in the elections, he would annex and apply Israeli sovereignty to the Jordan Valley, the northern Dead Sea and Israel\u2019s colonial settlements, despite the fact that all of those areas are occupied Palestinian territory. We categorically reject that announcement. If any Israeli Government were to proceed with the announced plan, our response would be that all signed agreements with the Government of the occupation and any obligations therein will be terminated, in line with previous decisions we have taken in that regard.\nWe have the right to defend our rights by all possible means, regardless of the consequences, while remaining committed to international law and to combating terrorism. Our hand will remain extended for achieving peace through negotiations. However, anything else will be null and void if Israel or any Israeli Government \u2014 that of Mr. Netanyahu or of any other person \u2014 implements the plan announced a few days ago. In that regard, I thank all leaders, countries and international organizations that condemned or rejected that announcement and the settlement activities as a whole, which are serious violations of United Nations resolutions and international law. We thank them all. They have reaffirmed that the Palestinian question remains the first central issue for the entire world, despite desperate attempts to divert attention away from the question.\nI ask members of the Assembly: what would they do if someone attempted to take their countries\u2019 land and erase their presence on it? How would they react? It is time for the international community to shoulder its responsibilities in order to bring an end to the Israeli aggression and arrogance. It is time to implement at least one resolution adopted by the United Nations on this issue. Otherwise, all of those resolutions are useless.\nI had hoped to come to the Assembly this year to proclaim together the end of the Israeli occupation of my country, Palestine. But, regrettably, I stand before the Assembly today bearing the same concerns and pain that have been endured for so long by my people, who, despite all the injustice, oppression and occupation they have suffered, continue hoping to achieve their freedom and independence, as all other nations of the world. I ask the Assembly once again: has the time not come to save the Palestinian people and emancipate them from injustice, oppression and occupation? Has the time not come? I hope that Assembly members would ask themselves that question.\nThe General Assembly granted the State of Palestine observer State status in 2012. We are grateful for that legal and moral stance. We thank the United Nations for standing by our just requests to end the Israeli occupation of the land of the State of Palestine and for the State of Palestine to achieve its full independence, based on the 4 June 1967 borders, along with a just and comprehensive solution to the issue of the Palestinian refugees, whose plight has been prolonged. We thank the United Nations for its stance and hope that it is implemented and translated into action on the ground.\nWe also convey our greeting and appreciation to all the countries and the peoples that continue to provide support and assistance to our people and our country, politically and economically, with a view to ending the occupation and building our national institutions. We also thank them for their continued support to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), pending a just and comprehensive solution to the plight of our refugees, in line with international law. UNRWA was established in 1949 to help Palestinians address their problems, despite the fact that regrettably some have halted their assistance to UNRWA while its mission has not ended.\nWe are proud that the State of Palestine, despite all obstacles and policies of the Israeli occupation and its supporters, has become a full-fledged member of more than 110 organizations and international treaties. It has received the recognition of 140 States from around the world. The State of Palestine chaired the Group of 77 and China this year. It continues to competently assume its responsibilities at the regional and international levels as a resilient and constructive member of the international family. It deserves to be a full-fledged Member of the United Nations and all of its agencies. I believe that after all this we deserve to be a full-fledged Member. I do not know a single reason why we do not deserve it.\nWe have accepted international legitimacy and international law for resolving our question. We have sought and continue to seek, just and comprehensive peace. But the international law we have accepted and adhered to and the peace for which we strive are now in severe jeopardy, as a result of Israel\u2019s policies and practices in our occupied land and the fact that it has reneged on agreements it has signed, since the Oslo Accords in 1993 to date. The responsibility for defending peace and international law is incumbent upon the members of the Assembly. Israel has not implemented any of the agreements. We hope that the Assembly compels Israel to respect international legitimacy.\nThe occupying Power is waging a reckless racist war in Jerusalem against everything that is Palestinian: from the confiscation and demolition of homes to assaults on clergymen; to the eviction of our citizens from their homes; to attempts to violate the sanctity of the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; to the adoption of racist laws, such as the Jewish nation-State law. We all thought that those laws ended with apartheid in the former South Africa. Apartheid and racial discrimination are gone. Today we can see that similar laws still exist. One such law in Israel discriminates against people based on their religion and race, while the world remains silent. Israel also denies worshippers access to the holy sites. I caution against those policies and reckless measures, which lead to dangerous consequences. The result will be a religious war. We want to avoid such a war, but Israel is making every effort to wage one.\nA few months ago, Israel has started to arbitrarily confiscate a portion of our funds, leading to additional suffering of our people. We therefore have not been able to meet our financial obligations towards our citizens. That exacerbates the economic crisis in our country due to a lack of resources and the decision of some parties and countries to not fulfil their commitments towards us. Nevertheless, the Palestinian people will not surrender to the Israeli occupation, regardless of the circumstances and no matter the pain we endure. We will remain steadfast on our land, resisting occupation by all available peaceful means. That is our legitimate right and our national and moral obligation. Let everyone know that occupation cannot bring about peace, security or stability for anyone. Israel must not think that it can achieve peace through occupation. That will not happen.\nWhat is unfortunate and shocking is that the United States of America \u2014 a permanent member of the Security Council \u2014 is supporting the Israeli aggression against us, reneging on its international legal, political and moral obligations instead of maintaining international peace and security and upholding United Nations resolutions. The United States has even undertaken extremely aggressive and illegal measures, declaring Jerusalem the capital of the State of Israel and moving its Embassy there, in blatant provocation of the sentiments of hundreds of millions of Muslims and Christians, for whom Jerusalem is a central part of their religious faith. Despite all of those measures, Jerusalem will remain the eternal capital of Palestine, whether they like it or not.\nThe United States Administration did not stop there. It also decided to close the office of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Washington, D.C., for no reason. Some of its officials \u2014 in particular its Ambassador in Tel Aviv \u2014 have claimed that the Israeli settlements on our occupied territory are legitimate. They have decided that it is no longer an occupied territory, but an Israeli territory where Israel can build whatever facility it wishes. That was stated by the American Ambassador to Israel. Must we adhere to that statement? No. We will not follow the words of the United States and its Ambassadors. They do not shape our destiny.\nMoreover, the United States has immorally and inhumanely terminated all of its contributions to UNRWA, then speaks about the so-called deal of the century, suggesting deceptive and elusive economic solutions after having destroyed, through its own policies and measures, all possibilities of achieving peace. I challenge the United States to show us anything but the deal of the century that it announced and which we totally reject.\nThe policy of the United States has emboldened the Government of the Israeli occupation to renege all signed agreements with us and all its commitments to peace, depriving the peace process of any credibility and causing many Palestinians to lose faith in achieving the desired peace. It has jeopardized the two-State solution, and now many are wondering if the two-State solution has become impossible. Many people ask: can there be a one-State solution where everyone may live with the other equally? Some are starting to wonder. They are witnessing Israel seizing lands and destroying the two-State solution, and are therefore asking whether it is possible to have a one-State solution. Let me reaffirm that I am in favour of a two-State solution, which is the only solution. That is in line with international legitimacy and international resolutions. Even the United States adopted resolution 2334 (2016). That is the resolution I want to be implemented. I will not accept a one-State solution. I will not accept apartheid. We want a two-State solution based on international legitimacy.\nOn our part, we have never missed an opportunity to hold serious negotiations with the Israeli side. We have constructively engaged in all initiatives. However, Mr. Netanyahu has never agreed to or accepted negotiations behind closed doors on a bilateral or multilateral basis. We have both received several invitations from several countries to meet on their land and start the negotiation process. He has rejected them all \u2014 including the latest invitation from the Russian Federation, of which there have been three \u2014 claiming that Palestine does not want peace or negotiations. We say that we will always be ready to welcome peace with open arms, and we are convinced that peace will be achieved only through negotiations.\nDespite all of this, I renew our call for convening an international peace conference in line with the initiative I presented before the Security Council in February 2018 (see S/PV.8183) with the participation of the Arab countries, States members of the European Union and the Middle East Quartet. They can all participate in the conference to reach a solution, as can the permanent members of the Security Council, so that we reach a plan based on international consensus and the relevant United Nations resolutions, with a defined time frame so as to end the occupation, achieve the independence of our State and end the conflict. That is what we are asking for.\nTo be frank, we categorically reject any negotiations shepherded by any one country, whether it be the United States or any other country. We reject negotiations led by a single country. Such negotiations must be held under the auspices of the United Nations. We would consider the United States, or any other country wishing to hold their own negotiations, as biased. However, including the Quartet or other countries would be acceptable. I am not solely referring to the United States; the same applies to any one country. We will not accept mediation by the United States alone.\nFrom the outset, we have believed in democracy, which is enshrined in our Constitution, as a foundation for building our State and society. We have demonstrated that on the ground by holding elections in 1996, 2005 and 2006. However, they came to a halt in 2007 due to the Hamas coup. Since then, we have called for reconciliation and the holding of elections. Nevertheless, when I return to the homeland, I will call for general elections in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem. Anyone opposing those elections will be held accountable before God, the international community and history.\nOur steadfast position is to fight terrorism, and we always say that we can relinquish anything but will never give up in our fight against terrorism. We have adopted 83 protocols with 83 countries, including the United States, to combat international terrorism. We would like to take this occasion, in the aftermath of the recent attacks on the city of Dhahran and oil facilities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to condemn them and express our solidarity with that country, while supporting its position.\nIn conclusion, I pay tribute to, and express my pride in, our Palestinian people \u2014 in Palestine, the refugee camps, the diaspora and throughout the world. I say to them that we are confident that this occupation, like every other occupation before it, will inevitably end. Many countries have been occupied, including the United States, which was occupied by a number of countries. However, the occupation came to end in Europe, Africa and Latin America. We say that our occupation will come to an end as other occupations have ended.\nWe will continue to call for our rights. A right is never lost as long as someone strives to claim it. We pay tribute to our honourable martyrs, courageous prisoners and their resilient and patient families, whose rights we will protect regardless of the cost. I will not submit to Israel\u2019s demands. Even if I had only one penny left, I would give it to the families of the martyrs, prisoners and wounded. I will not prevent them from getting it.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to express my best wishes for the success of the presidency of this session of the General Assembly and to assure the Assembly of Peru\u2019s support for, and commitment to, the work of the United Nations.\nI firmly believe that the future is built with the actions we take today. For that reason, I call for concerted efforts to ensure peace, promote sustainable development and care for and protect the planet on the basis of dialogue and respect among our peoples, while always thinking of future generations when making decisions. Increasing social and economic inequality and high levels of corruption and impunity in a number of countries pose a latent risk to the future of democracy and governance and a source of discontent and apathy among citizens. The economic uncertainty that has persisted since the global financial crisis of 2008 has been exacerbated by trade tensions among the major players of the world economy.\nThat is why today, as never before, we must redouble our efforts at dialogue and constructive participation in order to find multilateral solutions to global problems. To that end, we must take into account the lessons drawn from the negotiation processes that, in 2015, led to historic milestones such as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Peru, a country with a pacifist and integrationist outlook, reaffirms its commitment to those agreements.\nTogether with Colombia, we have coordinated efforts in that context with various Member States to agree a United Nations mandate for holding a special session of the General Assembly, in the first half of 2021, to address the fight against corruption. One challenge for that initiative will be to adopt a political declaration on the issue. I am confident that we will have everyone\u2019s support and constructive participation. We hope that the head-on fight against corruption and impunity will become a global crusade.\nHere at Headquarters one year ago (see A/73/PV.6), I noted that I had been given the honour of leading Peru during a serious political and institutional crisis. I also emphasized how corruption had become a cancer that was preventing us from taking advantage of all the potential that we have to achieve greater levels of progress and development, in the face of which my\nGovernment could not stand by idly. That is why we undertook a number of judicial and political reforms, which are now under way, in an effort to restore the effectiveness, prestige and legitimacy of our institutions.\nI would like to inform the Assembly today that a few weeks ago, we established four key norms of political reform, culminating from the debate, dialogue and consensus reached within the framework of the constitutional bodies and legal channels that govern the democratic life of my country. Those reforms will strengthen the Peruvian democratic system through rules on the registration and financing of political parties, on the exercise of internal party democracy, on parity and on alternation in the lists of candidates for the Congress of the Republic.\nIn the 18 months of my Government, we have managed to guide an orderly transition out of that crisis and to directly combat the corruption entrenched in all branches of the State. I lead a democratic Government that fully respects the separation and independence of powers. All our decisions have been, and continue to be, made within the framework of the political Constitution and the legal system. The rule of law, freedom of the press and freedom of expression are unrestricted in my country, as are the autonomy and independence of the judiciary and the Public Ministry to administer justice.\nMy country is currently undergoing a process of change that will allow us to embark on a new phase of growth and development. I must underline that those changes are being made exclusively by democratic means. That is why, to confront a situation of political entrapment that has lasted for three years, we have submitted to the Congress of the Republic a bill on constitutional reform that would advance the general elections in order to shorten the mandate of the executive and legislative branches by one year. That requires an act of detachment on the part of all. I am confident that we will achieve that for the good of the country.\nAfter decades of sustained growth, the Peruvian economy continues to show resilience despite the challenges of the international climate. For that reason, my Government has undertaken participatory and inclusive efforts to address the challenges to development, leading to significant results as reflected in two legal instruments that will be key to Peru\u2019s development \u2014 the national competitiveness and productivity plan and the national infrastructure plan for competitiveness.\nThose instruments include measures to underpin the country\u2019s medium- and long-term growth and constitute a transparent and consensus-based development agenda to bridge key gaps for Peru\u2019s economic and social development. Similarly, they demonstrate the important efforts made by the public and private sectors and the capacity of Peruvians to overcome our differences in order to work for the future of the country and achieve higher levels of well-being.\nThose objectives seek, inter alia, to provide the country with quality infrastructure, strengthen human capital, develop innovation capacities, stimulate a dynamic and competitive labour market, promote foreign trade in goods and services and achieve environmental sustainability.\nI once again reaffirm Peru\u2019s conviction and commitment to democracy and human rights. That commitment has led us to promote and support actions to re-establish the democratic order where it has been broken. I recall in that regard the International Conference for Democracy on Venezuela, which we organized and held in August in our capital city of Lima. The presence of 60 delegations from the five continents illustrated the global concern about a crisis whose impact spills over the national borders of the region.\nThere is no doubt that the rupture of the constitutional order and the entrenchment in power of an illegitimate regime in Venezuela are at the root of the political, institutional and humanitarian crisis that has generated an exodus of more than 4 million people, 900,000 of whom are in Peru. Faced with that crisis, Peru will continue to promote international initiatives and efforts to re-establish democracy in that fraternal country, within the framework of a peaceful process led by Venezuelans, and will continue to condemn serious human rights violations.\nThat International Conference underscored the urgent need to effectively address the humanitarian situation in Venezuela, in particular the enormous resources required to address the Venezuelan exodus, the full extent of which the international community still does not understand. I therefore encourage them to make every effort to reverse that situation.\nPeru aspires to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, as an appropriate universal framework for the promotion of peace, development and human rights. We have initiated national efforts to make them a reality with determination and political courage, especially by engaging women and young people.\nPeru is committed to strengthening the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of national gender equality policies, as well as to incorporating that approach at all levels of public administration. Peru is also a leader in the fight against sexual violence at all levels. In that context, I would like to reiterate our commitment to Goal 5 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which calls on us to join efforts to end all forms of discrimination against women and girls.\nWe are committed to building a peaceful and inclusive country, with transparent and accountable institutions, based on good governance, the head-on fight against corruption and the strengthening of the rule of law, especially in line with Sustainable Development Goal 16. We know from our own experience in Peru that it is possible to transform a country in one generation.\nThe growth of the Peruvian economy in the past 20 years has allowed us to markedly reduce poverty. Today our development policies and their financing are oriented primarily towards education, health and the infrastructure that Peruvians need in order to integrate and compete in global markets under equal conditions. We also promote greater formalization of our economy and the creation of decent employment for all. To that end, we reiterate the importance of promoting the policies of economic and commercial openness and the promotion of the green economy required to involve the private sector in financing sustainable development. In that context, Peru reaffirms its commitment to a rules-based multilateral trading system, as reflected in the World Trade Organization, and encourages everyone to work towards strengthening and improving that organization in order to guarantee the stability, predictability and transparency of the multilateral trading system, for the benefit of all.\nPeru is a country that is particularly vulnerable to climate change and the risk of natural disasters. That is why we have made an ambitious commitment to comply with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We have elaborated a realistic work plan for the next two years, based on technical evidence, with the expectation of being able to improve Peru\u2019s nationally determined contributions by 2020. We have drawn up a road map with 91 adaptation measures and 62 climate-change mitigation measures that incorporate cross-cutting approaches to gender and interculturality, which will allow Peru to reach its nationally determined contributions by 2030.\nAs one of the world\u2019s 10 megadiverse countries, Peru witnesses the serious impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystems, particularly in the Amazon. For that reason, the President of Colombia and I, in my capacity as President of Peru, decided to convene a summit on 6 September with six countries of the region to address the challenges of the fires that have affected the Amazon. The outcome of that meeting was the Leticia Amazon Pact, through which we reaffirm our commitment to conserving the Amazon forests and their sustainable development, while promoting full respect for the rights of the indigenous peoples who inhabit them. We also established an Amazon network to enhance cooperation in the face of natural disasters. I invite other Governments and interested actors, with full respect for the sovereignty of the Amazonian countries, to support us in the implementation of the Pact.\nLikewise, at the national level, we attach special importance to the establishment of priority areas for fighting deforestation, aimed at reducing deforestation in priority areas by 20 per cent by 2021 and by 30 per cent by 2030. We are working on a national adaptation plan that aims to improve the resilience of the population, particularly those most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.\nPeru supports any initiative that would help limit the increase in global temperature. That is why we accept with enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility the invitation extended by the Secretary-General to co-lead the Social and Political Drivers of Climate Action Coalition. Peru is also organizing the first high-level conference on the illegal wildlife trade in the Americas, to be held in Lima on 3 and 4 October, in order to generate commitments and implement actions to combat that illicit trade among the countries of the Americas, while promoting the involvement of key transit and destination countries.\nAll of those actions undoubtedly serve to reaffirm our conviction of the need to create an ambitious global framework for biodiversity beyond 2020, in whose preparatory process Peru has been actively participating.\nPeru\u2019s commitment to international peace and security and multilateralism is reflected both in our work in the Security Council and in our active participation in United Nations peace operations since 1958. We currently have Blue Helmets deployed in six peace operations and aspire to increase that participation in order to continue to offer a source of hope and humanitarian support to thousands of people around the world, particularly the most vulnerable.\nWe therefore welcome the reforms that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has been promoting to strengthen the Organization\u2019s work in the area of peace and security so as to increase the effectiveness and added value of peace operations. As a non-permanent member of the Security Council, Peru has promoted realistic and flexible mandates for peace operations, and we reaffirm our commitment to provide duly trained and disciplined troops who are respectful of host populations, with a progressive increase in the participation of Peruvian women.\nI would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the men and women who have given their lives in the cause of peace over the past year. In particular, I would like to pay tribute to the memory of the Peruvian non-commissioned officer Edwin Augusto Chira Reyes, who died serving in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic.\nIn the Security Council, Peru has constantly sought the unity of its members in order to contribute to the solution of the serious conflicts that are currently taking place in various regions that, in some cases, such as the Middle East, threaten to escalate and seriously jeopardize world peace. We have also prioritized initiatives that seek to limit the serious consequences of those conflicts for the most vulnerable populations, especially women and children, while ensuring respect for international humanitarian law and addressing the root causes of those conflicts. That has been complemented by the priority given to the involvement of women and young people in national processes of preventing and resolving conflict and of peacebuilding.\nIn its capacity as Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, Peru has promoted various efforts to address the scourge of terrorism. We have also fostered a deeper understanding of the nature and scope of the links between international terrorism and organized crime, with a view to identifying and dismantling them, in particular through Security Council resolution 2482 (2019), adopted unanimously during our presidency last July (see S/PV.8582).\nFinally, on behalf of the people and the Government of Peru, I reiterate our firm commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, as well as our conviction that multilateralism is a means of addressing such global problems as climate change, terrorism, the proliferation of weapons, corruption and illicit drug trafficking, among others.\nI assure the General Assembly that Peru will continue to participate constructively and coordinate its efforts with States Members of the United Nations in order to achieve the objectives that motivated the creation of the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of Tuvalu and on my own behalf, I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. Tuvalu has full confidence in your leadership. Let me also take this opportunity to thank Ms. Maria Espinosa Garces, President at the seventy-third session, for a very successful session under her leadership.\nI am honoured to report that Tuvalu has just recently installed a new democratically elected Government. Our honourable Prime Minister therefore sends his warm greetings to this gathering and wishes to convey his regrets that he is not able to attend this General Assembly due to other national commitments.\nI want to express Tuvalu\u2019s heartfelt condolences to the Government and people of the Bahamas for the extensive destruction and the loss of lives caused by Hurricane Dorian. The scale of the damage in the Bahamas and in natural disasters around the world is clear evidence that we are losing the race to save our planet and future generations.\nI also want to express the appreciation of the people and Government of Tuvalu to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Antonio Guterres, for visiting Tuvalu in May this year to see first-hand our extreme vulnerabilities to climate change and to build momentum towards the successful Climate Action Summit, which we all witnessed and participated in earlier this week. Tuvalu wishes to acknowledge his incredible energy and commitment to saving our planet and humanity from the adverse impacts of climate change.\nI congratulate you, Mr. President, on the priority that you have given to multilateralism, poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion by making them the theme of the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly. I am happy that those are the core development issues that my country set out to address in our recent national sustainable development strategy, Te Kakeega III. We have made positive progress in quality education, poverty eradication and health. We do not discriminate with regard to gender and our women have equal access to employment, rates of pay and decision-making processes as men, including political participation.\nAt the regional level, the objectives of your theme are also matched by the development vision of the leaders of our Blue Pacific continent when they met in Tuvalu last month. The outcome of our leaders\u2019 summit, the Pacific Islands Forum Communique and the Kainaki II Declaration for Urgent Climate Action Now, are strategically geared towards the achievement of those same objectives.\nHowever, the adverse impacts of climate change continue to impede our development. In 2014, Cyclone Pam wiped out 60 per cent of our gross domestic product. In 2011, we experienced the worst drought on record. More frequent and more severe cyclones mean repeated rebuilding every year or so. That is an expensive exercise, well beyond the resources and capacities of our small island economies.\nMy country is in the front line of climate change. The rising sea level presents a direct existential threat to my country, which is at no more than 3 metres above the sea level. It has contaminated our groundwater resources. Agriculture is now difficult in most places and the rising temperature is damaging our reefs and fisheries. Our food and water security are severely compromised. A life of fear and uncertainty is becoming our way of life. I know that none of us here would like our children and their grandchildren to live their lives in constant fear and uncertainty.\nA landmark United Nations report released on Wednesday this week predicts that the sea level rise could reach 30 to 60 centimetres by the year 2100 even if countries step up emission cuts and global warming is limited to well below 2\u00b0C. That would affect more than 1 billion people. According to the report, our small island countries will be submerged and uninhabitable.\nWe applaud the determination of our young people to address climate change. We must listen to them as future leaders and as the custodian of our planet and its resources and support their efforts. They deserve a future, just as it was given to us by past generations.\nI wish to acknowledge the Secretary-General\u2019s commitment to the atoll nations in providing assistance to bring young people from Tuvalu so that they could share their stories about living in the most vulnerable part of the world and advocate for their sustainable future. Earlier this week, young people from my country participated in the programmes of the Youth Climate Summit, including hosting a side event. The strong message that they brought to the United Nations is that they want to preserve their cultural identity and traditional knowledge and that moving from their homeland is not an option. Indeed, we are proud of our island nations because they are our own. It is where we have lived for generations and according to our culture.\nOn Wednesday of this week, a report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights on her visit to Tuvalu confirmed the very real risk of climate change to our culture rights. The report said that the very cultural survival of entire peoples may be at stake as never before, undermining all human rights, including cultural rights.\nThe science is very clear, as is and the evidence is also very clear. The 1.5\u00b0C target is no longer enough to save us. A target lower than 1.5\u00b0C is required to save the small island developing States. The target of 2\u00b0C is now irrelevant and a senseless target that will not save our planet and our future generations.\nThe voices of the most affected, who have done the least to cause the harm, such as the voices of Tuvaluans, must be heard loud and clear not just because our survival is at stake but because if the world fails us, it will also fail itself. As Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said during his visit to my country in May of this year, the world must save Tuvalu to avoid the world drowning with Tuvalu.\nWe therefore urge the United Nations process, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to recognize the three recent approved Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special reports on global warming of 1.5\u00b0C, climate change and land, and the ocean in a changing climate.\nFor underdeveloped and small island developing countries, mitigation and adaptation are beyond our capacities and resources. Tuvalu has committed to an ambitious nationally determined contribution target of 100 per cent renewable energy in our electricity generation sector by 2025.That is a very ambitious target for a country that makes a negligible contribution to climate change. It is a target that will address the high price of fuel in our region and contribute to our efforts to achieving sustainable development.\nIn that respect, I wish to extend our deep appreciation to India and France for their initiative on solar energy development, under the International Solar Alliance, and to the European Union, New Zealand, Taiwan, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, Japan and the World Bank for their support as well.\nWe have also set up a climate change survival fund that is regulated by an act of Parliament. The fund allows us to provide immediate relief and assistance to people when natural disasters strike. The Government is the main contributor to the fund and we welcome the contribution of the international community.\nIf we are to win the race against climate change, developed nations must lift the deprived with financial and technical resources. There are enough resources on this planet to meet everyone\u2019s needs. There are technologies available to support a just transition and decent jobs. In many countries, renewable energy is now cheaper than coal and fossil fuel. We therefore have what we need to save our planet. All that we lack is the political commitment, especially of those that are well resourced and better equipped to help. I want to take this opportunity to express my country\u2019s sincere appreciation to countries that have shown a commitment to the 2050 zero emissions target and increased their contributions to the Green Climate Fund.\nI wish to acknowledge the efforts of notable members of the Security Council in bringing climate change to the core of its peace and security agenda. That is a genuine commitment to addressing the single greatest threat to humanity. It is our humble hope that the entire Security Council membership can agree to have climate change as a permanent item on its agenda.\nOur oceans and fisheries are our greatest hope for sustainable development, providing over 50 per cent of our annual national development budget. So the security of our exclusive economic zone is an important national priority. I therefore wish to reaffirm the commitment of our Pacific leaders to developing international law with the aim of ensuring that once a Forum member\u2019s maritime zones are delineated in accordance with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the member\u2019s maritime zones cannot be challenged or reduced as a result of sea level rise and climate change. Our sovereignty cannot be compromised by climate change.\nGenuine and durable partnerships are fundamental to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals. However, the exclusion of as genuine and durable a partner as Taiwan from the United Nations systems denied its 23 million people their fundamental rights to participate in, benefit from and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals. Taiwan is already a responsible and able partner to Tuvalu and many countries around the world and could only do more if it were invited to do so.\nTuvalu strongly supports the Republic of China\u2019s readmission into the United Nations as a founding member of the Organization and its active participation in the United Nations specialized agencies.\nIn a similar manner, the long unilateral economic embargo on Cuba directly constrains the development aspirations of the Cuban people. It neglects the human rights and the spirit of cooperation espoused in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The recent increase in sanctions on remittances directly limits private assistance to communities at the grass-roots level.\nLikewise, the United Nations must engage with the people of West Papua to find lasting solutions to their struggle. I want to acknowledge and welcome the invitation by Indonesia for a mission to West Papua by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nWe must allow the participation of all people in our efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, with their human rights protected, if we are to achieve the 2030 Agenda and leave no one behind.\nAs Members have heard, I have spoken about climate change more than any other part of the theme of our seventy-fourth session. That does not mean that the other objectives of this session\u2019s theme are not important. Multilateralism, poverty eradication, quality education, health and inclusion are very important issues but for a small low-lying island atoll country such as Tuvalu, climate change is also important to our development.\nTo us, climate change is not only an environmental issue. It is an economic, social and cultural issue. It is a survival issue, as well as a human rights one. It affects all factors and sectors of our development, so much so that our sustainable future and survival depend on climate change more than anything else.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate that Tuvalu strongly believes that our collective efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in order to ensure global peace, security and prosperity will be severely compromised unless we are committed to immediate climate change action, as demanded by our youth and young people, and the scientific reports of the IPCC, the authoritative scientific body of the UNFCCC."

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for me to speak from the rostrum of the General Assembly for the first time as President of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The United Nations is a unique and universal organization that protects the needs of humanity and will always continue to do so.\nNext year marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of the Organization, which protects humanity from many challenges and dangers and much bloodshed. Today, the United Nations plays an extremely important role in ensuring global development and the interlinkage of civilizations. Kazakhstan fully supports the idea of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres not to ignore but to acknowledge the fate of every person and every State as our common heritage. However, we have every reason to be concerned about the geopolitical and geoeconomic changes of the present age. This situation will clearly be a complex test for our joint actions to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nIn my view, the alarming new global reality is influenced by the following major trends.\nFirst, a growing number unresolved conflicts and tensions in various parts of the world have revived old dividing lines and created new ones, bringing world Powers to the verge of full-scale military stand-offs.\nSecondly, we all suffer from the lack of trust among global and regional actors. It leads to the erosion of the current security and arms control architecture, resulting in a renewed arms race. Those challenges are aggravated by restrictive sanctions, trade wars, an intense rivalry in space, cybertechnology and artificial intelligence. All of the afore-mentioned represent alarming facets of the deepening fundamental crisis.\nThirdly, the widening social, economic and technological inequalities, growing disparities between the North and the South, together with the emerging global debt crisis, distort the existing world economic landscape. Consequently, we are witnessing the rise of protectionism and nationalistic policies, which undermine international partnerships and cooperation.\nFourthly, environmental degradation has become one of the most destabilizing factors globally. The impact of climate change in Central Asia in particular will result in dramatic existential challenges, such as desertification, the melting of glaciers and the subsequent depletion of drinking and irrigation water. In that complex environment, Kazakhstan firmly pursues a policy of inclusive and sustainable development, comprehensive dialogue and peaceful endeavours.\nAchieving a nuclear-weapon-free world remains a top priority for my country. That aspiration has become an essential part of the nation-wide identity of the Kazakh people, giving us the moral right to be at the forefront of the global movement to eliminate nuclear weapons. That stems from the firm conviction that nuclear weapons are no longer an asset but a danger to global peace and stability.\nUnfortunately, some countries still rely in their strategic defence calculations on nuclear arsenals, prompting their rivals to consider acquiring asymmetric responses but equally deadly types of weapons of mass destruction.\nLeading by example, Kazakhstan works hard to alter such misperceptions. Under the strong leadership of the first President, Mr. Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan closed down the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site and voluntarily renounced the fourth largest nuclear arsenal in the world. Those acts were the first step in our long and successful journey towards a global championship of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.\nAmong our contributions to that noble cause, I would mention the establishment of the unique nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia, hosting the low enriched uranium bank of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the adoption of resolution 64/35, on the International Day against Nuclear Tests, and the recent ratification of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\nWe all should stand resolutely by the Universal Declaration on the Achievement of a Nuclear-Weapon-Free World as our road map to a safer future. We also seek enhanced cooperation among nuclear-weapon-free zones and the creation of new ones.\nKazakhstan believes that the current issues concerning Iran\u2019s Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula should be settled only by political means, with due respect for each other\u2019s interests and concerns.\nMy country has always been a steadfast supporter of preventive diplomacy and mediation on the global stage. As early as in 1992, from this rostrum Kazakhstan\u2019s first President proposed convening the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia (CICA) as a platform for collective approaches to addressing security challenges (see A/47/ PV.24). Over time, CICA has proved its expediency and viability. We are grateful to all our partners who have embraced that process.\nThe growing economic might of Asia demands a more integrated continental security architecture. It is time to transform CICA into a full-fledged regional organization for security and development. As Chair of CICA in 2020, we will put our efforts to that end.\nAs a non-permanent member of the Security Council in the previous two years, we focused on strengthening security, non-proliferation and regional cooperation, affirming our commitment to the cause of peace. Kazakhstan contributes to United Nations peacekeeping by co-deploying with our Indian partners a 120-strong unit to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, as well as by providing military observers.\nWe are also proud that Kazakhstan has become a global centre for the dialogue of religions and civilizations. Since 2003, our capital has been honoured to convene the triennial Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, supported by the United Nations.\nAll of us are observing with alarm the developments in the Middle East, the cradle of human civilization, which is plagued by mutual hatred and violence. We therefore stand ready to support bilateral and multilateral actions aimed at finding viable peace and confidence-building solutions.\nAs a good example of our commitment to inclusive dialogue, Kazakhstan provides a platform for inter-Syrian negotiations. Thirteen such rounds have taken place in our capital. Thanks to the Astana process, which complements the Geneva talks, a cessation of hostilities has been reached. The de-escalation zones, with conditions for the safe return of refugees, have also been established.\nWe all know that conflicts are devastating and give rise to terrorism and extremism. Those challenges can be defeated only by joint actions through a global anti-terrorism network under the auspices of the United Nations. As a counter-terrorism measure, Kazakhstan initiated the code of conduct towards achieving a world free of terrorism by the United Nations centenary in 2045, and we urge others to join it.\nThis year, Kazakhstan successfully accomplished a special humanitarian mission called Zhusan in cooperation with our international partners. As a result, 595 Kazakh citizens trapped by terrorist propaganda, including 406 children, returned home from the war zones in Syria. We are ready to share our experience with other countries and urge them to take similar actions.\nFor decades, the Central Asian States had weak economic ties, which impeded their sustainable growth. Now, by sharing common interests and challenges, our region has entered the next stage of its development. In that respect, close and constructive political dialogue among all five regional countries will be instrumental for trade, economic, investment and people-to-people interaction. New opportunities have emerged for the region following the first informal consultations at the highest level held in our capital last year.\nI am fully convinced that Central Asia is becoming a global stakeholder. We are strongly united by our common historic and cultural heritage, as well as by our common future. Kazakhstan, as the largest economy of Central Asia, has a vital interest in further strengthening mutually beneficial cooperation among all States. The situation in Afghanistan has a direct impact on our region. We hope that the Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process, assisted by all key stakeholders, will produce lasting peace and prosperity for this country. Kazakhstan will continue to support the Afghan people in rebuilding their nation. Enduring global and regional partnerships, long-term investments and regional connectivity are vital to securing the peaceful future of that nation.\nThe United Nations ability to deliver on its core mission faces a serious test. The bold and clear vision of the Secretary-General on United Nations reform therefore deserves the wide support of all Member States. We pay special attention to the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as we strive to avoid the notorious middle-income country trap, and as the Goal 8 targets for Sustainable Development are integrated by 80 per cent into our strategic Government programmes. This May, I opened a new building for international organizations in Kazakhstan; it hosts 16 United Nations agencies. As the next step, we propose to establish on its premises a United Nations centre for the Sustainable Development Goals with the mandate of assisting Afghanistan and countries in Central Asia. Being one of the largest transit and transport territories in Eurasia, Kazakhstan is set to play a pivotal role in promoting transcontinental trade as a member of the Eurasian Economic Union and a reliable partner of the One Belt-One Road initiative.\nIn these challenging times, we shall continue to work towards the comprehensive transformation of our society under the motto \u201cContinuity, justice, progress\u201d. My formula for Kazakhstan\u2019s political system is one of a strong and visionary president, an influential Parliament and accountable Government. I firmly believe that this concept meets the basic needs of our nation and ensures its peaceful and sustainable future. As the new President, I am committed first and foremost to building a modern welfare State. My ultimate goal is to ensure that millions of my fellow countrymen benefit from large-scale reform and enjoy an inclusive society, a robust economy, high quality education and advanced health care. Kazakhstan will not become a success story of socioeconomic development unless profound political transformation is accomplished. At the same time, one should keep in mind that democracy in Kazakhstan is a work in progress, requiring regular scrutiny. We are constantly looking for a way to improve it by building on the positive and learning from the negative experiences.\nAs part of my agenda, I launched the National Council of Public Confidence to promote meaningful dialogue between Government and society. My vision is based on the concept of different opinions, but one nation. It is through the exchange of views and dialogue that we should move forward. Big changes will drive all law enforcement agencies and courts to uphold the rule of law in every sphere and in the everyday lives of our citizens. Populism is about mediocre policy. I am in a position not to make empty promises, but to pursue concrete deeds. I will be steadfast in implementing my reform agenda.\nNext year, the United Nations family will mark an important milestone in its history. That occasion should provide a new impetus for our joint endeavours in promoting comprehensive international cooperation in order to put an end to animosity, distrust and militancy. I call on the international community and all our partners to get together to strengthen the world\u2019s momentum towards security, cooperation and mutual trust. We all must take care of our future generations so as to ensure their just and meaningful engagement in developing a new economy and new technologies. We must take care of the environment, promote scientific development and ensure health care and education for all. The destiny of our future generations deserves to be much better than what it is now in this fragile world. As a responsible member of the global community, Kazakhstan will not cease to contribute to the collective action of promoting peace and advancing human rights, dignity and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I have the pleasure to convey to His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande my congratulations for his elections as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session; I also thank Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her efforts as President of the Assembly at the seventy-third session. In addition, I commend Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his efforts.\nI had hoped to talk today about the efforts made by my country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a founding member of the United Nations, aimed at fulfilling the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, namely, to preserve peace and security for the peoples of the world, achieve prosperity, growth and stability in our region, and pursue noteworthy development and humanitarian action worldwide. I had also hoped to review such economic and social challenges facing our world as poverty, climate change, the spread of diseases and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, while highlighting the Kingdom\u2019s positions, perspectives and actions in those areas. I had hoped as well to talk about my country\u2019s ongoing economic development and reforms in various fields, its vision that is seeking to take us back to our true Islamic faith, which rejects extremism in all its forms, and its vision of achieving an advanced and innovative society in all areas, connected and engaged with the world around it and beyond.\nHowever, what I would like to talk about in the General Assembly today is the dangerous and aggressive act that took place on 14 September, which violates the purposes and principles set forth in the United Nations Charter and which threatens the security, stability and prosperity of our region and the world. This dangerous and aggressive act requires that each of us takes a historic stance. This is the subject of my address today.\nThe reprehensible attacks by 25 cruise missiles and drones against the oil facilities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia cut oil production by nearly half, an amount equivalent to 5.7 million barrels per day. These attacks constitute a flagrant violation of international laws and customs, an affront to international peace and security and a significant threat to global oil supplies. Let me repeat that: they constitute a flagrant violation of international laws and customs, an affront to international peace and security and a significant threat to global oil supplies.\nWe know very well who stood behind that act of aggression, and have invited international experts from the United Nations, and other entities, to investigate and confirm this knowledge. Those who authored the bombings are also responsible for the assaults on commercial tankers in the Gulf of Oman in June and July, the attacks on Abha airport in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in July and the Shabwa oilfield in Yemen in August. That same regime hides behind its militias in the most miserable and cowardly manner, holding them responsible for the attacks on Abqaiq and Khurais and, prior to those attacks, on Saudi oil- pumping facilities. The regime in question looks on our States and our peoples as a mere context for enacting its destructive agenda.\nWe have known that regime quite well for some 40 years. Its only strength is masterminding explosions, destruction and assassinations, not only in our region but throughout the world. Ever since its inception, this regime has carried out terrorist acts in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon, various European countries and beyond. It assassinated a number of Saudi diplomats in Thailand in 1989 and 1990, and was responsible for the assassination of a Saudi diplomat in Karachi in 2011. May they all rest in peace. In addition, in that same year, the regime tried to assassinate our Ambassador to the United States. It was this regime that assassinated the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafiq Hariri, in the heart of Beirut in 2005. Sadly, the regime in question has continued to operate in this manner to this day. In recent years, we have seen it try to carry out terrorist attacks in Denmark and France, and not a day goes by without violent acts being committed under its auspices in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East region.\nThe most recent attacks have exposed the nature of the Iranian regime to the entire world. We are dealing with a rogue terrorist regime that is threatening international peace and security, as well as energy supplies and the world economy. The recent attacks are a real test of the international community\u2019s will.\nThe United Nations and the international community as a whole have a historic moral responsibility to take a firm and unified position with regard to Iran. They should apply utmost pressure and use every tool at their disposal to end the aggressive terrorist behaviour of the Iranian regime. Half-measures and partial or interim agreements will not suffice; efforts must be made to change the nature and behaviour of the rogue Iranian regime. Otherwise, peace and security in our region and across the globe, as well as the stability of the world\u2019s economy and energy security, will be left to an unknown fate.\nOver the past century, we have seen how policies of appeasement can lead to death and destruction all over the world. In the case of Iran, appeasement policies have led to partial agreements with the regime, and in the past four years have merely invited it to continue or expand its aggressive terrorist activities. The Iranian regime must be confronted by an international community with a unified and resolute stance that can apply maximum pressure until Iran abandons terrorism altogether. We must all confront the Iranian regime realistically and with an awareness of its well-known nature, rather than on the basis of illusions or assumptions that have repeatedly been proved wrong. The truth is that the bloodthirsty Iranian regime poses a threat not just to the peoples of the region but to the security of the whole world. It is a mistake to believe that reaching partial agreements with a view to lifting sanctions, or returning to previous failed agreements, will put the Iranian regime on a path to moderating its actions and ridding the world of its evil.\nAnyone who needs proof of the failure of the nuclear deal should look to the crimes committed by the Iranian regime in Syria, which have claimed more than half a million Syrian lives. The Iranian regime has participated in their murder, either directly or through its agents and its support for militias such as the terrorist organization Hizbullah. Anyone who needs further proof should take a look at the wreckage of the more than 250 ballistic missiles that have been fired at citizens of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The United Nations has recognized that those missiles were provided by the Iranian regime to the militias it sponsors in Yemen, in blatant violation of Security Council resolutions 2216 (2015) and 2231 (2015). Anyone who needs further proof should look at the party that is responsible for obstructing a peaceful settlement of the situation in Yemen, violating international resolutions, targeting civilians, threatening maritime navigation in vital waterways and preventing humanitarian access. The rogue Iranian regime has used the revenues it has obtained from the implementation of the nuclear deal to finance its aggressive terrorist activities. It is therefore incumbent on the international community to cut off the regime\u2019s sources of financing, which will be the best and most peaceful way to compel it to renounce its militias, stop developing ballistic missiles and end its destabilizing activities in the region and around the world.\nIt is now up to us to assume this historic responsibility. The credibility of the United Nations and the entire world is at stake. The Iranian regime must be forced to choose between two options \u2014 become a normal State that respects international laws and norms or face a united international front of pressure and deterrence. My country \u2014 the land of the two Holy Mosques and the place to which Muslims turn to pray \u2014 has never been a proponent of war, but it will not hesitate to defend its holy sites and sovereignty if it has to.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me congratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. He can count on Finland\u2019s strong support in his work to guide this important organ. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his tireless efforts in leading the United Nations.\nI have been glad to note how the new President of the General Assembly has stressed a trust deficit as a key concern for the world today. I could not agree more. I believe trust to be a central prerequisite for any functioning community \u2014 local or national, regional or global. Without trust, even the best of institutions cannot deliver. Without trust in institutions, we are less capable of acting together to address the challenges of the future; without trust in a sustainable future, we will not trust each other. That vicious cycle needs to be broken.\nFirst, let me begin with trust in a sustainable future. Crucial questions concerning that trust are at the heart of two major summits here in New York this week \u2014 one on sustainable development in general and another on climate action in particular. Under both headings, we already have the framework for the transformation we need. And yet, despite our joint commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement, the results are far too meagre. Recent reports show that we are not nearly on track to achieve the goals that we set together. The inability to keep our promises on matters of this magnitude will inevitably erode trust \u2014 the trust of citizens in their leaders, to be sure, but also trust among generations and, above all, our collective trust in our common future. Nothing less than the fate of our planet is at stake.\nFor yesterday\u2019s Climate Action Summit, the Secretary-General asked us to come with a plan, not with a speech. Indeed, a good plan is already more concrete than a speech, but that is only the beginning. In order to build trust in our common future what we really need are results \u2014 deeds, not just promises; and action, not just targets. The pressing need for action applies to all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Still, Goal 13, \u201cTake urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\u201d, stands out as the most urgent. The rapidly growing impact of climate change also makes achieving the other SDGs more difficult.\nThe scientific evidence on climate change has long been clear, but it is no longer just a question for the future. Climate change is already here in the form of melting glaciers, large-scale forest fires and extreme weather events across the globe from the Arctic to the Amazon. Even if we were able to end all of our carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow, we would have to live for decades to come with the climate change we have already caused. We are no longer able to completely avoid the climate crisis.\nWe also have to achieve concrete results in adapting to the inevitable, although that should not distract us from what we can do to prevent further damage. We all have to accelerate our efforts, reduce our emissions and increase our carbon sinks. We cannot afford to wait for others to move first. The climate crisis calls for leaders, not just followers.\nAs for Finland, we have recently set ourselves new climate targets. The Finnish Government is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2035 and to be carbon negative soon after that. We have already decided to ban the use of coal for energy by 2029 and we will stop using fossil fuel for heating by 2030. We are rightly proud of those targets, but targets are just the beginning. Only verifiable results matter and only concrete deeds serve as a credible example to others.\nI would like to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to one example. Finland and Chile are co-chairing the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, while the Helsinki principles of the Coalition are driving the systematic change we need with concrete deeds and the powerful tools of finance ministers \u2014 taxation and budgeting, public investment and procurement. When those instruments work for climate action, the prospects for a carbon-neutral world are much better. There are now 40 committed members in the Coalition and we warmly welcome new ones.\nSecondly, I want to raise the issue of trust in institutions. We have all seen how rapidly that trust has evaporated in recent years. The whole concept of multilateralism is increasingly under threat \u2014 from the competition among great Powers and from a lack of respect for existing agreements. The entire rules-based order is endangered. Passively complaining about the crisis of multilateralism will not help; instead, we have to become more active and determined in defending it.\nTrust in institutions is ours to rebuild and the international order is ours to shape. We, together, are the United Nations. The United Nations as an Organization also bears a responsibility in that regard. It has to show that it deserves the trust of its Members. Finland has steadfastly supported the Secretary-General in his reform agenda. Again, the results are what matters.\nThe disappearing trust in institutions and regimes is particularly dangerous in the field of arms control. On nuclear weapons, we are actually losing the last elements of control altogether. With the collapse of the INF Treaty and the uncertain future of the New START Treaty, the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons next year is now of utmost importance.\nWe should also be able to address other weapons of mass destruction, conventional weapons and completely new weapon technologies. We can only manage those challenges together. Finland therefore fully supports the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to bring the disarmament agenda back to the core of the United Nations.\nThirdly and to conclude, I will turn to trust in each other. Trust among States and trust among individuals is the fundamental basis for peace and security. In the absence of trust, the potential for conflict grows and once conflicts have erupted, their resolution always requires rebuilding trust. It is our collective duty to seek solutions to the many ongoing wars and conflicts in the Middle East, Africa, Ukraine and elsewhere. Of at least equal importance is preventing new conflicts from breaking out in the first place. Finland has always emphasized the value of dialogue in its own diplomatic relations. We are also happy to provide our good offices to assist others.\nTrust in each other is also closely linked to equality between genders and among generations. The future of our planet lies on the shoulders of today\u2019s young women and men. The inclusion of women and young people in peace processes, conflict prevention and mediation has proven to be decisive. We are approaching the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the most progressive policy documents ever for advancing the rights of women. Unfortunately, there is not much cause for celebration.\nWe are deeply worried to see that sexual and reproductive health and rights are now being questioned. Finland remains strongly committed to advancing the rights of women. Respect for universal human rights is the key to a peaceful and just world. Finland strongly believes in multilateral cooperation on human rights, with the Human Rights Council as its cornerstone. Accordingly, we have announced Finland\u2019s candidacy for the Human Rights Council for the period from 2022 to 2024.\nAs the United Nations nears its seventy-fifth anniversary, the Organization may well be more important than ever. Our shared global problems cry out for shared global solutions. Together we are also better able to seize new global opportunities, and there is no organization better placed to lead that work than the United Nations. In order to unleash its full potential, it is our responsibility to reduce the trust deficit.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour to address the General Assembly today as the President of Georgia. Georgia is a small country on the edge of Europe that for the past 28 years has experienced quite a few shocks and transformations \u2014 recovering its independence, opening its borders, the first wave of globalization, shifting to a market economy and enduring open or protracted conflicts, war and occupation. At the same time, despite all of those things, Georgia is among the democratic countries of the world that enjoy economic and social development, and it remains one of the main islands of stability in a complex region.\nWe are a country with a small population, and we know very well the price of solidarity. Given our location, we know that we are an integral part of a region where, without peace, global challenges cannot and will not be overcome. We are also fully conscious that the destiny of the planet is also our destiny.\nGeorgia, like all present here, faces the global challenges that confronting today\u2019s world \u2014 climate change, biodiversity loss, universal and accessible health, education for all, and overcoming poverty, unemployment and inequalities. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are all essential to tackle those challenges. They provide the path towards a radical transformation in both the way we look at the world and our behaviour patterns. The only way to overcome global challenges is to see and treat them as a whole \u2014 a complex, multifaceted threat, but doing so is far from easy. The world is much more complex than that, and so are the answers that we must find to those challenges. We need more systemic approaches and holistic thinking.\nGeorgia will spare no effort in working towards the 2030 Agenda\u2019s SDGs, together with all actors in society, be they public or private, together with our neighbours and partners, because solidarity and joint effort will be key for success. That is why we are here all here today, and that is why we believe in the necessary conciliation between sovereignty and multilateralism.\nWhile looking towards 2030 and with the determination to achieve our common goals, there are some more immediate challenges that we must overcome in order to succeed. We need new thoughts. We must dare, experiment and develop new options. We can no longer be afraid of initiative.\nWhat is true for the world and is true for Georgia. Our leading challenge, and thus our priority, is peace \u2014 the ultimate goal of every society \u2014 but it is the very essence and the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations. Global security is a global challenge. Wars, conflicts and terrorism pose a clear and massive threat to the lives of millions of citizens and provoke mass migrations and hordes of refugees.\nWe share the grief of the families of the victims of terrorism. We understand their fear and anger. And we will play our part in the common fight against that invisible enemy. Georgia is therefore a substantial contributor to peace missions, whether yesterday in Iraq or today in Afghanistan, whether in Mali or the Central Africa Republic, far from our borders but close to us in our duty of solidarity.\nWar and conflict have been part of our history. For centuries, Georgia has suffered numerous invasions by numerous invaders. Tbilisi, our capital city, has been burned down 26 times, while parts of our territory have been occupied for short or long periods, and its religion and identity have been actively suppressed at different times. Yet Georgia has survived, and today we proudly remain on the map of independent sovereign democratic countries. We responded with the same resilience in confronting the tragic war of 2008, which led to the occupation of 20 per cent of our territory by Russia.\nAs President of Georgia, I must speak out here on the plight of our people living on the administrative boundary line that divides relatives and villages, where incidents and provocations have become constant and where illegal demarcation is actively pursued, preventing a normal, peaceful life for our citizens. I have to speak out for our citizens living in the occupied territories of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali, who are subjected to continuous human rights violations and restrictions of their freedom of movement and access to health and education services. The crossing points to both regions are periodically closed, causing immense humanitarian suffering.\nI have to speak out and warn the world \u2014 in occupied Abkhazia not only the Georgian language but also the Abkhaz language, which the Georgian Constitution recognizes and I must defend as the President of Georgia, as well as the Abkhaz identity, are on the verge of disappearance. Abkhazian people are suffering a drastic demographic reduction. I must warn the Assembly: a world without the Abkhazian language, identity and traditions will be a much poorer place. We must all unite to protect and save that rich cultural diversity, which led the Arabs to refer to the Caucasus as the mountain of languages.\nI have to speak out for our internally displaced persons and refugees, who for decades now have been unable to return to their homes and lands.\nOur response to the tragedy of war and occupation has been multifaceted. Our response has been to preserve peace and development by keeping our word and respecting to the letter our commitments under the ceasefire agreement of 2008. Hence we have no military forces whatsoever close to the occupation line, and Georgia has unilaterally renounced the use of force.\nOur response has been to extend our hand through the Step to a Better Future peace initiative, which allows citizens from the occupied territories access, whenever they are not prevented from exercising it, to enjoy health and education services, share in business opportunities and take part \u2014 even if, alas, only marginally \u2014 in Georgia\u2019s economic development.\nOur response has been openness and tolerance. Last year, for instance, we received 1,500,000 Russian tourists without any incident being reported.\nOur response has been to stay the course on our determined path of economic and democratic development, and not to let anything divert us from our ambitions and concrete goals of European and Euro-Atlantic integration. We have managed to make remarkable progress on all those fronts without ever changing course or restricting our efforts, and always with a clear vision of our destiny. That has been, to some extent, our peaceful victory over war and occupation, tragedy and destruction.\nWhen we talk about the goal of peace and ending conflict and occupation, however, we must also act. We need movement and diplomacy. We have renounced the use of force but we have not renounced dialogue. We are resilient but we are not reconciled and resigned to the status quo. We need to make change happen, and that is what we cannot do alone. We need the engagement of all towards the objective of sustainable peace in the region.\nWe must enhance the political dimension of the existing formats for dialogue in order to at last to allow discussions on substance. We need to move from expert discussions to genuine political negotiations. Political will is needed on all sides to make the Geneva format, for instance, an instrument for solving the conflict and not solely managing it. Political will is needed to invent, if necessary, new formats.\nEvery forum and dialogue, formal or informal, should be used to engage Russia in discussions on the strict implementation of the ceasefire agreement and on allowing the European Union Monitoring Mechanism, as was agreed, to monitor all Georgian territory, because de-escalation along the line of occupation is our top priority, which would then pave the way towards an effective settlement. It should also be very clear that new conflicts should not cause us to forget older ones, for that would be a destructive message and peace is not divisible.\nPeace is not challenged only by war, but also and increasingly by a new internal threat that is gradually affecting all our States and societies. Polarization, the erosion of civil values and of mutual respect, hate speech, fake news and conspiracy theories are creating a black hole that is undermining the fabric of our society and eroding the foundations of democracy. The answer is there, in front of us \u2014 we must revive our traditional values. Tolerance is one essential value; pluralism is only an empty word if it does not mean respect for the ideas of others.\nGeorgia, which has for centuries been a model for religious, ethnic and cultural tolerance and openness, could be at the forefront of a battle that must involve us all. International society must be made of free citizens and healthy societies. We cannot achieve anything \u2014 let alone the SDGs \u2014 if we are weakened from within, divided and fighting each other. That is my appeal to Georgians, but not only to Georgians.\nOvercoming poverty has been the leading concern for Georgian Governments. Georgia is on the right path to sustainable growth, striving to modernize and raise our economy to international standards so that it can take its place in world markets and make better use of its unique standing between the European and Asian markets to which it has free access.\nYet we need to do more. Education and the acquisition of skills are key to overcoming unemployment and poverty \u2014 they are not only the fundamental right of any human being but a vital condition for the sustainable development of any country. Ensuring quality and affordable education is one of the main priorities of Georgia today, and a key objective of national development. That priority is not only a matter of words but is also backed by numbers in the budget, which plans to bring the share of education to 6 per cent of gross domestic product by 2022. We have undertaken a number of reforms aimed at transforming our education system to raise free citizens who will be competitive on the international platform.\nScience and technology research and innovation are the basis for our future development, and we attach great importance to the internationalization of education through cooperation with leading European and American institutions and by opening our doors to foreign students. Georgian students are eager to become part of the larger world, and 3,600 students have taken part in the European Erasmus programme.\nMigration has become our common plight, generating widespread fear and anxiety. Some countries fear a future decline because they are losing their vitality, their brains and their younger generations to the outside world. Others, seeing foreign migrants arriving en masse, fear that those newcomers will take natives\u2019 jobs and dilute their national identity. Some migrants are legally moving to countries with better opportunities; most are illegal and looking for what they cannot find in their home countries, which they are fleeing primarily because of war, destruction or persecution.\nIn addition, climatic changes are on the verge of producing a massive new category of migrants, who will leave territories turning to deserts, flooded by rising seas or destroyed by hurricanes or fires. On this issue, too, the answer must be global. States need to find common approaches to regulate what cannot be stopped.\nGeorgia, today facing both emigration and immigration, in addition to its 300,000 internally displaced persons, is actively looking for solutions. Reducing illegal migration is necessary to preserve one of the most precious benefits of our European integration process \u2014 visa liberalization. Beyond better controls at the borders, which are needed and are under way, but short of reinstating a strict visa procedure, there are solutions. One is to increase the standards of living and bringing to our country social protection, job security and the quality of life that most emigrants are seeking elsewhere. Georgia sees its European integration path as the most direct way to that end, and we are on that road.\nThe second path is to regulate the flows, by bilateral or multilateral agreements among States, to allow for legal and temporary employment in fields of mutual interest. Georgia is actively working to develop agreements on circular migration with its main partners. Uncontrolled and unregulated migration will remain a factor of major disruption that could affect peace and stability, but managed and regulated migrations can become assets for better mutual understanding and communication among cultures and civilizations, and vectors for more tolerance and mutually enriching experiences.\nI represent a country which, by mythology, is linked it to health and medicine through Medea, the goddess of medicine. It is therefore not surprising that we traditionally attach significant value to health. Nor is it surprising that we have produced outstanding doctors who practice throughout the world. Georgia is increasingly becoming a destination for health tourism because of its numerous thermal resorts, which are being modernized.\nWe share the core principle that health is the inalienable right of every human being, which means providing universal and affordable access to quality health services. That inalienable right is threatened today by the rising cost of treatments and medicines. In today\u2019s world, we are curing ever more illnesses and medicine makes incredible miracles possible, but the costs are rising exponentially, challenging social budgets, public services and individual resources.\nGeorgia has made the political choice to move towards a universal health coverage system and tripled health allocations across all sectors. Today, 90 per cent of our population has access to essential primary-care services. We have also attained notable progress in the fields of maternal and child health, tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS has almost been eradicated. We have successfully implemented a hepatitis C eradication programme with the support of the United States Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and private partners, thereby setting a global precedent for nationwide chronic-illness eradication through treatment. That is major cause of hope.\nWe still have significant challenges to overcome but I am proud that just two weeks ago we announced the launch of a centre for paediatric oncology, with the support of the United States Agency for International Development. We hope that this project will be the basis for international cooperation in Georgia.\nClimate change, it is clear to us all, affects every individual and every country. We are already directly feeling its effects and we understand our responsibility to act to preserve our planet so our children have a place to live. Some territories are being turned into deserts, flooded by rising seas or destroyed by hurricanes, as we have just witnessed, or fires.\nGeorgia, as a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is fully committed to the objectives of the Convention and endorses the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Georgia therefore updated its nationally determined contribution, in parallel with the elaboration of a climate action plan for the 2021-2030 period, ensuring that in 2030 greenhouse gas emissions will remain at 40 per cent below the level recorded in 1990. The Climate Action Summit demonstrated the momentum and showed the potential to leap forward by giving the climate community more ambitious measures for implementing the Paris Agreement.\nGeorgia, like many small countries, does not have industries that produce greenhouse gases, but like any other State we are feeling the impact and adapting. We aim to build a climate-resilient Georgia and to reduce climate-driven losses.\nGeorgia today represents a unique reservoir of biodiversity of fauna and flora, with a great number of endemic species. We are conscious that this unique geographic situation and our unique biodiversity must be preserved for the future of our planet. We are therefore developing an integrated climate policy process, led by the Interministerial Committee on Climate Change, and putting in place climate-friendly incentives in the energy sector, as well as green-economy and energy- efficiency policies.\nPrevention is key. It is true that we cannot control the weather, but there is nothing inevitable about natural disasters. What is more, by helping local communities to understand and reduce disaster risk, Georgia is strengthening a culture of resilience that is a core value of democracy and self-government.\nFinally, we cannot fight together if we do not share the same basic values. One of these is democracy. It is what allows for the full involvement, responsibility and commitment of each and every citizen in this global war we are embarking upon against global threats.\nIt has been 28 years since Georgia chose to become a democratic country again, as it was during its first period of independent. Gradually, we have shifted from being a presidential Republic to a parliamentary system. We have moved through peaceful transitions of power to an ever more transparent and open electoral system. The adoption of a fully proportional system for the upcoming 2020 parliamentary elections may even result in a coalition Government. Pluralistic and vivid media has become a reality in today\u2019s Georgia. Reporters Without Borders ranks Georgia 60th, which represents robust progress from our 104th ranking of a few years ago. The most recent decision of the Strasbourg European Court of Human Rights reinforces property rights, including in the media sector, and has resulted in more pluralism.\nThe new Constitution, adopted last year, reaffirms the strict principle of the separation of powers, guarantees all fundamental rights and sets a high standard by introducing a large set of new social rights, making it one of the most progressive Constitutions of the world \u2014 as was the 1921 Constitution of Georgia, which contained early recognition of the right of women to vote and be elected. Five women participated in the first Constituent Assembly. Georgia was the first country to elect a Muslim woman to office. Today, I am among 11 women Presidents in the world, and the first in our region.\nGeorgia is now embarked on the fourth wave of judicial reforms, which aims at ensuring a higher standard of independence in the judiciary and building public confidence in the court system. This stage is the most delicate and the one for which we need increased support and assistance from partners. Progress has already been made and can be measured. The number of complaints submitted by Georgian citizens to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has decreased 11-fold over the past six years, from 4,453 to 415. Georgia is ranked 41st out of 126 States in the Rule of Law Index 2019.\nBeyond the law adopted in 2014 on the elimination of all forms of discrimination, we are also taking important steps towards ensuring equality and safety in labour relations, employment and occupation and prohibiting sexual harassment, as well as developing the code on the rights of the child, fully aligned with the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nTo conclude, 50 years ago we had a dream and humankind landed on the moon. We shall not forget how difficult that was in terms of human, financial and scientific resources and sacrifices \u2014 and we faced those challenges. But today, we have a new challenge, a new dream. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is probably the most ambitious global agenda humankind has ever designed. It could be summed up by a simple message \u2014 come back to Earth. We have inherited one planet and it is where Georgians want to live, peacefully. We all have to remember that we have only one life to live and only one planet to save.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the people of El Salvador, who have given me the honour and responsibility to stand before the Assembly from this rostrum in my capacity as President, I am pleased to address this audience for the first time.\nJust a moment, if I may, I am going to take a picture. To be here before the Assembly during the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly is a privilege and an honour that I wanted to share with the world, because the world, the new world, is no longer in this General Assembly but rather where that photo will go \u2014 the world\u2019s largest network, where billions of people are connected almost all the time and in every facet of life.\nBelieve me, many more people will see that selfie than will hear this statement. I hope it came out good. Even if we do not want to accept it, that network is increasingly becoming the real world and the format the Assembly uses is increasingly becoming obsolete. We have heard many good ideas and interesting speeches, but really, the way we have been speaking here has not changed in 74 years. The world has changed, yet the General Assembly remains the same.\nPerhaps in a few years, tens of thousands of people will not have to travel to New York to gather in this building, when a series of videoconferences would have cost several hundred million dollars less, and I am certain that they would have practically the same effect and impact.\nIn addition, the people who come here would not have to leave their families, friends, lives and daily responsibilities to come to a series of meetings to which fewer and fewer people pay attention. I imagine that some will think that what I am saying does not make sense; but they should ask their children or grandchildren when they leave this meeting \u2014 they will likely use an app on their smartphones do to that \u2014 what gets their attention. It is not that the United Nations or its General Assembly is obsolete \u2014 although if we do not embrace change we may very well become obsolete \u2014 but rather that we still have a major opportunity to take advantage of that great network that is being built before our very eyes, not only to save our relevance but also to multiply it exponentially.\nOn the other hand, all of us \u2014 the United Nations system, Governments, politicians, etcetera \u2014 could ignore those changes and wait for what happened to Kodak, Blockbuster, the dinosaurs and the Teen Choice Awards, or what will happen to many of the big retail stores, hotels, travel agencies, cable companies and political parties and is also happening to many media outlets, to happen to us. A big TV crew to shoot interviews is no longer needed, let alone sophisticated equipment. Look at the iPhone 11 or the new Samsung S10 \u2014 even movies can be filmed with them. Why do we continue to do things the way we have always done them?\nFor that very reason, I have the opportunity to be here with those present, because we, the people of El Salvador, are tired of following the obsolete way of doing things; it does not work. We have decided to do things differently and I believe that the United Nations should think of doing the same. What should we should do as an international community? We should not rescue the format of the Assembly, because it is too late; it has become obsolete. We must accept that the world has change and that it is always changing, although here we continue on with the General Assembly just as we did 74 years ago, without really accepting the inevitable.\nThe digital revolution is becoming a human revolution in which, just as each country at the United Nations has a vote whether large or small, each citizen of the world has a voice that is magnified thanks to social networks. Consequently, there are no longer 195 voices representing 7 billion human beings, but rather billions of human beings representing themselves.\nThe United Nations still has a strong ability to bring people together, but it does so in traditional terms that weaken that capacity and each year it gets weaker. All the statements delivered by the Heads of State in the Assembly throughout this week will have less impact than a video of a famous YouTuber. I bet that one of those videos on YouTube has more views than all our speeches put together.\nThat new reality does not mean that we are not relevant; in fact, there are still unique resources here \u2014 economic and important resources for solving the world\u2019s biggest problems. It is the format that is obsolete. As we have seen and experienced in many countries, a couple of images on Instagram or a few YouTube videos can have a much more powerful impact than any speech in the Assembly, even from the most powerful countries in the world. An image uploaded by a citizen can spark a revolution \u2014 and in fact that has already happened.\nIt is time for us to become more inclusive and to accept and recognize that we can be in every country, every hour of the day, every day. It is time to start a quest for a format that invites the collective mass of all the countries of the world to participate, without having to be present here physically in New York. Why do we not change that format to make it more inclusive of the world\u2019s citizens? Why do we not post a 15-minute video of each of us to an online General Assembly platform so that all the representatives of the countries can see it on demand, when it is convenient for them and the important things that they are doing, which require attention in their countries, are not interrupted?\nHow many of those present watch live TV? How many read the paper copy of a newspaper? They should ask their children, or grandchildren if they have them, that same question, or even my 20-year-old daughter. We can imagine the answer. Spending one week at the United Nations when we could be solving issues in our countries will therefore become a waste of time. Our cell phones are the future of the General Assembly. Why then do we not give the young people of the world the opportunity to propose new ideas, those young people who are ambitious to change the world by breaking out of the paradigms that imprisoned the previous century? In fact, they are already doing it; we are just not listening to them. We are not making the most of the amount of resources we have to do this.\nAre those of us here today, supposedly representing those new generations, really doing so? Do we really represent the young people of today, the populations of our countries? We must give the floor to our millions of citizens \u2014 whether millennial, centennials or people of any age \u2014 so that they can offer solutions to the issues of poverty, hunger, climate change and disease, and so on. Why not organize a contest of ideas in order to further galvanize and motivate the young people of the world? We suggest awarding a prize to those whose proposals give us the key to solving the great problems the planet faces, such as energy supply, drought, poverty, hunger, climate change and the many other problems we face.\nWe have so many resources available to us that it would be a mere drop in the ocean if our Organization were to grant a prize of $10 million to each young person who managed to solve those problems with their ideas. Imagine how much we would save and how much we would achieve if we only opened our minds. We would open a Pandora\u2019s box of the collective creativity of billions of human beings and billions of brains thinking at the speed of light, connected at the speed of light and finding solutions to the problems that we have not been able to solve in that archaic format.\nIt is 2019 and, for obvious reasons, we have more technology at our disposal than ever before in the history of humankind. Do we truly believe that, by doing the same as we have always done, we will be able solve the problems that we have only made worse? Perhaps some, or indeed many, of those problems that we have been unable to solve could be solved by a millennial who thinks outside the box.\nIn a few years \u2014 perhaps no more than 10 \u2014 everything I am speaking about now will be happening in reality, but why not start now? Why not begin creating a platform where that new way of thinking for the General Assembly of the United Nations is precisely the mechanism for change and evolution? We must accept the inevitable irrelevance of the Assembly\u2019s current format; we must accept what does not work and start to do things differently now. What I am trying to explain is that the process of that new way of thinking has already begun. All the young people who are listening to me are doing so from their smartphones and those who are taking what I say seriously will already be thinking about how to make the changes that our planet needs.\nThat new way of doing things, in the sphere of public policy, has already been successful in many places. In my own country, El Salvador, where the number of smartphones exceeds our population, the effective and efficient use of those new platforms brought down a bipartisan system that has held hegemonic power since the Chapultepec Agreement. I was able to reach millions of citizens via Facebook Live, while my opponents held rallies with just several hundred of their own co-religionists. The change of format, not just of message and content, led to Salvadorans electing me as their President.\nThat is the way we are governing as well. I have a landline in my office that I have never used. When I need information, I request it directly from my ministers, without needing to involve intermediaries or convene meetings that cause delays. Communication today is direct and much more democratic \u2014 there are no filters. We all have a voice that can and must be heard.\nA few days ago, I proved that to myself again. On 15 September each year, El Salvador celebrates its independence. While the attention of the media and most of our Government was focused on a huge parade through the streets of the capital, the children of a small village named El Aguacate marched in their own parade along a narrow, rural dirt road. A teacher had dressed them up as if they were a first-rate band of peaceful protestors \u2014 almost everything was handmade, with powdered milk cans as drums and spoons to play them with.\nSomeone from the community filmed the parade on their cell phone and uploaded it to their Facebook page, probably so that their friends and family could see it. I am sure they never imagined that the patriotism and sheer joy of those children, despite their lack of resources, would make that video go viral in my country. In a matter of hours, the media had picked up the video, which was shared by thousands of Salvadorans and eventually reached me. After watching it, I instructed my ministers to improve conditions in the village of El Aguacate immediately. Right away, via WhatsApp, they agreed to visit the school there.\nThree days later, our ministers arrived to deliver real musical instruments for the children. Now, the streets are being paved, LED lamps are being installed and the school is being refurbished. The community will be transformed in a way that nobody could have imagined a month ago. It all started with a video that went viral. Without even realizing that it happened, every person who has a cell phone or is connected to the internet is now a spokesperson and a source of information. They can even have political influence.\nThe video of the children going viral animated thousands of voices that not only encouraged them but also asked the Government to take genuine and decisive action. The teacher from El Aguacate and the person who uploaded the video enabled something very ordinary and very local to be seen throughout the entire country, which brought about real change for those pupils. The environment those children inhabit is no longer just their community \u2014 like all of us, they are now also citizens of the world. We are talking about one teacher in a tiny school in a small village in a rural area in a small municipality in El Salvador.\nLet us imagine the transformative and convening power that the General Assembly of the United Nations could have by using the same network that those children used. Why not harness that convening power? Why not use that platform to summon the citizens of the world to participate in the General Assembly? I do not want to be misunderstood here. The United Nations plays a crucial role in maintaining world peace, fighting against hunger, improving health, leading the search for development, promoting the rights of women and children, protecting our environment, addressing the plight of refugees and even tackling nuclear non-proliferation.\nYet we must also acknowledge the fact that we are already reaching a point where the problems we face are overwhelming us. The communication revolution is a fact, a democratic revolution and the start of a new human era. Societies have made progress organically, but the United Nations has not. We must change and adapt and accept that progress. Today, the citizens of the world are more empowered than ever before. Let us give them the voice that they deserve here at the General Assembly, instead of letting only the privileged few who are gathered here be the owners of absolute truth.\nSome will understand this message very well, others not yet. Unfortunately, some refuse to accept the new democratic form of communication, which is the freedom of expression on steroids \u2014 billions of people interconnecting, every one of them with an opinion, a solution, an idea and a voice.\nSuccessful politicians used to say that all politics was local and they were right. Those politicians understood what won elections back then. Yet all politics today is personal. Few people understand that, but it is the reality. If those who understand that have been successful and if that is the right way to engage the citizens of the world in solving the most important problems we face, is that not what the United Nations should be doing as well?\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of His Excellency President Adama Barrow and the people of the Gambia, let me express our sincere gratitude to Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her excellent leadership during the seventy-third session of the General Assembly. In a similar vein, the Gambia welcomes the presidency of the General Assembly of Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande with hope and excitement. I assure him that our support will be unwavering throughout his tenure. We also thank the Secretary-General for his strong leadership and reform initiatives during one of the toughest periods we have ever seen, where multilateralism is experiencing unprecedented assaults.\nAllow me to take this opportunity to extend to the President of the General Assembly the warmest greetings and best wishes from His Excellency Mr. Adama Barrow, President of the Republic of the Gambia, who would have loved to be here in person but, due to other State matters, could not. He has asked that I extend to the General Assembly his sincere apologies and best wishes for a successful seventy-fourth session.\nToday, I speak to the Assembly with a heavy heart. Fifty-four years ago, on 21 September 1965, our founding father and first president, the late Mr. Alhaji Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara, saw the Gambia ushered in as a State Member of the United Nations. He was a beloved leader, a Pan-Africanist, a statesman, a global citizen and a true champion of human rights and the rule of law. He dedicated his life to the search for peace around the world. We mourn the demise of this colossus of a human being and commit ourselves, as a Government and a people, to preserving and celebrating his enduring legacy.\nThe theme that the President has chosen for our general debate \u2014 \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d \u2014 is indeed very relevant for our times. In the light of the multiplicity of the challenges facing the international community today, we cannot afford the enormous cost associated with weak multilateral institutions or inadequate multilateral action.\nNo country can single-handedly solve the challenges of global inequality, terrorism or climate change. For those of us coming from the developing world, we strongly support the work of our multilateral institutions and efforts geared towards finding collective solutions to our development and security needs. As developing countries, most of us are in special situations that require special development plans that would benefit from initiatives, experiences and best practices harnessed through South-South and triangular cooperation. As we strive to attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, therefore, let us collectively galvanize new resources, new efforts and innovative ideas and approaches so as to ensure that no one is left behind.\nIn the Gambia, we understand the critical difference that multilateral efforts can make in transforming a society teetering on the brink of despair into one of hope and a model for emulation. The story of the new Gambia started in December 2016, when the people ushered in a new era of democracy, freedom and the rule of law. As a Government, we launched a plethora of reforms in governance, transitional justice and prudent fiscal and economic management. Today, we can proudly report that our reforms are bearing fruit and yielding positive dividends.\nOur constitutional review commission has concluded consultations with Gambians at home and abroad. For the first time in our history, we have a national human rights commission to address the human rights concerns of the people. As a result of a number of informed policy decisions and actions since the advent of the new Government in 2017, the Gambia is back again as the human rights capital of Africa \u2014 a small country with a big voice on matters of human rights on the continent and beyond.\nIn the area of transitional justice, the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission is now functional and addressing past human rights violations of the former Government, with the active participation of victims and perpetrators. The Commission has also consulted with the Gambian diaspora as an important constituency in our quest for inclusiveness and national reconciliation. With the setting up of the Commission and the revelations that have come from public hearings, Gambians have now awakened to the true extent of the crimes and egregious violations of human rights wilfully committed by a Government against its own people.\nStories of egregious human rights violations like extrajudicial, killings, disappearances, rape and torture were mere stories until now. This is no longer the case thanks to the collaborative work that the international community is doing with the Government today. In this regard, sustaining the ongoing collaboration and support will remain critical to the success of our efforts in instituting accountability for past crimes and generating a historic record for transitional justice in the Gambia, which, in our view, will contribute to healing, national reconciliation and closure for society at large.\nAs part of our broad reforms and major national priorities, we have now created a separate Ministry for Women\u2019s Affairs, Children, and Social Welfare to address the concerns of women and children and wider social inclusion. Women\u2019s empowerment, education of the girl child, ending gender-based violence and discrimination against women and girls, ensuring effective and efficient social inclusion for all, are priorities for our Government.\nWith the launch of our national development plan for the period 2018-2021, which seeks to consolidate our recent democratic gains as well as revive and transform our economy for solid growth, job creation and peace consolidation, we have managed to stabilize the economy and institute fiscal discipline through better management of our unsustainable debt. Through a mix of prudent budgetary and macroeconomic policies, we have managed to register a 6.6 per cent rate of economic growth. Our tourism sector, a major foreign-exchange earner, has grown over 21 per cent in the past two years.\nThose achievements have also had a positive impact on reducing the phenomenon of irregular migration in our youth. The Government has also come up with targeted interventions for the empowerment of young people in our country. Skills development, entrepreneurial support and other opportunities are now being made available to them. For the Gambia, the ongoing global debate and implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development cannot leave young people behind because they constitute the majority of our society.\nWe therefore ask for international support and partnerships to enable us to create more opportunities through education, skills development and technology, and knowledge transfer, as these have the potential to boost the contribution of our young people towards addressing poverty, social and economic inequalities and the overall attainment of the SDGs. The international community\u2019s commitment to working with each other to establish genuine partnerships with a view to sharing and learning from each other\u2019s experiences and technical know-how will go a long way in empowering young people and increasing their positive contributions.\nAs a society in transition, we hope to consolidate our democratic gains by using our national policies and action plans to implement the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2020, we are planning to undergo a voluntary national review at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.\nOne of the major challenges that we must continue to address, even as we strive to bring macroeconomic stability to our economy, is our high debt burden. Therefore, as we concurrently seek the attainment of the SDGs in keeping with our national development priorities, the continued support of our development partners, private sector participation and technical cooperation to help address the capacity and financial gaps will remain critical. We appreciate the ongoing support of the United Nations and its readiness to continue to play a catalytic role in that process as a facilitator of development processes and convener of development actors.\nAs part of the reforms to address the wrongs of the past, the Government also set up a commission of enquiry into the financial activities of the former President and his close associates. The commission has concluded its work and the Cabinet has reviewed its findings and issued a white paper that included robust recommendations.\nAs a result of the illegal activities and illicit financial dealings of the former President and his associates, the Gambia has lost more than $350 million in funds that could have permanently transformed the country\u2019s development trajectory. Other estimates were higher. As a poor developing country, we appeal to the international community to come to our aid in tracking and returning some of that wealth. We ask for the international community\u2019s solidarity and cooperation in the recovery of our looted wealth.\nThe success that we have made would not have been possible without the support of friends and all our bilateral partners, such as the European Union and multilateral organizations, in particular the United Nations; the African Union; the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS); the African Development Bank; the Islamic Development Bank; the World Bank; and the International Monetary Fund. Our partnership with the Peacebuilding Commission remains very critical to the success of our transition process. We are truly grateful for their strong commitment and unwavering support. We continue to face challenges, but with steadfast support of Members the Gambia will emerge as a success story at the end of its transition. Our concerns as a developing country are not very different from those of our neighbours in West Africa and the Sahel.\nAcross our region, we are facing increasing threats from the rise of terrorism, violent extremism, the proliferation of illicit weapons and drug trafficking, including human trafficking. Deadly terrorist attacks have become more organized, sophisticated and frequent in an increasing number of countries in the subregion. We are grateful to the United Nations Office for West Africa and the Sahel and to ECOWAS for constantly championing the problems of the region and we underscore the urgent need to successfully implement the United Nations Integrated Strategy for the Sahel.\nThe Strategy needs to simultaneously address the security and development challenges of the region with a renewed sense of commitment. More international and regional cooperation and solidarity are needed to tackle the pervasive insecurity and underdevelopment in the Sahel. Without peace, the Sahel and West Africa will find it difficult to meet the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063 of the African Union.\nAs we march towards realizing those blueprints of the United Nations and the African Union, respectively, the Gambia will host seven West African countries for a high-level subregional exchange forum, entitled \u201cLocalizing the 2030 Agenda: building on what works\u201d, to be held from 27 to 29 October. In that regard, the Gambia is grateful for the partnership that it has established with the United Nations Human Security Unit and the International Peace Institute in an effort to continue sustaining peace and development in the subregion.\nMy delegation welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s reform proposals on restructuring the peace and security pillar and in the areas of development cooperation, peacebuilding and peacekeeping. We look forward to their successful implementation in line with the Member State-driven processes that were launched to complement them. We also want to see increased efficiency and effectiveness of cooperation in the Sahel, in which the United Nations and other international actors will give priority not only to conflict prevention and sustaining peace but also to regional and subregional cooperation.\nThe United Nations must provide effective support for the Peacebuilding Commission and overcome fragmentation in its responses by aligning the peace and security needs of the Sahel with the development imperatives of the region. With regard to the Sahel, we must draw inspiration from the wise words of the late Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General, who said that, \u201c[W]e will not enjoy development without security, or security without development... [and] we will not enjoy either without... respect for human rights\u201d.\nThe Gambia continues to contribute to peacekeeping and peace initiatives across Africa and beyond. Silencing the Guns in Africa by 2020 \u2014 an African Union initiative \u2014 remains a lofty goal that we must continue to pursue resolutely at this late hour. A peaceful Africa is possible and we must do more to encourage dialogue in Libya with a view to finding a lasting political solution to the conflict there. The parties must lay down their arms, sit down and negotiate in good faith.\nWe also call on the factions in the Central African Republic to give peace a chance. The United Nations must do more to find lasting peace for the long-suffering people of the Central African Republic and other conflict-affected areas on the continent. My delegation fully supports the political processes currently evolving in the Sudan and South Sudan. We encourage both countries not to rest until they attain the goals of peace, stability and national cohesion.\nAcross the globe, there are many urgent issues that continue to challenge our collective conscience and humanity. Over the past few years, we have witnessed a rise in racism, xenophobia, intolerance and anti-migrant sentiments, largely provoked by extremist groups, bigoted politicians and hatemongers, with deadly consequences. Collectively, we must strongly condemn and reject such barbaric attacks, hate speech and divisive rhetoric against foreigners. The world cannot remain silent. Migrants deserve protection and support. More needs to be done at the multilateral level to address those threats. It is our hope that more will be done to implement the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.\nExtreme weather events, increasing desertification, deforestation, rising sea levels and the irreparable loss of biological diversity should all serve as a wake-up call that climate change is real and already upon us. Will we continue our empty rhetoric or continue to look the other way and do nothing? Will we take stronger or bolder steps to address it, or will we continue to take weak or half-hearted measures that do not take us near the 1.5\u00b0C target?\nThe Climate Action Summit, held on Monday, provided the world with a major opportunity for Member States to demonstrate their true commitment to taking critical action that will make a difference. The Gambia is committed and is already taking action to implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We expect all nations \u2014 small or big \u2014 to demonstrate their commitment by taking genuine climate action. Let us leave New York with a new sense of urgency to tackle climate change.\nIn addition to the urgent need for climate action, there is the fact that hundreds of millions of people in the world today continue to lack health coverage. At the national and international levels, we must adopt clear policies and provide the necessary resources for universal health coverage. For that reason, the Gambia applauded the timeliness of convening a high-level meeting on universal health coverage. We remain hopeful that the outcome of the meeting will be fully implemented for the benefit of all.\nAt this juncture, allow me to share my delegation\u2019s thoughts on some of the political developments in the international arena.\nAs a pillar of our foreign policy engagement with the Peoples Republic of China, we recognize only one China in our mutual quest to enhance and nurture friendly relations, based on mutual respect and sovereign equality. We also believe that the evolution of our relations is built on shared prosperity and a win-win approach.\nThe embargo imposed on Cuba by the United States belongs to a bygone era. We call on the United States to end the embargo and give friendly relations and good-neighbourliness a chance.\nWe also reiterate our commitment to a two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The international community must galvanize renewed efforts leading to a comprehensive peace process. The conflict has persisted for far too long. Palestinians must be allowed to have their own independent State, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel must also stop all settlement activity in occupied Palestinian territories and respect the human rights of Palestinians. The two sides need to urgently negotiate a political solution to a conflict that continues to affect millions of lives. We are convinced that the situation requires a credible peace initiative, which the United Nations and the international community can spearhead with the support of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in its search for peace in Palestine.\nThe OIC can play a strategic role in partnering with the United Nations and other partners by serving as a credible bridge for mutual dialogue and understanding in the search for comprehensive peace across the Middle East and the world at large. The unique platform that the Organization enjoys in the Islamic world can foster interreligious dialogue and intercultural understanding among peoples and faiths of the world.\nThe Government of the Gambia champions the promotion and protection of human rights as one of the central pillars of our domestic and foreign policies concerning the well-being of our own people and people elsewhere in the world.\nFor those reasons, we continue to be deeply concerned about extreme violations of human rights and the troubling increase in cases of xenophobia and related intolerance in certain parts of the world. We therefore count on the Secretary-General and people in a position of authority to use their good offices to engage world leaders to do more to fight intolerance and extremism. We need to make the world a safer and more tolerant place for all peoples.\nThe Gambia is ready to lead concerted efforts to take the Rohingya issue to the International Court of Justice on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and we call on all stakeholders to support that process. As a global community with a conscience, we cannot continue to ignore the plight of the Rohingya. It is for that reason that my delegation takes this opportunity to call on the United Nations, like-minded nations and concerned stakeholders to synchronize our efforts in the search for a just, speedy and lasting solution to the Rohingya crisis.\nThe legitimacy of multilateral institutions such as the United Nations and its organs is built on the foundation that all Member States share in the values of the Organization because we all have the same voice and standing when it comes to decision-making. Many are losing faith in the Security Council and its decisions. We need to urgently embark on the reform of the Council, which is long overdue. Today, African issues form the bulk of the Council\u2019s agenda but no African country is a veto-wielding member of that organ. A whole continent could be excluded from decisions affecting it that have been considered normal. Let those countries standing in the way of Security Council reform give way and fully support the Ezulwini Consensus of the Group of African States. The demands are just and legitimate.\nWith the support of all our friends, the Gambia is on a new and upward trajectory today. The Government\u2019s approach continues to be strongly guided by our awareness of the difficult past that our people have overcome. In that regard, we continue to ask for the continuing support and cooperation of Member States as we endeavour to build the more prosperous and highly developed country envisaged in our current development blueprint, the Gambia National Development Plan 2018-2021.\nAs a country in transition, we strongly believe in the value of multilateralism and institutions of multilateral diplomacy as tools to solve our challenges. As small State members, we optimize our strength and leverage our voice when we work with the international community and friends to resolve the collective problems confronting us as one large family. Global challenges require global efforts for satisfactory and cost-effective solutions. We strongly commend the role of the United Nations in our transition process. We will continue to work with all States members of the General Assembly to address the concerns of small and developing countries.\nOnce again, on behalf of President Barrow, the Government and the people of the Gambia, I extend my sincere appreciation to all our bilateral and multilateral partners for their continuous support and assistance to the country. I wish all Member States a successful seventy-fourth session.\n"

        "file_text": "Today I am honoured and privileged to address the General Assembly on behalf of my Prime Minister, Mr. James Marape, and the Government and the people of Papua New Guinea. I would like to warmly congratulate you, Mr. President, and the Government and the people of Nigeria, on your election to lead the Assembly. We share the spirit of this session\u2019s theme of \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d and the priorities you have set, Mr. President. You have our trust and confidence in leading our collective work and, as one of the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly for the current session, my country stands in solidarity with you and all the States Members of the United Nations. I also want to express our gratitude to the outgoing President, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her vibrant leadership, commendable commitment and tireless efforts, including in strengthening the hand of multilateralism, inclusivity and humanity over the past year. I wish her all the best in her future endeavours, and Papua New Guinea hopes that it will not take another decade or more for a female President of the General Assembly to be elected once again.\nI would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his exemplary leadership, selfless service and stellar work in many important areas, such as climate change, during the past year, and his continued diligent work for the greater good and welfare of we the peoples of the United Nations. At the regional level, Papua New Guinea was heartened and inspired by his very timely and welcome landmark visit in May to the Pacific region, to bear witness to our sustainable development challenges, vulnerabilities and opportunities and the clarion call to step up the fight and do better, work harder and act more urgently to combat the adverse effects of climate change. At our national level, the United Nations remains a trusted and highly valued partner for us. The development, peacebuilding, human rights and humanitarian support under the reformed United Nations system that is now functioning in Papua New Guinea continues not only to expand and deepen but, more importantly, to strategically complement my Government\u2019s development priorities. But while we are moving in the right direction, there is still much to be done. I would like to assure the Secretary-General and the United Nations system that they have my Government\u2019s undivided support.\nA localized and integrated 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development remains an important priority for Papua New Guinea under my Government. Currently, measured progress continues to be made in specific areas, such as education, primary health care, gender equality and empowerment, and peace and security, but more work needs to be done. For instance, in health and education services, our Government\u2019s policies on free education and health care continue to gain momentum countrywide. More Papua New Guineans, particularly girls and children, are benefiting from these strategic interventions.\nMy Government remains committed to ensuring the provision of quality education and primary health care as a solid foundation for a better future for all our citizens. Working towards achieving those goals is important as part of our preparations to present our voluntary national review on the status of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda to the High-level Political Forum for the first time in July 2020. Meanwhile, we continue to be inspired by our national Vision 2050 and our National Strategy for Responsible Sustainable Development and guided by our Medium-Term Development Plan and a paradigm shift, including a generational change of political leadership, which is being done to strengthen national-level implementation in the context of core development priorities under the new vision to \u201ctake back Papua New Guinea\u201d, with a view to making it prosperous, peaceful and secure through inclusive sustainable economic growth.\nThe objective is, first and foremost, to strategically position the country\u2019s sustainable development in order to empower our citizens at all levels so that they can take national ownership and leadership of our development pathway and destiny, while also protecting our abundant natural resources. Secondly, in taking back New Guinea, we have ambitious plans to achieve economic independence and self-reliance in the coming decade. We recognize that a healthy and educated population supported by quality infrastructure, broad- based agriculture and just, fair, equitable and inclusive development serve as the engine of sustainable development. This will secure and empower the future of our children, while ensuring that we do not erode and compromise our environmental capital.\nIn order to achieve our national agenda as part of the wider 2030 Agenda, we have established the following priority areas of focus. First, we will focus on the revitalization of the agriculture sector as a key driver for inclusive economic growth. This approach is intended to harness the productivity of our rural communities, particularly women and girls \u2014 who constitute 80 per cent of the country\u2019s population \u2014 by empowering and enabling them to participate in income generation and job opportunities, with a view to improving their standard of living and eliminating poverty. Sectorial plans are also being established covering the marine sector and fisheries, forestry, mining, oil and gas and primary industry products. These plans include gender equity and social inclusion components.\nSecondly, we are committed to downstream- processing our natural resources in order to add value and build our human capital and manufacturing capacities and capabilities, thereby industrializing our economy. In adopting such measures, we are striving to become a middle-income country by 2030. We therefore welcome genuine and durable development partners from bona fide foreign investors to develop downstream-processing facilities in the country.\nThirdly, we are embarking on reviewing and reforming our legislative infrastructure on renewable and non-renewable resources. This objective aims at finding the right balance that fairly and equitably accounts for all stakeholders\u2019 interests. We do not have such a balance at present, which is disempowering our people who are the true owners of the natural resources.\nFourthly, we have prioritized building resilient economic infrastructure projects, such as roads, airports, wharves, and electricity and telecommunications facilities. This infrastructure will support economic corridors throughout the country that will enable our citizens to obtain market access for their primary produce and basic services. We recognize the importance of the digital economy and are therefore working earnestly with our development partners to harness the added value to the economy and our people\u2019s lives through the information and communications technology sector. The recent completion of the submarine fibre-optic cable between Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, and Sydney, Australia, is particularly noteworthy. This cable will significantly boost information and communications technology services in the country and globally. My Government greatly appreciates the strong and valued partnership of our closest neighbour, Australia.\nAs an integral part of enhancing the rule of law and order in my country, my Government is seriously committed to strengthening governance, particularly through combating corruption at all levels. We have made it a key priority to finalize the organic law on the Independent Commission against Corruption, which we are aiming to establish soon. This will be pivotal to halting the insidious drain on resources associated with corruption and to redirecting those resources to the areas where they are most needed. Another key part of the measures my Government has taken is in strengthening public-sector reform to ensure that it is fit for purpose for service delivery. This will be guided by economic drivers and social need, and where necessary, we will outsource or establish partnerships with the private sector and civil society organizations.\nWe recognize the value of development partnership for our national development, as called for in multilaterally agreed frameworks. We urge our development partners to align their development assistance with our national plans and policies, in accordance with our national development cooperation policy. Let me take this opportunity to convey our appreciation to all our bilateral and multilateral development partners, including Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, the United States, the European Union (EU), India, Israel, the Republic of Korea and the United Nations. I would also like to recognize the important and enduring role of faith-based organizations and civil society agencies, inter alia, in supporting our socioeconomic development agenda.\nI want to address the critically important issue of equality and the empowerment of our women and girls. Based on our recent thorough review and evaluation of Papua New Guinea\u2019s socioeconomic development over the past decade, we have not measured up to our full potential in this area. With the right leadership, commitment, requisite resources and a holistic and inclusive approach, we can do better in meeting the needs of our women and girls. We have put in place such laws, policies, plans and strategies as the National Public Service Gender Equity and Social Inclusion Policy, which champions workplace gender equity, inclusiveness and leadership. The National Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-based Violence 2016-2025 complements our international human rights and gender-equality commitments, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.\nWhat is now needed is to better translate these existing national frameworks and related international commitments into meaningful actions, thereby supporting the equality and empowerment of women and girls. That is exactly what our five-year Medium-Term Development Plan III is addressing through an approach that seeks to secure our future by way of inclusive, sustainable economic growth. An integral part of this approach is the clear recognition of the importance of gender as a cross-cutting development issue.\nThis year marks 18 years of unbroken peace in my country\u2019s Autonomous Region of Bougainville, which followed the signing of the Bougainville Peace Agreement between the Government and the people of Bougainville in August 2001, after a civil conflict claimed scores of lives and livelihoods and necessitated the involvement of the United Nations. As an integral part of the Peace Agreement, a referendum will be conducted on 23 November to decide the future status of the Autonomous Region, subject to the final decision of the national parliament of my country. Papua New Guinea is steadfastly committed to upholding the Peace Agreement, and we are doing everything possible to ensure that the referendum is free, fair and transparent. I would like to thank the Secretary-General and the United Nations system, as well as our bilateral and other multilateral development partners, including, again, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Ireland, Norway, Germany and the EU, for their enduring support that has enabled the peace that we continue to witness today.\nOn climate change, let me begin by joining others in conveying my Government\u2019s and my people\u2019s sincere sympathies and condolences to the people and the Government of the Bahamas for the unprecedented loss of lives and devastation caused by Hurricane Dorian. As a fellow small island developing State, we stand in solidarity with them.\nWe support and congratulate the Secretary-General\u2019s Climate Action Summit and the inclusion of youth in championing the fight against climate change. We are proud today to have heard such a call for urgent action in the context of small island developing States from a young Papua New Guinean woman. The courageous and uncompromising stance of youth is a good omen for the world. We also thank those funding the support for youth and others in this rallying call.\nAt the recently concluded fiftieth Pacific Islands Forum Leaders meeting, in Tuvalu, the Pacific leaders agreed to build on the blue Pacific\u2019s call for urgent global climate change action through the Kainaki II Declaration for Urgent Climate Change Action Now. This instrument is now our moral compass and the authority we will use going forward in the run-up to the twenty-fifth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nClimate change is the defining issue of our time. It requires that all States Members of the United Nations and all stakeholders take urgent and concrete measures individually and collectively under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and through the revision of nationally determined contributions by 2020. Such an approach will effectively address the adverse impacts of climate change for the sake of our planet. The important outcomes from the Climate Action Summit earlier this week paves the way for us to take the measures necessary to saving ourselves. We cannot continue to be morally irresponsible about this existential threat to the planet. Moreover, it is utterly unfair and unjust for those that contribute the least to greenhouse-gas emissions to pay the highest price. It must stop.\nWe take seriously the importance of being a party to the Paris Agreement by adopting the measures needed both domestically and globally. For instance, Papua New Guinea was one of the first few countries in the world to submit its nationally determined contributions, and we are currently in the process of revising them. At the Climate Action Summit, my Government\u2019s three initiatives were accepted under the nature-based solutions track and the resilience and adaptation track.\nThe nature-based solutions track focuses on harnessing our abundant tropical-rainforest resources as the lungs of the Earth and carbon reservoir through sustainable forest-management practices. These ends can be met, first, by implementing our national strategy for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, as well as conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. Secondly, with respect to our renewable energy plan, we are endeavouring to tap into our rich hydro energy and solar-energy sources. Thirdly, we are looking to climate-proof infrastructure in the country; pilot projects in this area are well under way.\nUnder the Paris Agreement, we commit to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions in the energy sector. Papua New Guinea\u2019s Vision 2050, national development strategic plan 2010-2030 and national energy policy outline our national goals to assist us in making the transition from our current energy sources to 100 per cent renewable sources by 2050. Climate funding is a necessity for us to be able to fully implement the Paris Agreement.\nPapua New Guinea wishes to express its appreciation to those Governments and organizations that have pledged additional funding to the Green Climate Fund and encourages others who have the financial capacity to contribute to do so as well. However, Papua New Guinea aligns itself with statements already made relating to accessibility of the funds. If our nationally determined contributions are going to be ambitious, we must not be constrained by difficulties in gaining access to climate funds.\nMy country considers the ocean as an integral part of our past, present and future. Ocean resources are vital to the economic, social and cultural values central to our people\u2019s lives and livelihoods. In this spirit, we are now mapping out our institutional framework and national oceans policy, which are intended to develop and establish an integrated ocean-management system within and beyond our national jurisdiction. As a State party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, this approach will also strengthen the implementation of the Convention in our maritime zones and support core development policies and plans.\nI am also pleased to note that as an integral part of this priority we submitted to the Secretary-General our national maritime-boundaries delimitation charts in April. In addition, we took positive steps in March 2017 to secure an extended continental shelf in the Ontong Java Plateau area, in a first-ever trilateral joint submission submitted together with our Pacific neighbours, the Federated States of Micronesia and Solomon Islands. A highly technical and sophisticated effort that spanned over a decade culminated in recommendations published by the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.\nThe fisheries sector is a major contributor to our economy, and to ensure its sustainability, we are committed to combating illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing and are working towards the adoption of the Agreement on Port State Measures of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations by the end of this year. Doing so will ensure downstream processing to add value to our resources. In this spirit, we call for the successful conclusion of the World Trade Organization negotiations on fishery subsidies in order to halt improper practices in this sector.\nWe also share the stewardship of our ocean with our Pacific Islands Forum neighbours under the strong Blue Pacific Continent regional architecture, designed to ensure a secure, peaceful and prosperous Pacific. The regional architecture will enable our people to live free, healthy and productive lives, on our own terms and in ways that recognize the richness of our cultures, national circumstances and oceanic resources, as well as the importance of conservation and sustainable use.\nWe welcome and support the convening of the second United Nations Ocean Conference to support the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14, to be held in Portugal in June 2020. Similarly, we are pleased to note the positive progress made in the third intergovernmental conference on an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. As we move towards the final negotiations in early 2020, we encourage all stakeholders not to be narrow-minded in order to protect their petty national considerations but, rather, to view the global commons as one shared ocean deserving of our collective protection and sustainable use.\nBased on our own domestic and regional experiences, my Government values the critical importance of the role being played by United Nations peacekeeping operations. We contribute in a modest way to United Nations peacekeeping operations, and I intend to increase our support in future as our capacity expands.\nLet me take this opportunity to express my Government\u2019s sincere condolences and sympathies to the families and friends of the peacekeeping personnel who made the ultimate sacrifice of their lives for the sake of peace this year. Our prayers and thoughts are also with peacekeeping personnel who have been injured.\nWe are also grateful for the work of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding Fund, from which we have particularly benefited in the context of the implementation of the Bougainville Peace Agreement. We look forward to continuing to work in close partnership with them.\nAs we prepare to mark, in 2020, the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, the Security Council must be reformed. We are heartened that the review of multi-country offices recognized and reinforced that the United Nations must do more and better to support small island developing States, especially those covered by multi-country offices, in the pursuit of sustainable development.\nIn our Pacific region, while we face common challenges, each country also faces specific and unique challenges. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. To meet current development challenges, the United Nations development system needs to operate in the context of the unique development dynamics in each country. In this regard, we welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s decision to establish a dedicated multi-country office in the North Pacific region for our Pacific neighbours of the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru and Palau.\nWe remain concerned about sporadic terrorist attacks around the globe. We stand in solidarity with the countries and peoples affected by such acts and strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We also continue to be concerned over tensions in various parts of the world, as they have the potential to have unintended consequences for others. We therefore encourage peaceful dialogue in order to resolve such issues.\nIn closing, Papua New Guinea\u2019s long-standing view on disarmament is that the world should be rid of all weapons of mass destruction. As long as nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction exist, there is a very real danger that such weapons will again be used one day, whether by design or by accident.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to extend the fraternal message of peace and respect from the people of Nicaragua, the President of the Republic, Mr. Daniel Ortega Saavedra, and the First Lady and Vice-President, Mrs. Rosario Murillo Zambrana, to the General Assembly.\nThe theme of this session, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, coincides with our prioritized State policies that the Government of Nicaragua has successfully developed over the past decade. We reaffirm the commitment and political will of the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity of Nicaragua to continuing to develop and strengthen these inclusive economic and social policies aimed at the common good of Nicaraguans.\nNicaragua welcomes the efforts promoted by the Secretary-General at the Climate Action Summit held here in New York, as well as the commitments undertaken within this framework by a large number of States, aimed at overcoming the grave threat to the existence of humankind caused by climate change. Nicaragua and the countries of the Central American region are among the most vulnerable nations on the planet, and our people are suffering the extremely grave consequences of the destructive effects of climate change. It is urgent that the international community adopt measures that curb global warming to ensure the future of the Earth, the future of humankind and the life of present and future generations. Based on the principle of shared but differentiated responsibilities, our country is undertaking great economic, social and preventive efforts to address climate change, which have so far yielded internationally recognized positive results.\nNicaragua will continue contributing to regional stability, peace and security, and will persist in fighting to maintain the important indicators of the inclusive economic, political, educational and social development achieved so far, attaining significant progress in the eradication of poverty. UNICEF recognizes that the Government of Nicaragua has achieved success in its economic and social policies. In addition, UNICEF recognizes that Nicaragua has a broad legal framework, as well as national and international instruments that protect the human rights of children and young people. It also recognizes that the Government of Nicaragua has managed to reduce general poverty rates by 17.6 per cent and extreme poverty by 7.7 per cent between 2009 and 2016, as well as having achieved a notable reduction in infant mortality. UNICEF also recognizes that Nicaragua has made significant strides in guaranteeing free access to education, as well as its extensive coverage and higher quality. UNICEF and Nicaragua have agreed a cooperation programme for the period 2019-2023.\nWe would reiterate that in order to comply with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, including eradicating poverty and providing quality education, unilateral coercive measures that violate international law and the human rights of our peoples must be avoided. Putting obstacles in place that prevent our people from reaching these goals is inhumane and criminal and must be denounced and condemned by all of humankind.\nOnce again, we raise the urgent call for a reinvention of the United Nations, as proposed by the Nicaraguan priest and Foreign Minister Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann in 2008, during his presidency of the General Assembly. The transformation of the United Nations is indispensable in order for it to effectively serve the interests of humankind.\nThe recent expulsion by the Government of the United States of two diplomatic representatives of the sister Republic of Cuba to the United Nations from the Organization\u2019s Headquarters in New York is another example of the need for the United Nations to undergo a profound transformation and change of Headquarters in order to meet the objectives for which it was created and so that it can become a multilateral forum that serves all countries of the world, without limitations or quarantines for States Members\u2019 representatives. We express our rejection and condemnation of this expulsion of the two Cuban diplomats, which was a clear violation of international law, in general, and of the United Nations Headquarters Agreement between the Organization and the Government of the host country, in particular. Illegal occurrences such as these confirm the urgent need for the United Nations to be rebuilt on new foundations and for the Headquarters to be moved to a country where international law and the Charter of the United Nations are respected. This requires the urgent reinvention and democratization of our Organization.\nWe condemn once again the criminal blockade against the brotherly Republic of Cuba and all the extraterritorial measures and ramifications associated with it. Nicaragua rejects all coercive economic measures that seek to break the will and spirit of freedom and the sovereignty of the Governments and the peoples of the world. We reiterate our militant solidarity with the brotherly Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Bolivarian people and the legitimate and constitutional Government of President Nicolas Maduro Moros.\nWe reject and condemn any threat of military intervention and the invocation of the obsolete Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, which is nothing other than an instrument designed by the Government of the United States to use or threaten to use force, which it is promoting within the framework of the Organization of American States. We continue to support decolonization throughout the world and join in solidarity with the Palestinian and Saharawi peoples, Puerto Rico and the Malvinas Islands, which are part of Argentina.\nIn conclusion, it has been 74 years since the Charter of the United Nations was adopted. To some extent, its purposes and principles have contributed to the maintenance of international peace and security. However, new modalities incompatible with the purposes of the United Nations are being implemented by super Powers that seek to subjugate developing countries, while undermining their rights to self- determination and political independence.\nIn Nicaragua, we continue to follow the path of development with social justice, family advocacy, gender equality, support for young people and improving security, education, health, energy, water and sanitation services, highways and roads, bridges, housing, agriculture and livestock, nature conservation in the context of climate change, small- and medium- sized businesses, the creative economy and everything represented by a culture based on identity, tradition and values, together with work, rights, well-being and the harmonious coexistence among Nicaraguans in peace, friendship, solidarity and cooperation with the States Members of the United Nations.\nThe Government and the people of Nicaragua are defenders of the principles of independence and sovereignty, as set out in the Charter of the United Nations. We therefore continue to demand that all policies of interference violating international law cease, including interventionist actions in Nicaragua and such brotherly nations of the Americas and the world as Cuba, Venezuela, Syria and Iran, inter alia.\nWe reaffirm that, in Nicaragua, we are lovers of peace. We are strengthening security and comprehensively promoting, defending and respecting human rights, despite media campaigns that, in their use of fake news, seek to project a negative image of our country and our Government. In the region, Nicaragua continues to be an important factor in promoting stability, peace and regional security, as illustrated by positive indicators in economic, political, and social development, poverty reduction, gender equality and State and citizen security. Nicaragua stands as a bulwark against international organized crime, gangs, terrorism and drug trafficking. Its related domestic policies and constructive international cooperation continue to be developed by the Government of President Daniel Ortega Saavedra.\nIn assuming the responsibility that we shoulder as a State, we are ensuring that Nicaragua takes the path leading towards successful poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and especially social inclusion, as the vocation of our Government is to stand up for the poor and those who have historically been marginalized and for peace, good governance, progress, international security and the peaceful coexistence among the brotherly countries that constitute the United Nations."

        "file_text": "All the achievements of the United Nations have one thing in common \u2014 respect for rules and principles. As much as we need those principles today, we also need trust and responsibility. And the best way to build trust is to respect the rules and to live and act by them, because we can then predict how we behave and be prepared when the unexpected happens. For me, mutual trust is the invisible silver lining that holds our societies together. Today I see two major challenges in that regard.\nFirst, we do not respect the rules and principles. As a lawyer and a long-term activist in the field of justice, I cannot ignore the fact that many of these rules and principles are under immense pressure, including through dangerous efforts to twist or break them. That is why it is important to remind ourselves that if one country takes away territory from another, that must be called occupation and not mistaken for peacemaking. Suppressing the human rights of minorities must not be confused with fighting against extremism. Spreading hate or false propaganda cannot be called freedom of speech; and using chemical weapons against innocent citizens cannot be justified as fighting against terrorism. These and many other examples are the reason for having a strong United Nations as a guardian of rules and of our trust.\nSecondly, we have serious difficulties in agreeing on new rules. Often, we cannot agree at all. That applies to new areas that have emerged as a result of our successes and progress. Those mostly concern climate change but also new technologies, cybernetics or artificial intelligence.\nWe are going to face difficult times. More than ever, we need responsible Governments that will draw their legitimacy from the trust of their people, refrain from populism and keep their own ego under control. We need Governments that will give our people hope that there is still justice and that it is worth playing by the rules because our future rests on our ability to repair broken trust. More and more often we hear leaders speaking about putting their national interests before the global good. Yet the best way to be patriotic actually lies not in national egoism but in cooperation.\nIn that regard, I see climate change as the key issue. If I had to name just one thing that concerns me the most at the global level, it is denial \u2014 denial that the climate crisis exists or that it is not that serious. The scientific evidence is clear: climate change is a fact, and we are running out of time. But if we act now, we can reduce carbon emissions within 12 years and keep global warming at 1.5\u00b0C. If we can succeed at the local level, thanks to activists and non-governmental organizations, and if we have successful green companies, why can we not do the same at the global level?\nAs if the fear of business that it will lose its competitive edge and profits or the fear of Governments losing popular support was greater than all rational arguments. To overcome such fears, we need to change our mindset that the green economy is costly and not profitable and learn that, in the long term, it is far less costly and far more efficient.\nI can provide one concrete example. For many years, it was politically unthinkable to close old and inefficient coal mines in our country. Instead, we had to subsidize the mining industry to keep it alive. But, finally, we found the courage to make that difficult decision. I am very proud that yesterday, at the Climate Action Summit 2019, I could present a credible plan to close the coal mines and transform the entire coal-mining region. In addition, Slovakia is firmly committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\nEach country can contribute with its fair share. We have no time and no excuse to wait for the others because they are bigger or richer. That is why I highly appreciate the initiative of the Secretary-General, and I thank him for his leadership and personal engagement in convening yesterday\u2019s summit. If we manage to combine our knowledge and our means with leadership, it will bring about a change of policy.\nTo that end, we need to fulfil what we have already agreed on. The Paris Agreement is central to keeping us on the right track. But its commitments are still far from met, and we need to go far beyond that. We need a rapid and profound change in how we do business, generate power, manage transport and make investments. We also need to change our lifestyle.\nThis year we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It seems that our young people understand the urgency better than us. What kind of future are we preparing for our children? We are in debt to this planet and to our children and we need to pay that debt back. The good news is that technological development is on our side.\nGreen energy is becoming increasingly competitive. Private companies and investors are starting to realize that investment in the green economy can be profitable and economically rational because, instead of undermining economic growth, climate action generates new opportunities for businesses and new jobs for our people.\nWe must make sure that, in the end, everyone can benefit from climate action, especially the most vulnerable, who bear the burden, but also those affected by the transformation, because the bottom line of development is primarily about the dignity of every human being.\nWe know what we need to do. We have been discussing it for years. We have all the knowledge and means. The time has come to no longer accept the excuses. I would suggest being bold and going even further. I believe that if we succeed in uniting over our action for climate, we can generate a new sense of solidarity in other areas. That can become a basis to overcome divisions among nations and bring new opportunities.\nOur citizens are already moving in that direction. We have the primary responsibility. We must lead. Let us use this opportunity to become the generation that laid the foundations for cooperation that is based on the common sense of our shared destiny.\n"

        "file_text": "We have witnessed inspiring calls to action this week at the United Nations in pursuit of a more vibrant and resilient world, but with few exceptions those contributions have not come from leaders. They have come from young people who are tired of watching helplessly as their future is hijacked by nations too blind to the catastrophe at our doorstep or too impotent to do what must be done; young people who are living in terror at what the coming years will bring, but who are choosing to speak out rather than cower in fear; young people who know that a secure and prosperous future remains within reach, only if we, as leaders, choose to act and act now to save them.\nOf all the contributions made and words spoken at the United Nations this week, some of the most thought-provoking, and certainly the most passionate, have come from our young people, inspiring and, sometimes, goading us, as national leaders, to use our power and influence, look beyond our narrow political objectives and think more broadly about the world that they will inherit.\nA few hours ago, the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), issued a report that adds a new dimension of horror to the world that our children and grandchildren will inherit. They warn that global warming is turning our seas into a huge potential threat to humankind, reporting that global average sea levels could rise by up to 1.1 metres by 2100, in the worst-case warming scenario. This is a rise of 10 centimetres over previous IPCC projections because of the larger ice loss now happening in Antarctica. That is heart-breaking news for tens of thousands of Fijians in our coastal areas and all people in low-lying areas around the world.\nIt adds considerable urgency to the mission of Fiji\u2019s Climate Relocation and Displaced Peoples Trust Fund for Communities and Infrastructure, which I launched Monday night here in New York. I urge everyone to read the report. It is from the top minds in their scientific fields. I would tell anyone living in denial of the climate emergency, some of whom sit at the apex of certain Governments the following, that if they readily listen to scientists and take heed of the best research available in every other field of human endeavour, they should not refuse to listen to scientists of climate change. One of our youngest climate warriors \u2014 Timoci Naulusala \u2014 makes the case far better than I ever could. He watched his village ripped to pieces in Cyclone Winston, and he is now demanding that the world act to spare other young people the same suffering he personally endured.\nIf we fail to act, Timoci\u2019s worst fears will be realized, as we will condemn him and all young people to a hellish future. For all 193 States Members of the United Nations, this is our moment of truth \u2014 the defining issue that will determine the course of history. Previous generations fought each other to uphold their own interests, but now the world must unite around our common interests to fight a more powerful enemy \u2014 a monster we created ourselves, a heating planet staggering under the excesses of all who have taken its resilience for granted.\nEvery nation has a role to play, but only the industrial nations have the economic capacity and advanced technical know-how to lead the world to victory in this struggle. Defeat is not an option, so I would again ask those who did not come to New York this week with fresh plans to tackle the climate crisis or who came merely out of curiosity to observe to please examine the evidence and the facts and, for the sake of our children and grandchildren, face up to their responsibility to lead.\nTo stave off catastrophe, there is no alternative but to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. There is no alternative but to cap the average global temperature at 1.5\u00b0C above the pre-industrial age \u2014 and preferably even lower \u2014 because even at 1\u00b0C warming entire species are being made extinct and our coral reefs are dying. There is no alternative but to rapidly scale down the use of fossil fuels and rapidly scale up the development of renewable energy. And there is no alternative but to rapidly phase out the use of coal. No more coal mines. No more coal-powered electricity. Unless we stop burning coal, we have no hope of achieving net zero emissions in 31 years\u2019 time.\nWe must put oceans at the heart of the process of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at the twenty-fifth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 25), or Blue COP, in Chile in December, because we cannot have a stable climate without a healthy ocean.\nMy message to my own people, and especially young Fijians, is that I hear them and that their nation and Government are doing everything they can to get the world to confront the climate threat. We assumed the presidency of COP 23 not for prestige, but to play our part in ensuring their survival and everything we hold dear, not only our precious surroundings, but our culture and traditions, in order protect the dreams and aspirations that every Fijian has for him or herself and the hopes they all have for their children.\nSmall as it is, Fiji will fight. We will continue to be a voice for more climate ambition and further climate action. We will continue to advance our case in the great forums of the world, on behalf not only of Fijians and other Pacific islanders, but of the climate-vulnerable everywhere. This week, Fiji answered the call of the Secretary-General to come to New York with increased ambition to reduce our own emissions. They amount to only 0.04 per cent of total global emissions, but we will be submitting our revised nationally determined contribution next year, which will include a commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. For leadership is about leading by example, not lecturing others or expecting them to shoulder the burden alone.\nCOP 23 was not the first time that Fiji demonstrated leadership in the world. For four decades, we have served the world through our contribution to United Nations peacekeeping. Our troops have travelled across the globe to some of the most violent trouble spots and placed their lives on the line to protect the innocent. More than 60 Fijians have paid the ultimate sacrifice \u2014 it has been a sacrifice not only for their loved ones, but for our nation of fewer than a million people. We have done it proudly because we see it as our duty to serve. With the assistance of our development partner, Australia, we are establishing a new training centre in Fiji for our peacekeeping activities and to provide a rapid response to climate-induced disasters in our region. Fiji will continue contributing to United Nations peacekeeping with better trained and equipped troops. While conflict zones in particular feel the stress of climate impacts, our peacekeepers will be even better prepared to assist affected communities.\nIn the climate fight, we have launched a host of initiatives to serve our people, the region and the world. We are working to reduce the emissions of our transport sector on land through electric buses and higher fuel standards and, at sea, working with our Pacific neighbours to convert our shipping fleets from diesel to hybrid and make them more efficient. We are working to protect our vulnerable coastline and our coastal communities and towns from rising waters and extreme weather events, including our global gateway, Nadi. We are working to ensure that when disaster strikes \u2014 as Cyclone Winston did three years ago, costing us one-third of our gross domestic product in 36 hours \u2014 we have access to appropriately packaged insurance to bounce back.\nWe are working to access adequate and affordable finance from public and private sources for climate adaptation. We are bringing solar power to communities that are off the national grid. The first of these projects \u2014 on Vio Island \u2014 will be the start of a programme that we hope can be replicated throughout the Pacific. We are working to secure our infrastructure from extreme weather events, such as by putting power lines underground and raising roads along our shores that are already threatened by the rising seas. We started building back better after Cyclone Winston and we will continue to build back better so that homes, schools and public infrastructure are more resilient.\nWe are relocating threatened communities to move them out of harm\u2019s way. Our Climate Relocation and Displaced People\u2019s Trust Fund is operational and we are seeking global support to assist our displaced people and to move the infrastructure they rely on, such as schools, health centres, roads, bridges and public utilities. We are raising money ourselves in Fiji for the Fund through an environmental levy, but this effort needs to be scaled up.\nFor me, personally, one of our most exciting initiatives is to preserve and plant more of our forests and mangroves and to monetize these through carbon-trading arrangements in the international marketplace. In addition to reducing our own carbon footprint as an important component of our revised nationally determined contribution, we want to fire the imaginations of our people and encourage them to protect our trees, our mangroves and our coral, too. This is because they will not only have natural value, but will be worth serious dollars and cents.\nFiji is also becoming one of the first countries to enshrine our implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and other strands of our climate campaign in a new national law. The Climate Change Act gives us the legal tool we need to place climate action and ambition at the centre of national life. When it is enacted by our Parliament within the next few months, the decisions of the Government and the private sector will have to factor in climate change and other laws will be amended to fall into line with the Act. The draft legislation is now online for public feedback on the Fijian Government\u2019s website. It is ground-breaking and something other countries can emulate \u2014 state-of- the-art nationally determined contribution enhancement, guided by a long-term vision and backed by force of law that reinforces Fiji as a global leader in the climate fight.\nAll of these measures are part of a holistic response to secure the future of every Fijian. However dire the climate threat may be, our people can rely on my Government to do everything we possibly can to protect them, especially in times of crisis. For 13 years, empowering our people has been the hallmark of my Government. We have done so, first and foremost, by levelling the playing field so that every Fijian enjoys equal opportunity in our new democracy. We are providing free education for the first time so that no\nFijian child is left behind, ending the heartbreak of parents unable to send their children to school. We are providing more access to higher education with scholarships and tertiary loans, training tradespeople and building national capacity in our network of technical colleges.\nWe are providing better access to health care, plus free medicine for low-income earners, and entering into public-private partnerships to improve our hospitals. We have raised social wages and extended maternity leave, family care leave and paternity leave. We have improved our standards of governance and accountability, fighting corruption and prudently managing the nation\u2019s finances. We are ensuring that those living in rural and maritime areas enjoy the same access to services as those in our towns and cities, providing incentives for investment and creating a record number of jobs. We are harnessing the might of multilateralism through deeper partnerships with \u2014 and leadership within \u2014 financial institutions and development organizations.\nFiji\u2019s willingness to give time and energy to answering critical global calls to action, whether in peacekeeping, addressing climate change or preserving our oceans, has earned us unprecedented respect. The reason these achievements have ultimately been possible is because my Government has united the country, empowered our people and given them a sense of purpose. They will not permit those who would seek to divide us and take Fiji backwards to ever succeed.\nBut all of that progress remains at risk if the world does not heed the voices of our young and summon the collective will to confront the climate threat. It is our duty, as the leaders of our own generation, to secure the future of our planet and our only home \u2014 for them and for the generations to come. We must lay out a vision of the great opportunities that await the world when we embrace a sustainable energy future and a sustainable future for all living things.\n"

        "file_text": "I bring fraternal greetings from His Excellency Mr. John Pombe Joseph Magufuli, President of the United Republic of Tanzania, who, although he so much wished to personally attend this very important gathering, was not able to do so due to other exigencies at home. He therefore asked me to represent him and deliver this statement on his behalf.\nIn that respect, I would like first of all to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I would like to assure you that you can count on the full support and cooperation of the Government and people of the United Republic of Tanzania as you discharge your responsibilities. I also want to pay a glowing tribute to your predecessor, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces \u2014 first for being only the fourth woman in the history of the United Nations to hold such a prestigious position, and secondly for the efforts, commitment and effective leadership that she demonstrated during her tenure.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s Assembly session is \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d. Needless to say, it is very appropriate and timely. It is appropriate because, as we are all aware, four years ago, in September 2015, the Assembly adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which integrates three key dimensions of sustainable development \u2014 economic development, social inclusion and environmental sustainability. Coincidentally, in November of that same year, Mr. John Pombe Joseph Magufuli assumed the presidency of the United Republic of Tanzania. The new Administration brought new strengths, thoughts and zeal to the work of the economic transformation needed to improve the welfare of the people of the United Republic of Tanzania, especially vulnerable groups.\nThe Administration\u2019s main agenda is eradicating corruption, instituting ethics and discipline in public service and increasing tax collection as a strategy for achieving quick socioeconomic growth. Its efforts are also aimed at improving the quality of education in the country, eradicating poverty and tackling unemployment. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that over the past four years, the Government has been able to live up to its promises by delivering for its citizens in many ways. In July we presented a voluntary national review of our SDG progress at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, convened under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council, highlighting our achievements in the implementation of the SDGs in both mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar.\nOur Government, in the understanding that good governance is critical to eradicating poverty and achieving socioeconomic development, has taken bold measures to fight corruption at all levels, including by establishing a corruption and economic crimes division in the High Court of Tanzania. We have also taken measures to prevent wasteful Government expenditures, including by improving the management of fiscal and financial discipline and ensuring accountability and transparency in the Government. In addition, over the past four years the Government has been implementing various reforms. In 2017, for example, to ensure the proper management of natural wealth and resources, it enacted laws on natural wealth and resources and on contracts for such resources. That legislation is inspired by and premised on resolution 1803 (XVII) of 1962, on permanent sovereignty over natural resources, and on the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, adopted in 1974 in resolution 3281 (XXIX).\nThose reforms, among other things, have helped to increase Government revenue collection from an average of TSh850 billion per month to TSh1.3 trillion per month. Thanks to the new mining law, revenues from the mining sector have also increased exponentially, from TSh191 billion in the 2016-2017 financial year to TSh335.18 billion in the 2018-2019 financial year. As a result, the Government has been able to increase its development budget allocation to 40 per cent, as compared to 25 per cent in 2015. Consequently, we have been able to implement strategic economic infrastructure projects, improve social services to our citizens in terms of education, health, water and sanitation and increase the availability of electricity.\nSince December 2015, the Government has embarked on providing free education in public primary and secondary schools. Through that initiative, pupils\u2019 enrolment in primary schools has increased by 35.2 per cent, providing access to basic education for children from extremely poor households and those living with disabilities. The Government allocates about TSh23.865 billion every month to implement the programme. Since 2017, the Government has employed 18,181 new primary and secondary schoolteachers in order to improve the quality of education and reduce pupil-teacher ratios. It has also built new school infrastructure and provided educational equipment and materials. At the tertiary level, the number of students who benefited from higher-education student loans has also gone up, from 98,300 in 2015 to 122,663 in 2019, as a result of a budget increase from TSh365 billion in 2015 to TSh455 billion in 2019.\nWith regard to the health sector, it is gratifying to note that one of this year\u2019s main themes of discussion of the General Assembly is universal health coverage. Through its two major public health prepaid schemes \u2014 the community health and national health insurance funds \u2014 the Government increased the number of beneficiaries from 20 per cent of the population in 2015 to 33 per cent in March of this year. In addition, as of March, 352 health facilities \u2014 304 new health centres, nine hospitals and 39 dispensaries \u2014 had either been constructed or rehabilitated countrywide since December 2015, bringing the total number of health centres in the country to 696. Furthermore, the Government is building 67 new district hospitals. We have reformed procurement and logistical processes for medical supplies and thereby increased the supply of medicines in our health facilities, so that the availability of 312 essential medicines in the country is now at 79 per cent.\nWith regard to the energy sector, the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania has embarked on a major programme of rural electrification through which 5,109 villages have been supplied with electricity since December 2015, bringing the number of our villages with electricity to 7,127 out of a total of 12,259. As a result, 67 per cent of the population now has access to electricity, as compared to less than 50 per cent in 2015. In order to guarantee affordable and reliable energy, the Government is implementing several power-generation projects, including the Nyerere hydropower project, which, when completed, will produce 2,115 megawatts, more than the amount of electricity that Tanzania currently produces in total.\nWith regard to water supplies, about 71 per cent of the population now have access to clean and safe water, as compared with 56 per cent in 2015. In addition, new water projects are being implemented across the country at an estimated cost of TSh1.666 trillion, which is equivalent to around $650 million. With regard to transport infrastructure, since December 2015, the Government has constructed more than 2,000 kilometres of tarmac roads and expanded its major airports in Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar, Mtwara and Tanga. In August we inaugurated the new terminal 3 at the Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam. The expansion or upgrading of other airports in the country, including terminal 3 at the Abeid Amani Karume International\nAirport in Zanzibar, is still ongoing. In addition, the construction of 722 kilometres of two phases of standard-gauge railway for our central corridor is progressing well and is expected to be completed in 2021 at an estimated cost of $3 billion.\nClimate change and environmental conservation are a priority of the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, 38.12 per cent of whose total land is designated as protected. That includes national parks, game reserves and natural protected forests. In that regard, this year the Government established four more national parks, increasing the total number of national parks to 24 in order to protect our ecosystems, forests, biodiversity and land as part of our environmental conservation. In addition, in June we banned the use of plastic bags in the country and have continued to reduce our use of fuel-oil and diesel-propelled electricity, which now accounts for only 5.6 per cent of our electricity. Furthermore, in order to reduce the impact of climate change, the United Republic of Tanzania is investing in renewable energy. However, our efforts have been constrained by the high cost of renewable energy technologies. We therefore urge the international community to collaborate in order to make renewable energy technologies accessible and affordable.\nThe Government of the United Republic of Tanzania remains committed to promoting democracy, good governance, human rights and the rule of law. Indeed, those democratic principles are guaranteed in our Constitution. As I speak, there are 21 registered political parties operating freely in the country, and some are represented in Parliament. In the case of Zanzibar, three opposition party leaders are in Government and one of them is here with us today. The United Republic of Tanzania also has a vibrant and diversified media representing different expressions of opinion, as evidenced by our 152 registered radio stations, only three of which are State-owned. In addition, Tanzania has 34 television stations, only two of which are State-owned, and we have also granted 172 newspaper licences. In order to improve the investment and business climate in Tanzania, beginning on 1 July of this year the Government started implementing a blueprint for regulatory reforms to improve the business environment. Through our fiscal policies, we have abolished more than 154 taxes, and we are convinced that efforts such as these will propel our country towards achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nWe are unfortunately witnessing an increasing trend within the international system towards unilateralism. In that regard, the United Republic of Tanzania once again reiterates its commitment to multilateralism and calls on all members to embrace multilateralism, not only in order to eradicate poverty, improve the quality of education, combat climate change and achieve inclusion, but also to maintain international peace and security and achieve a just and better world.\nIn August, at the thirty-ninth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), held in Dar es Salaam, the United Republic of Tanzania assumed the SADC chairmanship. Among other things, the Summit adopted the theme of our chairmanship, which is \u201cA conducive environment for inclusive and sustainable industrial development, increased intra-regional trade and job creation\u201d. The theme is premised on the fact that although the SADC region and the African continent in general are not poor, they have been compelled to be poor \u2014 despite being rich in terms of farmland, with 30 per cent of the world\u2019s arable acreage, and possessing 30 per cent of the world\u2019s known mineral resources, a population of about 1.3 billion people, a wide diversity of wildlife, ecozones and plant species that are extremely important, livestock and marine ecosystems, and hydrocarbon and mineral resources. Africa has continued to be a source of raw materials for other countries and a destination for manufactured goods and services from other countries. Ironically, Africa produces what it does not consume and consumes what it does not produce. That must change.\nIn that regard, Africa must vigorously pursue a path of industrialization, which will also create jobs for our young people, who constitute 60 per cent of the continent\u2019s population. I appeal to the international community to provide African countries with fair and better terms of trade. That will enable our countries to participate in the global value chain and increase the purchasing power of our people.\nThe Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, as Chair of SADC, would like to urge the international community to call for lifting the unilateral sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe. For far too long, Zimbabwe has been under sanctions that have negatively affected its people, especially vulnerable groups such as women, the elderly and children. Those sanctions have also negatively affected other countries in Southern Africa and should now be unconditionally removed.\nThis year, the United Nations celebrates its seventy-fourth anniversary. Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations stipulates that the purpose of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security. In that respect, it goes without saying that since its inception in 1945, the United Nations has recorded some important milestones, but some challenges still remain. In that respect, I wish to bring up the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been mired in a conflict situation that has persisted despite various efforts for so long. In that regard, the United Republic of Tanzania believes that support to the Democratic Republic of the Congo must be genuine and aimed at addressing the challenges facing the country comprehensively and holistically, with a view to helping it attain durable peace, stability and prosperity. To that end, we pledge to work together with the United Nations and other members of the international community to restore peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and turn it into an exporter of peace and shared prosperity.\nIn conclusion, I would like once again to reiterate our support to the United Nations and the ongoing reforms to make the Organization more relevant and representative of the global community.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I assure him of my delegation\u2019s full support and cooperation during his tenure in office.\nSeventy years ago, when the world was under the shadow of the ominous threat of extinction, perceptive men and women from 50 countries, representing all the continents of the world, appended their signatures to the Charter of the United Nations in the clear determination to save the world from the follies of the leaders of the time. Those visionary individuals envisioned a world of peace, justice and equitable relations among nations. They dreamt of a world characterized by freedom, socioeconomic development, respect for human rights and international law.\nToday we can all attest to the strides that the United Nations has made in pursuit of those goals. Indeed, the Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the Organization at the current international juncture, aptly captures the progress that the United Nations has made so far when he says, \u201cThe Organization, and its ethos of international cooperation, have yielded great and wide-ranging benefits to humankind, lifting millions out of poverty, upholding human rights and helping to forge peace in troubled lands\u201d (A/74/1, para. 1).\nDespite those laudable achievements of our beloved Organization, challenges remain on the path towards assuring humankind a bright, prosperous, dignified and secure future. We are seeing signs that hegemonic positions and unipolarity are once again emerging in the international political landscape. Climate change, the problem of refugees and migration, armed conflict and violence, internal displacement, a lack of respect for human rights, terrorism and many other challenges continue to transcend our borders. It is in that context that we hail the relevance of our theme for this general debate, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d.\nIn the space of one week, we have held four summits seeking to address the most pertinent issues facing the world right now \u2014 climate change, universal health coverage, sustainable development and financing for development. The experiences that we shared in the summits and the ideas that we exchanged should propel us to adopt policies and put in place measures in our respective countries that are responsive to the needs of our people.\nWith regard to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Lesotho has demonstrated commitment to their implementation by operationalizing the Goals through its recently adopted second national strategic development plan for the period from 2019 to 2023. The plan also emphasizes the importance of pursuing sustainable inclusive growth and creating decent jobs as the most effective route for poverty reduction. In that context, the Government recently launched a job and investment summit aimed at fostering private investment and creating new job opportunities for over 30,000 Basothos, with a particular focus on young people, women, people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups.\nIt should also be recalled that Lesotho was among the 47 countries that underwent voluntary national reviews during the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. In our review, we recognized that the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires the implementation of priority programmes under various SDGs that have a combined impact on every aspect of unemployment and poverty reduction. We also attach importance to an all-inclusive approach and the participation of all citizens in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.\nWe also recognize the need for quality education that fully responds to the needs of our country. In that regard, the Government of Lesotho is taking steps to raise the quality of basic education with a view to bestowing the Basotho with a strong foundation for skills development and an enhanced ability to participate more productively in the economic space.\nWe must nevertheless underscore the fact that the achievement of the SDGs will elude us if the least developed countries do not receive the assistance they need. The commitments made in that connection must be fulfilled. We must take concerted measures over the next 10 years to foster stronger partnerships at the national, regional and, of course, global levels and ensure that no one is left behind as we guide our countries towards the 2030 milestone. Collaboration with development partners, financial institutions and the private sector, among others, is critical.\nWith regard to climate change, Lesotho is aware of its serious vulnerability to the challenges it faces due to its location, size and topography. As a result, our Government has made a commitment to building resilience to the effects of climate change by reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 by 10 per cent using internal resources, and by 25 per cent using external resources. At the same time, we call for international assistance in our adaptation efforts in the area of capacity-building and the provision of adequate resources, in line with existing commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nWe also call on Member States to ratify the Paris Agreement and fulfil their obligations under it. And we urge those who are contemplating withdrawing from the Paris Agreement to refrain from doing so so that at this defining moment we do not spoil the benefits of our collective action. It is time for all countries \u2014 developed or developing, rich or poor \u2014 to join hands and take bold climate action to save Mother Earth.\nIndeed, we would be remiss if we did not commend the Secretary-General for his tireless drive to foster action beyond words. We particularly applaud his inclusion of young people in the global discussions on climate-action initiatives. It is my firm belief that this is a step in the right direction towards enabling them to be the drivers of climate action, since they are the generation that will affected the most in the long run.\nIn my address to the Assembly at its seventy-third session (see A/73/PV.13), I underscored the fact that peace, security and socioeconomic development will remain elusive if our countries do not implement the necessary legal and institutional reforms. The archaic laws and institutions inherited from our colonial masters, which are far removed from the realities of the twenty-first century, must be done away with now. Our journey towards national reform in Lesotho is nearing fruition. We will be concluding the process of national dialogue on the Lesotho we want next month. Parliament will also soon conclude the process of enacting legislation and creating a national reform authority with the necessary remit to implement reform.\nWithout the invaluable support of the Southern African Development Community, the Peacebuilding Commission and the European Union, the strides that we have made so far would not have been possible. We are eternally grateful to those partners. We are confident that they will continue to undertake this journey with us, including through the implementation phase. Attaining the goal of establishing transparent, efficient and accountable institutions that are free of corruption and just laws that are responsive to the needs of our people is within sight. We hope to become a beacon of inspiration for others to also undertake legal and institutional reforms with a view to finding lasting solutions to their problems.\nThreats to international peace and security persist, while conflicts continue to erupt in different parts of the world, putting the capacity of the international conflict-resolution machinery to a severe test. Lesotho underscores the imperative for prioritizing coordinated, sustained and inclusive conflict-prevention measures. It is in that connection that we reiterate our call for a reform of the Security Council with a view to making it representative, transparent and truly accountable. True reform of the Security Council must be modelled along the lines of the African common position, as enshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration. That is the only way we see the possibility of the historical injustice done to Africa and the suffering it endured being reversed. We therefore pray that negotiations on this very important subject will take place during this session.\nAs the Security Council remains paralysed in critical situations, the threat of the use of nuclear weapons continues to haunt us. The security situation on the Korean peninsula does not give us comfort. The launching of different types of missiles, in total disregard of Security Council resolutions, puts an unnecessary strain on relations among States and flies in the face of our Charter obligations. I appeal to all Member States to join hands in ensuring a safer planet that is free of weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons.\nHowever, a sense of hope is emerging. The ratification of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons has gathered momentum, despite some elements of opposition. We are hopeful that significant progress in nuclear disarmament will be made in the near future.\nIn the midst of those developments, we cannot ignore the plight of migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons as a result of terrorism and ongoing conflict in Africa, the Middle East and other parts of the world. Many undertake dangerous journeys across oceans in search of havens and countless people lose their lives in the process. While we thank the individual European countries that have opened their doors to migrants fleeing to their territory, we also call on the European Union to come up with a comprehensive strategy to resolve the crisis with us. At the same time, we must strengthen our counter-terrorism efforts through collective measures in order to put an end to the terrorist scourge that is indiscriminately causing great damage to property and resulting in a massive loss of innocent lives.\nThe United Nations was founded by peace-loving nations in the conviction that the nations of the world should be able to cooperate to resolve conflicts peacefully. That abiding conviction of our forebears must be reasserted as we build the United Nations of the future. The United Nations of the twenty-first century should be able to give humankind hope for a world of peace and total eradication of poverty.\nIt should be the United Nations that stands with the marginalized and oppressed. It should be the United Nations that takes bold steps in addressing the question of Palestine and protecting the viability of a two-State solution, with Palestine and Israel coexisting side by side in peace and within internationally recognized secure borders. Our United Nations should be the Organization that protects the sovereignty of its Member States and prevents interference in the affairs of other States, and it should not be indifferent to the plight of the people of Western Sahara, who have yearned for independence for decades to no avail.\nOur United Nations should guarantee and protect the Cuban people\u2019s right to freedom of trade and navigation and oppose unwarranted sanctions, such as those on Zimbabwe, which have resulted in the collective punishment of innocent Zimbabweans. I appeal to all members to rally behind Zimbabwe and call for an end to the sanctions that have for so long mutilated its economy and the livelihood of ordinary Zimbabweans.\nAs I conclude my statement, I want to underscore that it is not our rhetoric delivered from this rostrum that will change the global socioeconomic, political and security trajectory but rather our willingness to put our words into action that will usher the world out of ongoing misery. We are not at the helm of our countries by chance. Almighty God has allowed us to lead the world at this time for a purpose. Let us therefore all remain faithful, in the true spirit of multilateralism, to the principles underpinning the Organization \u2014 principles that envision a truly representative and effective United Nations that can be a torchbearer.\n"

        "file_text": "On\tbehalf of the Government and the people of Belize I would like to congratulate the President on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- fourth session. Unlike any other, this session represents a critical turning point for multilateralism, as appropriately captured in the theme the President has wisely selected for this debate.\nIt is becoming increasingly apparent that the challenges of our planet and its people are colliding, with far-reaching consequences. The course of action that we, the States Members of the United Nations, decide on in the next 15 months, will inevitably have a profound impact on the future of both humankind and our planet. If we choose to ignore the signs, the science and the millions striking for change, and instead proceed in the illusion that everything is going to be all right, our sons and daughters and all our heirs may well inherit an Earth that is wholly unliveable. That is our understanding of the majority view of the world\u2019s most eminent environmental scientists. We in Belize are persuaded by that view and we do not wish to bequeath such a poisoned legacy to our children, nor must we.\nIndeed, the legacy to which we are committed, the legacy that is promised, is clearly set out in the Charter of the United Nations.\n\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person ... to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\u201d\nBelize is resolved to remain faithful and true to that commitment. And in the remaining time allocated to me, I will set forth our vision of the leadership we need from the United Nations to confront three fundamental threats to our world \u2014 the runaway threat of climate change, the uphill struggle to achieve sustainable development in a rapidly changing world and the lingering threats to peace and security, both internationally and at home.\nTo our Bahamian brothers and sisters, the people of Belize extend their heartfelt condolences. We share their pain and sorrow. Belizeans are no strangers to the kind of death, destruction and utter devastation wreaked by Hurricane Dorian on the islands of the Bahamas and its people. Indeed, in 1961, 20 years before Belize celebrated its independence, we suffered a similar catastrophe when the category 5 Hurricane Hattie made a direct hit on our fledgling coastal capital and settlements south of it. The resulting devastation was unprecedented and so extreme that the World Meteorological Organization retired the name and the Government of Belize relocated our capital some 50 miles inland as quickly as we could.\nBack then, almost six decades ago, a category 5 storm was an anomaly. Today, storms of that and even greater intensity are the new norm. Indeed, Dorian joins a long list of extreme weather events indelibly etched in the minds of citizens living on small islands and low-lying coastal States the world over. Some we endure as daily occurrences, such as the incessant drought presently affecting Belize and the relentlessly encroaching seas and saltwater erosion. That which we do not experience near shore is constantly occurring offshore, in the deep ocean, where the very life-support system of our planet and its resources are slowly degenerating, deoxygenating and acidifying. Meanwhile, a million species are on the brink of extinction.\nIn the past, such disruptions to earth systems would have occurred over prolonged periods of time. But the measure of change now is our own lifetime. These events are so frequent, visible and impactful that even our children are now alarmed by them. They are witnesses to near-apocalyptic images. They are experiencing a climate crisis unfolding before their very eyes, impelling them to action and to assume leadership roles in the search for solutions to this crisis. Learned scientists are advising us that the world has at best a decade to get on the path to 1.5\u00b0C in order to ensure planetary sustainability and, for small island developing States (SIDS), our very survival. It is therefore urgent and imperative that we work to halve global emissions from their 2010 levels by 2030. We must also ensure the phasing out of coal and the achievement of net- zero emissions by 2050. Because some countries will be gravely and negatively affected by such measures, dedicated resources must be made available to enable the most vulnerable to adapt to their new realities and to compensate for the permanent loss and damage that they will inevitably experience.\nBelize thanks the Secretary-General for conveying the need for urgent action and heightened ambition. The Climate Action Summit has laid bare the mammoth challenges we face. But we must remain unbowed by the scale of the task before us. We must be defiant in our resolve to overcome the many emerging challenges. We are convinced that the solutions lie within our grasp. We must start with policies and programmes at the community and national levels. Belize is a willing climate front runner. We are committed to the SIDS ambition package and have joined the SIDS Sustainable Energy Initiative, which aims for 100 per cent renewable energy for SIDS by 2030. We are already beginning that transition at home.\nSome 54 per cent of Belize\u2019s electricity is already generated from renewable sources, and our electric company is now finalizing plans to replace a significant portion of our imported electricity \u2014 37 per cent \u2014 with 40 megawatts of local solar-powered energy. The project for the first 30 megawatts of the new solar source will be signed before the end of October, and the plant will be ready to start producing within a year after that. The company is also piloting electric vehicles.\nMy Government is combining incentives for climate and other sustainable development with benefits such as health, food security and youth empowerment. Initiatives are being undertaken that will result in large-scale reforestation drives. We are introducing climate- smart agricultural practices, and we are applying nature-based solutions through integrated coastal-zone management and sustainable fishery practices that have mitigation, adaptation and development potential. We in Belize believe that Governments must lead the way with the highest possible ambition, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, especially the 1.5\u00b0C goal. The private sector and other financial actors, including multilateral banks, must follow suit and pivot towards environmentally sound policies and climate-informed investments. People must press their leaders unceasingly and must also do their part to attenuate the drivers of climate change.\nBelize entertains no doubt that the science is clear and compelling. We are in a global state of emergency. As one of the first responders to that emergency, my country and my people urge the Assembly to join us on the front line and to take the bold measures that our people and planet need to secure our children\u2019s future. The failure to act by those with historic responsibility has already manifested in lost opportunities for the most vulnerable. A storm such as Hurricane Dorian has the potential to wipe out two times our gross domestic product and with that, our hard-earned development gains. Twenty-five years ago, the international community collectively agreed on targeted responses to address the special case of small island developing States. But with steadily mounting challenges from exogenous shocks, it has been necessary to periodically expand those responses. We have once again come to the table to account for the implementation of the SIDS agenda, and we are concerned. The midterm review of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway tells a story of a global system that is unresponsive to our unique characteristics and particular circumstances. It tells a narrative of fragmented system-wide policies, one-size-fits-all approaches and the seemingly forgotten special case of SIDS.\nSIDS are still far behind in making progress to achieve their priority sustainable development objectives. That is especially worrying because climate change is shutting the window of opportunity for us. Belize welcomes the agreed outcome of the midterm review of the SAMOA Pathway and the solemnity it brings to action that is urgently needed if SIDS are ever to have a chance of expanding our development horizons. Implementation is upon us. A swift response is needed from the international community and the United Nations system to allow SIDS to access grant and concessionary finance from which, incredibly, we are completely shut out. Many SIDS have been graduated out of eligibility for official development assistance. Absurdly enough, that means that the most vulnerable countries, which bear no responsibility for the climate crises, are being taxed to access the support that we need to save ourselves. In some cases, we are being priced out of financial markets because of our high-risk profiles. We are small, we are islands and low-lying coastal States, and we are severely exposed.\nThe midterm review outcome provides an opportunity to correct that fallacy. What we need is simple and timely access to affordable finance, smart investments and debt relief to help us break the cycle of poverty, relieve us from the stranglehold of debt and make headway with building the resilience of our people and economies. We call for a SIDS-specific resilience fund and the endorsement of a debt-for-climate swap initiative to channel investments into much-needed adaptation initiatives and green industries.\nBelize has never shirked its responsibility for national development. We remain fervently committed to advancing our growth and sustainable development strategy, with the ultimate aim of improving the quality of life for all Belizeans. In that regard, my Government has now rolled out phase three of its Belize City Southside poverty alleviation project in one of our most impoverished areas. That project, with a total value of $12 million, will see 100 houses either newly built or improved for families in need in the targeted constituencies. The infrastructure components to improve neighbourhoods and lives will wrap up the last leg of what has been a transformative multi-year initiative. Also, our food pantry programme increases every year, even if only incrementally. It constitutes one of the anchors of our pro-poor policies, continually uplifting the lives of disadvantaged citizens.\nIn education, we have achieved a milestone in bridging the divide between education and technology. In partnership with the national telecommunications company, we have deployed our DigiLearn project, which will introduce a cloud platform and service that facilitates digital teaching and online learning. Already a pilot project has been completed involving nine high schools. More than 360 students participated, and all of the schools have endorsed DigiLearn for their institutions. We anticipate rolling out DigiLearn to 43 secondary schools starting this month. Our ultimate goal is to provide a free laptop and digital classroom to every student, teacher and administrator in every high school in our country, and we aim to do all that over the course of the next five years. Importantly, we are in the process of expanding what has become another staple of our educational outreach, directed specifically towards at-risk youth in districts registering higher poverty incidence. The annual subsidies currently given to high school students for the first two years of the secondary programme will be given to every student in every Government high school in every district.\nIn April, with a view to ensuring a healthy environment for our people, we made the bold move, with the full support of our fisherfolks, to more than double the area of fisheries replenishment zones in Belize\u2019s waters. The total area of our territorial waters under no-take status now stands at 11.6 per cent and has almost tripled our marine-protected areas. Belize is also pleased to be supporting efforts to protect 30 per cent of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030 and finalize an agreement for marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction in 2020.\nBelize is making commendable strides to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but here too there is a need for greater urgency in global action and the delivery of support. Too much is at stake if we miss the 2030 targets. Young people and children are already experiencing that first-hand. Youth unemployment rates are three times those of adult s. About 1 billion children live in countries where the SDGs are out of reach. Women and girls are still suffering from substantive inequalities, and the gaps between the rich and the poor and the educated and the ignorant are not narrowing. Those are only the struggles of which we are aware. There are many data gaps that must be addressed, particularly in vulnerable countries and for vulnerable peoples, lest we inadvertently overlook even more acute issues requiring our urgent attention.\nThe United Nations has a central role in marshalling the strength of nations and other development actors in order to foster enhanced cooperation and support in accelerating the pace of attaining the SDGs. But the Organization itself is under threat, as is the concept of multilateralism. It is therefore incumbent on us to reinforce the centrality of the United Nations and to ensure that it is fit for purpose in order to harness global solidarity to act on new and emerging challenges that are likely to undermine the SDGs. The United Nations development system needs to be better aligned with the sustainable development priorities of the countries that it serves, and it needs the resources to ensure that it can support countries in achieving those priorities. Its priority, and our priority, should be to enhance the delivery of development gains for people on the ground.\nIt is regrettable that the full weight of the global commitment and action to tackle the biggest challenges of our generation, planet and future is consistently being undermined by man-made disasters. The deliberate policies and actions of countries that give rise to armed conflict or result in the imposition of sanctions, economic embargoes and blockades invariably result in the strangulation and/or destruction of the economies of the targeted countries and stymie their overall development. Sadly, and invariably, those draconian measures affect not only the targeted countries but also the regions around them. They lead to humanitarian crises, mass irregular migration and human exploitation, and they simultaneously divide regions, inhibit cooperation and collaboration and conduce greatly to the increase of persistent poverty \u2014 all unintended collateral damage, but grave damage nonetheless. When the United Nations and Governments fail to act in the face of those harmful and unjust practices, the suffering caused by natural causes are only magnified by those man-made acts.\nAt present, more than 7 million Palestinians continue to suffer under an oppressive regime. We urge a quick and just resolution to that chronic and tragic state of affairs and call for a two-State solution to be reached at the earliest possible moment.\nThe Sahrawi people are still being prevented from exercising their right to self-determination, notwithstanding their efforts to attain that right for decades.\nCuba and its people continue to labour under the weight of a protracted, unilateral economic, commercial and financial embargo that is getting worse rather than better.\nThe General Assembly has consistently and overwhelmingly agreed that those and other lingering injustices worldwide are in violation of international law and should not persist, yet they do. Belize deeply regrets that an organization founded on the rule of law should allow such exceptionalism to the rule of law to fester. The immortal declaration of Martin Luther King, Jr., could not be more appropriate: an injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere. We call on the world community to redouble its efforts to put an end to those injustices, which clearly do great harm and no visible good.\nSymptomatic of those injustices is the exclusion of Taiwan, with a population of 23 million, from representation in the United Nations. In our view, it is a travesty of justice for this institution to rely doggedly and erroneously on resolution 2758 (XXVI), adopted in 1971, to block Taiwan\u2019s participation in any of its bodies. Belize calls upon the United Nations to end what is effectively a political and humanitarian embargo against the people of Taiwan.\nThe situation of Venezuela is also particularly troubling. Not too long ago, Venezuela was a thriving country in Latin America, willingly sharing its vast resources through a progressive Petrocaribe programme, which included, inter alia, access to badly needed capital for participating regional countries on concessionary terms for infrastructure development and poverty alleviation. Sadly, the current circumstances in that country are leading inexorably to the impoverishment of the nation itself and a worsening in the social and economic conditions of the countries that benefited from it. It has upended Venezuela\u2019s integral role in the region. We call for greater efforts to bring a speedy end to the state of affairs in that country and to the undeserved hardship and suffering of its innocent citizens through dialogue and diplomacy.\nBelize accepts that the need to enlist the mechanisms of the United Nations to prevent any threat to or breach of peace anywhere should be a matter of last resort. That is why, for as long as Belize has been independent, it has engaged in diplomatic efforts to finally end Guatemala\u2019s territorial claim to our country. I am therefore very pleased to announce today that, following the commitment made in the special agreement signed with Guatemala to submit that country\u2019s territorial claims on Belize to the International Court of Justice, the people of Belize, in a referendum held on 8 May, voted by a convincing majority to authorize the Government to submit the case to the International Court of Justice. That will finally bring an end to an age-old atavistic claim that has hindered Belize\u2019s development and made more difficult the relations of friendship and cooperation that both our peoples aspire to and deserve.\nAs we comply with the requirements of pursuing the case before the Court, and during the years it will take for the case to be heard and decided, both countries are under an obligation to not allow any step of any kind to be taken that might aggravate or extend the dispute of which the Court is now seized. In that connection, Belize continues to be concerned about the illegal encroachment by Guatemalans into our territory, resulting in even greater deforestation of our protected forests, the illegal extraction of our natural resources and attempts to establish farms and residences on our Belizean territory. Belize is also concerned about activities by the Guatemalan armed forces in the Sarstoon River \u2014 our southern boundary \u2014 which pose a threat to the peace and security of the border area. Belize is strenuously seeking to establish a modus vivendi with Guatemala for the peaceful shared use and enjoyment of the Sarstoon River.\nWe take this opportunity to acknowledge with gratitude the work of the Organization of American States in facilitating the ongoing efforts of Belize and Guatemala to implement confidence-building measures, and we urge the international community to continue to support those and other similar measures.\nFinally, Belize and Guatemala are forever neighbours, and we in Belize certainly have the most fervent wish to live side by side with the Government and the people of Guatemala in peace, harmony and close cooperation. It is the same aspiration that we have for peoples far beyond our borders. Belize remains determined to defend and uphold the purposes and principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations, not only in our words but, most important, in our actions. As a responsible Member of the United Nations, it is the right and just thing for us to do."

        "file_text": "I bring warm greetings from the Government and the people of the Republic of Kiribati, on whose behalf I am very proud and honoured to address the Assembly today. In His wonderful holy name, Kam na bane ni Mauri \u2014 may all be blessed.\nI would like to join previous speakers in congratulating President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I wish him every success as he guides our deliberations over the next few days and for the remaining 12 months. On that note, I wish to assure him of Kiribati\u2019s support, both morally and in kind, on any initiative that seeks to make our planet Earth a cleaner, greener and safer home. This is at the core of Kiribati\u2019s 20-year vision in our efforts to transform our nation into a better Kiribati home and implement the globally agreed 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nWe appreciate the Secretary-General\u2019s recent visit to the Pacific but want to highlight the need for a more balanced presence on the part of the multi-country office for the islands in the northern Pacific. At this point, I would like to pause to express our deepest condolences to our brothers and sisters of the Bahamas on the loss of many lives and the tremendous damage to homes caused recently by Hurricane Dorian.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s session, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, is a reminder of the fact that for our national development action to be effective, we need a stronger global political alignment at the multilateral level in order to ensure that support and assistance are delivered to those who matter the most and according to their needs and priorities.\nPoverty and inequality remain humankind\u2019s biggest dilemma and challenge. The social and economic security of any nation can be strengthened only if the support system addresses people\u2019s needs and empowers them at the household level. It is therefore critical that United Nations programmes target the family at that level, where the fragmentation of values creates a fault line in our societies.\nThe Kiribati Government has made a substantial investment in subsidizing copra, targeting households and coconut farmers. In our narrow economy, the goal is to benefit not only those who are in poverty but those who have been deprived of the opportunity to improve their social and economic status. This is driven by our strong desire to uplift the economies and lives of the 49 per cent of our people on our outer islands, who for years have been deprived of their share of development.\nThe Government invested A$32 million in 2017 and A$31 million in 2018 in the copra industry. To ensure sustainability, we are assessing the policy impact, as well as farmers\u2019 voluntary contribution to superannuation for retirement savings, supported by financial literacy measures. Strengthening the inclusion of marginalized and often forgotten segments of the community is core to our egalitarian culture, with a A$4 million senior- citizens and special-needs subsidy programme this year. This underlines our values and our recognition of the importance of our elders in our traditional cultural system, and we are very proud that we have taken steps to duly recognize their importance legally.\nTo further demonstrate the commitment to leaving no one behind, our investment in outer island infrastructure, including wharfs, jetties, roads and airstrips, is now also under way. The Government has already provided A$60 million, A$30 million in 2017 and earmarked another A$30 million for 2020, and we thank the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank for their additional financing of A$40 million for outer-island maritime infrastructure. These investment projects address our isolation challenge by enabling trade and the mobility of people, goods and services, as well as by strengthening the delivery of public services while reducing the cost of accessibility.\nSomething more fundamental to Kiribati, as a group of island atolls, is our basic right to water. We are fully leveraging our partnerships; the A$58 million South Tarawa water supply and sanitation project will be co-funded by the Green Climate Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. My Government contributed 12 per cent to this project, consisting of a cash contribution and in-kind provisions. It is clear that we cannot wait, for the damage caused by climate change is a daily experience in our lives. This life-changing project will provide a 24-hour clean water supply for all residents of South Tarawa, the capital, for the first time this week by harnessing our ocean to provide clean drinking water.\nWe also acknowledge the Government of New Zealand\u2019s support in contributing A$700,000 to our sanitation component, which will transform hygiene and sanitation standards for our people at the household and community levels. Those bold infrastructure projects highlight our ownership of our development challenges in co-investing our own funds, owing to our atolls\u2019 scattered geography, which makes infrastructure more expensive, due to the high logistical costs, risks and challenges. Those critical investments will be game-changers for Kiribati\u2019s development curve. We acknowledge the support of our development partners. Equally important are the lessons learned from our partnerships, and the importance of respecting a nation\u2019s right to do what it sees as serving its best national interest.\nEducation is the backbone of a nation in inspiring the future of its citizens. We have embraced that through our investment in the education sector, with it having the third-largest share, at 23 per cent, of the 2019 fiscal recurrent budget of A$28 million, which is equivalent to 11 per cent of our gross domestic product.\nIn addition to that, we acknowledge the Australian Government\u2019s support to the Kiribati Education Improvement Programme and other donors throughout the educational value chain, with a development budget allocation that is equivalent to 28 per cent of our gross domestic product, making education the third-largest sector for development intervention after infrastructure and copra. In 2016, we also introduced our new free education policy, ending the national quota system and for the first time enabling all I-Kiribati students who achieve a pass grade to pursue their full studies with Government\u2019s support.\nWith a fragile population of 110,000, almost half of whom are young people, I am convinced that such an investment will yield a population dividend that will raise our nation. Removing constraints by, for example, providing transport to school for students, has also improved school attendance rates. My Government is expanding its vocational and technical training in the country\u2019s rural areas. It is our aspiration to drive inclusive education by improving access to education and by ensuring quality education for all.\nWe have also invested A$1 million in our preschool- level education for teachers, who have the important responsibility of nurturing and educating our young ones. That new early-childhood education initiative is a key catalyst for intergenerational transformation towards sustainable development.\nThe alarming dilemma of our present time, that is, climate change, is without question of great importance to Kiribati and our Blue Pacific. The signs validated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C were already evident to us before such reports were even released. We have already secured green-climate funding for one project and are now strengthening access to climate finance, which we have earmarked through our climate change policy and our integrated Kiribati joint implementation plan. That will drive the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals to secure the future of our young people and generations to come.\nThe current negotiations on the draft international legally binding instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction are of key importance to Kiribati and the Pacific. We urge that any outcome of those negotiations should in no way jeopardize the health and wealth of the long stretch of oceans defining the Blue Pacific, on which our livelihood depends. Our maritime boundaries are critical to the Pacific region, mapping jurisdictions over our waters, continental shelf, exclusive economic zones and resources. The recent IPCC report is clear that the rising sea levels have the potential to profoundly shift the baselines, thereby altering legal entitlements regarding the spatial extent of our delineated boundaries endorsed by the United Nations.\nThe IPCC reports serve as a catalyst for informed decisions on action by Governments, and now multilateral policies for actions to ramp up our commitment to implementation. The same boundaries should also apply to our upper airspace, with the State having a role in its management consistent with International Civil Aviation Organization policies. That is critical to securing the future of Kiribati and the Blue Pacific in this world.\nFrom a small island perspective, the overengineering of the development of small island States is a risk. With regard to the theme of galvanizing multilateral support, I implore the Assembly to consider the complex web of bilateral and multilateral support pouring into small fragile countries such as ours without the capacity to coordinate all that support more effectively.\nKiribati will start to take control of that situation, as it is beginning to stretch our already scarce Government resources, risking diluting the impact of development. Forty years after becoming a sovereign nation, these consolidation and maturity processes will be a critical pivot for our small nation, where we aspire to reflect the perfect harmony of our Kiribati dance in the way that we administer and align the coordination of our agile development process.\nI note the term \u201cisland paradox\u201d, describing Kiribati\u2019s precarious situation, whereby it has graduated from being a least developed country and yet is in a permanent state of fragility and vulnerability while maintaining a relatively high gross national income per capita.\nWe live in a paradox every day, with the blue ocean that we have now coined as our regional approach to climate consciousness at the very core of who we are in Kiribati. In truth, we are essentially being categorized as an anomaly in the system of classification of nations. Perhaps the members of the Economic and Social Council and United Nations scientists should visit, see and experience the island paradox of Kiribati. I challenge members to come to the islands, in particular to hear the voice of our young people calling, \u201cWe are not sinking, we are fighting\u201d, as they joined the voice of millions of children around the world in their climate change strike last Friday. It is amazing how those young children mustered their efforts to address the world leaders and even attend. I want to acknowledge the presence of that brave young girl from Sweden, Greta Thunberg. I join and echo the voice of our young people and raise the challenge, particularly to those who have an enormous ability to do so, to act rightly, to act now and to be seen by the young watchful eyes as a good neighbour in our one home, where we all live.\nFurthermore, the turbulence that we continue to face in our world today has emerged because of continued greed and hunger for power and dominance. We have had our own taste of that at the national level in the form of the legacies of the Second World War, in particular the battle of Tarawa, phosphate extraction on the island of Banaba and nuclear testing in the eastern part of our country and on Christmas Island.\nThe consequences continue to have an impact to this day, including through implications for our people\u2019s health. The destruction of our land continues to deprive our people of their right to live freely, and many are still\nliving with unresolved issues. Those are some of the unaccountable practices and breaches of human rights that warrant compensation from those responsible. As a champion of anti-corruption, Kiribati will continue to pursue fair settlements and compensation for our people, who continue to suffer the consequences of those unjust practices.\nWe believe that the real and true test of the success of the United Nations is to be measured not in the number of treaties concluded or resolutions adopted but rather in how much it improves the lives of the most vulnerable, oppressed and disadvantaged people on the ground. That is why we gather here each year. Our theme, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d calls for a true reform of our multilateral system.\nThe business of a development business exists because of its customers. We the countries are the customers in that regard, and any reform of the multilateral system must therefore consolidate the various multilateral interventions into a coherent country-centric programme. I wish to conclude by sharing with everyone in this Hall our traditional blessing, Te Mauri Te Raoi Ao Te Tabomoa, which means \u201cpeace, health and prosperity upon us all\u201d.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to salute all present from this important rostrum. I hope that this session will represent a further decisive step in the search for peace and international security and towards a fairer and more balanced relationship among all nations.\nOngoing political and military conflicts, including pervasive economic inequalities, pose a permanent threat to all humankind \u2014 a fact that compels us to unite in a common effort to solve the real problems that constitute our priorities, such as by protecting the environment and definitively eradicating hunger and\npoverty, endemic diseases, human trafficking, drug trafficking, illegal immigration, terrorism and other threats against peace, in order to create an environment conducive to social progress and development. In order to meet those noble goals, it is imperative that we focus all our efforts on the peaceful resolution of conflicts that have created a permanent climate of tension and imminent war in some countries.\nWe stand for multilateralism in international relations, as it alone contributes effectively to the world\u2019s peace and security. For that reason, it is never too much to insist on the need for a deep reform of the United Nations, so that the Organization can better fulfil its great responsibility for conflict management and resolution and the prevention of war. We reiterate the need to increase the number of permanent members of the Security Council, in particular to include members from Africa and South America, as the current composition, which at the time of the Council\u2019s formation mainly comprised the winning Powers of the Second World War, no longer reflects the need for a fairer global geostrategic balance.\nThe prevailing tension on the Korean peninsula, which constitutes a danger to world peace, should remain one of the major concerns of the international community. We therefore encourage and commend the diplomatic efforts being made by the major world Powers \u2014 the United States of America, Russia and China \u2014 to make that part of our planet a zone of peace and security.\nWe are also concerned about the perpetual Middle East conflict. It is crucial that the many relevant Security Council resolutions be upheld, in particular those calling for the establishment of an independent Palestinian State that can live in peace with the State of Israel and for those two countries to develop normal neighbourly relations and economic cooperation.\nWith regard to the growing tension in the Persian Gulf, where extensive reserves of crude oil are threatened by latent conflict that imminently endangers global energy security, we call on all parties to exercise moderation. The best solutions are found at the negotiating table.\nAfrica, our continent, has been ravaged by terrorism, especially that of a religious fundamentalist nature, which affects countries such as Mali, the Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Chad, the Central African Republic and Somalia, to name just a few. The international community \u2014 and the African Union in particular \u2014 should pay special attention to the need to normalize the political situation in Libya, as its territories, which are controlled by different militias, constitute the logistical source of the arms and ammunition of the fundamentalist groups operating in Africa.\nAngola has made a modest contribution to conflict prevention and resolution as often as it can, in particular in the Southern African Development Community and the Great Lakes and Central African regions, the most recent case being the Rwanda-Uganda memorandum of understanding signed in Luanda, which seems to represent an important step towards preventing a simmering conflict that was about to break out.\nI would like to take this opportunity to call from this rostrum for an end to the decades-old economic embargo imposed on Cuba, especially given the recent window of opportunity for rapprochement and normalcy of relations. Allow me to also call for an end to the current trade war between two economic Powers, the United States and China, considering the negative consequences that are already being felt in the global economy.\nThe world is helplessly witnessing the effects of climate change and global warming, which have been worsening as confirmed by the latest scientific studies, as well as the rapid rise of natural hazards and their devastating consequences, such as the typhoons, cyclones, tsunamis, floods and even severe droughts that are proliferating around the world.\nStark examples of such hazards are multiplying all over the world, which leads us to associate ourselves with those who point out the responsibility of those who persist in ignoring those signs and feel entitled to continue supporting polluting industries. We welcome the initiative taken by the recent protests in many countries around the world, which have become a true symbol of advocacy to preserve the environment and defend our planet \u2014 our common home.\nLet us work together to preserve the remaining rainforests in South America, Africa and Asia, such as the forests of the Amazon and Congo river basins, which have not yet been completely devastated by humankind. Those are the planet\u2019s last reserves for oxygen renewal and also absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants that deplete the ozone layer.\nAlthough noble and fair, the Sustainable Development Goals, which were intended to give continuity to the Millennium Development Goals, are not themselves a guarantee of better results in the future. In order for us to achieve the desired levels of sustainable development, it is important to make the expected outcomes of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the object of positive brainstorming on alternative projects that are appropriate to the political situations and concrete realities of the countries most affected.\nConflict, hunger, misery and disease cannot be eliminated by political and bureaucratic solutions alone, but also \u2014 and more importantly \u2014 by good governance, combating corruption and other social evils, protecting the environment and strengthening values such as human dignity, responsible and inclusive citizenship, social justice and equal opportunities.\nIt is important in that context to highlight the role of young people, the only force capable of overcoming all those challenges. It is imperative to enhance the quality of their education, both technically and culturally, so that their specific training takes into account the contribution of the different cultures and civilizations which, for centuries, have helped us to better understand and love the world of our fellow human beings. It is with firm hope in the commitment of young people that I remain optimistic and continue to believe that we can bequeath a better world to our descendants.\nSpeaking of Angola in particular, I would like to highlight the major ongoing reforms that aim to build a truly democratic State that respects the rule of law, fights corruption and impunity, and promotes a culture of accountability among civil servants. Such reforms will create a business environment that is more attractive to domestic and foreign private investment, thereby increasing the domestic production of goods and services, reducing the import of foreign goods and increasing the range and quantity of exportable domestic goods as well as the supply of jobs.\nThe Government is addressing all those challenges very seriously and transparently. Among other measures, approximately 150 State-owned companies and assets from different sectors of the economy, including the oil and gas sector, are being privatized. We have also launched an ambitious plan for the construction and rehabilitation of water and energy production and distribution infrastructures, as well as the construction of hospitals, educational establishments and secondary and tertiary roads and other repairs across the country\u2019s 164 municipalities, the budget for which has already been secured.\nFinally, I take this opportunity to declare that Angola is now open to the world and to foreign investment in all areas of its economy.\n"

        "file_text": "In this high-level week, we are confronted with a major challenge, namely, to believe and invest in multilateralism and the irreplaceable role of the United Nations. A few months ago, the Secretary-General used the expression \u201ca world of trouble\u201d to describe the breadth and complexity of the challenges that we are called upon to confront \u2014 climate change, armed conflicts, human rights, inequality and trade disputes. Our debate is focused on subjects of great scope, namely, the fight against poverty, quality education as a source of personal and social opportunity and action to protect the environment. The common thread of those topics is inclusion and putting the human person at the heart of the political action of the United Nations and every Member State. Inclusive humanism, an expression to which I love to refer, recognizes the equal dignity of every individual and is the true achievement of modernity.\nItaly invokes and openly supports effective multilateralism because only collective and coordinated action can lay the groundwork for appropriate solutions to the multiple challenges before us. Effective multilateralism must be nourished by a concept of what the international community can contribute based on cooperation, transparency and the principle of equality among States in order to correct the dysfunctional aspects of globalization. But the inspiration, the north star that must guide that multilateralism is respect for the human person, starting with the recognition of personal and social dignity. Without such a foundation multilateralism becomes a mere tool, which undoubtedly can be useful but cannot be expected to guide the making of solid choices based on values. That humanism is the distinctive feature of the Government over which I preside.\nOur objective is to foster a genuine human democracy. At times, we see our democratic institutions as based solely on the interplay of majorities and minorities. We forget that behind those numbers are human relationships, but if we can keep that fact in mind, then our systems of Government will show a human face and not devolve into authoritarianism. Those are the principles, together with the basic principles enshrined in the Constitution of the Italy, that we embrace as we envision the society of tomorrow.\nWe in Italy have begun a new period of reforms, which seeks to build a sustainable future for all those who will come after us. It is a project that focuses on solutions that will improve the lives of citizens and respond to the urgent needs of our society. It is a path strengthened by measures for social inclusion and equality that we have already adopted and which we will carry forward and implement with the utmost determination.\nTurning to the international stage, our strategy for tackling the root causes of destabilization must be ambitious. Four years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we now need to accelerate and intensify the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, while focusing on the most effective medium- and long-term policies. Italy is deeply committed to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. We are expressing our commitment in the private sector, through our major corporations, and in our civil society, which has a strong sense of tradition, awareness, capacity for action and proactive stance on these issues.\nOne of the priorities of the recently formed Government is to give life to a green new deal, reorient the entire system of production towards sustainable development and encourage socially responsible behaviour on the part of all economic stakeholders. With regard to the phenomenon of climate change, we fully agree with the urgent need for global action to respond to the challenge, as voiced yesterday at the Climate Action Summit.\nWe have learned only recently through press reports that a glacier on the Italian side of Mont Blanc \u2014 the highest and most majestic peak in the Alps \u2014 is in danger of collapse. That alarming news cannot leave us indifferent or able to entertain the illusion that it does not concern us or that it is far off in time or space. Rather, it should shake all of us to our core and move us to take action. That is why we will continue to encourage citizens, in particular young people, to act, as I did when I met with some of them in Rome in March. We recognize the disproportionate impact that climate change will have on future generations.\nThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change is a crucial starting point, but we must remain cognizant of our moral and political duty to pass the planet on to our children in the best possible condition. Furthermore, owing to its leadership in the area of renewable energy, Italy is at the forefront in combating climate change. Italy has already met the 2020 emissions-reduction targets set by the European Union and, by the end of next year, we are committed to developing a strategy for achieving climate neutrality by 2050.\nWe will not waver in our support of the Chilean presidency of the twenty-fifth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We are particularly pleased with our partnership with the United Kingdom in preparations for the twenty-sixth Conference, the preparatory meeting of which Italy will host, as well as other important events, including one that is dedicated to young people.\nWe are aware, however, that everything I mentioned is not enough and cannot be enough. A radical change in cultural mindsets must be pursued. That is why we want to include the protection of the environment, biodiversity and sustainable development in the fundamental principles of the Italian Constitution.\nDoing so means forging a new way of conceiving of the relationship between us and the planet and between us and future generations as the basis of our social pact. It means abandoning the logic of ownership that would have us believe that we have exclusive dominion over the planet, when in fact we have inherited a right to stewardship that we must pass on to future generations.\nThe other great challenge testing the international community\u2019s ability to respond and its solidarity is today\u2019s unprecedented level of migration. With regard to national sovereignty, the phenomenon requires the sharing of burdens and responsibilities among all countries, whether they be countries of origin, transit or destination. We are coming closer to meeting that goal today through the implementation of an automatic mechanism for redistributing migrants among the various European countries. We are on the verge of reaching a crossroads, moving from an emergency phase in managing the migratory phenomenon to a structural one based on partnership among States.\nAs we all know, migration is the result of deep-rooted causes that require immediate action, together with medium- to long-term perspectives. We must all work to eliminate those root causes. At the same time, we cannot compromise on ensuring a rigorous and effective system for repatriating illegal immigrants. Italy has never failed to do its part. We continue to be involved in resettlement programmes, humanitarian corridors and emergency evacuations, but Italy is no longer alone. Europe has finally seized the opportunity to do its part without being further urged to do so.\nItaly is taking determined and decisive action at the international level to promote human rights, based on the principles of universality, indivisibility and interdependence of fundamental rights and freedoms, which must be recognized and guaranteed for all individuals without distinction or compromise. I very much appreciated the initiative promoted yesterday by President Trump on religious freedom \u2014 an issue to which Italy has always been deeply committed (see A/74/PV.3). As a member of the Human Rights Council for the three-year period from 2019 to 2021, Italy will work for the Council inspired by the motto \u201chuman rights for peace\u201d.\nWe proudly contribute to United Nations peacekeeping by providing our best forces and technology. Conflict and crisis prevention should be the political priority of every one of us, especially of the United Nations, which was created expressly to save future generations from the scourge of war. At the first signs of a crisis, we must make more systematic use of the instruments for the peaceful settlement of disputes at our disposal, starting with mediation, and involve all segments of society, including women and young people. We also promote mediation initiatives through our support for the Mediterranean Women Mediators Network, which we launched in 2017.\nI am pleased to recall a totally Italian initiative, conceived in a small village in Tuscany called Rondine. But for more than 30 years, hundreds of young people who come from countries in conflict have been invited to live together and experience daily, facts-based dialogue bringing a message of peace day after day \u2014 a message, in the greater Mediterranean above all, that we support the need to work on political solutions. One of Italy\u2019s strategic priorities is its major contribution to United Nations stabilization efforts to ensure conditions favourable to the development of a region to which our own security and prosperity are closely tied.\nAlmost nine years since the fall of Muammar Al-Qaddafi, the Libyan nation has still not been able to live in peace and prosperity. For the international community, the moment has come to renew its commitment to a peaceful, united, independent and democratic Libya. We must all act in support of the United Nations Support Mission and the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Libya Ghassan Salame. Reaching a credible ceasefire is only a first urgent and necessary step to restart an inclusive political dialogue among all the Libyan parties \u2014 the only instrument for achieving a lasting solution. That is why it is crucial that all the States Members of the United Nations conform to the obligation to respect and implement the arms embargo on Libya, thereby preventing a future escalation of the conflict. A lasting solution will also entail a reasonable compromise that can guarantee the equitable distribution and use of the riches of Libya to the benefit of the whole Libyan nation.\nFollowing the Palermo Conference, Italy has continued to push for cohesive action from the international community. That is the direction of the initiatives we are developing, together with France, Germany and other partners, in preparation for an international conference on Libya we will be hosting. I wish to express Italy\u2019s appreciation for the work done on Libya by all the branches of the United Nations and in particular by the organizations that have worked to assist vulnerable migrants and refugees. Nevertheless, on the basis of our knowledge on the ground, I hope that they will have a greater and more incisive presence.\nItaly is aware of the other challenges on the African continent. We wish to play a high-profile role at the bilateral level. That is also why the many visits I have made to Africa in recent months confirm our attention to that part of the world, with which we intend to foster greater involvement of the European Union. Aware of the importance of coordinated action between Europe and Africa, we would like to create a new partnership based upon equality. We are engaged in a pilot project to promote the social and economic development of the country, which will involve various European countries and an excellent Italian agency in the energy sector. Italy\u2019s focus on the Mediterranean entails, obviously, a strong commitment to addressing the crisis in the Sahel.\nAt the same time, we cannot forget the strategic importance of the Horn of Africa, where we have a new process of change that we must support. It is very important to note the reconciliation between Ethiopia and Eritrea in the promising birth of a transitional Government with civilian leadership in the Sudan.\nAs a founding member of the European Union and NATO, Italy is following with concern the gradual splintering of the instruments that for decades have contributed to strategic stability in Europe and the world. We have had various successes, but we must also pursue the fight against terrorism. We will work towards spreading a culture of respect for institutions and the other opinions, adopting all the instruments necessary to prevent the spread of hatred, and through words, which are not lost in a general commotion. They have weight \u2014 great weight.\nItaly also intends to relaunch national and European action in the Western Balkans, consistent with a traditional role played in favour of the stabilization of the region. There are new, growing threats to international security that demand a multilateral commitment to disarmament and non-proliferation. Italy promotes universal adherence to and full implementation of the nuclear, biological and chemical non-proliferation regimes.\nThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran continues to represent a key element of the global non-proliferation architecture. We appeal to Iran therefore to return to full compliance with its obligations under the JCPOA. It is in the interest of the entire international community that this happen, also by keeping open the necessary channels of dialogue with Tehran.\nAnother common goal should be that of lowering tensions in the Gulf region, where there is a high risk of escalation. We believe that it is in the collective interest \u2014 not only Italian \u2014 to ensure freedom of navigation, considering its major impact on the global economy.\nThe United Nations and the principles that inspired the Charter are the only point of reference today that can lead humankind in responding to the new, more complex challenges that the international community faces. We must all commit to guaranteeing that the Organization can, to the best of its ability, fulfil its mandate. Among the plans for reform, we support with special conviction the Secretary-General\u2019s commitment to the empowerment of women and girls and the achievement of gender equality as instruments for strengthening the effectiveness of the Organization.\nIn the programme of my Government, we underline the clear goal of pursuing gender equality. We cannot allow the grave injustice of women doing the same work and being paid less than men. We must pool our efforts on the process of the reform of the Security Council, making it more democratic, effective and representative of the entire United Nations membership.\nIn conclusion, there are many challenges that we are called upon to respond to as political deciders. We can be successful if we act with determination, courage and vision and if we do not make the mistake of seeking short-term consensus. We must know how to imagine a future and know how to build it in order to leave it to our children and grandchildren. Their voice grows louder every day; the duty of leaders is that of listening to their voice and translating it into concrete actions.\n"

I am pleased as well to be able to pay tribute to Mr. Hazza Al Mansouri, the first Emirati astronaut to embark on a mission to the International Space Station. I want to express our appreciation and pride in the fact that what he is doing is a major step, demonstrating that the United Arab Emirates is entering a new era in which it will contribute alongside other countries to investing in space science and building a new generation in a world based on science, technology and enlightenment.\nThis year in Abu Dhabi, in conjunction with our declaration of 2019 as a Year of Tolerance in my country, His Holiness Pope Francis and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, Ahmed Al-Tayeb, signed a document on human brotherhood that constitutes a historic message of peace aimed at promoting tolerance and coexistence.\nBuilding safe communities requires the will to take concrete initiatives and make concerted efforts to address the tensions caused by extremism. The United Arab Emirates has participated in regional and international efforts aimed at easing tensions and reaching political solutions to the crises in the Middle East, including in Libya, Yemen, the Sudan, Syria and Palestine. We believe that strengthening multilateralism is the most effective approach to de-escalating those crises and addressing transnational challenges, including extremism and terrorism, in order to achieve international peace and security. However, multilateralism has succeeded neither in resolving existing crises nor in preventing new ones. In order to achieve the goals for which the United Nations was established, we must therefore examine the problems that are obstructing international efforts and explore ways of enhancing their effectiveness.\nOur collective efforts have achieved remarkable successes in tackling the challenges of the twenty- first century, particularly in the area of sustainable development. Unfortunately, however, our efforts to bring about regional and global stability have stalled, especially in our region. Today we are witnessing violations of States\u2019 sovereignty and interference in their internal affairs. As conflicts continue and new crises emerge, we are seeing a growing presence of extremist and terrorist groups, which have developed their capabilities with the support of rogue States that aim to destabilize and dominate the region. Terrorist groups such as Da\u2019esh, the Muslim Brotherhood, Hizbullah, Al-Qaida and the Houthis have been able to access the weapons and funding they need to implement their agendas, thereby exacerbating existing crises. The terrorist attacks on our sister nation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the ongoing strikes targeting its civilian and vital infrastructure, the most recent being a heinous attack on ARAMCO\u2019s facilities, have been condemned. Such attacks not only threaten the security of both Saudi Arabia and the region but also affect the stability of the global economy. In that context, we emphasize the importance of restoring a reasoned approach and securing maritime navigation and energy supplies while working to find sustainable solutions based on respect for the sovereignty of States and non-interference in their internal affairs.\nDespite the efforts of the international community, we have to admit that multilateralism has not responded to the challenges that have emerged in the past few decades, mainly owing to weak enforcement of international law and Security Council resolutions and disregard for the role of regional organizations and States in supporting political solutions. While international mechanisms for the maintenance of peace and security do exist, an inability to take a firm stand against some States\u2019 aggressive policies has hindered international efforts.\nEven when there has been international consensus on the importance of taking collective measures to maintain peace and security \u2014 such as curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions by signing a nuclear agreement with that country \u2014 the agreement involved failed to achieve expectations in correcting Iran\u2019s behaviour and compelling it to abide by international law and the principle of good-neighbourliness. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action should have taken into consideration the views of the countries of our vital region that fully understand its history and should also have addressed every aspect of Iran\u2019s behaviour, such as its interference in the internal affairs of States, its development of a ballistic-missile programme and its provision of arms to terrorist groups. This is a country that is seeking to export its revolution.\nWe have an opportunity to achieve sustainable solutions that serve the interests of the region through a political initiative supported by the international community that focuses on the following four areas. The first is promoting the implementation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations as core pillars in preventing the collapse of the international order and preserving relations among States. To that end, we should support States\u2019 capacity to implement their legal obligations, and hold accountable States that violate those obligations. My country will continue to make it a priority to urge States to respect their legal obligations and abide by the principle of good- neighbourliness. In 48 years the United Arab Emirates has never renounced its claim to sovereignty and legitimate rights over the three islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, which are occupied by Iran in a flagrant violation of international law and the Charter. The historical records assert that the United Arab Emirates owns the islands and that they have been under Arab rule since ancient times. We therefore want to emphasize once again from this rostrum the firm position of the United Arab Emirates regarding its legitimate right to sovereignty over its three islands. We will never abandon the demand that Iran restore our rights to us. My country has called on Iran to peacefully resolve the issue through direct negotiations or through the International Court of Justice, but those calls have gone unanswered.\nSecondly, regional organizations should be permitted to play a greater role in addressing regional tensions and achieving security and stability. We should emphasize that it is they that are best positioned to develop effective solutions to the issues of their member States. This year our sister nation of Saudi Arabia hosted Gulf, Arab and Islamic summits, in a successful example of coordinating regional and international positions to address the critical security situation in the region. We also look forward to the assistance of the United Nations in promoting consultations and cooperation with those organizations when discussing regional issues. The part played by the African Union in supporting peacekeeping operations, especially its recent role in the Sudan, is a successful model that we welcome and encourage others to follow.\nThirdly, we should enhance political action and make it more effective in easing tensions and resolving crises in order to fulfil the legitimate aspirations of our peoples. That requires building trust among States and strengthening mediation efforts, including those of United Nations envoys. For that to succeed, the relevant parties must work within a comprehensive, transparent and cooperative framework. Accordingly, the United Arab Emirates considers political efforts vital as the primary option for de-escalating and addressing crises. When my country joined the coalition to support legitimacy in Yemen we focused on restoring the role of the legitimate Yemeni Government, rejecting the fait accompli that those who carried out the coup tried to impose and supporting a political process that could lead to stability and peace. Despite the violations by the Houthis, my country will continue its efforts to achieve peace. Similarly, we believe that a political path is the best option for addressing regional issues and we appreciate the efforts of the United Nations, the international community and friendly States in that regard. We welcome the role of the Secretary-General in supporting the political track with regard to the issue of the Moroccan Sahara and commend the efforts of our brothers in the Kingdom of Morocco to find a political solution to the issue.\nThe chaos that has engulfed the Arab world during the past decade made us even more committed to finding political solutions and more appreciative of the importance of the stability of States and the security of their peoples. The Palestinian question will remain the central issue of the Arab world. Stability cannot be established in our region without a just, comprehensive and lasting solution that enables the Palestinian people to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital. Violations committed by the occupying Power against the Palestinians, including the creation of new facts on the ground in Jerusalem, will enable extremist groups to exploit the suffering of the brotherly Palestinian people.\nLastly, with regard to focusing on development and investment for fostering our peoples\u2019 prosperity, the starting point should be rebuilding post-conflict countries, supporting their national institutions and strengthening their rule of law. More broadly, we need to fight extremism and spread the values of tolerance and pluralism while ensuring that women and young people contribute to such efforts, which will lead to a brighter future for all.\nWe must not forget the suffering of millions all over the world that results from war and natural disasters, whose severe impact requires intensified humanitarian efforts. In that context, my country continues to spread a message of peace by assisting those affected, regardless of their race or religion. In particular, we have also stepped up our humanitarian and development assistance in response to the crisis in Yemen, which has worsened as a result of the fact that the Houthis have been obstructing people\u2019s access to assistance and even stealing aid supplies and equipment to finance their criminal acts.\nStability has been lacking in our region for a long time, but it can be achieved through hard work and united international efforts. We believe that the next few years will begin a new era for our region, which will become a global economic and cultural centre where new technology, science, renewable energy and artificial intelligence will thrive. To that end, we are hosting Expo 2020 and seeking to launch outer-space projects and create a new environment for young people in which they can aspire to a brighter future with open minds. As individuals, Governments and peoples, we have a choice to either start a new decade in which we safeguard the future of our region and the world, or to abandon our world to terrorist groups and destructive extremist ideologies. We will continue to fight the latter with all our might."

        "file_text": "At the outset, on behalf of myself and my delegation, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, Permanent Representative of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to the United Nations, on his commendable election as President of the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly. I wish him every success in his mission and assure him of the Chadian delegation\u2019s support throughout his term of office.\nI would also like to express our sincere thanks and congratulations to Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, the outgoing President of the General Assembly, on her excellent work during her term of office and the attention given to the countries of the Lake Chad Basin, including my own, by making a field visit in May 2019.\nMay I also express my high appreciation and full support for His Excellency Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his leadership and commitment to revitalizing the role of the United Nations to better meet the enormous expectations of all peoples, through strong engagement with regional organizations. Chad welcomes in that regard the exemplary partnership that is developing between the United Nations and the African Union.\nThe theme of this session of the General Assembly \u2014 \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d \u2014 is a timely one to assess progress on the implementation of some of our commitments under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThat theme, the relevance of which I applaud, underlines both the weakness of the efforts made to address shared socioeconomic and environmental challenges and the urgent need for greater mobilization of the international community in order to achieve, in accordance with the commitments made within the framework of the 2030 Agenda, the main Sustainable Development Goals, which include the eradication of extreme poverty, access to quality education, the fight against climate change and the reduction of inequalities.\nWe note with regret that the fervour that prevailed at the time of the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in September 2015 has not been followed by convincing results in relation to the commitments made. Yet, the Agenda has been a consensus document that has reconciled the concerns and positions of all stakeholders.\nIn the absence of vigorous action and the planned resources which have not been mobilized, our shared dream of building a stable and peaceful world where all our peoples flourish together, is giving way to anguish and uncertainty, because the issue of poverty is closely linked to crises and conflicts, migration and climate change.\nThe eradication of extreme poverty is the first of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. That reflects the paramount importance of its implementation. The joint fight against poverty requires the fulfilment of the commitments made under the 2030 Agenda in terms of specific actions to be taken. The necessary resources for that purpose are well within the reach of the international community provided it demonstrates resolve and unity.\nIn that regard, Africa\u2019s priorities and expectations, which my country shares, are well known and are enshrined in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development. Four years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda (resolution 70/1), the expected results are far from being achieved. The lack of progress on all fronts is more than concerning at a time when our expectations for development are more than pressing. How can we claim to fight poverty if the commitments made to that end under the Addis Ababa Action Agenda never go beyond the pledging stage?\nI believe that it is urgent that some of our main concerns receive our collective attention, particularly with regard to the industrialization necessary for processing the tremendous natural resources on our continent, diversifying our economies, combating the illicit flows of capital that siphon significant resources from our countries, access to markets, innovative funding to support the development and marketing of technology and reforming the international financial institutions, so as to ensure the effective participation of African countries in decision-making processes that concern them.\nThe lack of tangible results in relation to commitments made also affects the fight against climate change despite the immense hope raised by the historic Paris Agreement. The serious impact of climate change is felt above all in Africa, particularly in the Sahel, as evidenced by the advancing deserts, the drying and silting up of watercourses such as Lake Chad and the Niger River, increased deforestation, land degradation and so on.\nThrough its adverse effects, climate change also exacerbates crises and conflicts over natural resources and causes food insecurity and large population displacements. It disrupts access to basic social services and increases poverty to the point of pushing the unemployed youth into the arms of terrorist groups.\nGiven that serious threat, Chad joins many other countries in reiterating its strong call for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and increased resilience to climate change. The Paris Agreement is achievable only if it is supported by concrete actions to meet the commitments made by all parties, in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.\nI would like to emphasize the urgent need to fulfil the commitment made by developed countries to mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 to meet the mitigation and adaptation needs of developing countries. The full operationalization of the Green Fund is extremely urgent in that regard.\nOur children\u2019s access to quality education is a key driver for a sustainable fight against poverty and climate change. Quality education is also a vehicle for knowledge and the transformation of our societies. It goes without saying that it is the best guarantee for a better world. However, hundreds of millions of children around the world are now deprived of access to the most basic education. The main causes that make schools inaccessible to those children continue to be underdevelopment, poverty, devastating conflicts and obscurantism, among others.\nDespite an acute economic and financial crisis, while drastically reducing our investment in key sectors, Chad continues to pay particular attention to education, allocating between 15 and 16 per cent of its annual budget to it. Over the past 10 years, student enrolment has increased tenfold. We plan to increase that rate in the budget to 20 per cent in the coming years.\nGiven the extent of educational needs, the challenges are immense and the resources available are insufficient; hence, the urgent need for continuing mobilization to act together, in a spirit of solidarity and complementarity, in support of the least wealthy countries so as to give all the world\u2019s children the opportunity to access quality education.\nFor almost a decade, Africa has been plagued by a growing rise in terrorism. The Sahel and its immediate vicinity are suffering the full force of the ravages of the evil of this century, which causes our peoples to mourn daily and jeopardizes all our development efforts.\nWithin our means, we actively participate in addressing the existential threat of terrorism as part of both the Multinational Joint Task Force of countries of the Lake Chad basin and the Joint Force of the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel).\nIn the fight against a blind and often invisible enemy developing unexpected resilience, the huge sacrifices made have not enabled us to overcome that evil. The affected States in the Sahel region spend between 18 and 32 per cent of their annual budgets on that increasingly unsustainable effort. The international community, whose support is vital to winning the fight, cannot remain indifferent to this ongoing mobilization of such States against terrorism in recent years.\nIn that regard, I reiterate from this rostrum the call of the G-5 Sahel member States to the Security Council members to provide sustainable funding for the G-5 Sahel Joint Force from the Organization\u2019s regular budget under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.\nFurthermore, in view of the ongoing pooling of efforts by the G-5 Sahel Force, the Lake Chad Basin Commission and the Economic Community of West African States, we underscore the need for greater and more tailored coordination among the actions of all actors present in the Sahel, including such international forces as the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and Operation Barkhane, while respecting the mission of each entity. Chad stands ready to make its modest contribution to this coordinated structure in order to lead a more effective fight against terrorism.\nI cannot mention terrorism and insecurity in the Sahel without mentioning the Libyan crisis, which is having incalculable consequences on the region. Despite commendable efforts by the international community to put an end to this long-drawn-out crisis, the situation remains highly worrying and continues to take a dramatic turn. Efforts to help our Libyan brothers restore peace are being compromised by inter-Libyan armed confrontations, aggravated by diverse and multifaceted external interference. Resolving this crisis requires the individual and collective awareness of our Libyan brothers themselves. They must understand that they are the primary masters and authors of their destiny, and that violence will not provide a solution to the crisis. In this war, there will be no victors or vanquished, but one loser: the Libyan people.\nWe must all work towards a comprehensive and inclusive dialogue that will bring together all the protagonists of the crisis. With this in mind, we call on all armed parties, including tribal and community leaders, to engage in a national dialogue that will serve as a prelude to the holding of credible elections. We are always ready, as we have been in the past, to support the efforts of the United Nations and the African Union to restore peace and stability to this country. The return of peace and stability to Libya is a condition for the return of peace and stability to neighbouring countries and, in large measure, the Sahel in general. In this regard, Chad calls for the strong involvement of the African Union alongside the United Nations in the search for a lasting solution through a synergy of efforts. Whatever we may say, Libya has been and will always continue to be an African country.\nThe question of United Nations reform \u2014 particularly that of the Security Council, which Africa earnestly calls for at every sessions of the General Assembly \u2014 deserves our necessary and full attention. This legitimate demand cannot be diluted by endless negotiations that have been going on for years without any tangible progress. Africa is asking for nothing more than compensation for the blatant damage done to an entire continent of more than one billion people, unjustly deprived of its legitimate place in the United Nations system. I reaffirm Chad\u2019s commitment to the Common African Position on the reform of the Security Council, as set forth in the Ezulwini Consensus, and I appeal to the sense of justice and solidarity of all nations to accelerate this much-desired, long-awaited reform.\nTo conclude, I would like to express the solidarity and sympathy of Chad with all countries facing difficult situations due to crises, conflicts or natural disasters. In this regard, Chad welcomes the momentum for dialogue and reconciliation that has begun in the Central African Republic, the Sudan and South Sudan, and urges all relevant stakeholders to redouble their efforts to achieve lasting peace in these brotherly countries. Chad also reaffirms its position of principle regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict, calling on all parties to support a two-State solution where Israel and Palestine live side by side in peace, in line with the relevant Security Council resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002.\nLastly, Chad reiterates its call for the lifting of the embargo unjustly imposed on Cuba, which is causing serious harm to the people of that country. It is because we are attached to the founding principles of the United Nations and because we believe in its ideals of peace, justice, sovereign equality between States and prosperity for all that we come every year to this great meeting that is the General Assembly. Let us ensure that the behaviour of each Member State aligns with the rules we have set ourselves so that peace, justice and solidarity may triumph around the world.\n"

        "file_text": "I am greatly honoured to address the General Assembly for the first time. I would like to congratulate the President on his assumption of the presidency of the Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I assure him that Latvia will provide active and constructive support to our joint efforts during this session.\nThirty years ago, as a young politician and lawyer, I had the opportunity to fight for the restoration of my country\u2019s independence. Latvia, like Estonia and Lithuania, was occupied by the Soviet Union at the beginning of the Second World War. Unlike in western Europe, where the war ended in 1945, the Baltic States regained their independence only in 1991. We will be forever grateful to the States that never recognized the occupation of our countries as legitimate. Our independence was regained through strong mass movements whose demands were rooted in international law, and was the result of a non-violent freedom fight, a rare occurrence in history. At the same time, it was a triumph for international law. It proves that even seemingly hopeless situations can be overcome by belief in the law and strong civil societies. Sooner or later, justice will always prevail.\nIn the 25 years that followed, I had the privilege of serving as a judge in two international or supranational courts \u2014 first the European Court of Human Rights, then the Court of Justice of the European Union. That explains why justice and the rule of law at the national and international levels is so important for the Latvian State, the Latvian nation and for me personally. I was therefore pleased earlier today to deposit Latvia\u2019s declaration joining the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice as yet another sign of our strong commitment to the rule of law and a rules-based international order.\nA strong multilateral, inclusive and rules-based international order is essential to the maintenance of global peace and security. It must be our joint responsibility to defend and strengthen it. The United Nations is and must remain the central forum for multilateralism and a rules-based global order. Experience shows that our goals are best achieved through cooperation in multilateral forums. With that aim, Latvia is actively seeking opportunities to contribute to a more peaceful and just world. For example, over the past year we are proud to have presided over the fifth Conference of States Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty.\nThe multilateral order also demands that territorial integrity and sovereignty, as enshrined in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, be respected by all States Members of the United Nations. In that regard I should point to Russia\u2019s open disrespect for the principles of international law, as its violations of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and Georgia continue. Such brazen disregard for international law must not be accepted as a new normal. Latvia\u2019s experience shows that the rule of law, like democracy and respect for human rights, is an important catalyst for a State\u2019s successful development. We will therefore strongly support the consolidation of those principles in international law.\nNowadays, violations of international law are committed not only with direct military force but increasingly through disinformation, cyberattacks, economic influence, energy pressures and interference in electoral processes. Given that such hybrid threats do not recognize national borders, no country is immune. The United Nations can and must be a significant global player in promoting peace, security and stability in cyberspace. Latvia is ready to participate actively in relevant discussions and share its experience in promoting responsible behaviour in cyberspace and boosting institutional and individual resilience to malicious intent. While there can be no doubt that digital technologies have brought humanity progress, we must be careful to prevent them from being used maliciously. There can be no excuse for unintended or unexpected consequences that undermine our societies. Technologies must be developed with greater responsibility and accountability.\nWe must be aware of the impact of technological advances on human communication and connectivity. Vast amounts of personal data are being collected every second of every day by both State and non-State actors. Our private communications, our health, location and movements can be constantly monitored. In recent times the use of facial recognition has been increasing, and we are coming under constant surveillance. Yet the rules governing the ownership, authorization and protection of that data are opaque to say the least. Our data can easily become a threat to our freedom and privacy. When we feel that we are being observed, we often adjust our behaviour and speech. The potential risks to the independence of our thoughts and actions will only grow in the coming years, given the rapid development of artificial intelligence. We must not allow artificial intelligence rather than humans to take legally binding decisions. Humans must retain control.\nThe United Nations must therefore actively promote the discussion of personal data protection in cyberspace, especially the ethical and legal standards for the collection and use of personal data. We need an intensive public discussion of risk reduction at the national, regional and global levels. The international level is essential, since cyberspace is global. We believe that the report of the Secretary-General\u2019s High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation, The Age of Digital Interdependence, and the Secretary-General\u2019s Agenda for Disarmament, which addresses key technology security concerns, are a useful stimulus for a more intensive exchange of ideas in this area.\nThe climate, too, is global. Climate change must be tackled at the international, State and individual levels. We must collaborate across borders to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. The empowerment of young people can play an important role in climate action, as we recently witnessed at the Youth Climate Summit. Technologies also have a leading role to play in healing our planet. Innovations, combined with computing power and connectivity, enable us to become more effective. I am proud that Latvian information technology companies are willing to take up the challenge and have joined the green pledge launched by our neighbour Estonia.\nLatvia is committed to the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In Latvia, we have reduced our greenhouse-gas emissions by almost 60 per cent compared to our 1990 levels, but we understand that it is not enough, and we therefore support climate neutrality as a goal for the future. We are currently working on an ambitious low-carbon development strategy that will enable Latvia to reach climate neutrality by 2050. Earlier this year, my Government approved a national climate change adaptation plan for 2030. It sets out concrete actions on adaptation to be implemented in the near future. A major solution for mitigating climate change that aligns closely with Latvia\u2019s own experience is sustainable forest management, which provides continuous carbon sinks and sustainable forest products that can replace fossil-based materials, thereby reducing emissions. Forest coverage in Latvia has almost doubled since the first half of last century, and we are committed to sustainable forest management for our current and future generations. Meanwhile, our civil society is also making efforts. On World Cleanup Day, 21 September, individuals young and old planted trees all over Latvia as a contribution to our sustainable future, building on a long-standing volunteer tradition in my country to promote a clean environment.\nLatvia remains a strong advocate of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with a view to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals both nationally and globally. The Sustainable Development Goals have changed the way we plan our own long-term national development strategy. At the national level, we are focused on two main directions \u2014 promoting an innovative and eco-efficient economy and reducing inequalities. I believe that ensuring gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment is not only the right thing but also the smart thing to do from an economic perspective. Latvia is showing leadership in this area. According to the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Report 2018, Latvia is one of the few countries in the world that has closed the gap in terms of both health and survival and in educational attainment, and it is above the 80 per cent milestone for economic participation and opportunity. Through bilateral development cooperation programmes, Latvia is contributing to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly in the European Union\u2019s eastern areas and Central Asia. We share the lessons we learned through our own transition to a democratic State, based on the rule of law.\nThirty years ago, 2 million people joined hands to make a 600-kilometre-long human chain through Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania called the Baltic Way, to demonstrate our wish for freedom. The Baltic Way and the fall of the Berlin Wall marked the end of the Cold War. Latvia was finally able to join the United Nations. We have actively used the opportunities provided by multilateralism through this unique global body, and my country and people have experienced impressive change over the past 30 years. I believe that the United Nations, too, can adapt to resolve the global challenges of today. Let us use the run-up to its seventy-fifth anniversary to make the United Nations more purposeful and valued by working with renewed determination on its own reforms, notably that of the Security Council. The United Nations must evolve if it is to stay effective. All the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are as relevant today as they were 74 years ago, when it was adopted. I am gratified that Latvia now has the freedom to enjoy those principles within its borders and the responsibility to uphold those principles across the globe.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I am pleased to be able to congratulate the President on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, and I wish him every success in his work. I would also like to thank Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her excellent leadership of the work of the Assembly at its previous session.\nOn 16 September, the General Assembly voted to adopt resolution 73/344, on the establishment of the Academy for Human Encounters and Dialogue in Lebanon (see A/73/PV.107). In that context, on behalf of my country I would like to thank all the Member States that sponsored the resolution and voted in favour of it, encouraging us to move forward with this initiative, which I launched before the Assembly two years ago (see A/72/PV.11).\nI will follow up the creation of the Academy with keen attention, because I believe that true peace is established not on paper but between human beings, and because I also have faith in Lebanon\u2019s role and vocation as a land of convergence and dialogue, and in the experiences and expertise of its people and its pluralistic society, which have enabled them to reject intellectual and religious extremism and live in tolerance and acceptance of others. The Academy is all the more important because it embodies an international project for fostering the convergence of various cultures, religions and ethnicities, while promoting a spirit of coexistence and spreading a culture of knowing and accepting the other, in line with the principles of the United Nations and with what this Organization aims for through its noble programmes, which strive to bridge the gaps between peoples and to advance the preventive diplomacy that can ultimately help to eradicate the causes of conflicts.\nTwo days ago, the Secretary-General convened the Climate Action Summit here at the United Nations. In that context, Lebanon, as one the first signatories of the Paris Agreement, joined the group of countries supporting the initiative of President Van der Bellen of Austria for a more ambitious approach to climate action.\nLebanon has also taken numerous steps this year to promote the role of women. In fact, the Lebanese Government has adopted a comprehensive national plan to put into effect Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, and has begun implementing it. We have also completed all the steps related to the work of our National Commission for Human Rights and Torture Prevention Committee.\nWhile the fierce war that raged across many countries in the Middle East in the past decade has subsided somewhat, its effects and consequences for our countries and societies are becoming more widespread and entrenched, especially at the economic and social levels. The theme of the General Assembly\u2019s debates this year is \u201cGalvanizing the multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d. I would like to once again remind the Assembly of the enormously adverse impact of the Syrian displacement crisis and its repercussions for Lebanon in the security, political, social, economic and environmental arenas, as well as on our infrastructure and growth and unemployment rates. It is a serious threat to Lebanon\u2019s ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and has aggravated our economic crisis.\nAs Lebanon strives to tackle this difficult economic situation, it is also relying on a set of drastic structural measures and reforms to its economic and financial system, in cooperation with the relevant international institutions. However, I also want to call on all world leaders to work for the safe return of Syria\u2019s displaced persons, especially considering that it is certainly not Lebanon\u2019s sole responsibility to address this crisis but rather a shared international duty that makes it imperative that we all work together urgently to find solutions to it. The international community cannot content itself with merely providing minimal assistance to the displaced and refugees in the regions where they are displaced, while ignoring programmes for their safe and dignified return. The conditions for that return are in place. In fact, as international reports have shown, the security situation in most of Syria is now stable, while military confrontations are limited to the Idlib area, and the Syrian Government has officially declared over and over again that it will welcome the return of the displaced. To date, around 370,000 of them have left Lebanon, of whom more than 250,000 have returned to Syria with no reports that they have been persecuted or mistreated.\nOn the other hand, we have many question marks about the positions of certain influential States and relevant international organizations that have been obstructing this return, and about the allegations that the security situation in Syria is dangerous. They sow fear among the displaced, in a clear indication of the political perspectives under which the displacement crisis is being tackled, as if the displaced have become hostages in an international game, to be swapped when settlements and solutions are imposed. That is very likely to drive Lebanon to promote the return process that has begun, in agreement with the Syrian Government, in order to resolve this dilemma, which is threatening our very existence. The fact is that the experience of displaced peoples anywhere in the world as they wait for political solutions is not at all reassuring.\nWe have seen two discouraging experiences in this respect in our history, one in 1974, after war broke out in Cyprus and a large number of Cypriots took refuge in Lebanon. They quickly returned to their country as soon as a ceasefire was declared, without waiting for a political settlement, which has not been achieved to this day. The other began in 1948, when waves of Palestinians were displaced to the countries of diaspora and particularly to Lebanon, where they are still living in camps, nurturing the dream of return, and where they have now been awaiting a political settlement and the implementation of resolution 194 (III) for 71 years.\nIn a related context, I want to warn against the danger of reducing the services provided to Palestinian refugees by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which have added to the social and fiscal strains weighing on them and on us and threaten to turn Palestinian school students into young people seeking revenge. In that regard, I want to note Lebanon\u2019s categorical rejection of any attempt to undermine or modify UNRWA\u2019s mandate. I call on the countries that contribute to its budget to double their contributions in order to enable it to restore its vital role.\nThe crisis in the Middle East, which has lingered for decades, is becoming more complicated, because all approaches to reaching a settlement and all of Israel\u2019s practices run counter to the founding principles of the United Nations. The Judaization of Al-Quds, the policy of systematic colonization, the laws that contravene human rights, the recognition of the annexation of lands occupied by force, as in the case of the Golan Heights, the election promises to annex new lands, with all the leaks about the so-called deal of the century, changing the borders of some States and undermining their territorial unity, while eliminating the Palestinian cause and keeping the Palestinians where they are, as well as the damage that Lebanon is likely to suffer as a result because it hosts a large number of refugees \u2014 all of these undermine any chance for peace in the Middle East and unquestionably point to a dark, unknown future. And yet people continue to have rights however long it takes.\nIsrael\u2019s violations of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) have not ceased, and neither have the continued acts of aggression against Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty by land, sea and air. Last month\u2019s blatantly hostile attack on a residential area in the heart of Beirut is a serious infringement of the resolution, while the fires that lasted for days in the occupied Shebaa farms as a result of incendiary Israeli shells represent an international environmental crime that demands that those who caused them be condemned. From this rostrum, I want to reiterate that Lebanon is a peace-loving country and that we are committed to resolution 1701 (2006) and always strive to respect it, but that commitment does not obviate our natural inalienable right to legitimately defend ourselves, our land and our people by all available means. I also reiterate that Lebanon retains its sovereign rights over the occupied areas of Shebaa Farms, Kfar Shouba Hills and northern Ghajar. We will spare no effort to affirm our internationally recognized land borders, which are firmly documented at the United Nations, and to demarcate our maritime borders under United Nations supervision, while welcoming help from any country in this respect, at a time when exploratory oil and gas drilling operations will start in our territorial waters by the end of the year, in accordance with international laws and norms.\nAs Lebanon embarks on preparations to celebrate the centenary of Greater Lebanon, the United Nations, founded on 24 October 1945, will be celebrating its seventy-fifth anniversary. Since then the world has known many wars and conflicts, especially in the Middle East, the constant flashpoint where the temperature rises or falls but never cools down. It is our peoples who continue to pay a high price with their security, stability, peace, economy and even demographic diversity. The core of the problem is the same \u2014 a contradiction between the interests of the strong and the rights of the weak. Thus, principles, logic and justice are lost and solutions disintegrate.\nThe political aberration prevailing today has cost the world its stability, now that all the guiding milestones have been undermined and there are no more criteria to confine and control differences and thereby solve them according to the applicable rules. This has made many peoples incapable of taking political decisions beyond their borders and prevented them from coming together and cooperating. Many opportunities for conflict resolution have been lost and the door has been opened wide for chaos.\nThe United Nations has undertaken many initiatives to make the voice of peace and development heard. Some have succeeded while many have not attained the desired outcome. We hope that the United Nations today will promote the general principles, international law and charters that serve as the only references for safeguarding our rights. No justice shall rise, no right shall be granted and no peace shall be established as long as the principle prevailing in our world is \u201cmight makes right\u201d.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session and to wish you every success in fulfilling this important task. I would also like to express my gratitude to Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her successful and effective leadership of the previous session of the General Assembly.\nThis session\u2019s theme of the general debate of the General Assembly \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d is particularly relevant. In recent years, the people of the Kyrgyz Republic, having set a course for building a new political system in 2010, have achieved significant results in developing parliamentary democracy, a multi-party system and the legal transfer of power, as well as in strengthening the civil sector and its institutions. One indicator of the success of the path that we chose was the presidential election in 2017, which resulted in a peaceful democratic transfer of power.\nThe functioning of parliamentary democracy clearly requires ongoing diligent work and seeking compromises, while at the same time opening up new opportunities. A strong civil society, with a balanced Government, and diverse viewpoints allow for reforms and corruption to be rooted out.\nTo date, the Kyrgyz Republic has been uncompromising in the fight against corruption. There are of course elements that do not want such changes. At the beginning of August, there was an attempt to undermine our national unity, stability and security. However, the wisdom, unity and firm belief of our people in the irreversibility of the ongoing reforms meant that the situation in our country did not deteriorate.\nThe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has set a course to improve the work of the State bodies. Profound changes are taking place. Reforms of the law enforcement, fiscal and educational systems, aimed at ensuring greater accountability and transparency, are making progress. At the beginning of the year new laws entered into force that focus on modernizing criminal legislation and promoting the reforms under way. We have launched the electronic single register of crimes and misdemeanours and single register of offences, which strengthen the capacity of law enforcement agencies and the legal system as a whole.\nIn the context of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals, the Kyrgyz Republic continues to address socioeconomic issues, including reducing unemployment, raising the standard of living of the population by implementing national programmes in the areas of education and health care, youth policies and infrastructure projects, as well as by attracting investment and creating the most favourable conditions to that end.\nThe national development strategy for 2018-2040 has an entire section on priority areas of development of the Kyrgyz Republic for the period to 2023. That includes areas such as reforming State governance, establishing a fair judiciary, developing the energy sector and introducing information technologies. As part of the Year of Regional Development and Digitalization of the Country and in implementation of the digital transformation concept \u201cDigital Kyrgyzstan for 2019-2023\u201d, significant measures are being taken to build the capacity of the regions. Digitalization is being actively implemented in the country at all levels, from kindergartens, schools and universities to Government agencies and the business community, including digital technologies in public services.\nCurrently, the number of innovative schools is increasing. Ninety-six per cent of schools in the country are connected to the Internet network and electronic health projects are being introduced. Sixty State bodies are connected to an electronic interoperability system called Tunduk and 24 State bodies have started electronic document processing.\nThere is a programme for the construction and restoration of sections of international transport corridors for the period up to 2025. For the first time in the Kyrgyz Republic, the office of Business Ombudsman and a new model of cooperation between the State and business have been established in order to create favourable conditions and protect business interests. A moratorium on the audit of businesses has been brought in for two years, until 1 January 2021. Entrepreneurs building new enterprises in the regions are exempt from four kinds of taxes for five years, with the right to extension. The Kyrgyz Republic was ranked seventieth out of 190 economies in the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2019: Training for Reform. A liberal investment and tax regime has been created, which speaks favourably of our country. The Kyrgyz Republic is among a group of countries with a developed public-private partnership sector.\nUnder the new foreign policy framework of the Kyrgyz Republic, as approved by its President in March, we pay particular attention to cooperation with the United Nations and its institutions. In the area of strategic development, the Kyrgyz Republic prioritizes achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Goals have been successfully implemented as part of the national development strategy for the period from 2018 to 2040, which seeks to further promote economic development and will help us to effectively implement the SDGs.\nAs further proof of our commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Kyrgyz Republic has requested to submit in 2020 its voluntary national review on SDG implementation as part of the high-level political forum on sustainable development of the Economic and Social Council.\nAt the international level, the Kyrgyz Republic is also contributing to the implementation of the SDGs. We hosted the World Nomad Games, aimed at preserving the diversity of cultures and traditions, which has been recognized and supported by the General Assembly and UNESCO.\nWe are grateful to the United Nations for including the Kyrgyz Republic in the financing for development project. As a mountainous country, the Kyrgyz Republic is severely affected by the negative impacts of climate change. According to the assessments of experts, the Central Asian region has experienced the accelerated melting of glaciers, which for centuries have been a source of life and clean drinking water. That will have an impact on vast areas, changing the landscape, and may affect traditional ways of life and lead to mass displacements.\nSuch consequences of climate change cannot but concern the Kyrgyz Republic as a landlocked mountainous country. With the support of Member States, the Kyrgyz Republic therefore established the Group of Friends of Mountainous Countries and calls on all to engage in broad and fruitful cooperation within that framework. In time, the Kyrgyz Republic drew the attention of the international community to the issue of the sustainable development of mountainous countries and initiated the declaration of 2002 as the International Year of Mountains. During this seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly the Kyrgyz Republic intends to again co-sponsor the updated draft resolution on sustainable mountain development.\nIn September 2018, the Kyrgyz Republic was the leading country in the number of volunteers who participated in the global action on World Cleanup Day. The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has now submitted the Paris Agreement on Climate Change for ratification by the country\u2019s Parliament.\nNo less important is addressing another problem related to uranium tailings facilities in the Central Asian region. In 2015, the multilateral Environmental Remediation Account for Central Asia was established. Last year, the Kyrgyz Republic initiated the adoption of the new resolution 73/238, entitled \u201cThe role of the international community in the prevention of the radiation threat in Central Asia\u201d. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the countries that supported and sponsored the resolution. During this session of the General Assembly, on 27 September here in New York, the Kyrgyz Republic held a high-level event that focused on preventing the dangers associated with the former uranium mining activities in Central Asia.\nThe Kyrgyz Republic attaches particular importance to cooperation in the Central Asian region, which is developing dynamically. In that regard, I wish to draw attention to resolution 72/283, entitled \u201cStrengthening regional and international cooperation to ensure peace, stability and sustainable development in the Central Asian Region\u201d, adopted in 2018.\nAt the same time, in Central Asia there are still problems, whose successful resolution requires the collective efforts of the countries of the region. It is necessary to address, as a matter of priority, the demarcation of State borders, which will make it possible to ease social tensions in such areas and prevent border incidents. Guided by principles of good-neighbourliness, the Kyrgyz Republic takes a responsible approach towards such matters. We have already achieved concrete results in that regard.\nToday, Central Asian countries must remove obstacles towards economic cooperation and increasing the region\u2019s transit potential. Separately, we are addressing the integrated use of water and energy resources in the region. Forming the main freshwater reserves, as part of existing relations, the Kyrgyz Republic seeks to receive appropriate economic compensation for the storage and conservation of water resources. Those resources are important not only to the region but for the preservation of the entire global balance. Kyrgyzstan therefore supports establishing an integrated administration for water-resource management and proposes developing economic mechanisms in Central Asia for establishing mutually beneficial cooperation in the hydro-energy sector.\nWe are also focusing on producing green electric power. The implementation of hydroelectric projects will ensure that we meet the needs of Central Asian countries in terms of hydropower, thereby creating conditions conducive to sustainable development across the entire region. In the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we believe equal attention should be paid to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7, ensuring access to affordable and clean energy. In that regard, the Kyrgyz Republic is working to implement the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project. From a regional perspective, Kyrgyzstan considers cooperation and comprehensive dialogue to be the only possible way to resolve existing issues in this area.\nEnsuring access to safe and affordable drinking water is an urgent issue for our country. According to statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Kyrgyzstan, while an area of Central Asia that is a significant source of water supplies, has the lowest per capita access to drinking water in the region. In rural areas, about 40 per cent of the population is not adequately provided with clean drinking water. In order to deal with that, my Government is currently implementing its Taza Suu project \u2014 meaning \u201cclean water\u201d \u2014 designed to provide villages with clean drinking water. In that connection, we urge international organizations, financial institutions and donor countries to support my country\u2019s efforts in promoting such projects.\nCurrent events in the world today show that no State can effectively confront its challenges and threats solely through its own efforts. The widespread expansion of international terrorism and extremism in their various manifestations, along with illegal drug and arms trafficking, human trafficking, cross-border crime and the threat of the emergence or escalation of conflicts, requires collective efforts for implementing preventive measures. In that regard, I want to emphasize that throughout its chairmanship of various regional structures this year, including the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Kyrgyzstan has highlighted the need for greater attention to the importance of constructive engagement and the adoption of comprehensive measures to tackle these challenges and threats, an approach that is fully in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations and Chapter VIII of its Charter. In that regard, we would like to thank to all States Members of the United Nations for their support in the Assembly\u2019s adoption of resolution 73/334, on cooperation between the United Nations and the SCO, and resolution 73/331, on cooperation between the United Nations and the CSTO.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to effectively implementing the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We also call on the international community to adopt coordinated measures, in accordance with Security Council resolution 2178 (2014), to prevent people who have previously participated in armed conflict on the side of international terrorist organizations from returning to their countries of origin in Central Asia or from redeploying to our region. We believe that given the existing and emerging centres of instability around the world, the role of the United Nations should be strengthened as much as possible. In that regard, we support the peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflicts and crises around the world by promoting dialogue between all political and military forces under the auspices of the United Nations.\nIn the light of everything I have mentioned, I want to once again draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the fact that on 9 June 2017, Kyrgyzstan, in its efforts to make a substantial contribution to the common cause of the United Nations \u2014 ensuring peace, global security, sustainable development and social progress all over the world \u2014 as well as to focus the attention of the international community and the United Nations on the problems of small States, put forward its candidacy for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the period from 2027 to 2028. In the years since it became independent, the Kyrgyz Republic has gained significant international experience as a Member State. We have been selected a number of times to become members of various elective United Nations bodies and specialized agencies, including the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme, the Commission on Sustainable Development, the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations and the Commission on Narcotic Drugs. Kyrgyzstan has twice been elected to the Human Rights Council, in May 2009 and October 2015. The Kyrgyz Republic is also a member and depositary of the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia, and we strongly support international cooperation in the reclamation and destruction of radioactive waste and the restoration of contaminated land.\nThe Kyrgyz Republic pays great attention to preventive diplomacy, peacebuilding and peacemaking. We have positive experience of participating in the settlement of international and local conflicts, in United Nations peacekeeping operations and within the framework of the Peacebuilding Fund, and we are also contributing to the process of restoring Afghanistan. We believe it is essential that the international community focus greater attention on the prevention of conflicts and the fight against terrorist and extremist activity. With regard to the issue of Security Council reform, and in order to strengthen the consolidating role of the United Nations and adapt its activities to current realities, Kyrgyzstan supports the adoption of the reforms needed to improve it, based on the principles of universality, effectiveness and broad geographical representation.\nWith the essential support of the United Nations, our country is making efforts to implement multifaceted and diverse reforms, which are confirmed by the assessments of Kyrgyzstan put forward by the international non-governmental structures that are carrying out research and establishing ratings on important issues pertaining to our progress in sustainable development. According to the April 2019 World Press Freedom Index, the Kyrgyz Republic ranked eighty-third out of 180 countries, improving its ranking by 15 places. We have also ratified eight of the nine international human rights treaties. On 7 May, Kyrgyzstan ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In 2018, we successfully completed our term on the Human Rights Council. According to data from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, this year Kyrgyzstan became the first country in the world to resolve its stateless problem, having reduced the number of stateless persons from 13,000 to zero over the past five years.\nWe are still facing many challenges in the area of the protection and promotion of human rights. We are keen to harness the potential and experience of the United Nations and other international partners with regard to the specifics of our national development and the historical and cultural traits peculiar to the Kyrgyz Republic. Our active and productive cooperation with the United Nations system is evident in the growing presence of its institutions in our country. We intend to continue our joint work, and we are very interested in the possibility of attracting additional structures and expanding the United Nations presence in our country.\nThe United Nations is a key global centre for solving the problems of maintaining peace and security, developing friendly relations between nations, cooperating to address development issues, reducing poverty, promoting human rights, protecting the environment, fighting disease and tackling many of the other challenges and problems facing humankind. We are an open country, ready for mutually beneficial dialogue and trustworthy and cooperative partnerships with States. We believe that together we can solve the challenges we face in striving to maintain peace and security and ensure the sustainable development of all States, including by improving the standard of living and well-being of all peoples."

        "file_text": "I wish\t to \tcongratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his assumption of the responsibility to steer the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I assure him of Sierra Leone\u2019s full support during his tenure. I also applaud Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces of Ecuador for the effective manner in which she conducted the previous session. I also commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his overall dedication and commitment to the work of the Organization, including his efforts to advance the urgent need to address climate change.\nWe commit to our prayers memories of the late President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. He was a dedicated pan-Africanist whose pursuit of African integration, cooperation and solidarity shall forever remain in our minds and hearts.\nThe theme of the current session, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, builds on the commitments we have made over the years. Those issues are at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We therefore commend the timely choice of a theme that resonates with the aspirations of the people whom we all represent.\nSierra Leone supports the principle of collective engagement in both the prevention and settlement of conflicts and disputes, as well as the Secretary-General\u2019s reform agenda in sustaining peace in all its facets, including efforts to reform peacekeeping. As a troop- and police-contributing country, Sierra Leone\u2019s active participation in peacekeeping operations demonstrates our firm commitment to the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security. Let me reiterate our firm commitment to continuing to contribute our fair share in maintaining world peace.\nThe need for Security Council reform is urgent and imperative. Our historic pledge to the early reform of the Security Council as an essential element of our overall effort to reform the United Nations must be upheld and implemented without further delay. The legitimacy and effectiveness of the Security Council\u2019s decisions and the relevance of the United Nations as a whole will continue to be questioned if urgent action is not taken to make the Council more broadly representative. Africa remains the only region without representation in the permanent category of the Security Council, and is also underrepresented in the non-permanent category.\nIn that context, Africa\u2019s demand for two permanent seats with all the rights and prerogatives of current members, including the right of the veto, as well as two additional non-permanent seats, is a matter of common justice. Africa should have the right to an equal say in decision-making on issues pertaining to international peace and security. The long-standing injustice and imbalance perpetrated by the current configuration of the Security Council should be of grave concern to us all and ought to be addressed now.\nAs the Coordinator of the African Union Committee of Ten Heads of State and Government, which seeks the reform of the Security Council, we are convinced that such reform should address the long-standing injustice and imbalance of the current configuration of the Security Council. We believe that the prevailing geopolitical realities make a compelling case for a comprehensive reform of the Security Council in order to bring about equitable geographic representation. Africa\u2019s patience is being tested. We therefore urge the Assembly to collectively support our urgent call for Africa\u2019s representation on the Security Council, as espoused in the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration.\nWe pursue peace as a public common good, and we have played an important role in securing peace as a stand-alone goal of the 2030 Agenda. There is a strong case to be made for the voices of billions of people living in conflict-affected countries to be heard in the highest global decision-making forum, in particular with regard to the Group of Seven Plus countries. Sierra Leone has always pursued country-led peace and resilience through national dialogue and reconciliation. We recently concluded a broad-based national consultative conference, Bintumani-III, during which a nationally representative body resolved to establish a permanent and independent national commission for peace and cohesion. We did so mindful that peaceful coexistence and inclusive governance are prerequisites for our development.\nDevelopment and poverty eradication must be well planned, inclusive and sustainable and must transition our nation out of fragility. To that end, Sierra Leone has partnered with United Nations agencies and development partners to better understand the dynamics and severity of poverty and map out possible approaches to eradicating poverty, in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1. That culminated with the production of a national multidimensional poverty index, a report on multidimensional child poverty and Sierra Leone\u2019s population policy, all with a view to ensuring effective measuring and monitoring capabilities.\nThe aspirations of Sierra Leoneans are reflected in a detailed and costed five-year medium-term national development plan, entitled Education for Development. The plan, which was aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063, is based on an inclusive national consultative process. It ensures that people are at the centre of, and own, our national development trajectory.\nEradicating poverty can be achieved only when we develop and improve our own greatest national resource \u2014 the people. Skilled, healthy and productive human beings represent the pathway to global success and prosperity. As a nation, we see human capital as a critical enabler for achieving the SDGs. My Government has therefore allocated 21 per cent of the national budget to education. Consequently, pre-primary to secondary school education is free, irrespective of gender, ability or ethnicity, and we now have 2 million children enrolled in school.\nWe have expanded opportunities in education for girls by creating safe spaces in schools, while campaigning vigorously against early marriage and sexual and gender-based violence. Girls admitted to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines in college are guaranteed scholarships. Technical and vocational education centres are now accessible to more Sierra Leonean girls and young people. We are also investing in more school infrastructure, transportation, sanitation and health, and nutrition and retention programmes.\nWe are restructuring and redesigning our education system to deliver quality education that meets the needs of inclusive and sustainable national and private-sector development. Our aim is to achieve fundamental, age-appropriate learning outcomes in literacy, computational skills and critical thinking. We invite the world to work with us. Through the directorate of science, technology and innovation, we have developed a human capital development incubator with extensive real-time data on education in Sierra Leone and other components of our human capital development flagship programme. Policy interventions and investments in education, health care and food security are increasingly informed and driven by that real-time data.\nSierra Leone continues to use the power of data to plan, make policy decisions, allocate resources, guide governance and create new possibilities for private entrepreneurship and drive human capital development. We are open to partnerships, collaboration and ideas about how to continue improving the quality of education, because we believe that our success in a global digital economy in the fourth industrial revolution is predicated on our investment in the future of our children.\nThrough partnerships and innovation, we have made great progress in establishing legal identity and birth registration by strengthening our national civil registration and vital statistics systems. We have also rolled out Africa\u2019s first blockchain national digital identity platform, which will help citizens obtain access to approved institutions by digitally verifying their identities. That initiative to establish legal identity using a singular, securitized and serially numbered instrument is guided by governance, development planning, financial inclusion and human rights imperatives, among others. The same instrument can also be used to strengthen health care planning, health information systems, disease surveillance and the monitoring of public health interventions and outcomes.\nThe threats of inequality, lack of opportunity and exclusion of our young people still persist. Anxiety over the growing population of young people in Africa is complicated by increased poverty indicators, the exclusion of young people, the perils of migration across the Mediterranean, transnational organized crime, terrorism, violent extremism and greater national and regional security threats. Sierra Leone is addressing the youth question through financial and social inclusion programmes, skills training and farming initiatives. We are pleased to be one of the 10 countries selected by the United Nations as pilots in the recently launched United Nations Youth Strategy. We aim to collaborate across the region and with international partners and to share lessons and best practices.\nOur development agenda is inclusive and affirms the critical role of women. We have ratified Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security. We are addressing the inclusion of women in governance and entrepreneurship. Our actions on child marriage, rape and sexual and gender-based violence have been emphatic and uncompromising. We have passed progressive laws on sexual offences and a presidential task force directly advises the President on sexual and gender-based violence. We are also working to eliminate barriers to the inclusion of persons with disabilities.\nQuality, affordable and universal health care coverage is foundational to productivity and overall well-being. That is critical for our human capital development agenda. As a nation, we cannot afford the cost of not investing in health care and universal health care coverage. We have maintained a rights-based approach to health care coverage that is aligned with SDG 3. We are focused on, and request cooperation in, reducing maternal and child mortality; preventing epidemics of tropical and communicable diseases through increased disease detection, surveillance and control; providing primary health care in accordance with the Declaration of Astana; providing first-rate, in-country medical diagnostic facilities; and strengthening capacity and resilience in the delivery of health-care services.\nThrough all those efforts, we are leveraging innovation and technology to support the delivery of health care. We also believe that we cannot achieve universal health coverage without delivering mental health care for all. We are rewriting mental health legislation and are committed to community-based mental health care and treatment. We aim to change attitudes towards mental health and provide affordable and integrated quality care that matches the burden of mental health conditions. We therefore welcome partnerships with a view to achieving that goal.\nOur focus as a Government remains the delivery of accountable and transparent State governance through critical debates and engagement with all citizens on their rights, governance and development. We continue to work with civil society and the press as we expand democratic space. My Government has forwarded to Parliament a bill to completely repeal a 54-year-old law that criminalizes libel, which has been used by Governments in the past to imprison journalists and restrict press freedoms.\nAs co-Chair of the Task Force on Access to Justice, Sierra Leone strongly identifies with, and reiterates, the Secretary-General\u2019s call for accelerated commitments to addressing gaps in the justice delivery system. We have signalled that commitment as a country by establishing a special directorate within the Ministry of Justice to monitor, evaluate and report on progress on access to justice for our most vulnerable groups. We are also using technology and innovation to digitize our court processes and thereby fast-track justice delivery for all.\nWe have undertaken governance reforms that foster the rule of law and public accountability. And we continue to pursue a determined fight against corruption while minimizing the waste and abuse of State resources. We are also implementing business-friendly reforms that create an ecosystem that is conducive to private capital investment and entrepreneurship in our country.\nAllow me to express my country\u2019s sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General for convening the Climate Action Summit in September. Extreme weather events increase the risk of hunger, disease, forced migration, conflict and poverty. The science is indisputable, the effects on lives and livelihoods are real and the threats to our efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals are clear and present.\nAs a country, we are committed to a multilateral approach to fully implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Our medium-term national development plan provides for mitigation and adaptation strategies that include reviewing, formulating and strengthening national policy actions on environmental management and governance. We are committed to green and sustainable energy generation. With the right partnerships, the right attitude and an unflinching commitment to climate financing and continuing multilateral efforts, we can save our planet from the destructive impacts of climate change.\nAllow me to conclude by encouraging us all to not lose sight of the shared responsibility we all have to ensure a peaceful and secure world for the next generation. Sierra Leone is a small nation, but it is determined to play its own part in the international system. We are committed to promoting peace and security, addressing the underlying causes of fragility and the drivers of conflict, tackling the scourge of climate change and, in turn, building resilience and achieving the 2030 Agenda. Together, we can achieve that in our lifetime.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate Mr. Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- fourth session. We are confident that, under his able leadership, this session will be productive.\nMyanmar considers this year\u2019s theme, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, to be most timely. Those are among the most daunting challenges the world faces today. They can be overcome only through the coordinated efforts of the entire international community.\nEradicating poverty in all its forms is the greatest global challenge. In Myanmar we pursue a careful balance between economic and social development, on the one hand, and environmental protection and sustainability, on the other. The Government is resolute in its commitment to address poverty. To that end, we have developed a range of strategies that go beyond simply stimulating economic growth. Our efforts are bearing fruit \u2014 poverty in Myanmar has fallen from 48.2 per cent in 2005 to 24.8 per cent in 2017. Myanmar has also experienced rapid economic growth in recent years, becoming one of the region\u2019s fastest-growing economies, with an annual growth rate of 6.5 per cent for the period 2018 to 2019.\nThe adverse effects of climate change pose significant obstacles to poverty reduction and threaten hard-won progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Indeed, climate change could be considered the defining issue of our time. In that connection, I welcome the convening of the Climate Action Summit and wish to underscore the urgency of responding to climate change and the importance of implementing both the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nThe United Nations is at the heart of multilateralism, on which we place our hopes and aspirations. In fact, cooperating with the United Nations is the cornerstone of our foreign policy. Our world is facing the challenges of transition and geopolitical shifts. The United Nations and other multilateral institutions need to recognize the disconnect between the expectations of peoples and nations and the responses of institutions and policies. Such a disconnect creates mistrust in international systems and institutions and causes the growth of unilateralism.\nCountries are coming to the realization that, in the new geopolitical order, it is getting harder to find a common thread that ties their members together. The United Nations should take a stern look at how it is evolving. It must avoid the mistake of allowing unwieldy mandates or unilaterally extending its powers with no corresponding due diligence. Multilateral institutions should never be used as a tool to target Member States. They should uphold the sovereignty of nations, working in concert for a greater good, ensure the equality of actions and scrupulously avoid double standards and exceptionalism. Left unchecked, the United Nations, as a beacon of peace and security, may end up with huge deficits of trust. That cannot be allowed to happen, as there are critical issues that can be addressed only through multilateral efforts. No nation should be made to feel that its value in the United Nations is decided by the degree of material wealth and political influence it can muster.\nMyanmar is undergoing a process of democratization and, in doing so, has embraced the culture of political dialogue to solve internal conflicts by peaceful means. We regard the rule of law as a fundamental principle of democratic governance. The Government and the legislature are seeking to make our laws more transparent to ensure that each and every person is equal before the law.\nTo attain progress in those and many other areas, we need a constitution that can truly protect and advance the democratic rights of the people. In that regard, the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, our parliament, has taken a bold initiative towards the amendment of a number of provisions in the Constitution. Our democratic endeavours and associated reforms are continuous and vibrant.\nThe achievement of national reconciliation and peace is our Government\u2019s topmost priority. We have convened three sessions of the Union Peace Conference and adopted a total of 51 basic principles to be included in the Union Peace Accord. A total of 10 ethnic armed organizations have already signed the nationwide ceasefire agreement. Despite the recent successes in broadening the agreement\u2019s coverage, there is still a long way to go before all remaining non-signatories are on board. Notwithstanding challenges, negotiations continue. We are determined to resolve differences through dialogue, negotiation and peaceful means, thereby building mutual trust and understanding.\nLet me now touch upon recent developments in Rakhine state. Our democratic transition is still young and, as yet, incomplete. We must overcome a range of challenges, from an imperfect Constitution to continued conflicts. The situation in Rakhine state \u2014 an issue that has deep and historical roots \u2014 counts among those challenges. We fully share the concern of the international community over the violence that affects communities in Rakhine. In fact, the Government\u2019s efforts to bring about peace and stability predate the violent attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) terrorist group in 2016 and 2017, which triggered the current humanitarian crisis.\nSince assuming office in 2016, the elected civilian Government has placed the highest priority on addressing the situation in Rakhine state. To find a lasting solution, we established the Central Committee for the Implementation of Peace, Stability and Development in Rakhine State, chaired by our State Counsellor, and, subsequently, the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, headed by Mr. Kofi Annan. Our aim was to find long-term, durable and practical solutions to the delicate and sensitive issues in Rakhine. Our priority now is to expedite repatriation and create a more conducive environment for verified returnees. To that end, we are cooperating with Bangladesh, the United Nations Development Programme, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as well as friends and well-wishers.\nMyanmar is aware of the many obstacles that need to be addressed, including destructive movements in the camps aimed at preventing repatriation and exploiting the plight of displaced persons. Smooth and successful repatriation requires genuine political will and committed efforts, as well as strict adherence to the signed agreements \u2014 and I stress \u201csigned agreements\u201d. The displaced persons now in Cox\u2019s Bazar who had been residents in Rakhine have a different legal status. We are willing to repatriate them in accordance with the bilateral agreement signed between Myanmar and Bangladesh. The agreement calls for the issuance of identity cards to the returnees. Those who qualify for citizenship under our citizenship law will be issued with citizenship cards. The rest will be issued with national verification cards, which are similar to the green cards much sought after by immigrants in the United States.\nMyanmar strongly holds the view that issues between neighbours can and must be resolved bilaterally in an amicable and friendly manner. The current issue of displaced persons in Cox\u2019s Bazar can and must be resolved bilaterally, particularly as Myanmar and Bangladesh signed a bilateral agreement to address the issue in November 2017. Despite obstacles, including killings and threats by ARSA, some 300 people from camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar have returned under their own arrangements and of their own volition. They have resumed their lives in conditions of safety and dignity.\nThere have been persistent calls to put pressure on Myanmar. There have been calls to set up a so-called safe zone inside Myanmar. Such a demand is neither warranted nor workable. We call on Bangladesh to faithfully implement the bilateral agreement, which is the only feasible way to resolve the issue of displaced persons. We also call on Bangladesh to allow the speedy repatriation of those who have long expressed their desire to return, including some 400 people of Hindu faith. Grandstanding, introducing new elements or putting forward new conditionalities will be a futile exercise. The people of Myanmar are pragmatic and resilient. We value friendship with all nations, but we do not respond well to coercion that is removed from fairness and consideration due to a sovereign independent member of the family of nations.\nAccordingly, on 15 September, Myanmar\u2019s Parliament, the Hluttaw, celebrated International Day of Democracy, during which politicians from various political parties made statements. I wish to highlight one of the statements made on Rakhine by a member of parliament from an ethnic minority. With regard to the external pressure exerted on Myanmar, he said:\n\u201cThey are flouting our territorial integrity and national sovereignty. Only peoples of sovereign independent nations can enjoy the true essence of democracy.\u201d\nThe Government of Myanmar sincerely sympathizes with all those who have been affected by the problems in Rakhine state. Myanmar is not opposed to accountability for any wrongdoing related to the large outflow of displaced persons to Bangladesh. We stand firmly for the principles that are the cornerstones of the international legal order.\nOn 30 July 2018, President Win Myint initiated a special investigation procedure, pursuant to which the Independent Commission of Enquiry is currently preparing a report with recommendations for further action. Like some other States Members of the United Nations, Myanmar has a military-justice system, which is provided for in our 2008 Constitution. A military investigation into Rakhine is currently being undertaken by the Office of the Judge Advocate General. A recent announcement suggests that there will soon be a court martial. The integrity of these independent investigations should not be compromised by international actors.\nOn 4 July, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) requested that a Pre-Trial Chamber authorize an investigation into the Rakhine allegations. Independent scholars have already identified the request as problematic in that it excludes allegations of crimes committed by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), deliberately omits the undisputed fact that ARSA\u2019s actions precipitated the current displacement, relies heavily on human rights reports that contain factual errors with regard to both international and Myanmar law, and mischaracterizes the criminal-justice system of Myanmar. This critique is all the more serious when we consider that Myanmar is not a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The Government\u2019s position remains very clear: the Court does not have jurisdiction over crimes alleged to have been committed in our country. We are both able and willing to do investigate and prosecute the allegations ourselves.\nThe ICC Prosecutor is focusing on the outflow from Rakhine to Bangladesh, but she is silent on the broader picture of the various reasons, immediate as well as long-standing, that brought about the displacement, as well as the various actors who were involved. Her silence widens the divide between the Court and the people of Myanmar, who have been made to feel that their concerns are of lesser import than the perceptions of influential nations and organizations acquainted but superficially with the true situation on the ground.\nMyanmar was a British colony for nearly 100 years. During that period, the colonial Power transferred hundreds of thousands of civilians from British India to then-Burma to propel the rapidly expanding rice production and export sectors. In 1927 alone, there were more than 480,000 such transfers into occupied colonial Burma. The Burmese were reduced to a minority in their own capital city, Rangoon, which is now Yangon. Immigrants from Bengal, mainly from the Chittagong region moved en masse into the western townships of Arakan. As is the case with other colonized territories across the world, our local population had no say whatsoever with regard to the seismic demographic transformation of their lands. Nevertheless, Myanmar now accepts it as part of the chequered legacy for which we assumed responsibility when we regained our independence in 1948. It was only in 1949, with the adoption of the Fourth Geneva Convention, that international law expressly prohibited the transfer of civilians into occupied territories. But there was no recognition of the troublesome consequences of such transfer operations.\nIf\tthe\tinternational\tcommunity\tpasses fundamentally different judgments on occurrences of one and the same practice, albeit at different times, perceptions that double standards are being applied will grow. If left unaddressed, such perceptions will undermine respect for international criminal justice and fuel the danger of extreme polarization.\nWe have objected to the formation of the independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar since its inception, because of our serious concern about the mission\u2019s composition and mandate, as well as its capacity for fairness and impartiality. Chair Marzuki Darusman\u2019s reports, without exception, have been biased and flawed, based not on facts but on narratives. Events have therefore proved that our concerns are justified. The latest reports are even worse. We cannot help but conclude that they were prompted more by hostility towards the democratically elected Government and the peace-loving people of Myanmar than by a genuine desire to resolve the challenges of Rakhine. We therefore also reject the establishment of the new Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, which was set up to bring Myanmar before such tribunals as the International Criminal Court, to which we strongly object. We are also disappointed by the report by former Guatemalan Foreign Affairs\nMinister, Gert Rosenthal. The facts presented are inaccurate, distorted and lack professional objectivity.\nWe request the States Members of the United Nations to differentiate between the motives that are behind the actions of the General Assembly. Is there a genuine will to protect human rights or is the aim to hijack human rights issues for political purposes?\nTo address the delicate issue of Rakhine, we need truth, fairness and constructive support. Exertions of discriminatory scrutiny and political pressure with malicious intent will not contribute to our efforts to resolve the problems. In this regard, we, the Government and the people of Myanmar, truly appreciate the support offered by many friends and partners, as well as their constructive cooperation based on genuine goodwill. This support benefits not just the people of Myanmar, but people all over the world who value justice and fair play for all nations, both great and small.\nThe people of Myanmar have waited decades for the emergence of democracy in our country. Transformation from authoritarianism to a democratic system is a daunting challenge, but it is a challenge that our Government and our people have taken on with faith and determination. Our peace process, based on an inclusive framework for political dialogue with all ethnic armed groups, will continue. We will use the platform of the Union Peace Conference \u2014 the 21st Century Panglong to create the democratic federal union to which our people aspire. We will strive to build a society that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms \u2014 a society where all citizens can attain peace, prosperity and freedom from fear.\nWe invite the international community to join hands with us, in a constructive way, to ensure that democracy takes firm root in Myanmar."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. While assuring you, Sir, of my country\u2019s full support, I wish you every success in implementing the priorities of your mandate. I also wish to take this opportunity to thank your predecessor, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her excellent work and the progress achieved by our Organization during her term in office. On behalf of the Togolese people, I would also like to reiterate my deep gratitude to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his unwavering commitment to peace and security in a world facing multifaceted forms of upheaval.\nMultilateralism and the pooling of efforts and experiences are appearing today no longer as mere options available to the community of States but rather as imperatives indispensable to the attainment of our objectives. Today, our Organization\u2019s responsibilities are growing in number, and its multidimensional challenges are becoming more complex. In order to ensure more effective action, we must get used to the idea that there is no alternative to collective action and solidarity. Evidently, the scale and acuteness of these new challenges \u2014 which are fuelled and perpetuated by wars, sociopolitical crises, poverty, exclusion, environmental degradation and the effects of climate change \u2014 call on us to wake up and implement concrete, concerted and pragmatic actions. That is why I commend the theme chosen for this session of the General Assembly \u2014 \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d \u2014 as it responds perfectly to our current concerns and reflects the values that underpin our full adherence to the Charter of the United Nations.\nBy adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development a number of years ago, we resolutely committed to ensuring that this programme, which remains to date the most ambitious tool we have to advance the well-being of our peoples, does not become merely another programme. In this regard, I wish to reiterate Togo\u2019s full support for all initiatives and mechanisms aimed at implementing various strategic plans in pursuit of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nThe Government of Togo has made enormous efforts at the national level to reduce poverty and ensure that no one is left behind by 2030. With this in mind, and in accordance with the 2030 Agenda, Agenda 2063 of the African Union and Vision 2020 of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), my country adopted a national development plan for the period 2018-2022, in line with the country\u2019s emerging agenda. The plan is a five-year strategic document based on the fundamentals of economic, social and environmental development.\nThrough the plan\u2019s three strategic focuses, Togo aspires to become a stable and economically, socially and democratically sound middle-income country that espouses solidarity and is open to the world. This is already reflected in efforts to establish a strategic hub of excellence and a first-class business centre in the West African subregion and to develop centres to transform agriculture, manufacturing and the extractive industry while strengthening social development and inclusion mechanisms. In short, the plan, whose flagship project is based on rational choices that integrate all 17 SDGs, is designed to make structural transformations to the Togolese economy with the aim of ensuring strong, sustainable, resilient and inclusive growth that creates decent jobs for all and leads to improved individual well-being.\nTherefore, in addition to the accelerated building of road, port, airport and agricultural infrastructure, my country is determinedly pursuing its 2008 education policy to introduce free primary education, the implementation of an expanded school meals programme and the introduction of health insurance called School Assur for 2 million students. The policy has encouraged greater enrolment, especially among girls. Through the Government education strategy for the period 2014-2025, Togo aims to achieve universal primary education by 2022 and to expand preschool services in rural and poor areas. The ultimate objective is to meet the standards of quality education and significantly reduce the illiteracy.\nWhen we adopted the SDGs in 2015, we knew full well that the fulfilment of our development commitments would depend on the international community\u2019s ability to mobilize the necessary financing. Accordingly, it is vital to further promote international cooperation and solidarity in order to establish innovative partnerships that will bring progress at the international level. We therefore welcome the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, which remains a key framework for mobilizing financial resources likely to lead to tangible progress in achieving the SDGs. It is therefore urgent to make a definitive commitment to the implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and to make the most of the relevant mechanisms it offers. In this regard, particular attention should be paid to the least developed countries and to all vulnerable countries at the margins of world trade. We should seize multilateralism as an opportunity for vibrant international economic and trade cooperation that brings hope to the human community we are building.\nI would like to welcome the continuous integration efforts made within the framework of the African Union (AU) and the continent\u2019s regional communities since the adoption of Agenda 2063 of the African Union, whose goal is the structural transformation in Africa. In this regard, my country welcomes the AU\u2019s launch, on 30 May, in Niamey, of the African Continental Free Trade Area, one of the 14 flagship projects of Agenda 2063, which is intended to accelerate the industrialization of Africa, increase intra-African trade and build quality infrastructure. Similarly, the Single African Air Transport Market was established in response to the urgent need to unify the African domestic air-transport market. The Market, of which Togo is the coordinator, will stimulate huge cross-border investment opportunities in the aviation and tourism industries and provides an excellent opportunity to improve connectivity among AU member States. At the subregional level, the adoption of the principle of a common ECOWAS currency is also to be welcomed as an important factor in accelerating integration.\nIn addition to improving the legal framework to promote good governance and access to health, education and well-being, the issue of climate change and environmental protection is a major concern for my country. It is the entire international community\u2019s responsibility to demonstrate how closely the issue of climate change is linked to food and health security, poverty reduction, economic growth and human development. We therefore believe that it is appropriate to guarantee funds to help the most vulnerable countries preserve biodiversity. That is why it is crucial for the international community to find appropriate solutions to issues related to climate change.\nAt this juncture, my country reiterates its support and commitment to the Paris Agreement. Accordingly, the holding of the Climate Action Summit, which took place in the run-up to the general debate, is to be welcomed. We hope that the promises made at the Summit will lead to a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 and their total neutralization by 2050. My country stresses the need to better endow the Green Climate Fund so that it can better assist less polluting States that are more exposed to climate change in finding the appropriate means to deal with it.\nOur world today is in an extremely volatile security context. The persistence of hotbeds of tension, particularly in Africa, the Middle East and the Near East, such emerging issues as terrorism, violent extremism, natural disasters and climate change, and the trends towards nuclear proliferation threaten international peace and security, without which our development efforts cannot prosper. That is why, my country, which is committed to the values of peace and peaceful coexistence, considers that we have everything to gain by acting in a concerted manner and with strong determination to end all these crises.\nThe year 2019 has been a particularly scary year for several countries marked by an existential fear of terrorist threats. Recurring attacks around the world prove to us on a daily basis that this rampant evil remains omnipresent, forcing us to be constantly and increasingly vigilant. The West African region has not been spared. Indeed, there have been several attacks in Mali, the Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Benin and so on. Because of its proximity to neighbouring countries hard hit by the scourge of terrorism, Togo is well aware of the magnitude of the threat and remains on high alert in the face of this asymmetrical threat. Togo is currently taking a preventive and proactive approach to the terrorist threat and has therefore sought the expertise of the Office of Counter-Terrorism to help it assess the risks posed by violent extremism. The Office\u2019s visit, which took place in Lome from 22 to 24 July, made it possible to make recommendations and assess the priority needs in terms of technical assistance. I take this opportunity to thank the United Nations for its highly appreciated support.\nMy country remains convinced that the spread of the scourge of terrorism requires enhanced international cooperation as its complexity precludes an individual approach by States and demands a synergistic action through a shared vision. Aware of the need for cooperation at the regional level, the Togolese Government supports the Accra initiative, taken jointly with Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Mali and the Niger in September 2017, whose objective is precisely to unify and harmonize approaches to the terrorist threat.\nTo that end, it is vital that sustainable financing be found for the Group of Five for the Sahel, which constitutes an exemplary framework for cooperation in the fight against terrorism in the West African subregion. The delay in the operationalization of its joint force is highly detrimental to peace and security in Africa. In this regard, we join in the many calls for international mobilization to enable the force to act and contribute to eradicating this tentacular evil that preys on our countries. That is why my country welcomes the reform of the United Nations peace and security pillar and strongly supports the actions initiated by the Secretary-General to increase the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations through more specific mandates and collaboration with regional and subregional organizations.\nHowever, it is not unreasonable to question the diminishing financial resources allocated to these operations as the challenges of peacekeeping and consolidation become more complex. As a major troop contributor to peacekeeping operations, Togo reiterates its commitment to serve wherever peace is threatened. We fully support both the zero-tolerance policy on sexual abuse in theatres of peacekeeping operations and the Kigali Principles.\nIt cannot be stressed enough that nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction continue to pose serious threats to international peace and security. My country, whose foreign policy prioritizes general and complete disarmament, has always advocated the use of nuclear energy exclusively for civilian purposes. It is in this spirit that, on 7 August, the Togolese Government adopted a bill on the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear energy, cognizant of its positive applications, particularly in the fields of health, agriculture, industry and ionizing radiation, and so on.\nInternational migratory flows are intensifying and diversifying and today constitute another major challenge to be addressed. As a result of growing economic inequality, more men and women are leaving their countries of origin in search of a safer or better life and opportunities in other places. The migratory phenomenon too often results in tragedy and is a source of sorrow for people and Governments alike. It poses enormous challenges to the international community, which must find mechanisms for collective management and more effective cooperation among States. In this regard, my delegation welcomes the adoption by the General Assembly on 19 December 2018 of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which emerged from the intergovernmental conference held in Marrakech on 10 and 11 December 2018. This historic Compact, while non-legally binding, serves as a useful road map for the more effective management of this great crisis of our time.\nOur community of shared destiny compels us to overcome any temptation to resort to isolated and solitary actions. If our goal is to effectively fight against poverty and all the other ills afflicting humankind in order to build fairer and more inclusive societies, we must devote our efforts to strengthening multilateral mechanisms, while taking daily inspiration from the African proverb: \u201cAlone we go faster, but together we go further\u201d."

        "file_text": "During the general debate of the General Assembly, all the States Members of the United Nations make their voices heard, and I am proud to be standing in this Hall representing the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which is made up of four autonomous countries located in Europe and the Caribbean: the Netherlands, Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao and Sint Maarten. We are familiar with both the trade winds of the tropics and the cold gales of the North Sea. Anyone wishing to understand our character can best begin with a concept that is close to the heart of everyone in our Kingdom \u2014 freedom.\nOver the coming year, we will be celebrating the seventy-fifth anniversary of our liberation from oppression and tyranny. From the city of Amsterdam to the smallest villages, there will be commemorations and celebrations by old and young alike. The Caribbean part of the Kingdom will also reflect on its own contribution to the allied struggle. We remain forever grateful to our allies both in and beyond Europe for the sacrifices that they made for our sake. This collective remembrance still moves and inspires us today.\nFor our Kingdom, freedom is bound up with cooperation with other countries, based on equality, justice, honest relations and international law. That is why we were involved in building the United Nations from its inception, and why we look forward to next year, when we will celebrate its seventy-fifth anniversary. As a platform for managing international conflicts and creating opportunities for people across the entire world, the United Nations is unparalleled in history.\nWe believe in multilateral cooperation. The Kingdom of the Netherlands is convinced that close collaboration within a broad-based partnership of States offers the best guarantee of freedom, security and prosperity for all. The fight against poverty and inequality is best served by joining forces at the international level. We believe that it is vital to express that clearly here in the General Assembly, given the pressure that that cooperation is under. We should cherish the multilateral system and its international agreements and rules as a precious achievement. Let us appreciate the value of what has been carefully built over many years. Let us acknowledge that we need one another, just as we did 75 years ago. In fact, we need each other more than ever. \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need\u201d is the motto of next year\u2019s session \u2014 a motto that offers plenty of food for thought. What kind of future do we want? Anyone who asks their children that question will get a clear answer. Our young people want a fair, clean and sustainable world that gives them the freedom to develop as individuals and discover who they are, where no one is left behind or has to fear violence, want or oppression. If we listen to the voices of the young, it is clear where we need to look for solutions. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will bring the world imagined by those young people closer. That is why it is essential that we put all our energies into achieving them.\nWe are concerned about the fact that in several countries and regions, young people risk losing all hope of a better future. One example is Venezuela, which is a neighbour of the Caribbean part of our Kingdom. We fervently hope that a way can be found out of the current stalemate by means of free and fair elections. In many places around the world people are not free to be themselves. In many places, there is no room for diversity, no respect for the rights and opportunities of minorities and no equality between men and women. As a result, breeding grounds for instability endure.\nAfter all, every human being strives for recognition. If that recognition is denied, tensions and conflict are inevitable. We must hold firmly to the principle of freedom of religion or belief, including for minorities in places where the great majority profess a different faith. No one can prescribe how another person should think. Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Jews and people without religious convictions should be able to follow their own conscience in peace everywhere.\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands welcomes the fact that the rights of lesbian, gay and transgender people and other minority communities are being enshrined in law in more and more places around the world. We hope that that trend continues. But, ultimately, words must translate into action. The fight against discrimination, whether open or hidden, must continue on every continent.\nIf we are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, we must protect human rights. The Kingdom of the Netherlands wants to work with all Member States to champion that aim. We have therefore announced our candidacy for a seat on the Human Rights Council from 2020 to 2022, and we hope to have the support of everyone here in the election this autumn. Human rights are for everyone, even those who have committed crimes and are punished for them. People are not infallible, which means that the administration of justice is not infallible either. An irreversible sentence can never be justified. The death penalty is a violation of the fundamental right to life. That is why the Netherlands, together with all other members of the European Union, advocates the abolition of capital punishment worldwide.\nWe care deeply about the plight of those who are victims of war and violence. Many are refugees and many have reached the point of despair. It is essential that people whose rights are trampled underfoot know that the United Nations is on their side. The Kingdom of the Netherlands is actively involved in the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to make United Nations peace missions more effective. The Action for Peacekeeping initiative is a crucial part of that process. It is equally important that we take effective action to combat terrorism and eliminate the factors that fuel it. As co-Chair of the Global Counterterrorism Forum, the Netherlands is firmly committed to that goal. Anyone guilty of genocide, war crimes, terrorism or human trafficking must be held to account. The Kingdom of the Netherlands is determined to combat impunity. This week, we will be hosting an event aimed at encouraging the criminal prosecution of fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, preferably in the region where they committed their atrocities. We will also continue our efforts to strengthen the International Criminal Court, which is an indispensable component of the international legal order. It is unacceptable for individuals responsible for international crimes to escape their just punishment. In this forum, I want to repeat that under Security Council resolution 2166 (2014), all countries, including Russia, must cooperate fully with efforts to establish the truth about the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 on 17 July 2014. The families of the 298 victims expect justice, and we will not rest until justice is done.\nHuman rights, peace and development opportunities for all are the cornerstones of the world order that we seek to build, and they are at the heart of the Sustainable Development Goals. Everyone deserves the chance to build a decent life and find respite in times of adversity. To that end, the United Nations is working with Member States in all manner of ways. But we are not working fast enough. At our current pace, we will not achieve our goals by 2030 in the area of reducing inequality, for example. We can and must speed up our efforts. The international community has shown in the past that it is capable of great things. Thirty years ago, one in three people lived in extreme poverty. Today that figure is one in 10. We have made a huge leap forward in just one generation. Let us take heart from that and put all our energies into reaching the Sustainable Development Goals. Among the many people working on those goals is my wife, the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development. For 10 years now, she has fulfilled that role with enormous drive, passion and pleasure.\nAnyone who champions sustainable development must also champion climate action. Climate change is one of the biggest threats to the achievement of the SDGs. All over the world, people are feeling its impact. Climate change is affecting our livelihoods, security, health, living environments and future. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development demands that we all take more action to combat climate change. The Secretary-General deserves praise for giving this issue such a prominent place in the General Assembly. Never before has international cooperation been so urgent for the future of our planet. Greenhouse gases do not recognize national borders. We can combat climate change only if we work together, and we are glad to heed the call to take responsibility and show ambition. Transitioning to a sustainable, circular economy is no simple task. Every Member State is wrestling with that challenge, including our Kingdom, and that is precisely why we all need one another. We must join forces and share our knowledge and experience.\nIn the Netherlands, the Government, municipalities, the business community, civil society and the general public have joined together with the goal of almost halving emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. At the same time, we are partnering with Costa Rica to help developing countries that want to raise their climate ambitions and take action. The Nationally Determined Contributions Partnership is a vital platform in that regard, and we strongly urge the private sector to play its part and make greening a priority. As a country with more than 1,000 years of experience in water management, the Netherlands is also an expert partner for anyone working to enhance flood protection. We are proud that Dutch engineers and water managers are doing their part all over the world. What is more, next year we will be hosting the international Climate Adaptation Summit.\nAs we approach next year\u2019s celebrations to mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, the Kingdom of the Netherlands sees this as a time for reflection. How can we ensure that as the twenty-first century unfolds, the United Nations remains fit for purpose? After the horrors of two world wars, we created a multilateral system based on dialogue and cooperation, a system that places international agreements and rules above ultranationalism and power-based spheres of influence. As a result, we have improved the lives of billions of people and made our world more secure, and that is a unique achievement.\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands believes in the need for an effective multilateral system because it offers the best guarantee of stability, peace and sustainable development. That does not mean that we can simply carry on the way we were. Reforms are needed in order to prevent the system from coming to a standstill and losing its credibility. The reforms initiated by the Secretary-General must be put into practice as a matter of urgency. He has our full support. In order to achieve that, it is crucial that Member States honour their financial commitments. It is also essential that United Nations organizations improve their cooperation and that financial resources be spent smartly and efficiently in order to achieve the best possible return for the people they are intended to help. Every person counts; every Member State counts. The United Nations will have an inclusive future or no future at all. The voices of small island developing States must therefore be heard more at the United Nations level, because their concerns have too often fallen on deaf ears.\nTogether, we can make our world greater. So let us remember where we began, 75 years ago. Let us realize that the building of an international framework for cooperation has given billions of people hope, security and confidence. Let us retain those achievements and uphold the values of the United Nations. But at the same time, let us rejuvenate our United Nations so it is fit for purpose in today\u2019s world.\n"

        "file_text": "Much has changed since the United Nations was established many years ago. Australia was there in the beginning and we are here today because we continue to believe that differences can be resolved through dialogue and mutual respect; because we believe that an international rules-based order is essential for global stability, security and prosperity; and because we know that there can be no prosperity without peace.\nThe world today is complex and contested. Many fatalistically see a polarized world where countries feel pushed to make binary choices. Australia will continue to resist that path. Australia will continue to seek to honestly maintain our great alliances and comprehensive partnerships in good repair, from our great and powerful friends to our smallest Pacific Island family neighbours.\nAs it approaches its seventy-fifth anniversary next year, the United Nations must reform and evolve to respond effectively to the challenges of the twenty-first century. And, to fulfil its core mandate, the United Nations must be ever mindful of the principles and values that have always been foundational to the Organization\u2019s efforts and success: the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international law; respect for the sovereignty and independence of all States; open markets that facilitate the free flow of trade, capital and ideas; freedom of faith and freedom of expression; respect for human rights; and combating disadvantage, discrimination and persecution based on disability, gender, religion, sexuality, age, race or ethnicity.\nThose are the liberal democratic values that underpinned the United Nations at its inception. Those are Australia\u2019s values. We believe that they should remain the guiding principles of the United Nations into the future. The alternate path of lowest-common-denominator transactionalism and relativism is a dead end. The United Nations is the prime custodian of the rules-based order. It is also the custodian of the mechanisms for dialogue and adjudication that buttress them. It has a challenging task ahead of it.\nFor Australia\u2019s part, we will continue to practice what we preach. Last month, Australia ratified a maritime treaty setting out a new sea boundary with Timor-Leste. That followed the first conciliation initiated under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It demonstrates that the United Nations and its norms are central to a cooperative, rules-based approach to global challenges.\nIn the Pacific, we are also stepping up. Australia is the single largest development partner for Pacific Island nations. That is an instinctive response for Australia, consistent with our clear national interest and our commitment to our Pacific family \u2014 our vuvale, our whanau. Our goal is simple \u2014 to ensure that the south-west Pacific is secure strategically, stable economically, sovereign politically and sustainable environmentally.\nThe Organization\u2019s work, in partnership with Australia, has also helped to build a more sustainable and resilient Pacific, to support local climate change actions and resilience, to strive for gender equality through the empowerment of women and girls, to support continuing improvements in health outcomes and to bolster regional peace, including through the Bougainville Referendum Support Project.\nToday, however, I would like to take the opportunity to speak about Australia\u2019s response to the great global environmental challenges. First among them is how Australia is acting to protect our oceans. Australia is an island continent. It has the world\u2019s third largest maritime jurisdiction, stretching from the Great Southern Ocean to the vast Pacific and Indian Oceans. Over 85 per cent of Australia\u2019s population lives within just 50 kilometres of the coast. Australia\u2019s indigenous peoples have been linked to our land and sea for more than 65,000 years.\nOur oceans connect Australia with the world. Some 99 per cent of Australia\u2019s trade, by volume, is carried by sea. By 2025, marine industries will contribute around $100 billion each year to our economy. Our prosperity and security rely on the established laws that govern freedom of navigation, be it in the Strait of Hormuz or closer to home.\nProtecting our oceans is also one of the world\u2019s more pressing environmental challenges. To protect our oceans, Australia is committed to leading urgent action to combat the plastic pollution that is choking our oceans, to tackle overexploitation of our fisheries, to prevent ocean habitat destruction and, of course, to take action on climate change. Scientists estimate that in just 30 years\u2019 time, the weight of plastics in our oceans may exceed the weight of fish in those oceans.\nRecently, I announced that Australia will ban exports of waste plastic, paper, glass and tires, starting in 2020. That is about 1.4 million tons of potent recyclable material. Australia is also leading practical research and development into recycling, turning recycled plastic and glass waste into roads, manufacturing 100- per cent recycled PET bottles and capturing methane and waste to create energy.\nNew technologies are coming on line, with the potential to recycle used plastics into valuable new plastics, creating a circular plastics economy. These include innovations like bioplastics, compostable plastic replacements and technologies like the Catalytic Hydrothermal Reactor \u2014 an innovative Australian- designed technology that converts end-of-life plastics into waxes, diesel and new plastics. Those innovations show us that a truly circular economy is not only possible, but achievable and, of course, essential.\nAs Australians, we intend to do more. Australians will invest $167 million, through our Government, in an Australian recycling investment plan. Our focus is to create the right investment environment so that new technologies are commercialized, preventing pollution from entering our oceans and creating valuable new products. Australia supports the High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy and we are working through the International Maritime Organization to address the way shipping contributes to plastics pollution in our oceans. Australia supports the Group of 20\u2019s work on marine plastic debris and the Osaka Blue Ocean Vision, championed by Prime Minister Abe.\nWe welcome the contributions and leadership from business and the private sector to address these challenges, including Australia\u2019s own Minderoo Foundation. Industry-led mechanisms for investing in new recycling technologies and mitigating plastic waste in rivers, beaches and oceans on a global scale are absolutely essential for the way forward.\nWe must also act to safeguard the sustainability of our fisheries. That means cracking down on illegal fishing. There are too many nations standing by while their nationals are thieving the livelihoods of their neighbours. Australia is not only acting in its own interest, but also helping its Pacific island family to reduce illegal fishing, which depletes the fish stocks of Pacific islanders, who rely on them for their jobs, revenue and food security.\nWe have also worked together with Indonesia, and for that I congratulate President Widodo. We are jointly committed to an action plan to combat illegal fishing in South-East Asia, and we thank Indonesia for its regional leadership. We are also working with regional organizations to improve fisheries governance. In addition, we provide patrol boats to 13 countries, supported by aerial surveillance through our Pacific Maritime Security Program, which assists Pacific Island nations police illegal fishing in their own waters.\nWe are leading efforts to preserve natural habitats and biodiversity, including through partnerships with other countries to protect migratory birds and their habitats. We have also worked hard to prevent commercial whaling and to end whaling in the Southern Ocean. In 2015, Australia set up the International Partnership for Blue Carbon with the aim of protecting and conserving mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses for climate change mitigation and adaptation.\nThe Great Barrier Reef remains one of the world\u2019s most pristine areas of natural beauty, and everyone is welcome to visit it. The reef is vibrant, resilient and protected under the world\u2019s most comprehensive reef management plan. The UNESCO World Heritage Committee has found that Australia\u2019s management of the reef is highly sophisticated and considered by many as the gold standard for large-scale marine protected areas. Australia\u2019s $2-billion Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan is based on the best available science and draws on 40 years of analysis and experience, underpinned by the management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Australia\u2019s continued support for reef, coral and water quality science will ensure that the Great Barrier Reef remains one of the best-managed World Heritage sites.\nAustralia is also taking real action on climate change and getting results. We are successfully balancing our global responsibilities with sensible and practical policies to secure our environmental and economic future. However, Australia\u2019s internal and global climate change critics willingly overlook or, perhaps, ignore our achievements because the facts simply do not fit the narrative they wish to project about our contribution. Australia is responsible for just 1.3 per cent of global emissions. Australia is doing its bit to combat climate change and it rejects any suggestion to the contrary.\nBy 2020, Australia will have surpassed its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 367 million tons more than is required to meet its 2020 Kyoto target. There are few members of the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that can make that claim. Our latest estimates show that Australia\u2019s emissions per capita and the emissions intensity of its economy are at their lowest levels in 29 years. In 2012, it was estimated that Australia would release some 693 million tons of emissions in 2020. As of 2018, that estimate has fallen to 540 million tons.\nAustralia\u2019s electricity sector is producing fewer emissions. In the year to March 2019, emissions from Australia\u2019s electricity sector were 15.7 per cent lower than the peak recorded in the year to June 2009. While Australia is a resource-rich country, it is important to note that it produces only around 5.5 per cent of the world\u2019s coal production. Having met and on its way to exceeding its Kyoto targets, Australia will also meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change \u2014 and we stand by them. We have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below our 2005 levels by 2030. That is a credible, fair, responsible and achievable contribution to global climate change action. It represents a halving of emissions per capita in Australia or a two-thirds reduction in emissions per unit of gross domestic product.\nAt the centre of our domestic efforts is our $3.5-billion climate solutions package, which I campaigned on during our recent national election and successfully launched as Prime Minister. It supports practical projects, such as capturing methane from waste and the revegetation of degraded land and soil carbon. Through our climate solutions plan, we are supporting the transition to renewable energy with projects such as Snowy 2.0, the largest pumped hydro station in the southern hemisphere. We are also investing significantly in research and development to use the best science and business expertise to commercialize new renewable technologies and integrate renewables into our electricity grid. Australia now has the highest per capita investment in clean energy technologies of anywhere in the world and one in five Australian households has rooftop solar systems. In 2018, $13.2 billion were invested in clean energy technologies in Australia. That builds on the estimated $10 billion that was invested in 2017.\nWe are also doing the right thing by our neighbours. We recently committed to investing an additional 500 million Australian dollars over five years from 2020 for renewable energy, climate change and resilience in the Pacific region. We have decided to invest that directly from within our international overseas development programme, rather than by making an additional budget contribution to the Green Climate Fund. That enables us to target our support directly to Pacific island nations to ensure that they receive that support directly, and in a more timely and targeted fashion. At the same time, it provides greater transparency, fairness and accountability for Australian taxpayers, who rightly demand attention and support from their Government to address the significant challenges at home, in particular with regard to boosting drought resilience through our investment in national water grid infrastructure.\nAustralia is also committed, among other countries, to the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer, an agreement that will help protect the world from ozone depletion and combat climate change. Under the Montreal Protocol, Australia will further accelerate its efforts and will use 60 per cent fewer hydrochlorofluorocarbons than permitted. I can proudly inform the Assembly that Australia is on track to fulfil those commitments and I urge all other countries to do likewise.\nAll of that adds up to significant and comprehensive action by Australia in response to the world\u2019s greatest environmental challenges. Australia is under no illusions about the challenges that the global community will confront in the years ahead. Today, I want to reassure all Member States that Australia is carrying its own weight and more, just as we always have. We are a generous nation playing our part in securing our shared future. We are reforming the rules of global governance, setting common standards to ensure global connectivity in a digital future, preventing conflict, building the capacities of developing nations, supporting essential health projects, protecting our oceans, taking action on climate change and achieving results.\nLike many of the leaders here, I get many letters from children in Australia who are concerned about their future. I take them very seriously and I deeply respect their concerns. Indeed, I welcome their passion, especially when it comes to our environment. My impulse is always to seek to respond positively, to encourage them, to provide them with context and perspective, and in particular to generate hope, focus their minds and direct their energies to practical solutions \u2014 things they can do, positive behaviour \u2014 that will deliver enduring results for them. I seek to encourage them to learn more about science, technology, engineering and maths, because it will be through research, innovation and enterprise that the practical work of successfully managing our very real environmental challenges is achieved.\nWe must respect and harness the passion and aspiration of our younger generations and we must guard against others who may seek to compound or, worse, facelessly exploit their anxiety to advance other agendas. At the same time, we must not allow their concerns to be dismissed or diminished, as that can also needlessly increase their anxiety. What parent would do otherwise? Our children have a right not just to their future, but to their optimism. Above all, we must let our children be children, let our kids be kids and let our teenagers be teenagers while we do the work positively together to deliver the practical solutions for them and their future.\nI am confident that, as Australia stands here once again, together we will have the wit, the capacity and the will to surmount the challenges that will come our way, just as those who have come before us in this place have done, consistent with the values that have made that possible.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session and to assure him of Uganda\u2019s full support. My delegation is pleased to have an eminent African steering the work of this organ and remains confident that he will lead the Assembly effectively and successfully. I would also like to thank Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her leadership during the seventy-third session. I pay tribute to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his dedication and commitment to the work of the United Nations.\nUganda welcomes the theme of this session. It reminds us that, by putting the eradication of poverty, the improvement of livelihoods for all and the protection of our planet among its core objectives, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in 2015 is ambitious, inclusive and transformative; it seeks to leave no one behind.\nAt the outset, I wish to thank the membership of the United Nations, in particular the Group of 77 and China, for their support and for accepting Uganda\u2019s offer to host the third South Summit in Kampala in April 2020. We look forward to welcoming all the members and working with them to strengthen and further revitalize our cooperation, within the context of a global partnership for sustainable development.\nUganda has prioritized poverty eradication and the provision of quality education in its national development plan, through deliberate and targeted investments in agriculture, industrialization, strategic infrastructure, such as roads and railways, energy production and human capital development. Uganda is mainstreaming the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the main component of the 2030 Agenda, through partnerships and targeted resource mobilization, from both domestic and external sources. Good progress has been made to integrate the SDGs into national, sectoral and local Government plans, and the progress of implementation is tracked through a national monitoring and evaluation system.\nThe biggest challenge remains inadequate financing to implement the 2030 Agenda. In order to mobilize domestic resources for the implementation of the SDGs, Uganda is implementing a policy of promoting exports, attracting tourists and foreign investors, mobilizing external development resources on concessional or favourable terms and strengthening institutional capacity to enhance service delivery. We are also committed to promoting integrated national financing mechanisms that will lower the cost of borrowing and facilitate easier access to capital for priority areas such as agriculture, agroprocessing and value added. While we do our part, we call on our development partners to fulfil their commitments and extend support in terms of timely and adequate means for accelerated implementation.\nSetting our world on a sustainable course requires that we urgently address one of the defining challenges of our time, which is climate change. Climate change affects each and every one of us. All over the world, we have witnessed environmental disasters, the most recent of which in the Bahamas and Mozambique led to considerable loss of life and property. Those disasters showed the intensity and ferocity of the changes taking place in our environment. We stand in solidarity with the affected people as they continue with the recovery process.\nUganda has not been immune either, as it has experienced prolonged droughts, the melting of ice caps at its highest mountain, the Rwenzori Mountains, floods, erratic rainfall and landslides, which have also caused substantial loss of life. Those frequent and recurring episodes have severe consequences on our socioeconomic growth, which is heavily dependent on natural resources.\nDespite being one of the least emitters of polluting gases, Uganda has taken bold measures to move to implement some concrete adaptation and mitigation actions, such as the restoration of 64,000 hectares of wetlands to benefit 4 million farmers, the reforestation of over 200,000 hectares, the generation of an additional 20 per cent of clean energy from renewable sources and the promotion of solar-powered irrigation schemes.\nClimate financing remains crucial because investments are required to significantly reduce emissions, adapt to the adverse effects and reduce the impacts of a changing climate. We urge developed countries to scale up their level of financial support as committed to in a concrete road map to achieve the goal of jointly providing $100 billion annually by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation.\nWhile the world focuses on climate change, biodiversity loss continues to escalate. However, climate change and biodiversity loss are intrinsically linked, and both must be addressed simultaneously. Biodiversity is part of an intricate web of life that provides $125 trillion per year in ecosystem services to humans, such as clean drinking water, clean air, fertile soils, climate stabilization and crop pollination.\nRecent reports have shown that vulnerable populations will feel the effects of biodiversity loss first, as well as benefit the most from avoiding and reversing land degradation. Uganda is a country with a large population that relies heavily on natural resources. We are therefore likely to feel some of the most extreme affects first, such as the loss of wetlands, forests and even species. That is why Uganda is supporting a proposal at next year\u2019s meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity that takes bold steps to create a sustainable planet, including protecting at least 30 per cent of our lands and significantly generating more funding from Governments and the private sector to protect nature, on which our lives and economies depend.\nUganda is prioritizing universal health coverage to ensure that the population can access health services without risk of financial or economic ruin or impoverishment, no matter what their socioeconomic position might be. To demonstrate its commitment, my Government has developed a universal health coverage road map that lays out the main policy actions for quick wins and setting the course for sustainable and faster progress.\nMy Government is expanding community-level health promotion and prevention programmes to reduce the preventable disease burden. It is enhancing specialized medical care services to address population needs, especially for non-communicable diseases. We are also addressing financial risk protection by ensuring the affordability and sustainability of quality health-care services through legislation and aiding the institutionalization of a national health insurance scheme.\nWe welcome the high-level meeting on universal health coverage held a few days ago. In addition, we underscore the need to strengthen international solidarity and cooperation to make bigger and smarter investments in health to achieve universal health coverage by 2030.\nTerrorism constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. Terrorism and violent extremism continue to bring death and suffering to innocent people. Terrorist groups such as Da\u2019esh, Al-Qaida, Al-Shabaab and Boko Haram continue to inflict death and devastation. They continue to manipulate young minds by exploiting real or perceived injustices and grievances. The international community must adapt to that changing landscape. We must be unswerving in our resolve to combat terrorism. Uganda will continue to support and actively participate in global counter-terrorism efforts.\nUganda remains committed to multilateralism as a means to achieving comprehensive and equitable solutions to global problems and global challenges. The 2030 Agenda was truly a triumph for multilateralism. We proved that the global community could work together to address pressing issues facing humankind, while making the necessary commitments for the benefit of all. We must redouble our collective efforts to seek common solutions to various pressing regional and global challenges, including unsettled situations and conflicts in various parts of the world, transnational organized crime and disease.\nAs we saw in the recent period, the Ebola virus and other diseases know no boundaries. Recent outbreaks are a reminder of areas where countries in a region, working with the international community, can work together to detect, assess, notify and respond to such public health threats and challenges. Uganda has been involved in such efforts, and we appreciate the support extended by the international community in dealing with the recent outbreak in our region. I wish to reiterate Uganda\u2019s readiness to strengthen international collaboration in that endeavour.\nOur development and transformation cannot take place without peace and security, which are prerequisites for socioeconomic development and transformation. We should continue to give attention to supporting an environment that is peaceful, thereby enabling us to concentrate on our growth and on development. The United Nations should continue to support conflict prevention and resolution initiatives undertaken by regional and subregional organizations such as the African Union and Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). That partnership should be based on a division of labour and burden-sharing, complementarity and mutual respect. Where there has been such cooperation, we have seen positive results.\nWe congratulate the Government and the people of the Sudan on the historic milestone of reaching an agreement between the Forces for Freedom and Change and the Transitional Military Council, which ushered in a civilian-led transitional Government in the Sudan. We commend Mr. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union Commission, and Mr. Abiy Ahmed, Prime Minister of Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and current IGAD Chairperson, for their tireless efforts. That was a clear demonstration of the pursuit of African solutions to African problems.\nWe a pleased with the progress Somalia is making in finding peace and stability. Those developments are taking place against the backdrop of Government efforts to consolidate State institutions, including the building of its national security forces, which will pave the way for the gradual drawdown and exit of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). As the country implements the transition plan, it is essential that the international community address the mismatch between the commitment to generate the requisite Somali national security forces and the drawdown of AMISOM. A failure to carefully manage that process could imperil the political and security gains already made.\nWith regard to South Sudan, we are pleased with the positive progress in the implementation of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan. We welcome the progress on the security front and urge the non-signatory groups to join the nation-building efforts. We call on the international community to support the positive momentum and expedite its support for the completion of the remaining critical tasks.\nUganda continues to support the efforts of the peoples of the colonies and non-self-governing territories to exercise their right to self-determination. We believe that, to achieve decolonization, the voices of the people of those territories should be heard by all. We support the right of the people of Western Sahara, the only such territory on the African continent, to self-determination on the basis of respect for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and the relevant United Nations resolutions. Uganda supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to achieve a mutually acceptable political solution between the parties.\nThe Assembly made a historic pledge during the 2005 World Summit to strengthen the United Nations with a view of enhancing its authority and its efficiency. In line with that pledge, Uganda has continued to support the cause for a revitalized, reformed and effective United Nations system. It is critical to make the United Nations more responsive, efficient and effective in its support to the efforts of Member States to achieve the SDGs. Uganda welcomes and supports the Secretary-General\u2019s reform to make the Organization more efficient and effective.\nUganda is proud to host the United Nations Regional Service Centre in Entebbe, which over the years has proved it can provide the efficiency gains and cost savings that the Secretary-General and the United Nations membership are calling for. Since its establishment, the Regional Service Centre has grown and expanded with the active support of the Government. As Member States prepare for discussions on the global service delivery model during this session, Uganda looks forward to support by the membership for Entebbe as a location for a global shared service centre.\nThe need to reform the Security Council is more urgent and imperative now than ever before. Uganda supports the comprehensive reform of the Security Council. The present geopolitical realities are compelling for a comprehensive reform of the Council to make way for equitable representation. Africa, with more than 1 billion citizens and over 70 per cent of issues on the agenda of the Security Council, has no representation in the permanent category of membership, in addition to being underrepresented in the non-permanent category. It is time that we address this long-standing injustice and imbalance, perpetuated in the present configuration of the Security Council, without further delay. Uganda supports the Common African Position on Security Council reform, as enunciated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. We urge Member States to work to achieve progress in the negotiations on reform in the context of the intergovernmental negotiations.\nThe predicament of refugees continues to this day. Millions of refugees continue to live in countries facing economic and development challenges. Despite the generosity of host countries and international actors, the gap between the needs and the humanitarian funding of refugees and host communities has in effect widened. Uganda has maintained its open-door policy on refugees and currently hosts more than 1.3 million refugees \u2014 the largest number of refugees in Africa.\nOur approach to refugees is anchored in our pan-African spirit, whereby we regard refugees as our brothers and sisters fleeing conflict and distress, who, above all, are seeking peace and security. The influx and prolonged presence of refugees have had an adverse impact on the environment. Forests have been stripped, as refugees need poles for houses, firewood, medicine, thatching and fodder within and far away from the refugee settlements. It is estimated that 15,000 hectares of forest and savannah woodland near several refugee settlements in the country have been lost.\nThe circumstances of refugees and host communities pose enormous challenges to the national authorities, which need to be addressed as part of international solidarity. Solidarity is not a one-way street. We call for more equitable sharing of the burden and responsibility for hosting and supporting the world\u2019s refugees, consistent with international commitments.\nStrengthening South-South cooperation is critical to the achievement of the SDGs. We welcome the outcome of the second High-level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation, held earlier this year in Buenos Aires. That meeting underscored, inter alia, the need to promote peaceful and inclusive societies in order to achieve sustainable development and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.\nFinally, I wish to reiterate the readiness of Uganda to work with Member States in preparation of the South-South Summit to be held in Kampala in April 2020. We believe that the Summit will make a significant contribution to our collective efforts towards achieving the SDGs."

        "file_text": "It is a privilege for me, as a Cabo Verdean, to greet all the peoples of the United Nations represented here by their highest dignitaries. I extend a special greeting to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in recognition of how he has been leading and elevating the United Nations system to new heights in all areas, from human rights to peace and from the struggle against inequalities and injustice to sustainable development.\nI welcome the General Assembly\u2019s adoption of resolution 73/339, on cooperation with the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries.\nCabo Verde congratulates Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of Nigeria on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. He can count on the support of Cabo Verde. We agree with him on the virtues of multilateral diplomacy in the service of peace and development.\nCabo Verde is a country with 559 years of history. Our history is one of ambition, resilience, triumph and adaptation. We have lived for centuries in a country where rainfall is sparse and uneven. We experienced hunger in the 1940s. Today, we are much more resilient and face periods of drought, always with the assurance of food security. Since the late seventeenth century, Cabo Verdeans have emigrated for economic reasons and today we have a vast diaspora in the United States, Europe and the African continent that contributes to our economy and the presence of Cabo Verde in the world. We have progressed from a very poor country to a middle-income country and now, in this generation, we legitimately aspire to development.\nWe have always had a difficult yet passionate relationship with nature. The good news, in what is a major trend moving forward, is that the world now values the resources found in Cabo Verde that caused trouble for past generations. The sea, which our musicians and poets sang about as the path to emigration and longing, has become an asset for the blue economy and tourism. The wind and the sun, which used to signal drought, now produce renewable energy. Our location, distant from the rest of the world, is now an important resource, positioning Cabo Verde as a platform in the mid-Atlantic, connecting Africa to Europe, the United States and Brazil.\nWe did not invent a new country; we adapted to living in it. We overcame the challenges and made a patriotic commitment to development, in the conviction that no one will do for us that which we cannot do for ourselves to drive the structural changes that our country needs in order to develop. The most secure foundation on which those changes can occur is political stability, good governance and trust rooted in the rule of law and the integrity of our institutions. Those are the most important assets that we in Cabo Verde are determined to preserve, watch over, value and improve.\nWe face the same economic, social and environmental challenges as all small island developing States (SIDS). We face the development challenges of a SIDS that has graduated to middle-income status. Our goal is not to grow out of less-advanced country status and remain a middle-income country under more punishing financing and cooperation conditions. Rather, our goal is to achieve development and high income. We therefore need development to be the goal of the transition process and for financing mechanisms and conditions to be coherent and consistent with that goal.\nThe revision of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway currently under way is an opportunity for us to step up actions that may help island nations to develop their economic competitiveness, promote social inclusion, foster resilience in their exposure to climate change and other extreme events, as well as access and judicious and sustainable financing.\nWe welcome the vision that Mr. Muhammad-Bande has brought us and the theme that has been proposed for our general debate, namely, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, without forgetting peace and security as essential conditions for those efforts to succeed. These are global issues that require local responses in a context of global solidarity as they have implications for global security in the broadest sense.\nCabo Verde is implementing its strategic sustainable development plan, which is fully harmonized with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Cabo Verde takes a cross-cutting gender equality and equity approach in our planning system, State budget and public policies. Cabo Verde guarantees the right to education for all by ensuring the universalization and funding of preschool education, providing free access to basic and secondary education and responding to special education needs. Cabo Verde has invested in social protection and care for the most vulnerable sectors of our society, including children, the elderly and persons with disabilities. Cabo Verde is betting on autonomy and self-sufficiency for families through policies that promote job creation, entrepreneurship and productive inclusion.\nCabo Verde is implementing a water and energy transition strategy aimed at reducing reliance on rainwater and fossil fuels, and improving people\u2019s economic capacity to access water and energy. We introduced the first seawater desalinator 50 years ago. Today, 70 per cent of the population in Cabo Verde uses desalinated water for consumption. In coming years, as a result of current investments, we will reach 90 per cent. We are implementing strategies to diversify sources of water for agriculture through desalinization, the reuse of wastewater and the dissemination of drip irrigation together with renewable energy.\nWe are implementing an energy transition strategy in order to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. From the current level of 20 per cent, our goal is to reach 30 per cent power production from renewable sources by 2025, exceed 50 per cent by 2030 and reach 100 per cent renewable resource use by 2040. We are the first\nAfrican country to join the Transport Decarbonisation Alliance. As part of our energy transition strategy, we intend to gradually replace all internal combustion vehicles with electric vehicles by 2050. That is our modest contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in transportation.\nCabo Verde has demonstrated its alignment, commitment and credibility with respect to the broader ideals of the United Nations. We wish to position Cabo Verde as a useful interlocutor in promoting dialogue, peace and tolerance among nations and as a credible ally for cooperative security against such transnational crimes as drug trafficking, trafficking in persons and terrorism. We are taking all steps to implement the 17 Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in an effort that involves Government, companies, civil society organizations and international partners. We seek even greater commitment in order to achieve our ultimate goal of developed status. For the United Nations, which will celebrate 75 years of existence in 2020, and for each country individually, this is a great moment to accelerate our actions towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals if we actually wish to leave no one behind and achieve one of the more humanistic goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nTime is short and we need concrete action to reverse the direction and breadth of climate change. Time is short and we must implement effective responses to the challenge of poverty and its consequences. Time is short and we must commit to peace. The current generation of political players does not have all the time in the world and must be held accountable to humankind. The time has arrived for us to move beyond intentions. It is time for us to undertake concrete, measurable and committed actions to fulfil the aspirations of our peoples and our global needs. It is time to improve the world.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, it gives me pleasure to sincerely congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I also express my appreciation to Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinoza Garces, President of the General Assembly at its previous session.\nOur gathering this year comes at a time when the magnitude of the challenges facing our world is increasing. It is therefore imperative that we all engage in an in-depth discussion on the prospects for advancing our work under the umbrella of the United Nations, while upholding the noble values upon which the Organization was founded. That can be achieved by reaffirming our commitment to an effective and just international order that is based on dialogue, cooperation, promoting a culture of peace and mutual respect.\nAs a founding member of the United Nations and of a number of regional organizations, including the African Union, which we are honoured to chair this year, and of the League of Arab States, Egypt has always possessed its own unique vision and contribution towards addressing the greatest challenges of our world. Allow me here, from this important rostrum, to present Egypt\u2019s visions and contributions in that regard.\nRespecting the principle of national ownership of solutions is crucial to ensuring the effectiveness of the international multilateral system. Egypt has a pioneer national experience in that regard. In recent years, it has embarked on an ambitious plan to comprehensively advance its society, including by resolutely combating terrorism and launching the most ambitious economic reform programme in its modern history. That has been undertaken in accordance with national plans and priorities, which have been embraced by the Egyptian people, who have graciously shouldered their burden of successfully implementing the first phase in a manner that exceeded all expectations.\nRegionally, as the current Chair of the African Union, we have worked alongside our brothers to consolidate the principle of African solutions to African problems. That seeks to develop a comprehensive approach that lays the foundations for development through a continent-wide vision based on our common history, unity of destiny and confidence in our ability to achieve progress towards integration and uphold the interests of our peoples. To that end, a new mechanism has been launched in Cairo, which will focus on post-conflict reconstruction, namely, the African Union Centre for Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development.\nUndoubtedly, all Member States are well aware of the many recent successes in implementing the principle of national ownership, supported by an active African role, which resulted in achieving a peace agreement in the Central African Republic as well as developing a common vision among the various parties in the Sudan to manage the transition phase in that country. In that connection, I would like to call for the removal of the Sudan\u2019s name from the list of States that sponsor terrorism, in order to acknowledge the positive transformation of that brotherly country, which would enable it to confront the economic challenges it faces by interacting with international economic organizations in order to fulfil its people\u2019s ambitions and ensure that it returns to its rightful place within the international community.\nOn the principle of national ownership, African countries are fully cognizant of the importance of formulating genuine and effective partnerships to address the political and economic challenges they face and gain access to knowledge and technology, develop African human resources and mobilize the necessary financing and political support \u2014 all essential to achieving the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063.\nI therefore call upon international, continental and regional financing institutions to assume their role in financing development in Africa on the most favourable terms. Indeed, Africa is a continent of promising opportunities. It could become the new engine of growth for the entire global economy, especially after the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area, the strengthening of regional integration arrangements and the development of an ambitious strategy for infrastructure.\nI would like, in that connection, to refer to Egypt\u2019s convening of the first Aswan Forum for Sustainable Peace and Development, to be held in December in Aswan, which will serve as a platform for dialogue among international and regional actors, including political leaders, financial institutions, civil society and the private sector, that aims to implement international and regional initiatives and mechanisms targeting Africa.\nResolving protracted and inherited crises is a necessary precondition for any serious efforts to formulate a more effective international system. The most prominent example of that is the longest-standing crisis in the Middle East \u2014 the Palestinian question. The persistence of that question, without a just solution based on international resolutions that call for the establishment of the independent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital, means not only the continued plight of the Palestinian people but also the continued depletion of the capabilities and resources of the peoples of the Middle East.\nI reiterate with a clear conscience what I have stated from this rostrum over the past few years \u2014 Arabs are open to the realization of a just and comprehensive peace, the Arab Peace Initiative is still valid and there remains an opportunity to launch a new phase in the Middle East.\nHowever, we need bold decisions that restore the rights of the Palestinians and pave the way for a major change in the reality of the region and \u2014 I say this without exaggeration \u2014 the entire international system. Such decisions would lead to the establishment of a security and economic system in the Middle East that is based on peace, security, cooperation and common interests.\nThe adoption of comprehensive solutions to address the root causes of international problems is imperative for the success of the international multilateral system. That applies to the protracted crisis of the brotherly Libyan people, who suffer daily from the scourge of an armed conflict that must be stopped.\nIt is time to take a decisive stance to address the root causes of the Libyan crisis in a comprehensive manner by committing to the full implementation of all the provisions of the United Nations action plan adopted by the Security Council in October 2017 and by addressing the grave imbalance in the distribution of wealth and power, as well as the lack of public oversight by the Libyan people\u2019s elected representatives over political and economic decision-making. We also need to work on unifying all national institutions in order to save our brotherly neighbour from the ensuing chaos triggered by militias and prevent the intervention of external actors in Libya.\nJust as it is imperative to find a comprehensive solution to the Libyan crisis, a political solution in Syria has also become an urgent need. We can no longer afford to waste time and continue in the vicious cycle that Syria has been enduring for eight years. While Egypt welcomes the announcement of the formation of a constitutional committee, we nevertheless call for the immediate commencement of its work without delay as a fundamental step towards the realization of a comprehensive political settlement, in accordance with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). That would lead to safeguarding the unity and territorial integrity of Syria and the cohesion of its institutions, and would put an end to the bloodshed while totally eliminating terrorism.\nThe same logic applies to the protracted crisis in Yemen. It is time to take a decisive stance to end the crisis there by implementing a political solution based on the well-known parameters. We need to end foreign interventions by non-Arab regional parties that seek to curtail Arab national security. We also need to address the unprecedented threats facing the Arabian Gulf region, including threats to navigation, as well as the recent attacks on oil installations in the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nThe principle of addressing matters comprehensively also applies to one of the most daunting challenges of our time \u2014 terrorism. Egypt has persistently called for a comprehensive approach to combating terrorism based on the necessity of confronting all terrorist organizations, without exception. In that regard, I stress the need for all to fully comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions and hold accountable those who support terrorism \u2014 whether by providing them with funding, weapons, safe havens or media platforms \u2014 in addition to those involved in facilitating the movement and travel of terrorists.\nFrom this rostrum, I reiterate Egypt\u2019s readiness, in the light of its extensive counter-terrorism experience, to intensify its cooperation with friendly countries and the United Nations, especially with regard to countering the ideology of terrorism. I stress the importance in that regard of implementing Security Council resolution 2354 (2017), on the implementation of the comprehensive international framework to counter terrorist narratives, which was adopted on the basis of an Egyptian initiative to uphold the values of tolerance and the renewal of religious discourse.\nThe Security Council must work seriously and resolutely to address the imbalance in its composition and the shortcomings of its decision-making process. We must ensure a just and balanced representation in the Council. We must work to rectify the historical injustice to which our African continent has been subjected. I reiterate our commitment to the common African position based on the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, and I call upon the Assembly to adopt that just position within the framework of the relevant governmental negotiations.\nFor decades, Egypt has sought to strengthen and deepen the bonds of cooperation with its brotherly Nile basin countries, with which it enjoys excellent relations. As a testament to its keenness to further the wellbeing of the sisterly peoples of the Nile basin, Egypt has expressed its understanding regarding Ethiopia\u2019s first steps towards construction of the Renaissance Dam, despite the fact that Ethiopia did not conduct the necessary studies on the effects of that huge project to ensure that no harm befalls the water interests of downstream countries, including Egypt.\nYet Egypt took the initiative to propose the Agreement on Declaration of Principles on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which was signed in Khartoum on 23 March 2015, initiating a four-year negotiation process to reach an agreement governing the process of filling and operating the Renaissance Dam. Unfortunately, those negotiations have not yielded the desired results.\nNevertheless, Egypt still hopes for an agreement that will secure the common interests of the peoples of the Blue Nile in Ethiopia, the Sudan and Egypt. The continued impasse in the negotiations on the Renaissance Dam will have negative repercussions for the stability and development of the region in general, and of Egypt in particular.\nWhile we recognize Ethiopia\u2019s right to development, for Egypt the water of the Nile is a matter of life and existence, which places a great responsibility on the international community to play a constructive role in urging all parties to demonstrate flexibility in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory agreement.\nIn conclusion, Egypt\u2019s message today comes in the form of a call for the pursuit of peace, a call to action for the benefit of humankind, a call for cooperation and mutual understanding, a call for the achievement of sustainable development and the promotion and protection of human rights, and a call for the realization of what is the ideal path for the benefit of the international community.\nMay God help us for the good of all our peoples. Peace and God\u2019s mercy and blessing be upon those present.\n"

        "file_text": "Ei nga tangata katoa, e manaa kitia ana te whenua, o te Ai Whanui Ei nga kaitiaki, e riterite ana, nga whenua, hurl rauna, i to Ao Ia tu tatou ki te wero hia I nga wero I te ingoa o te tika o nga me a katoa Tema koutou katoa.\nI greet the Assembly in Te Reo Maori, the language of the tangata whenua, or first people, of Aotearoa, New Zealand. I do so, not just because it is the same way I would begin an address if I were at home but because there are challenges that we face as a world that I know no better way to express. Maori concepts, like kaitiakitanga, represent the idea that all of us here today are guardians \u2014 guardians of the land, of our environment and of our people.\nThere is a simplicity to the notion of sovereign guardianship. For decades we have assembled here under the assumption that we narrowly cooperate only on the issues that overtly impact one another, issues like international trade rules, the law of the sea or humanitarian access to war zones. The space in-between has, essentially, been left to us.\nWe, the political leaders of the world, have been the authors of our own domestic politics and policies. Decisions have been our own and we have ultimately lived with the consequences \u2014 but the world has changed. Over time, we have become increasingly interdependent. We see more and more often domestic decisions that have global ramifications. Physical events have taught us that in obvious ways \u2014 oil spills that show no respect for maritime boundaries; nuclear accidents and testing, the impacts of which are never confined to the exact location in which they occur; and so on.\nYet our interdependence, our connection, runs so much deeper than that. Experiences in recent years should lead us to question whether any of us ever truly operate in isolation anymore. That is a question that we, the remote but connected nation of New Zealand, have been grappling with this year. There are things that we are well known for in New Zealand \u2014 green rolling hills, perfect, you might say, for hobbits to hide in and for plenty of sheep to roam. We are known for manaakitanga, or the pride we take in caring for our guests, so much so, that it even extends to our most entrenched sporting rivals.\nNow we are known for something else. On 15 March 2019, an alleged terrorist undertook the most horrific attack on a place of worship, taking the lives of 51 innocent people, devastating our Muslim community and challenging our sense of who we are as a country. There is no changing a nation\u2019s history, but we can choose how it defines us.\nIn Aotearoa, New Zealand, the people who lined up outside mosques with flowers, the young people who gathered spontaneously in parks and open spaces in a show of solidarity, the thousands who stopped in silence to acknowledge the call to prayer seven days later and the Muslim community who showed only love \u2014 those are the people who collectively decided that New Zealand would not be defined by an act of brutality and violence, but instead by compassion and empathy.\nMake no mistake, we do not claim to be a perfect nation. While we are home to more than 200 ethnicities, that does not mean we are free from racism or discrimination. We have wounds from our own history that, 250 years on from the first encounters between Maori and Europeans, we continue to address. But since the terrorist attack in New Zealand, we have had to ask ourselves many hard and many difficult questions.\nOne example sticks in my mind. It was only days after the shooting that I visited a mosque in our capital city. After spending some time with community leaders, I exited and walked across the car park, where members of the Muslim community were gathered. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a young boy gesture to me. He was shy, almost retreating towards a barrier, but he also had something he clearly wanted to say. I quickly crouched down next to him. He did not say his name or even \u201cHello\u201d, he simply whispered, \u201cWill I be safe now?\u201d\nWhat does it take for a child to feel safe? As adults, we are quick to make the practical changes that will enable us to say that such a horrific act could never happen again \u2014 and we did that. Within 10 days of the attack, we made a decision to change our guns laws and banned military style semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles in New Zealand. We have started on a second tranche of reforms to register weapons and to change our licensing regime. Those changes will help make us safer. But when you are a child, fear is not discrete and it cannot be removed through legislative acts or decrees of parliament. Feeling safe means the absence of fear; living free from racism, bullying and discrimination; feeling loved, included and able to be exactly who you are. To feel truly safe, those conditions need to be universal \u2014 no matter who you are, no matter where you come from, no matter where you live.\nThe young Muslim boy in Kilbirnie, New Zealand, wanted to know if I could grant him all of those things. My fear is, that as a leader of a proudly independent nation, that is one thing that I cannot achieve alone, not anymore. In our borderless and technologically connected world, commentary on race, acts of discrimination based on religion, gender, sexuality or ethnicity are not neatly confined behind boundaries \u2014 they are felt globally. The fact that I received so many letters from Muslim children from around the world in the weeks after 15 March speaks to the power of connection.\nThose children had no sense of distance. They may have never heard of New Zealand before 15 March. They just saw an act of hatred against their community and it felt close to them. Whether it is acts of violence, language intended to incite fear of religious groups or assumptions about ethnicities that breed distrust and racism \u2014 those actions and utterances are as globalized as the movement of goods and services. Children hear them, women hear them, people of faith hear them and our rainbow communities hear them.\nNow, it is our turn to stop and listen \u2014 to accept that our words and actions have immeasurable consequences and to speak not only like the whole world is listening but with the responsibility of someone who knows a small child somewhere might be listening too.\nThe spaces in which we communicate are part of the challenge too. In an increasingly online world, we need to create spaces for the exchange of ideas, the sharing of technology and the exercise of free speech, while also acknowledging the potential for that technology to be used to cause harm. The events of 15 March were a staggering example of such harm and a deliberate effort to broadcast terror on a massive, viral scale over the Internet. The alleged terrorist did not just take the lives of 51 people, he did it live on Facebook. In the first 24 hours after the attack, Facebook took down 1.5 million copies of the live stream video. YouTube saw a copy of the video uploaded, at times, as fast as once every second during the same period.\nThe alleged terrorist used social media as a weapon. The attack demonstrated how the Internet \u2014 a global commons with extraordinary power to do good \u2014 can be perverted and used as a tool for terrorists. What happened in Christchurch, as well as being a profound tragedy, is also a complex and ongoing problem for the world. It is a problem we felt a sense of responsibility to do something about, so we sought to collaborate with the technology companies that are so integral to the solution.\nTwo months after the attacks, leaders gathered in Paris for the Christchurch Call to Action Summit, bringing together companies, countries and civil society, and committing to a range of actions to reduce the harm such content can cause. In so doing, we have kept our focus on the deeper aim we all aspire to \u2014 technology that unleashes human potential, not the worst in us.\nYesterday, I met with Call supporters to check on our collective progress. We announced that a key tech industry institution will be reshaped to give effect to those commitments and we launched a crisis response protocol to make sure that we can respond to such events, should they happen in the future. Neither New Zealand nor any other country could make those changes on their own, and neither could the technology companies. We are succeeding because we are working together and for that unprecedented and powerful act of unity, New Zealand says, \u201cthank you\u201d.\nThe centrality of technology in our lives is not the only example of our increasing interconnection and reliance on one another if we are to respond to the challenges we face. There is perhaps no better example of our absolute interdependence than the issue of climate change. When the Secretary-General visited the Pacific region this year, he saw at first-hand how countries that have produced the fewest greenhouse gas emissions are now facing the most catastrophic effects. In his words: \u201cTo save the Pacific is to save the whole planet.\u201d\nIn fact, 7 of the 15 most climate-affected nations in the world sit within the Pacific region, including places like Tuvalu, with a population of just over 11,000 people, which barely contributes to global emissions but is paying the price for our collective inaction; atolls so low-lying that in weather events the water on either side of them can flow together and join at the narrowest points, engulfed by the sea; or Tokelau, a beautiful set of three atolls that can only be accessed by boat, where the children speak knowledgeably about climate change, knowing that unlike all the challenges their self-reliant forbears have ever faced, this one is completely and utterly in other people\u2019s hands.\nThey have never met the world leaders represented here, nor have those leaders met them, but I can tell everyone that their expectations of all of us are high. Meeting those expectations will require us to use every policy lever available and, following the example of the Christchurch Call, we need to work with partners inside and outside Government to make change.\nIn New Zealand, we have plenty of work to do. We may produce only 0.17 per cent of global emissions, but like so many others, our gross emissions have been rising steadily since the 1990s. That is why we have coupled ambition with action. Over the past two years since my Government took office, New Zealand has produced our own zero carbon legislation, which puts our domestic economic transformation in line with the objective of a 1.5\u00b0C limit in global temperature increase.\nWe have continued towards our goal of planting 1 billion trees. We have created a $100 million green investment fund. We have stopped issuing new offshore oil and gas exploration permits. We are creating a plan to achieve 100 per cent renewable electricity generation and to incentivize low emission transport options. We are also supporting our Pacific neighbours with projects to increase solar power, reduce the use of diesel generators, protect coastlines and stop seawater from entering water supplies.\nSome answers to the climate challenge are easier than others. The vast bulk of our greenhouse gas emissions, for instance, do not come from transport, energy generation or waste but from one of the things that we pride ourselves on \u2014 our food production for the world. We know that requires us to adapt. In fact, our farming leaders have made their own commitment to cutting emissions from food production. Over the next five years, we will collaborate with farmers to build systems in New Zealand that every farmer will be able to use to measure, manage and reduce their own farm\u2019s emissions.\nWe are doing that because we are unique. Agriculture makes up nearly half of our greenhouse gas emissions, setting us apart from our counterparts in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, but we will not stay out there on our own for long. When other countries cut pollution from traditional sectors, like energy and transport, their profiles will start to look more and more like ours does today.\nNew Zealand will never produce all of the food that the world needs, no matter how many sheep the world may think we have, but we can produce the ideas and the technology that the world needs for everyone to farm and to grow in the most sustainable way possible. New Zealand is determined to do good and to be good for the world.\nThat is why we are also focused on tackling the billions of dollars that countries spend annually on fossil fuel subsidies \u2014 billions that could instead be spent on transitioning to new forms of clean energy generation. Despite commitments to phase out such subsidies by groups like the Group of 20 and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, we are still struggling to see concrete action. It is time to do things differently.\nNew Zealand will once more be calling on countries to support an end to fossil fuel subsidies at the Twelfth World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference, to be held in June 2020. This week, New Zealand and a group of like-minded countries will also announce the launch of a new initiative that applies trade levers to climate-related goods, services and technologies.\nIt is time for trade deals to become a force for good on climate action. They need to stop allowing perverse subsidies that incentivize pollution and finally remove tariffs on green technology. Fossil fuel companies should no longer reap the benefits of subsidies that many, like our farmers and others, have been asked to give up. Without the billions in subsidies that go into the fossil fuel industry, green energy can compete on an even footing. It is both the most fair and economically consistent thing to do. My question is \u2014 will our fellow members of the General Assembly join us?\nThat brings us back to the concept that challenges our modern political environment. We are being asked to make decisions that are local, but with consequences that are global. Yet that is what climate change requires us to do and it is what, historically, our commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, asks us to do. It is what standing up against acts of violence and discrimination asks us to do. Our globalized, borderless world asks us to be guardians not just for our people, but for all people.\nThere may have been a time when being unified under common challenges was an easier concept than it is today, but, undeniably, we are living at a time when our greater reliance on one another has collided with a period of greater tribalism. It would be wrong to assume that this is a new phenomenon. Research has, in fact, shown that humans are so inclined to form natural tribes, that if one were to put a completely unconnected diverse group of people into a room and flip a coin for each person, two groups will automatically form a suspicion of one another based on nothing more than heads versus tails.\nScientist and writer Robert Sapolsky recently reminded us that humans organize. Whether according to class, race, country or coin-flipping, there has always been a tendency to form \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cother\u201d. But he also asks the question: What if we change what \u201cus\u201d means? What if, instead of forming our tribes based on fierce nationalism or self-interest, we seek to form them based on concepts that can and should be universal? What if we no longer see ourselves based on what we look like, what religion we practice or where we live, but by what we value \u2014 humanity, kindness, an innate sense of connection to each other and a belief that we are guardians, not just of our home and our planet, but of one another?\nWe are borderless, but we are connected. We are inherently different, but we have more that we share. We may feel afraid, but as leaders we have the keys to create a sense of security and a sense of hope. We just need to choose.\nTatou tatou. No reira, tena koutou, tena koutou, tena koutou katoa.\n"

        "file_text": "I am honoured to address the General Assembly and present Romania\u2019s renew commitment to multilateralism and the rules-based international order, with the United Nations at its core. With the fall of the hideous communist regime 30 years ago, my country embarked on a new era of freedom, democracy and prosperity. The Iron Curtain was replaced by our strong determination to rejoin the family of Western values and to interact openly with the rest of the world, driven by our deep respect for democratic principles and the international rule of law.\nToday all of us are profoundly interconnected by multilateral governance and, more than ever, we must value the genuine spirit of cooperation that the United Nations has always promoted and which is indispensable for finding efficient solutions to international challenges. The forthcoming seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations in 2020 will be an opportunity for our Organization to step up the implementation of the Secretary-General\u2019s ambitious reform package, renew our Organization and make sure that it delivers for all. The United Nations can count on Romania and our active commitment to fulfilling these ambitious endeavours.\nUndoubtedly, climate change is a global challenge, from the shortage of water and food insecurity to sea-level rise. I thank the Secretary-General for his leadership in generating a meaningful agenda on this issue throughout the year. Unfortunately, Romania has not been spared by the adverse effects of climate change, but we came to this session of the General Assembly with a sense of hope and responsibility \u2014 hope that it is not too late to secure a safe and environment-friendly planet for our children, and responsibility to undertake concrete steps in order to keep the pace with our promises under the Paris Agreement and the rules agreed in Katowice, including by pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0 C above pre-industrial levels. Our national strategy on climate change has been conceived with the aim of shaping an economy resilient to climate change, with low carbon-dioxide emissions, and able to integrate climate policies through smart economic growth. Our objective is to reach by 2050 a society in which economic, social and environmental policies are interconnected and designed to ensure sustainable development, high living standards and quality of environment.\nFurther, advancing the European Union agenda on climate change was a priority for Romania during its mandate as President of the Council of the European Union in the first six months of this year. The transition to a climate-neutral economy was intensively debated within the European Union, and its long-term strategy on climate change is to be finalized soon. At the same time, Romania answered the call of the Secretary-General to come up with national initiatives for nine portfolios, entailing concrete actions with the potential to curb greenhouse-gas emissions and increase global action on adaptation and resilience. A list in this regard was sent to the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Envoy for the 2019 Climate Change Summit.\nAdaptation tools and mitigation of the negative effects of climate change are parts of the wider strategy of sustainable development at the national and global levels. In Romania, a dedicated strategic document launched last year, the revised National Strategy for Romania\u2019s Sustainable Development 2030, guides our action over the next 12 years. Based on a broad public consultation, the Strategy mirrors the expectations of our society and maps the policies needed to meet the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The establishment of sustainable development units in the Administration and the creation of a civil society coalition for sustainable development are just a few tools we have envisaged in order to scale up our national effort in this area.\nDevelopment and security go hand in hand. Nevertheless, the approach based on the security-development nexus may not be enough to overcome security challenges as they may have roots going beyond development per se. Unfortunately, in our region, we continue to witness deliberate actions aimed at undermining security. The belt of unresolved conflicts around the Black Sea, which has strategic importance for transatlantic security, remains a serious source of instability, hampering regional cooperation and overall international security. Military presences on other countries territories without their consent, military build-ups, aggressive gestures, threats of the use of force, and the use of hybrid tactics to undermine internal stability are worrying developments and should be rejected by all of us.\nRomania remains a strong supporter of the multilateral rules-based international order built around the United Nations, which represents our best hope for tackling such challenges. The effectiveness of this international order depends on the willingness of all United Nations members to engage in finding lasting multilateral solutions that conform with the core values of the United Nations. Romania is strongly committed to acting in this way as a pillar of stability in the region, and we have constantly supported the United Nations efforts aimed at tackling such risks, including through General Assembly resolutions pertaining to these matters.\nRomania participated, and continues to participate, in United Nations peacekeeping operations, covering countries all over the world, from Afghanistan and the Sudan to Georgia and Haiti, and now Mali. In mid-October, 120 Romanians and four helicopters will start their mission in Mali \u2014 a critical area in support of the United Nations effort to help the Malian Government to achieve stability and build a safer future for its people by promoting sustainable development, peace and security.\nRomania reiterates its deep concern about the global spread and magnitude of terrorism and condemns in the strongest terms the continued recurrence of terrorist attacks, including those targeting representatives of diplomatic missions. Recently, such attacks in Kabul, Afghanistan, tragically ended the lives of two Romanian citizens and seriously wounded one. I reiterate the firm commitment of Romania to combating terrorism at the international level by using all available tools, including international law. Romania has welcomed the reform launched by the Secretary-General at the beginning of his term and supported the efforts of the United Nations to enhance coordination and improve coherence in the implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.\nIn conclusion, let me reaffirm Romania\u2019s full support in the endeavour to galvanize multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion at the General Assembly throughout the seventy-fourth session.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Professor Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. We offer him our full support during the duration of his mandate, which, we hope, will enable our Organization to make progress in addressing the most pressing issues that affect our peoples and the planet as a whole. We also congratulate the outgoing President, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for the wisdom with which she carried out the work of the previous session.\nFurthermore, we take this opportunity to pay tribute to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his tireless efforts to strengthen the role of our Organization in promoting peace, democracy and the protection of human life worldwide, as well as in combating poverty in all its forms in order to achieve sustainable development.\nWe welcome the theme of this session, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, because we believe in multilateralism as a means to solve the enormous and difficult problems facing the globe. Given that poverty is the greatest scourge of humankind, it is no coincidence that its eradication appears as the first Sustainable Development Goal. Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, should be the number-one priority for all of the countries of the world that make up the United Nations.\nPoverty is a major cause of hunger, land degradation, the unbridled exploitation of natural resources, armed conflict, the displacement of peoples, the saturation of major urban centres and migratory flows from south to north. And, as we all know, it has tragic consequences. It is in all of our interests to have societies in which peace, stability, progress and social justice reign, which means that we must unite our efforts to find the best solutions for our countries and regions, while also safeguarding their specificities. Only then will migratory flows be stopped. When it comes to the migratory flow from the south to the north, there is an unjustifiable impasse at hand. The destination countries must combine their efforts and coordinate their refugee reception policies and provide adequate support to the countries of origin in order to combat this sad phenomenon.\nWe believe that it is in the interest of us all to have peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, which translates into the need to unite our efforts to find solutions not only to the refugee problem, but also to the various armed conflicts that unfortunately continue to cloud various regions of the world. In that connection, it is advisable for our Organization to create more binding mechanisms to ensure solidarity with the victims of war and terrorism and to create lasting solutions to both old and new conflicts, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Syrian conflict, the Libyan conflict, the deployments of terrorist groups in the Sahel, and the actions of the Al-Shabaab terrorist groups in East Africa and Boko Haram in Central and West Africa. The situation of persistent political and military instability in the Central African Republic represents a great challenge for us and requires that we undertake concerted efforts to silence the guns in order to enable a negotiated solution through permanent dialogue with a view to ending the suffering of the Central African people.\nThe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe welcomes the positive evolution of the ongoing democratic consolidation process in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and encourages the Bissau-Guinean political actors to continue that path in order to ensure success in the presidential elections scheduled for November. In the same vein, we hope that the general elections in Mozambique scheduled for next October will take place in normal conditions and in peace and harmony, to the benefit of the country\u2019s socioeconomic development and the well-being of the Mozambican people.\nWith regard to the situation in the Sahara, we call on the parties to commit to the political process within the framework of the United Nations until its completion. In addition, we commend Morocco\u2019s efforts aimed at reaching a political settlement of the Sahara regional dispute, based on the Moroccan autonomy initiative.\nSao Tome and Principe once again reiterates its support for the Cuban people and calls on the international community to work towards the normalization of relations between Cuba and the United States of America and the lifting of the trade embargo, thereby allowing for Cuba\u2019s progress and development.\nIn addition to the consequences of violent extremism, the world faces many other challenges, such as the devastating effects of climate change, which pose serious obstacles to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals to which we all committed in this very Hall in 2015. We therefore believe that the United Nations must assume its true leadership role by uniting efforts to combat climate change. Natural disasters are occurring on a larger and more intense scale, leading to lives being lost, especially in the least developed regions of our planet. Global efforts must undoubtedly continue under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and that responsibility must be shared among us all, because we are the ones responsible for safeguarding the future for the generations to come.\nWe strongly believe in our Organization as the ideal vehicle to harmonize our world through respecting differences, cultures, models and systems of Government, but also to provide solutions capable of underpinning cooperation and exchanges that generate wealth, prosperity and lasting peace for all. Sustainable development has gained prominence in the debates of recent General Assembly sessions, demonstrating clearly the spirit of inclusion for which we strive. But in order for this spirit of inclusion to become a reality for all, we must see to it that the reform our Organization also becomes a reality, so that Africa may take up its rightful place and cease to be the only continent without a permanent seat on the Security Council.\nAs a small island developing State, and with all the constraints that come with that status, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe pursues policies adapted to our reality, with full respect for multicultural diversity and human rights. With no mineral resources and an economy highly vulnerable to external shocks, our country has faced enormous challenges in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals but has been making efforts to attain the goals that have been set. In order for these efforts to be effective, it is essential that we be able to count on the international community to provide the development-financing mechanisms announced at certain international forums. We cannot make lasting democratic achievements without sustained economic growth.\nIn that regard, and as the Assembly is aware, Sao Tome and Principe is preparing to graduate from the category of least developed countries to that of middle-income countries by December 2024, reflecting the efforts undertaken and the progress made by our country in key areas of sustainable development. However, our country will continue to face enormous challenges even after having graduated into that new category, and the continued support of the international community will be indispensable. Speaking from this high tribune gives us a unique opportunity to make a strong appeal to the international community not only to accompany us throughout the arduous task of transition but also to provide us with the necessary support for the full achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nAccess to development credit remains the only way to relaunch the global economy with the necessary conditions for risk mitigation, good governance and the fight against illegal financial flows. The African continent is lagging behind across all human- development indices. However, Africa remains a continent of opportunity for all, with huge mineral resources, vast arable land, forests, rivers and above all a large youth population. As for our country, Sao Tome and Principe remains unequivocally committed within the international community to building a better world for all.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I would like to assure him, my brother, of my delegation\u2019s support during this session. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces on her term in office as the fourth female President of the General Assembly. I hope that more women will continue to be elected to the post in future in the pursuit of gender parity. I commend her for her excellent work during the previous session. I also want to convey my condolences to the Government and the people of France on the death of former President Jacques Chirac. May his soul rest in eternal peace.\nI would like to begin by listening to the voice of silence, the voice of those who cannot speak but who are waiting for the Assembly to take action. As we speak, many are losing their precious lives because we cannot protect them. Many are escaping from countries because we cannot protect them. Many helpless children and women are being trafficked and sold like cargo without value. Many vulnerable children are heads of families or unable to go to school.\nAs an organization, we have urgent work to do. We are a generation with a place in history, a generation with a mission. And let us remember that time has a way of punishing history. If we do not take the right decisions and actions today, in time they may return to haunt us. The United Nations is an organization with a mission in human history. It was founded on three pillars \u2014 peace and security, human rights and development. That is our mission and the burden of our generation. It is our turn to do what is right for humankind and our time to make a difference to humankind. And the United Nations is our ultimate weapon to make a difference to human existence. No matter what happens, we should never, ever lose faith in the Organization. Let us agree with Samantha Power that \u201cwhatever its flaws, the United Nations is still the only institution that brings together all the countries of the world.\u201d\nThis year we have met as an alliance of nations determined to fight a common war. We have declared war on poverty, education inequality and climate change, and we have declared that we will fight for the inclusion of minority nations. The world has enough resources to eradicate poverty and to send every child to school. We have the means to slow climate change and save the planet. All we have to do is to think as one humankind, with one goal, and to pool our resources.\nBut the trouble with multilateralism is that 1 per cent of the world controls 99 per cent of its resources. It is those who control the planet\u2019s resources who are the real decision-makers for humans\u2019 fate on Earth. That global inequality in decision-making undermines the ability of the United Nations to make the world a better place. Poverty eradication remains an elusive objective of the Sustainable Development Goals. Unfortunately, some members of the Assembly use poverty as leverage for controlling other human beings in other places. Many people around the world struggling in poverty are amazingly hard-working individuals. Many leaders in developing countries strive to improve the lives of their people with the best intentions. We all wish our people well.\nAfrica is not poor through the will of its people. It is the continent that has suffered in the world\u2019s worst history of exploitation, from slavery through colonialism to the aid regime of the past 60 years. History knows us. We have built empires and cities of the West with our blood, sweat and minerals. Africa has given far more resources to the developed world than it has ever received in aid or philanthropy. Today, the more we strive to build our economies, the more climate change undermines them through disasters and external shocks. And yet the leading architects of climate change are outside the developing countries.\nAs I speak, poverty thrives in the least-developed countries. Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the worst- affected regions in the world, with more people trapped in poverty than anywhere else on the planet. Africa has a rising population of young people and women, and that booming population of young people and women trapped in poverty is a great danger to the world. Women and children are the worst affected by poverty. Poverty is dehumanizing. It is a tragedy of the people, and in the people\u2019s quest to survive at any cost, poverty is a breeding ground for radicalization in Africa. A radicalized youth in any part of the world poses a threat to every part of the world. That is one of the reasons why we must act collectively and swiftly on poverty. It is why we must empower young people as humankind\u2019s common resource. We can save the world by empowering young people and educating children. The cost of poverty, the cost of radicalized youth and the cost of children bred by ignorance will always outstrip any investment we can make today.\nSadly, there are millions of children across the least-developed countries who cannot access quality education. Many are being left behind by the digital divide. As the United Nations, we therefore cannot claim to be making progress with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development if a significant part of the world population is left behind. We must re-examine the underlying causes of poverty and take concrete measures to address them swiftly. Let us move quickly to empower youth and women. Let us move quickly to eradicate poverty. Let us promote sustainable and equitable economic growth. We must reduce inequities and create greater opportunities for all.\nOn that account, Malawi has taken pragmatic steps to eradicate poverty in a bid to achieve sustainable development. My Government is implementing the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy III, an overarching national development framework that targets the Sustainable Development Goals. We are pleased with our progress. We are implementing poverty reduction policies and programmes and social support programmes that target Malawi\u2019s ultra-poor and vulnerable citizens. We are also providing free access to basic social services such as health and education. In order to sustain those programmes, we have consistently increased our budgetary allocations to the country\u2019s key sectors of agriculture, education, health and social welfare. My Government has also developed a national social-support programme to guide the delivery of social protection services. The programme provides a comprehensive social protection response and offers women and children preventive, protective and life-changing interventions in a multisectoral approach. One flagship programme in this category is the social cash transfer programme. This intervention targets women, children and the most vulnerable in our society and provides a predictable cash flow to cushion vulnerable households. We also have an additional top-up value for all school-going learners. This programme has taken people who have lost hope out of poverty, improved school enrolment and retention, and reduced extreme hunger. The programme has so far benefited a total of 1.2 million individuals from 280,000 households, mostly children and female-headed households.\nThere can never be meaningful development without the inclusion of youth and women. Therefore, my Government has established a number of youth-centred programmes aimed at driving youth empowerment, and we have proven results and testimonies of real lives transformed.\nWe have focused on empowering young people by teaching them skills. We have introduced a progressive skills-education programme for young people in Malawi who have finished secondary school. We aim to empower the masses of young people who do not have access to university education. We are empowering them with the skills needed to create their own jobs and businesses. We want them to be masters of their destiny.\nWe are therefore constructing community technical colleges in every part of the country, starting with a community college in every district. Now we are moving to bring a community college to every constituency. Every constituency will have a secondary school and a community technical college. Our goal is to empower young people and create equal opportunities for them all, in every part of the country.\nOur youth-empowerment programmes complement our programmes for empowering women. Just as there can never be a society without women, there can never be development if women are not included. We have stepped up the inclusion of women in decision-making, and we have increased social protection measures that target rural women. We now provide soft loans to rural women for them to invest in small and medium businesses, an initiative that now benefits more than 4.5 million women. Our goal is to include women in economic activities.\nThe United Nations has agreed that education is a human right and the primary responsibility of the State. Every country is doing its best to educate its people. Education creates a human society that understands its own problems and equips the people with the capacity to solve their problems. Investing in education is the best way of investing in all other sectors of society. That is why in Malawi education gets the lion\u2019s share of the national budget every year.\nWe acknowledge the support we get from various stakeholders, including development partners. These include United Nations agencies and civil-society organizations. But we regret that the global commitment on education is now weakening. UNESCO projections warn us that the global community will fail to meet educational commitments unless serious progress is made over the coming decade.\nThis year\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals report indicates that that millions of children are still out of school. Worse, not all who attend school are learning. Consequently, many youths cannot fully participate in the highly complex global economy. These educational gaps also threaten an individual\u2019s ability to move out of poverty. To fail to prepare young people is to prepare a generation to fail.\nBut we are the ones failing the global child. The world will pay the heavy cost of breeding poverty and ignorance by having failed the child. Let me remind the Assembly that poverty and ignorance are a breeding ground for the radicalization of young people, and we all suffer the cost of radicalism.\nLet the world also remember its commitment to save the only planet on which we live. Climate change is an existential threat. In March, Malawi yet again suffered a devastating national disaster. We were hit by Cyclone Idai together with our Mozambican and Zimbabwean brothers. We lost loved ones, and the infrastructure was damaged. Cyclone Idai destroyed many people\u2019s lives. Malawi needs more than $370 million to recover. My Government, in collaboration with the United Nations country team and other partners, has so far raised $45 million for immediate response. This has gone into food, temporary shelters, relocation and medication. But we still have a huge deficit that calls for more support from the international community.\nMalawi plays its role in international peacekeeping with diligence. We are proud to sacrifice our scarce resources for the humanitarian cause of keeping others safe wherever they may be. As a peaceful country, we consider ourselves ambassadors of peace. We are proud that the Malawi Defense Force has always been professional and effective wherever it has gone on United Nations peacekeeping missions. Our military is the pride of the nation, and we are proud to find our place in the United Nations family and play our role. We must all work to make the world a safe place and to provide security to the vulnerable and the voiceless.\nMalawi is understood to be a poor country. But we are testimony to the fact that small or poor countries can play a significant role in the affairs of the United Nations. I repeat what I said before: there are no small or poor nations in the United Nations; all we have are nations of the United Nations. In fact, the Organization would be more powerful and more effective if we all participated in decision-making on security. But for some reason, there are nations that refuse to share power with African nations.\nIn this regard, the United Nations is undemocratic. And yet those same countries and the United Nations are preachers of the gospel of democracy in Africa, although African countries are sometimes more democratic than Western countries.\nLet me therefore call upon the United Nations to implement Security Council reform. Africa must be on the Security Council. I repeat: Africa must be on the Security Council. We cannot ignore and marginalize an entire continent of 1.3 billion people; that is unacceptable. We cannot marginalize and repress one third of the Member nations of the Organization. It is a travesty that we are meeting to galvanize multilateral efforts even as we marginalize and repress other Member States.\nI therefore urge the United Nations and the permanent five in particular to open up Security Council membership, increase the number of permanent seats with veto power and make the Security Council truly representative of all States Members of the United Nations.\nAfrica will never relent on this position, which is for the good of the United Nations and the global community as a whole. The more we allow a few nations to monopolize power in the Security Council, the more undemocratic the United Nations looks. This cannot be allowed in this day and age. Let us be the change we want to see in the world.\nLet me conclude by making what should have been my opening remarks. My country is a proud Member of the Organization, and we are thankful for the role that the United Nations plays in my country. This year, Malawi had an election, and I am in my second term of office. The process was duly audited by a United Nations-affiliated network, BDO Jordan, and the election was unanimously declared free, fair and credible by the European Union, the African Union, the Southern African Development Community, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and the Commonwealth observer missions. But the opposition, led by the Malawi Congress Party, decided not to accept that very credible election. This is the party that ruled Malawi under a dictatorship for 31 years. This time it went to court, but ignored the court process and waged a vicious campaign of violence in the guise of demonstrations. Its violence betrayed a desire for ethnic cleansing and civil war, and an attempt to destroy the economy and make Malawi an ungovernable State of lawlessness. We responded with peaceful resistance and insisted on the rule of law. We fought violence with peace and hate with love. That is what saved Malawi from descending into chaos. We have seen democracy and the rule of law at their best in Malawi. Malawi remains the peaceful and stable country that we have always known, and a beautiful destination for tourists and investors. Malawi is a beautiful place where we fight to make life better for everyone.\n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased, on behalf of the Government and the people of Saint Lucia to once again address this global community of nations. It was a pleasure for me and for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to have had Secretary-General Antonio Guterres join us in Saint Lucia this past July for the meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community. At that meeting, the Secretary-General acknowledged the challenges faced by small island developing States (SIDS), especially that of climate change. Importantly, he noted the other obstacles to sustainable development for countries like ours, notably the urgent need for reliable access to development finance.\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his words of support and for his visit to our brothers and sisters in the Bahamas, and we note first-hand how tenuous our grip on development can be in the face of climatic events. We are very encouraged by his commitment to supporting the advancement of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean proposal on debt for climate adaptation swaps for SIDS. That initiative will go a long way not only towards freeing up domestic fiscal space, but also towards establishing a resilience fund to finance adaptation projects. Saint Lucia looks forward to engaging with the international financial institutions and our partners to forge ahead towards the implementation of that critical initiative.\nWe opened this high-level week with a focus on climate change and climate action. Saint Lucia, along with our fellow small island developing States, continued to make a strong case for urgent action. The disturbing fact is that every September when we gather here, it is against the backdrop of yet another devastating extreme weather event. Have we already forgotten what befell Dominica in 2017, when Hurricane Maria ravaged that island, causing a loss of 226 per cent of gross domestic product? Have we already forgotten Barbuda, laid to waste by Irma, or the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla?\nI saw the devastation in the Bahamas first-hand when I visited that country in my capacity as Chairman of the Caribbean Community. I saw the faces of people, absolutely lost and desperate, as they attempted to rationalize what had happened to them and, more importantly, what would happen next. As expected, they cried and they yelled, but ultimately, after the initial reflex empathy and emergency aid, they remain voiceless. We need to let them know, through our actions, that we hear them, we see them and we will not forget them.\nMany of the victims of these devastating extreme weather events have to focus on surviving from one day to the next. They no longer have the luxury to anticipate and plan for the future when they cannot contemplate where their next meal will come from. We should act with the same urgency as a mother searching for her lost child. We should act with the same desperation as a father who has seen the roof of his family\u2019s home blown off. Let us recognize the awesome responsibility that has been placed on us \u2014 those of us in a position to give hope to the hopeless and tangible assistance to those most in need.\nTo date, despite the overwhelming evidence, the tragic loss of lives and the destruction of people\u2019s dignity, we unfortunately have failed. We are failing as world leaders to act with urgency. Instead, we are too often allowing the denials of a few to paper over the real and existential threat to the lives and livelihoods of so many. Where is the action to deploy, with immediate effect, the resilient solutions and the commitment to wrestling to the ground the fact that a heating planet is to blame and the fact that we are the ones who are heating it? As for the few who stand with us and have provided tangible assistance as we fight for our survival, we are grateful for the support provided, thus far, but I daresay that, given the magnitude of the problem, we have only begun to scratch the surface.\nIt is abundantly clear that the international financial architecture \u2014 the systems, mechanisms and rules that govern global finance \u2014 that are associated with our fight for survival are moving too slow to pivot to address the new normal for small island developing States like mine. The inability and, at times, unwillingness to change the status quo as it relates to graduating countries out of programmes and creating new financing vehicles can no longer be tolerated. While we face the reluctance of global financial institutions to heed our calls, we are left to attempt to develop our own solutions and lean on new friends in our times of need. In fact, in the face of this new climate change reality, we are being forced to consider every all options to ensure our survival and that of our people. One such step is the establishment of a special purpose vehicle dedicated to SIDS, through which we hope to mobilize financing for resilience. We truly hope that we will be able to interest Member States in joining us in that very vital initiative.\nMy island home of Saint Lucia is small, just 238 square miles, with a population of fewer than 200,000 people. However, we are fortunate to be members of strong regional institutions. If one explores a little, one will note that, as a subregion, eight countries within the eastern Caribbean, including Saint Lucia, use what has become one of the most stable currencies in the world \u2014 the Eastern Caribbean dollar. We share a single court system, and we pool our resources to provide a large number of services for our people. In our wider Caribbean community, we cooperate in even more areas \u2014 a university of international renown, our own development bank, a common market and a regional security mechanism are but a few of our successes.\nI highlight those achievements to signify that we are not a region of people who sit on our hands, waiting to be rescued. In fact, as a region, post-independence we have worked diligently to establish the institutions and fashion the responses to deal with the challenges that confront us, and we have achieved much success in so doing.\nLike all other nations of the world, Saint Lucia has a goal to chart a sustainable development path that benefits every last citizen, leaving no one behind, a goal to ensure that all are clothed and fed and have a roof over their heads, with access to education, health and security, and to provide those basic needs that lay the foundation for a better future. Is that not the aspiration that, as leaders, we all have for our people? Yet, in the face of our ambitious Sustainable Development Goals, as SIDS, we continue to have to battle with insurmountable challenges, many as a result of rules and systems that do not create the mechanisms and the requisite urgency to address our unique challenges.\nSome of those rules impose restrictions on States in the absence of credible evidence to support claims of wrongdoing. Our islands are being blacklisted, which is a demeaning and unfair practice that results, in some instances, in effecting irreversible damage to our reputations. Countries such as Saint Lucia, which has the ambition to be self-sufficient and aid-free, cannot therefore exercise the will to participate in financial services, an area in which we have a comparative advantage.\nOur Government in Saint Lucia believes that every single person matters and that every person has a contribution to make. However, to genuinely say they matter, we must give them the ability to be able to participate. If we are constantly moving from one crisis to another, our people are not going to be able to participate in such necessary changes. For the past three years, Saint Lucia has been focused on trying to take control of its own destiny.\nOne such way is our new partnership with the World Economic Forum to be the first country to implement the Country Financing Roadmap. The Roadmap is a platform to support countries in making a transformative shift from funding to financing. It will harness the collective intelligence from the World Economic Forum\u2019s expansive networks and promote consensus on the main challenges that limit capital flows to Saint Lucia. It will also leverage coordinated action to move from a holistic diagnostic to a country-specific tangible action plan. We are grateful for this opportunity to be the test case for that initiative and look forward to its success and, once successful, to its being replicated across other States.\nLast April, the Foreign Ministers of the Group of Seven (G-7) expressed their support for the substantive participation of Taiwan as an active member of the international aviation community in forums of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Saint Lucia endorses that call, as we believe that the exclusion of active members for political purposes compromises aviation safety and security. The G-7 has now added its voice to those that have long advocated for the inclusion of Taiwan in the work of the global community.\nAs we continue our strides to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the participation of all States, including small States, in the various United Nations agencies and processes is critical to achieving our collective goals. We remain true to the Agenda\u2019s clarion call to leave no one behind. Similarly, we express our solidarity with the people of Cuba and we question the continued application of the embargo.\nOn the issue of Venezuela, Saint Lucia continues to believe that this crisis should be resolved peacefully and through dialogue. Military action is not an answer. But let me be clear. The continued instability in that country is a threat to us all in the hemisphere. That cannot be overlooked or swept under the table.\nI would like to be able to boast of a United Nations where small nations such as mine receive a fair hearing and genuine empathy when appropriate, a United Nations where, once the case is made, there is an examination of conscience followed by a commitment towards change. To some, that may seem like a high ideal but I submit that it is the minimum owed to States like Saint Lucia. It is indeed the object and purpose of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. Patrice Athanase Guillaume Talon, President of the Republic, Head of State and Head of Government of the Republic of Benin, who was unable to travel to New York, has instructed me to deliver the following message on his behalf and on behalf of the Government: \u201cIt is with particular pride that I would like, on behalf of the Beninese delegation and on my own behalf, to reiterate my warm congratulations to Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his successful election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session and to assure him of Benin\u2019s full support for the success of his mandate. \u201cI also congratulate his predecessor, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for the excellence of her work during her term of office, and reiterate my vision of success to the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, whose courageous reforms I welcome and support.\n\u201cThe General Assembly at its seventy- fourth session is taking place at a time when the fundamental principles of multilateralism are increasingly being questioned, and when serious climate, security and social challenges need to be addressed, which is a major challenge for the Organization that we created almost 75 years ago. The theme of this session invites us to galvanize multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion, which is a theme that summarizes the objectives we have set for ourselves for the next 12 months as part of our joint actions.\n\u201cThose challenges require us to strengthen multilateralism \u2014 a multilateralism that is seen as the expression of exchange between peoples and the equality of all. It is a necessity more than a projection into the future. If all our States retreat behind their national borders, if we sacrifice our collective values and if we perpetuate the current tragedies, we will certainly move away from these objectives. Indeed, it is multilateralism that will make it possible to build lasting peace and to meet each of these challenges.\n\u201cAs we enter the fifth year of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the current session of the General Assembly is of particular importance for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The high-level events held \u2014 namely, the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, the High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development, the high-\nlevel meeting on universal health coverage, as well as the high-level meeting to review progress made on the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway \u2014 were opportunities for exchange and engagement. These forums, in which we discussed efforts and future actions to accelerate progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, should enable us to end all forms of poverty and to fight inequalities, while ensuring that no one is left behind. The Secretary-General encouraged us to approach our meeting on climate change on the basis of concrete engagement for future actions rather than negotiation and discussion.\n\u201cMy Government is convinced of the seriousness of the current situation and has therefore developed and submitted an ambitious plan to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030. Accordingly, in all energy and agriculture sectors, Benin plans to contribute to reducing cumulative greenhouse-gas emissions by 16.17 per cent between 2021 and 2030 by increasing our renewable-energy production capacity and through sustainable agricultural. Over the same period, we will increase the protection of natural forests with a focus on reducing the annual deforestation rate by 20,000 hectares and by creating 10,000 hectares of forest plantations.\n\u201cI take this opportunity to reaffirm from this rostrum my country\u2019s commitment to continuing to work towards sustainable development in order to achieve social inclusion and the reduction of inequalities, in particular by encouraging effective political impact through the strengthening of dialogue on social development issues, which will ensure the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda.\n\u201cI would like to recall that my country stands firm on the principles and values enshrined in the Charter and the fundamental principles of international law. My country deeply believes in international solidarity and common efforts aimed at ensuring the well-being of all peoples. I renew my country\u2019s support for efforts to achieve a two- State solution guaranteeing a viable Palestinian State with the attributes of full international sovereignty, living side by side and in perfect harmony with the State of Israel. Benin also regrets the continued economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed on Cuba by the United States of America and would like to call for the promotion of constructive dialogue so that these two countries can achieve a definitive normalization of their bilateral relations for the well-being and prosperity of their peoples.\n\u201cThe late former Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said,\n\u2018If every ethnic, religious or linguistic group claimed statehood, there would be no limit to fragmentation, and peace, security and economic well-being for all would become ever more difficult to achieve\u2019 (A/47/277\\ para. 17).\n\u201cPeace and security in the Sahel are of crucial importance for the stability of our region. At the special summit of the Economic Community of West African States focused on the fight against terrorism, held on 14 September, we reaffirmed our commitment to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries against all separatist tendencies.\n\u201cI would like to join my peers in the subregion and welcome the fact that the advocacy of the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel) before the Security Council has been favourably received, in the form of the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). Despite my country\u2019s limited capacities and resources, Benin has always been involved in international initiatives aimed at preventing crises and maintaining peace. My country\u2019s continued contribution of troops to MINUSMA illustrates this commitment.\n\u201cOnce again, I would like to express the solidarity of my Government and the people of Benin with the countries of the G-5 Sahel and with neighbouring Nigeria, which are all gravely affected by terrorism. However, our countries have not failed to continue to focus on the well-being of our respective peoples through the implementation of the sustainable development programme by 2030, despite this regional security challenge.\n\u201cThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the launch of its implementation were an important step in the process of promoting the development of our States and the well-being of peoples. Accelerating its implementation has been a major imperative for my Government, which seeks to find innovative mechanisms for access to resources to ensure its financing. In the four years since its launch in Benin, one of the key lessons that has emerged is that integrating SDG initiatives into national planning frameworks is essential for the 2030 Agenda to be effectively implemented. This effort must pay particular attention to harmonizing the principles of prioritization, coordination and partnership.\n\u201cAfter contextualizing and selecting the SDGs, my Government organized its interventions around three focus areas, namely, sustainable food security policies, resilient production policies and inclusive policies, which generate positive synergies. In relation to each of these critical entry points, we have implemented specific actions leading to cross-cutting progress.\n\u201cIn this framework, in order to guarantee quality education for children, we have set up the Integrated National School Feeding Programme, which not only improves the school performance, health and nutritional status of students but also develops local agricultural production, thereby providing substantial income to farmers. These concerted actions have also reduced the prevalence of food insecurity, which fell by 1.4 per cent over the period 2013-2017. By promoting the development of sustainable food systems and healthy lifestyles, this critical entry point into education creates positive synergies by reducing hunger, promoting good health and well-being, and fostering effective partnerships.\n\u201cWith a view to achieving more such results, strengthening the resilience of production systems was chosen as the second critical entry point. It has found expression in, among other specific actions, sustainable land management and the roll-out of initiatives to protect and rehabilitate depleted lands with the aim of improving food security. These climate-change adaptation measures have led to more than 13,000 farmers being trained in sustainable land management, over 92 per cent of whom have adopted sustainable practices. In this context, the Government of my country is considering establishing an international research centre on climate-change-resilient agriculture. By strengthening the resilience of production systems, soil protection and rehabilitation help with climate-change adaptation and lead to increased productivity and employment and reduced hunger and poverty, thereby resulting in significant positive synergies for fulfilling the 2030 Agenda.\n\u201cIn order to leave no one behind, Benin has set up, under the third critical entry point, a human- capital development insurance scheme for the most vulnerable in the agricultural, trade, transport, crafts, art and culture sectors. By providing health insurance, training, credit and pension insurance to 22 per cent of those without health coverage and 18 per cent of the extremely poor population, this specific measure contributes in a tangible way to poverty eradication, social protection, learning and access to decent employment. Once the pilot phase has ended, implementation at national level should complement other specific social protection measures with cross-cutting impacts on the attainment of the SDGs.\n\u201cAlso under the third critical entry point, also with the aim of improving the living conditions of our population, my Government has invested massively in the area of drinking water in order to fulfil SDG 6 by 2021. In addition, it has halved energy dependence by setting up new 127-megawatt power-generation capacity, with the objective of reaching 400 megawatts by 2021 and a 25 per cent renewable energy mix.\n\u201cTaking into account the assessment that quality-control institutions should play a role in the regulatory and anti-corruption fields, and especially a prominent role in improving the effectiveness of public spending, Benin has embarked on a vast programme of reforms in the area of economic governance. The efficiency gains resulting from the implementation of the reforms, which target the administration, the judiciary and the party-based political system, will strengthen the effectiveness of public policy.\n\u201cAmong emerging trends that may present opportunities for the medium-term financing of the development programme until 2030, my Government advocates the consolidation of public finances through investment and capital expenditures, the curbing of illicit financial flows and the return of foreign assets. For this reason, combating impunity and corruption is at the heart of our priority actions. In order to optimize the\nState\u2019s resources, we have, more specifically, set up enforcement agencies that play a key role in ensuring that actions are carried out with greater efficiency. Similarly, it is very important to strengthen oversight bodies in the public expenditure chain. Such measures are necessary to ensure that financial resources are actually used for their intended purposes. They also aim to make national actors more virtuous and to guarantee the quality of public spending.\n\u201cIn summary, Benin has generally undertaken important actions to accelerate progress. They include improving access to transport infrastructure and electricity, with the introduction of new capacity that brings us closer to autonomy, cleaning up the country\u2019s main cities, enhancing young people\u2019s access to decent work and empowering women.\n\u201cOn the political front, we have undertaken major reforms of the party and electoral systems. For example, a new political party charter and electoral code were adopted in July and September 2018, with almost unanimous support from members of parliament of all persuasions, are the result of a process initiated at the beginning of the seventh legislature in 2015. The reforms\u2019 overriding challenge is to address the fragmentation of political parties, avoid the instability inherent in majority Governments built on alliances and create the conditions for every political party to actually play its role and implement its programme in a coherent manner and in accordance with its development vision. The new electoral code and the political party charter served as the basis for the organization of the parliamentary elections in April. This democratic electoral process, despite the disputes inherent in all reforms, was led serenely by the Autonomous National Electoral Commission and resulted in the election of the members of the eighth legislature, which was formally sworn in on 16 April.\n\u201cIn conclusion, 30 years after making a historic commitment to children around the world by ratifying the Convention on the Rights of the Child, we have the opportunity today to reaffirm this commitment and ensure that every child enjoys all of his or her rights. My delegation is pleased to have ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which establishes a communications procedure that was adopted in New York on 19 December 2011.\n\u201cFurthermore, my country remains convinced that ever closer cooperation between States and the harmonious functioning of international organizations whose main function is to guarantee the common interest and collective security must remain our absolute priority of the day. That is for us the key issue at the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly, which seeks to galvanize multilateralism, the only guarantee of success in the process of resolving our global challenges in the area of climate change, the fight against poverty and efforts to develop quality education. I wish this session every success."

        "file_text": "I extend cordial greetings from the Government and the people of Grenada, on whose behalf I am always honoured to address this noble institution and its members.\nI join those before me in congratulating you, Mr. President, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I am confident in your stewardship and assure you of my delegation\u2019s cooperation and support. I also echo my colleagues in thanking the outgoing President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her able and energetic leadership.\nI take this opportunity to thank and commend Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his leadership of the United Nations and for his interest in and understanding of the unique development challenges facing small island developing States (SIDS). I also applaud the Secretary-General\u2019s unrelenting efforts to address the scourge of climate change and the global poverty eradication agenda. I commend his unrelenting efforts in securing education for all, promoting total inclusion and leaving no one behind.\nAllow me to congratulate fellow Caribbean Community (CARICOM) member State Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on being elected to a non-permanent seat on the Security Council. It is the smallest nation ever to do so.\nOur Assembly is occurring in a global context with continued and increasing anxiety about economic, social and political inequality and marginalization. Grenada unwaveringly recommits to the United Nations and its principles, as outlined in the Charter. Our commitment in national and international life to the norms of peace, equality, justice, human rights and multilateralism is clear. We are proud this week to have signed or acceded to three new treaties: the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Participation and Justice in Environmental Matters in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\nLest we forget, the raison d\u2019etre of this body is essentially to solve the world\u2019s problems through multilateral efforts. The issues that we now face, such as eradicating poverty, providing quality education and taking climate action, are problems that cannot be solved by individual Member States. Our efforts must be collective, focused and strategic if we are to achieve meaningful progress for the benefit of our peoples.\nSmall island developing States have had to navigate our development agenda in that much broader context, while at the same time facing challenges that are as natural as they are man-made. The phenomenon of climate change and the attendant exacerbating consequences of increased frequency and more intense natural disasters are real, existential threats, which we must confront daily.\nIn that regard, we again extend our most profound solidarity to the Government and the people of the Bahamas. Hurricane Dorian was indeed an unprecedented event and amounted to the total destruction of significant aspects of the Bahamian landscape. Hurricane Dorian has again brought into sharp focus the inadequacy of the per capita income classification as a barometer for accessing development resources for small islands developing States. Indeed, Hurricane Dorian has reminded us that the entire gross domestic product (GDP) of SIDS can be wiped out in a few hours.\nThe experience of the Bahamas contains many new lessons and points to many new imperatives in adaptation for those small vulnerable States. The cost of adaptation to that experience requires massive public expenditure for the virtual reconstruction of the entire infrastructure if we are to withstand the successive onslaught of hurricanes. The need to ensure the safety of life and limb also challenges us to implement new, robust building codes that will provide bunker safety housing, particularly for the most vulnerable.\nThe States members of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States are calling on all small island developing States to join us in creating a SIDS foundation, the purpose of which will be to mobilize the funding and other resources required to finance adaptation in a manner that does not impose fiscal stress on our fragile economies. With limited access to and ever-increasing competition for climate and development financing, those climate change and poverty challenges are further intensified.\nOur foremost goal must be to aggressively pursue policies and strategies that will help us to mitigate the effects of some of those challenges, especially those over which we have little control, while at the same time, moving expeditiously to implement long-term plans that will help to sustain our societies. We therefore must focus on national and regional sustainable development plans and programmes, long-term low-carbon development strategies, low greenhouse gas emissions strategies and comprehensive disaster risk reduction and risk management strategies.\nWe are firm in the view that effective multilateralism, based on an inclusive approach that takes into account the needs of all countries is the only way that we can address global challenges like climate change and poverty reduction. It is clear that there is a strong relationship between climate change and poverty, with the most vulnerable being those that are most negatively impacted, while also being the ones that have contributed the least to the problem. In that context, I wish to outline several of Grenada\u2019s key initiatives, plans and programmes that are geared to addressing climate change and poverty eradication and will also further the objective of sustainable development.\nIn Grenada\u2019s case, there are many accomplishments of which we can be proud, including the remarkable economic turnaround of the past five years. Our economy remains strong, growing by 5.2 per cent in 2018, with a further increase expected this year. In fact, average growth over the past five years has been 5 per cent. That was achieved through the collective effort of the Government and its social partners and a tightly managed homegrown structural adjustment programme, consistent with our growth and poverty eradication strategy. It has not been an easy few years, but through sound macroeconomic policies, fiscal responsibility legislation and other legal measures, we have seen tremendous progress. Public debt, for example, now stands at 59.5 per cent of our GDP, down from 108 per cent in 2013. The decision to enact into law a fiscal responsibility act, which would help us manage and control our spending in any given year, is crucial to our macroeconomic viability and sustainability.\nIt is worth highlighting that we have done all that while ensuring that social spending was expanded to take care of our most vulnerable citizens. Our achievements in Grenada are indeed commendable and we are justly proud, but we do recognize that we have much work to do, especially as it relates to elevating our citizens out of poverty. Always cognizant that the proven pathway to advancement is education, the Government is working daily to improve the quality of education delivered to our nation\u2019s students. Job security, compensation and enhanced opportunities for training are all among the incentives used to retain quality teachers in the educational system.\nWe are also working to revolutionize and improve students\u2019 educational outcomes through the widespread use of technology and innovation. Other key initiatives, such as the establishment of several skills training centres island-wide and programmes in entrepreneurship to help narrow the gap between education and employment, especially among our youth, will serve to further improve the education system, reduce unemployment and alleviate poverty.\nWe fully support the theme of this debate, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d. We therefore call on the United Nations to commit to multilateral action aimed at quality and affordable education for all.\nAs we attempt to create sustainable societies, we are confronted by certain global financial policies and actions that pose significant threats to our region\u2019s sustainable development. Correspondent banking and de-risking, blacklisting and middle-income status graduation are measures that negatively affect Caribbean economies. The unilateral and premature graduation of many small island developing States to middle-income status, without consideration of our region\u2019s specific vulnerabilities, has resulted in significant budgetary shortfalls, adversely affecting our economic and social development. Our region has inherent structural economic challenges that already restrict the pace of our development. We ask that those impediments to growth be considered when our matters arise for consideration.\nThe Caribbean Development Bank has pioneered the use of vulnerability indices in setting the terms of its financing. Likewise, we urge international partners to work towards an acceptable country vulnerability index that holistically assesses our countries\u2019 development and risks. Moreover, the withdrawal of correspondent banking services to CARICOM member States can be seen as an economic assault that would destabilize the financial sector of our already vulnerable economies. We wish to call on countries, development partners and corporations to collaborate to fill the need for policy coherence and to work towards developing a road map that addresses the problem. Our own Eastern Caribbean Central Bank is engaged in helping to address the problem, and we express our support for United Nations principles of corporate banking. Remittances contribute in real and significant terms to the GDP of small States. In fact, the World Bank has stated that any sudden stop to remittances to economies that rely on those flows could pose a significant threat to socioeconomic stability.\nIn addition to the threat of lost correspondent banking relationships, we also have to contend with the unilateral and often unfounded blacklisting of our institutions as money-launderers and our countries as tax havens. It pains us as policymakers to expend our limited resources to comply with international rules, only to face arbitrary punishments when we are quite evidently doing our best. There are no easy answers to these challenges, but I urge our partners to desist from draconian approaches to these matters when dealing with vulnerable developing nations.\nIn Grenada, we are currently pushing forward with our National Sustainable Development Plan 2035, which will resolutely set us on an unprecedented long-term development path. The ability to successfully and fully enact an enduring strategy for development has been a shortcoming of successive Governments throughout the years. We are now working assiduously to correct that, given the adverse effects that this glaring gap has had on Government\u2019s ability to manage its macroeconomic affairs.\nThrough extensive consultations, Grenada is well on its way to realizing the implementation of the National Sustainable Development Plan, which envisions that the tri-island State of Grenada shall become a resilient and prosperous nation, with a conscious and caring citizenry, promoting human dignity and realizing its full potential through sustainable economic and social progress for all. The Plan, as envisioned and outlined, provides strategic direction and presents home-grown solutions that are geared to improving the way Grenadians live, work and interact with our natural environment, institutions and each other. The Plan, by the people and for the people, calls for constant and consistent stakeholder engagement and coordination. A dedicated entity, the Development and Planning Institute of Grenada, will coordinate the sustainable implementation of the Plan and serve as a strategic link between all relevant stakeholders to ensure that the preparation and implementation processes are conducted in a collaborative manner through a consultative process, with clearly identified roles and responsibilities. A more stable and stronger Grenada is well on its way as we attempt to build resilience at all levels.\nHowever, despite the progress made to date at the national level, there are risks to be managed that are beyond our capacity and ability to adapt to. In that regard, international partnerships, as per the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway, are the way to go. Our nationally determined contribution calls for financial injection of $160 million over the next five years. We are indeed heartened by the indications of support received so far from the Green Climate Fund, the Global Environment Facility, the Nationally Determined Contributions Partnership, bilateral partners and other agencies focusing on climate finance.\nOur National Adaptation Plan calls for an additional $240 million over the next five years and, again, we are grateful for the support received so far and are heartened by the indications of further support. In fact, I must emphasize that the financial requirements of the Partnership and the National Adaptation Plan would amount to 40 per cent of our annual GDP, and that this does not include any provision for the impact of stronger hurricanes, extended drought and heat waves, flash flooding or losses and damage, including from slow-onset events. The needs in that respect are greater than we can afford with our national resources, and we need the international community to come together and provide the support needed. The only hope we have now is in the collective strength of multilateralism.\nThe Global Commission on Adaptation reminded us just this week of the scale of the resources required to address the adaptation needs of developing countries. The report indicates that investing $1.8 trillion globally in five areas of climate adaptation between 2020 and 2030 could yield $7.1 trillion in net benefits. Mobilizing those resources will require a concerted multilateral effort. I therefore issue a call here today to the rest of the international community to step up and respond to the needs identified. I also call for a simplification of the process to access available financing, which regrettably, as it currently stands, serves as a barrier to aid to those most in need.\nIn the spirit of multilateralism and inclusion, Grenada has always supported and continues to support resolution 70/5, which calls for an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America on Cuba. We believe that recent measures aimed at restricting remittances, as well as banking transactions, only serve to weaken the economic stability of our sister nation, thereby severely affecting the socioeconomic conditions of the Cuban people. We call for an end to the embargo against the Cuban people and the immediate repeal of the Helms-Burton Act. We ask for continued solidarity with and support for the Government and the people of Cuba.\nGrenada remains concerned by recent political and social developments in Venezuela. What we seek is to encourage meaningful dialogue based on the premise that the Venezuelan people, brothers and sisters who disagree on form, can come together to safeguard the future of the people of Venezuela. In the meantime, Grenada believes in the art of diplomacy, the principle of respect for State sovereignty and the right of all people to self-determination. The onus is squarely on the Government and the opposition to ensure that Venezuelans do not lose hope. Grenada therefore supports all initiatives aimed at resolving the problem in Venezuela peacefully, including the CARICOM process agreed by member States of the region.\nGrenada is committed to the maintenance of the Caribbean region as a zone of peace. In that regard, we are proud to be not only a party to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean but also, now, a signatory to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\nThe United Nations membership must make paragraph 3 of Article 1 of the Charter a major priority in the next few years. Our founders called on the Organization\n\u201c[t]o achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\u201d.\nWe must do all in our power to provide added economic opportunities for the developing world. I therefore call on the Economic and Social Council to actively pursue undertakings designed to create an encouraging atmosphere providing Member States with the opportunity to raise the standard of living of their people. In the current global environment, we must be conscious that inclusion in the process of the global economy is vital. We are now engaged in direct diplomatic initiatives to strengthen the links as a matter of core strategic interests with our African brothers and sisters. In that regard, we welcome and look forward to recent steps taken by our Caribbean Community and Africa to deepen ties and explore ways in which to increase cooperation.\nFinally, I must recall Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations, which calls on the Organization to maintain international peace and security and, to that end, to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace. We must be relentless in our pursuit of the purposes of the Organization. Our challenge is to work towards the elimination of terrorist activities and armed conflicts around the world. Grenada therefore calls on all actors to work tirelessly to that end and for the peaceful resolution of all disputes so as to secure and maintain international peace and security by avoiding conflict at all costs. Our quest must be for economic opportunities for all States, and our goal should be the peaceful coexistence of all peoples of the international community. Indeed, if we can achieve that, we will be well on our way to transforming our world."

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to convey to the Members of the General Assembly the warm greetings of His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of Cameroon, Head of State, who has authorized me to represent him at this session of the General Assembly and to take the floor on his behalf.\nIn joining those who spoke at this rostrum before me, I would first like to express my sincere and brotherly congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as president of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I have no doubt that his extensive experience and leadership will enable him to successfully conduct our deliberations. Cameroon will give him all of its support for the full success of his mandate. Now is also a good opportunity for me to pay sincere tribute to his predecessor, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for the dedication and commitment with which she successfully led the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session.\nI would like to reiterate Cameroon\u2019s continued appreciation and encouragement to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres his tenacity in carrying out the courageous and relevant reforms that he has initiated since his appointment as head of our Organization and for his guidance in managing the many global challenges. Cameroon would like to express our full support for his commitment to international peace and security, and economic and social progress in the world.\nThe current session is taking place in an international context where we are faced with multiple challenges and where populations around the world are living in oppressive anxiety about the deterioration of international relations. The persistence of sources of tension in various regions of the world, particularly in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America is to be deplored. Terrorism, drug trafficking, transnational organized crime, including general banditry, and illicit trafficking of arms of all kinds appear to be spreading and are threatening the peace and stability of States and the flourishing of peoples. In addition, it is worth mentioning the phenomenon of migratory flows, which has become a matter of concern for all States, as it particularly affects young people in search of a better life.\nOn another level, it should also be noted that poverty and inequality persist and even seems to be gaining ground. Similarly, humankind is presently faced with a new scourge, namely, social media networks that have become full-fledged empires on their own. They carry masses of exaggerated information instantaneously and at the global scale, mixing truth and lies manipulated by actors in service of partisan interests, who by exercising their rights to freedom of opinion, expression or information deliberately trample on what is essential: respect for human dignity and our sense of responsibility. In addition to all of these scourges, the preservation of our planet is threatened by natural disasters, some of which are caused by human activity, be it climate disruption, floods, drought, volcanoes and earthquakes or other landslides, and fires, which cause the most varied types of damage.\nIn the face of those problems and misfortunes that know no borders because of increased globalization, Cameroon believes that the best solution lies, first and foremost, in increased, active, vigorous and better- structured solidarity at local, national, regional and international levels. Moreover, our century has major assets at its disposal \u2014 technological means and many other instruments and mechanisms \u2014 to address, eradicate or at least mitigate the devastating effects of these problems and concerns. Indeed, in today\u2019s digital age, the exponential progress of science and technology has placed into human hands the most effective tools to reach the most remote parts of the universe and to explore and exploit the abyssal depths of the seas and oceans, in short, to control the infinitely large and the infinitely small. In sum, solutions are therefore within our reach to engage in a constructive, concerted and united approach.\nThe foregoing shows the relevance of theme of the general debate of the seventy-fourth session, namely, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d. In choosing this theme, there is no doubt that the President wanted to make the international community aware of two major facts: first, the preservation of our common planet and the protection of humankind, which is at the centre of the planet and could be swallowed up and disappear if nothing is done, and secondly, the need to maintain a good interactive relationship and a necessary balance between these two entities.\nIn relation to the analysis I have just made, allow me to address the issue of multilateralism, on which many delegations have dwelt, and which cannot be dissociated from the theme of this session. Multilateralism is a healthy solution that must highlight our respect for the ideals, purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. It calls for the strengthening of active solidarity and the will to live together in the strict observance of world cultural diversity with a view to promoting and preserving the interests of everyone, especially the weak. That naturally implies the establishment of a new and just international order based on our determination to eradicate poverty and achieve all of the Sustainable Development Goals in a safer and fairer world for both present and future generations.\nWe must focus on the cardinal values of good governance and democratization at both the national and international level, as well as the renunciation of unilateral decision-making. In this spirit, the reform of the Security Council and world economic institutions is of great importance, as that would enable all countries, in particular African countries, to regain the place they deserve in the community of nations.\nIn this regard, Cameroon welcomes the General Assembly\u2019s decisions to proclaim 24 April the annual International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace and to celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations under the theme \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism\u201d.\nEfforts to implement an innovative, responsive form of multilateralism would be in vain if they did not give priority to the human being \u2014 if they did not protect them from the dangers that arise from the disruption of peace, insecurity, natural or human-made socioeconomic precariousness, all of which prevent them from living in peace and dignity. Faced with each of the aforementioned challenges and in the context of our national Vision 2035 development document, which is in line with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063, my country has committed to building a proactive, long-term development strategy that reflects the deep aspirations of its citizens to live in a democratic and prosperous country that is united in its diversity and that offers equal development opportunities to all its citizens. To that end, President Paul Biya has committed the Government to carrying out major structural projects to strengthen infrastructure, including roads, ports and energy facilities, as well as projects in such sectors as sports, public health, and urban and rural development.\nSignificant progress has been made, most notably in the areas of education and inequality reduction. We have launched ambitious programmes and projects aimed to fight poverty and climate change. We provided a detailed overview of our progress in the voluntary national review that we presented during the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development convened under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council in July.\nIn the field of education, for example, despite strong growth in the numbers of student enrolments, we have substantially reduced disparity between boys and girls and achieved a significantly higher secondary-school graduation rate. Our efforts are focused, inter alia, on ensuring that young Cameroonians in all regions of the country are able to enjoy their right to education.\nWith regard to inequality reduction, Cameroon has established a social safety-net programme, raised the level of guaranteed minimum income and increased salaries for public officials. A three-year special youth plan, with a budget of 102 billion CFA francs, which is roughly equivalent to $175 million, is being implemented to facilitate the socioprofessional integration of young people. A large number of programmes have also been put in place to ensure the advancement of women and the family.\nIn terms of resilience and adaptation to climate change, Cameroon, which was among the first signatories to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, has set itself the goal of reducing carbon emissions to 32 per cent of current levels by 2035. I am pleased to inform the General Assembly that my country has adopted a national climate-change adaptation plan. Believing desertification to be one of the major consequences of climate change, Cameroon initiated, in 2008, the Green Sahel Reforestation Programme, which is aimed at restoring degraded land through such initiatives as an operation to plant thousands of trees in order to stop the desert from advancing. As part of this national action plan, the National Observatory for the Fight against Climate Change in Cameroon is now operational. Furthermore, our country is part of the great Congo basin forest in Central Africa and is home to the headquarters of the Commission of Central African Forests, for which we hold the presidency. This institution plays a crucial role in the management of the forests in our subregion and is an initiative to which all the countries of the region contribute.\nIt is to be hoped that funding for the implementation of the various programmes envisaged by the international community within the framework of the Green Fund will be made available in order to expedite the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. The same stands for access to science, technology and innovation, for which wealthy countries must deliver on the promises made in the light of commitments entered into as part of the Paris Agreement.\nAs members of the General Assembly are aware, in recent years Cameroon and the countries of the Lake Chad basin, principally Chad, Nigeria and the Niger, have been subject to insecurity at the hands of the terrorist group Boko Haram. Our countries have been pooling resources and working together as part of the Multinational Joint Task Force to resolutely fight that terrorist sect. Thanks to our combined efforts, we have achieved considerable success in this fight.\nNevertheless, Boko Haram continues to have considerable capacity for wreaking havoc in the region. We therefore wish to take the opportunity to solemnly reiterate our gratitude to all our bilateral and multilateral partners who have tirelessly supported us in our fight against terrorism, a scourge that now affects all regions of the world. We call for their unwavering solicitude, particularly in the management of the grave humanitarian crisis that terrorism has unleashed, and specifically in taking care of the many refugees and displaced persons. In this regard, we appeal for decisive support from our bilateral and multilateral partners in implementing the various development projects that we have designed in the region to eradicate poverty and, in so doing, tackle the root causes of the terrorist threat.\nAnother major concern my country is the crisis that has been playing out over the past three years in the north-west and south-west regions of the country. Separatist groups in these two regions have attempted to undermine Cameroon\u2019s territorial integrity, national unity and cohesion, the stability of its national institutions and the well-being of its people through armed violence, calls for boycotts, general strikes, lootings, kidnappings for ransom, assassinations and arson, as well as the destruction of infrastructure, including attacks of all kinds against hospitals, schools, students, parents and teachers, law-enforcement agencies and civilian populations, to say nothing of the destruction of the country\u2019s economic and social fabric. Moreover, this situation is provoking a wave of displaced persons and large numbers of refugees whom Cameroon is hosting, following sociopolitical crises in certain neighbouring brother countries.\nDespite those difficult circumstances, the Government is controlling that internal and localized crisis, which poses no threat to subregional, let alone regional or international, peace and security. We manage it in the spirit of dialogue and cooperation. I can say today with satisfaction that the process initiated by the Government and driven by the Head of State for the management of the security situation in the north-west and south-west regions of Cameroon and for a definitive return to peace has made great progress. A decisive step forward was taken on 10 September 2019, with the announcement by the Head of State, His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, to convene a major and inclusive national dialogue.\nAt this stage, I would like to share with the General Assembly the views of the President of the Republic on this major national dialogue. The national dialogue will allow Cameroonians \u201cto seek ways and means of meeting the high aspirations of the people of the north-west and south-west regions, but also of all the other components of our nation. The dialogue in question will mainly concern the situation in the north-west and south-west regions. Since it will focus on issues of national interest such as national unity, national integration and living together, it is obvious that it will not concern only the population of these two regions. The dialogue will therefore rally all the sons and daughters of our beloved and beautiful country, Cameroon, to reflect on values that are dear to us, namely, peace, security, national unity and progress.\n\u201cIt will also focus on... bilingualism, cultural diversity and social cohesion, the reconstruction and development of conflict-affected areas, the return of refugees and displaced persons, the education and judicial system, decentralization and local development, the demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants, the role of the diaspora in the country\u2019s development... \u201cThe dialogue... will bring together a wide range of personalities: parliamentarians, politicians, opinion leaders, intellectuals, economic operators, traditional authorities, religious authorities, members of the diaspora, representatives of defence and security forces, armed groups and victims.\u201d\nI am pleased that the announcement by the President of the Republic of Cameroon concerning this major national dialogue was favourably received by the national and international community, as well as, inter alia, the United Nations, the African Union Commission, the European Union, the Commonwealth, and la Francophonie. Cameroon expresses its gratitude to them for their willingness to support us in this major exercise. It should be noted that the Prime Minister, our Head of Government, is currently conducting intensive consultations with the nation\u2019s stakeholders, including civil society, for the full success of the dialogue, which is due to be officially launched on 30 September.\nAs members know, Cameroon has always been committed to promoting the rule of law and respect for human rights in their civil and political, economic, social and cultural aspects. The Government places particular emphasis on the fight against corruption. To that end, it has established bodies and mechanisms for good governance, guaranteeing the rule of law, development, prosperity, harmony and national cohesion.\nWith particular regard to abuses and other violations of human rights committed in the context of the crisis in the north-west and south-west regions, Cameroon is committed to the principle of impunity. In this perspective, perpetrators of attack on the stability of the State and all recorded crimes will also be held accountable before the competent courts, in strict compliance with the law. In this context, allow me to quote the President of the Republic once again: \u201cRespect for the rule of law and the fight against impunity are pillars in the consolidation of a State ruled by law to which we all aspire. Violating the rule of law and granting impunity to some citizens is paving the way for anarchy.\u201d\nI reiterate from this rostrum the appeal of the President of the Republic of Cameroon to countries that harbour extremists and promoters of hatred and violence to arrest and act against those criminals in accordance with the law. In passing, I thank those of our partners that have already committed to cooperating with us in this area. This occasion gives me the opportunity to warmly acknowledge the contribution of bilateral and multilateral partners that have always reaffirmed Cameroon\u2019s unity and territorial integrity. Their ongoing attentiveness and support are of great value. I reassure them that the President of the Republic of Cameroon, His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, and his Government are making every effort to invest in resolving the crisis in the north-west and south-west and in restoring lasting peace in my country.\nAs I previously stated, we are now at a turning point in the history of the world in which peoples and nations are called to live in peace. The fundamental mission of our Organization remains that of guaranteeing peace and international security because there can be no development \u2014 the development to which we all aspire \u2014 without peace and security. Cameroon will continue to support the United Nations in this noble mission.\n"

        "file_text": "I am honoured to address the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session on behalf of the Government and the people of Liberia. Before I begin, I would like to ask the Assembly to kindly join me in observing a moment of silence for the deaths of the 28 young scholars who died last week in a tragic fire in Liberia. May their souls rest in perfect peace.\nI would also like to thank the large number of members that shared in our grief and loss by sending us condolences through personal telephone calls and social media. God bless them for their compassion.\nAllow me first of all to congratulate His Excellency Professor Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. His election is not only an honour for him and for the Government and the people of Nigeria; it is also an honour for West Africa and the African continent at large. We are convinced that he will lead this body successfully and live up to the expectations and the confidence reposed in him. I wish to assure him of Liberia\u2019s fullest support in the discharge of his duties.\nPermit me also to congratulate his predecessor, Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, on the astute manner in which she administered the affairs of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session.\nLet me also pay special tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his enthusiasm and personal dedication to the work of the United Nations and for ably steering its affairs. His far-sighted leadership qualities keep the United Nations focused on its objectives in the face of daunting challenges.\nAs I have acknowledged on many occasions, Liberia is a United Nations success story. After the country was devastated by a brutal civil conflict that lasted for 14 years, peace was restored and maintained by what was then the largest peacekeeping force in the history of the Organization. Under the auspices of United Nations Mission in Liberia peacekeepers, Liberians enjoyed 16 years of unbroken peace. We are pleased and grateful for the efforts and sacrifices they made to secure our peace.\nWhen the peacekeeping force was withdrawn two years ago, the responsibility for maintaining peace in Liberia was passed on to the Liberian Government. This is a responsibility to which I attach the greatest importance, because without peace, our world would be difficult. We are all aware of the terrible destruction of lives and property caused by civil war.\nHowever, long after the guns have been silenced, the survivors have to live with the collateral damage of the war-wounded, the shattered families, the displaced populations, the resettlement of refugees and all the other negative consequences of a national socioeconomic fabric that has been torn apart.\nSince I assumed the leadership of my country almost two years ago, I have remained focused on my charge of ensuring that peace prevails in Liberia. At that time, we committed ourselves to upholding our constitutional mandate, which is to ensure that all the democratic rights of our citizens are guaranteed and protected. I am proud to say that I have kept this promise and that our country is today a beacon of democracy in Africa, where freedom of the press, freedom of expression, freedom of association and other political and democratic rights are respected, under the rule of law.\nThe political environment remains vibrant, with political actors and parties freely exercising their franchise and participating in various elections. I am delighted to report that there are no political prisoners in Liberia and that laws that hindered or threatened press freedom have been abrogated. Several protests have taken place from time to time, all of which have ended peacefully and have been welcomed by my Government as a positive manifestation of our democratic maturity.\nThis is the democracy for which our country has yearned; this is the freedom for which our people have struggled and suffered; and this is the emancipation for which many of our citizens have paid the ultimate price.\nHowever, we are beginning to witness the emergence of a creeping threat to our democratic space and to our hard-won peace and stability. Some individuals, within and outside of our country, particularly those who have lost democratically held elections, have resorted to incitement, threats of violence, misuse of social media and hate speech, with the aim and objective of achieving power through undemocratic means. This is unacceptable and must not be encouraged by those who would wish Liberia well. For democracy to thrive, all Liberians, including both the ruling parties and the opposition parties, must respect the rule of law and abide by the procedures and regulations prescribed therein.\nAs the leading opposition party in Liberia during the past 12 years, our party, the Congress for Democratic Change, accepted the disputed results of the two previous presidential elections, in 2005 and 2011, in the interest of peace. Nevertheless, throughout those two terms, we continued to engage the Government of the day in a constructive manner, even accepting to serve as peace ambassador when called upon to assist them to maintain the peace under their regime.\nWe must all learn to respect the mandates of our electorates, even when that mandate is not in our favour, and not be selective in our support for democracy, supporting it only when we win.\nThe Liberian civil conflict came to an end when all parties and warring factions signed the Peace Agreement between the Government of Liberia, the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy, the Movement for Democracy in Liberia and the political parties in Accra in August 2003. The accord called for the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to provide a forum that would address issues of impunity, as well as an opportunity for both the victims and the perpetrators of human rights violations to share their experiences in order to facilitate genuine healing and reconciliation.\nThat Commission was duly established, concluded its hearings and produced a final report in 2009. Among other things, the report called for the establishment of an extraordinary criminal tribunal to prosecute those identified as having committed gross violations of human rights and economic crimes between 1979 and 2003. It is important to note that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report also recommended the use of the palava hut, a conflict-resolution mechanism traditionally used in Liberia whereby in various district meetings conducted by community elders, perpetrators can publicly request forgiveness from their victims and the aims of restorative justice can be served.\nWhen I spoke before the Assembly last September (see A/73/PV.8) after my first nine months in office, I indicated a preference for dialogue as a conflict-resolution mechanism, so that as a Government and a people we could together focus our efforts on poverty reduction, growth and economic development, rather than retribution. Since then, however, we have heard a rising chorus of voices from many quarters calling for the establishment of an economic and war crimes court. They are the voices not only of thousands of war victims but also of alleged perpetrators, who seem to want to cleanse either their names or their conscience. Support for establishing such a court has also been voiced by many international organizations, as well as some of our international partners. We are at a loss to understand why the clamour for establishing a court is now being heard, almost four decades after it was first called for, and during which time no such pressure was brought to bear on the Government that grew out of the Accra Peace Agreement.\nNevertheless, our Government is a listening Administration, and we have been paying keen attention to the voices of our people. What I have discerned from their cries is that it is important to bring closure to the wounds from the 14 years of Liberia\u2019s brutal civil war, and that we need to agree on a mechanism that would guarantee the sustenance of peace, stability, justice and reconciliation, as well as enhance our prospects for economic recovery. Considering the importance of this matter, I have already begun consultations with our national legislature \u2014 the representatives of our people \u2014 and we intend to have a broader engagement with the Liberian judicial system and with our strategic international partners and organizations in order to determine pertinent issues such as the legal framework, timing, venue and funding, among other things. It is my hope that at the end of this consultative process, a national consensus will evolve that will determine the pathway to resolving this issue. I therefore ask for the Organization\u2019s unflinching support as we embark on this important national endeavour.\nWe are gathered here today at a time of uncertainty and heightened tension in global politics, security and trade. The global economy is also under undue stress and security tensions are on the rise in many parts of the world. Trade protectionism and climate change are having unintended consequences, especially for developing countries. We strongly believe in the ability of the United Nations, however, to maintain international peace and security, foster friendly relations among nations and promote social progress, better living standards and human rights. We continue to have faith and confidence in the United Nations as the best universal institution for guiding the nations of the world in peaceful and harmonious interaction.\nThe theme of this seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly is \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, which certainly reminds us of our responsibility to focus on achieving the purposes of the United Nations in principle and practice. My Government has developed and is implementing a national development plan that supports this theme. Our Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development is intended to serve as our compass for reconstruction, development and modernization. While it gives priority to poverty reduction, it is also intended to support the efforts of middle- and upper-income Liberians to grow and prosper. It is equally centred on infrastructure development, road construction, road connectivity and agriculture. The Pro-Poor Agenda also emphasizes women and youth empowerment, as well as qualitative education and good health-care delivery.\nHowever, at this juncture we are beginning to face significant implementation challenges, due to the continued decline in prices of our major exports, as well as revenue shortfalls and structural imbalances. Increasing inflation and currency depreciation are tending to reduce the purchasing power of our citizens, putting further burdens on their standard of living. We have done our best as a Government to address those challenges and will continue to do so. Many of them persist, however, and are demanding our full attention to the problem of finding practical solutions to them. We therefore want to appeal to the United Nations for its continued assistance and expertise. My Administration has recently developed a new investment framework of incentives and tax reliefs that will directly benefit the private sector, and we invite the investment community to take advantage of that new opportunity. We have also established several other initiatives to address those challenges. For example, we are presently engaged in talks with the International Monetary Fund with the aim of entering into a programme with it. We are also reorganizing the leadership and management of our central bank to make it more efficient, independent and responsive to the issues of formulating and supervising monetary policy.\nAs part of our efforts to ensure an inclusive and participatory dialogue on the problems confronting our economy, including the urgent need to offer appropriate solutions, we recently initiated a national economic dialogue involving all local and international stakeholders. We have taken due note of their recommendations and have already begun to implement those that are most urgent and pertinent.\nI want to assure the Assembly that Liberia remains engaged as a responsible member of the international community at all bilateral, regional and multilateral levels. We will continue to work with the United Nations and its entities to foster peace, security and harmony among the nations and peoples of the world.\nTo my fellow Liberians, both at home and abroad, I would like to say that without peace there can be no progress or development. All Liberians therefore have a responsibility to maintain the peace that we now enjoy, especially those who want to be future leaders of Liberia. I want to remind my fellow Liberians that it was the love of liberty that established our country, it was our unity that made us the first independent African republic, and it will take our joint efforts to sustain peace, achieve development, reconcile our nation and gain economic stability.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, and the members of the Bureau on your election, and to assure you of our full support in the discharge of your responsibilities. I also appreciate the role played by Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. We commend Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his reforms aimed at making the United Nations fit for purpose.\nToday the world stands at a crossroads. The landscape of the global order is undergoing profound transformation. The problems of yesterday have not subsided and yet new challenges are looming. Our inequalities in income, opportunities, technology and capabilities are increasing. Trade tensions among the largest economies create unpredictability and the risk of recession. The ensuing insecurity and disorder hurt least-developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and small island developing States the most.\nThe peril of climate change is outpacing our response. Its threat is truly existential in terms of the sustainability of the planet and the future of humankind. It is the poorest and most vulnerable countries that are hardest hit by the effects of climate change. Despite their negligible emissions, they face consequences that are disproportionate, unjust and undue. In that context, Nepal appreciated the Secretary-General\u2019s leadership in convening the Climate Action Summit on 23 September. It was another milestone in charting a sustainable path in the face of obstinate ignorance of climate science. Nepal, as home to Sagarmatha, also known as Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world, lies at a hotspot of climate change. The Himalayas, as a barometer of such change, are seeing glaciers melt and fresh water dry up at an accelerated rate. A report published this year by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development predicts that one third of glaciers in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya ranges will melt away by the end of the century even if we meet the 1.5\u00b0C commitment. That is alarming. Climate-induced disasters wreak havoc every year. This year alone, several of our citizens were killed by floods and tornadoes. Bearing in mind the seriousness of the issue and our own responsibility, the Government of Nepal has decided to convene a global dialogue in April under the theme of climate change. It will be the first in a series of Sagarmatha dialogues, established by Nepal to deliberate on critical issues of current importance.\nNepal pins great hopes on the centrality of the United Nations in galvanizing multilateral efforts to address cross-cutting and global challenges such as reducing poverty and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We have an abiding trust in multilateralism and believe that there is no alternative to it other than a better and more effective, inclusive and responsive multilateralism. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was a display of inclusive multilateralism at its best, but it can be implemented only if a similar spirit guides our actions with a renewed sense of partnership and with all stakeholders assuming responsibility for it.\nIn the past four years the SDG scorecard has shown mixed progress. Poverty has decreased, but the rate of its reduction is slowing. Unemployment rates have dropped, but wages remain stagnant. Food insecurity and hunger are getting worse. Greater collaboration is critical to mobilizing the resources needed to attain the SDGs and to ensure universal health coverage. Countries like Nepal need many resources if they are to fully realize the SDGs by 2030, and while mobilizing domestic financial resources is a priority for us, our national efforts, particularly those of LDCs and LLDCs, will have to be complemented by international support measures in the form of technical, financial, investment and other means of support.\nThe world has made great strides in wealth creation and the advancement of technology, and advances have also been made in life expectancy, literacy, basic education and the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Sadly, that progress has not been evenly distributed. Women and girls, people with disabilities and the elderly still bear the brunt of poverty and inequalities. Inequality within and between countries is growing. In that context, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the International Conference on Population and Development, as well as the midterm review of the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-2024, will provide important opportunities to take swift action. In that context, Nepal appreciates the Secretary-General\u2019s strategy on ensuring gender parity.\nWe welcome the reforms aimed at creating synergy and coherence within the United Nations system, in line with the principle of ensuring that all its activities are people-centred, and we hope that the new generation of country teams and Resident Coordinators can live up to expectations by delivering more. We also hope that the renewed thrust of United Nations reforms will propel the reform of the Security Council. We must focus on making the Council representative in structure, transparent in function, democratic in character and accountable in performance. The revitalization of the work of the General Assembly, including enhancing its role and authority, is long overdue, and we must make it a priority. However, the Organization\u2019s deteriorating financial situation is a matter of serious concern, as it can only impede the fulfilment of its mandates and responsibilities.\nHeightened geopolitical complexities, a defunct disarmament architecture, and the absence of order in cyberspace and outer space endanger international peace and stability. The intensifying arms race, coupled with growing distrust among major players, seems symptomatic of new forms of division with regard to the critical issues of peace and security. That is why a stronger and effective United Nations is critical to promoting trust and cooperation. Nepal supports the general and complete elimination of all weapons of mass destruction. We are concerned about the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the withdrawal of an important party from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian nuclear programme, and the stalemate in the Conference on Disarmament. Such trends should not be permitted to encourage a penchant for nuclear weapons. Nepal supports effective and verifiable nuclear-weapon-free zones and a legally binding multilateral disarmament regime for ensuring global security and stability. As a signatory to the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, we expect to complete our internal legal process for its ratification soon. In addition, for the greater benefit of humankind, we reiterate that outer space must not become a weaponized arena. As the host country for the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, Nepal calls for strengthening regional approaches to disarmament, including the Kathmandu Process, in order to complement global initiatives.\nThe problems of transnational organized crime, human and drug trafficking and terrorism transcend national boundaries. The flow of illicit money for financing crimes must be countered with stringent measures and cooperation among States. Nepal condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. In that regard, we call for the effective implementation of the relevant existing conventions and resolutions, including the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. The conclusion of a comprehensive convention against terrorism should be delayed no longer.\nThe violent conflicts in Libya, Syria, Yemen and elsewhere continue unabated, leaving human suffering in their wake. Conflict-related issues, including human rights violations, exoduses of refugees and forced migration, have global ramifications. We believe in the peaceful settlement of conflicts and disputes through negotiation and dialogue, without external interference. Robust conflict prevention and peacebuilding measures are critical to sustaining peace. The underutilized tool of mediation can potentially help to bring about a mutually agreeable solution to conflicts.\nWe want to see meaningful steps being taken to resolve the protracted Middle East issue. We support a two-State solution for Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security with secure and recognized international borders based on the relevant United Nations resolutions.\nNepal welcomes the dialogues between the United States and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and between the two Koreas. We hope that the initiatives will lead to lasting peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.\nTrue to our commitment to the Charter of the United Nations, Nepal has rendered one of the most dedicated, reliable and professional services to United Nations peace operations for more than six decades. Our peacekeepers have been deployed without caveats at the shortest notice, even in fragile and asymmetric threat environments. The safety, security and dignity of peacekeepers are therefore critically important to us.\nIn that spirit, we endorsed the Declaration of Shared Commitments in support of the Action for Peacekeeping initiative last year. We appreciate the role of the Department of Peace Operations, the Department of Operational Support and the United Nations as a whole in maintaining peace and security through peacekeeping operations.\nPeace operations require predictable, adequate and sustained resources for their success. The timely and full reimbursement to troop- and police-contributing countries is essential to ensure that those brave personnel continue to give their best performance, even in adverse situations. Troop- and police-contributing countries should receive their due share of leadership positions, both in the field and at Headquarters.\nNepal is committed to progressively deploying more women peacekeepers. We do not condone sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping missions. We have therefore endorsed the Kigali Principles on the Protection of Civilians.\nThe Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 calls for global cooperation in order to reduce the risk of large-scale natural disasters. Nepal has harmonized its national strategies on disaster risk reduction with those of the Sendai Framework, the SDGs, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the outcomes of the World Humanitarian Summit. Learning lessons from the 2015 earthquakes, Nepal has focused on the resilience of infrastructure.\nEven as a landlocked country, we care equally about oceans. We believe that there is an organic linkage between oceans and mountains. We are concerned because the health of the oceans is deteriorating alarmingly mainly due to climate change and reckless human activities.\nWe are confident that the new international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction currently under negotiation will prove to be a milestone in international law for the protection and conservation of marine biodiversity.\nMigration, a phenomenon as old as human civilization, is a defining megatrend of our time. Ensuring the rights and well-being of migrant workers is a matter of priority to us. The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (resolution 73/195, annex), adopted in December last year, is an important stepping stone and a good example of multilateralism at work. We urge all Member States to own the process and to be part of the outcome. As host to a large number of refugees for decades, Nepal firmly believes in the right of refugees to return to their home country in safety and dignity.\nNepal\u2019s commitment to the universal values of human rights is total. The Constitution of Nepal is founded on the fundamentals of inclusive democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, secularism, representative and accountable Government, social justice and human rights.\nWe are fully committed to concluding the transitional justice process in line with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Nepal and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), a directive of the Supreme Court, the relevant international commitments, the concerns of the victims and the realities on the ground. We hold that democracy, development and respect for human rights are interdependent and mutually reinforcing.\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, we have been promoting those ideals in an independent, apolitical and objective manner. In order to contribute further, Nepal has presented its candidature for re-election to the Human Rights Council for the term of 2021-2023. We greatly count on the valuable support of all United Nations Member States.\nNepal\u2019s foreign policy is guided by the five principles of peaceful coexistence, non-alignment, the United Nations Charter, international law and the norms of world peace. \u201cAmity with all, enmity with none\u201d has been our guiding motto. We believe in an inclusive, just and fair international order.\nNepal believes that regional processes complement global efforts for peace, security and economic development. We strive to enhance regional economic cooperation under the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation and the Asia Cooperation Dialogue. As the current Chair, we are striving to revitalize the stalled SAARC process.\nNepal\u2019s democratic transformation presents a uniquely successful, nationally led and owned peace process. We would be happy to share our experience, which may be useful to those in conflict.\nBuilding on the historic political transformation, the Government of Nepal is now focused on an economic agenda to sustain the political gains under the overarching national aspiration of \u201cProsperous Nepal, happy Nepali\u201d. We have created an investment-friendly atmosphere with substantive policy and legal reforms. One window service is operational, with almost all sectors open for 100 per cent foreign investment.\nWe have recently adopted the fifteenth five-year plan with a longer-term development perspective. Graduation from the status of a less developed country is part of our plan. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other internationally agreed goals and targets have been integrated into our national plans and programmes.\nPeace, tolerance and harmony are intrinsic to Nepali culture and way of life. Lumbini in Nepal is not only the birthplace of Gautam Buddha but also a fountain of peace, the ultimate destination for tranquillity of mind and spiritual fulfilment. We want to promote that world heritage on the international stage. We aim to host the International Day of Vesak in 2021.\nBefore I conclude, let me reiterate Nepal\u2019s profound commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations. We firmly believe in the centrality of the United Nations in promoting multilateralism. Viewed from the crossroads of history, we see no alternative to multilateralism to ensure peace, security and order in the world.\nIt is incumbent upon us, the Member States, to make the Organization a strong platform of collaboration and dialogue for resolving differences and finding solutions to the challenges. Only an empowered and reformed United Nations, reflective of the present-day reality, can achieve those critical responsibilities.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to extend the warm greetings of Pope Francis to the President and to all the delegations participating in the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly.\nKeenly aware that relationships in the international community today are experiencing particular tension and fragmentation, Pope Francis, who dedicated his 2019 New Year\u2019s address to the diplomatic corps accredited to the Holy See to the theme of multilateralism, tirelessly urges every actor on the international stage to strive to promote dialogue at every level as an indispensable step and the antidote to all divisions. In recent years, we have seen the value of effective multilateralism, for example in lifting millions out of poverty, resolving various conflicts, protecting our common home, fighting infectious-disease epidemics and caring for migrants and refugees. At the same time, we are painfully aware of the many ways in which international cooperation and commitment have been inadequate to meet the challenges we face.\nAmong those challenges, we must consider the situation in the Middle East and the various conflicts, especially in Syria and Yemen, that demand effective cooperation and the courageous commitment of the family of nations in order to put an end to the immense suffering of so many people and to set out on the road to peace and reconstruction. The Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which has been under way for a long time, is of perennial concern and runs the risk of seeing unilateral measures and solutions being advanced instead of a collaborative response from the international community.\nAnother area of pressing concern involves the situations in Venezuela and Nicaragua, where institutional channels must be fully utilized to find negotiated solutions to political, social and economic problems, ease tensions and alleviate the suffering of the population. In that regard, it is important also that the recommendations presented by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights be fulfilled. Positive signs include the extension for another year of the mandate, as established in Security Council resolution 2366 (2017), of the United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia. Notwithstanding the many obstacles facing it, the ongoing peace process in Colombia remains an inspiring example for a world of effective multilateralism.\nOne of the great challenges is the absence of peace and security in many parts of the world. In our common efforts to prevent conflict, end wars through mediation and build post-conflict peace and reconciliation, it is opportune to recall Security Council resolution 1888 (2009) on the tenth anniversary of its adoption. This anniversary is a welcome occasion to renew our dedication to protecting women and children from widespread sexual violence in armed conflict. The use of sexual violence as a weapon of war is absolutely unacceptable and must be stopped. We must never overlook the plight of the children conceived as a result of sexual violence in war. Both mothers and children are innocent victims. They must be protected, assisted and rehabilitated without being separated from their families or communities. No effort must be spared to ensure their full reintegration into society.\nThe proliferation of weapons is particularly alarming, as it spurs and exacerbates violence, conflict and war. The Secretary-General\u2019s report (A/74/1) documents the fact that armed groups are multiplying, worldwide military spending and arms competition are increasing, and the threat of the weaponization of artificial intelligence, cyberspace and outer space is growing.\nGreater multilateral cooperation is likewise needed to create the conditions and take the steps necessary for the elimination of nuclear weapons. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) are both important steps towards a nuclear-weapon free world. They are the fruit of the efforts of many States and other stakeholders to promote greater awareness and understanding of the humanitarian consequences and environmental disasters that would result from the use of nuclear weapons and are complements to, not distractions from, to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which will hold its tenth Review Conference next year.\nOne of the triumphs of multilateralism in recent years has been the global mobilization to lift people out of extreme poverty. The implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, in addition to other achievements, has helped lift nearly a billion people out of extreme poverty. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is an unprecedented multilateral commitment. Yet, as the Secretary-General\u2019s report notes, while much progress has been achieved, if we continue at the present pace, the targets may not be reached by 2030.\nWhen Pope Francis spoke to the General Assembly four years ago (see A/70/PV.3) immediately before the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, he emphasized that the new paradigm for development called for by the Agenda must begin with the core principle of the dignity of each human person and must recognize that extreme poverty is primarily a denial of that dignity. He said,\n\u201cabove and beyond our plans and programmes, we are dealing with real men and women, just like the Government leaders, who live, struggle and suffer, and are often forced to live in great poverty, deprived of all rights.\u201d (A/70/PV3, p. 4)\nWhen we focus on the primacy of the human dignity of every impoverished man or woman, boy or girl, we immediately recognize the need to help them shape their own integral development as subjects, not objects.\nEducation is a fundamental enabler and key to the achievement of the Agenda for Sustainable Development. Recently, Pope Francis launched the Global Educational Alliance, in which he renewed the invitation to dialogue on how we are shaping the future of our planet and the need to employ the talents of all, since all change requires an educational process aimed at developing a new universal solidarity and a more welcoming society. Pope Francis believes that never before has there been such need to unite our efforts in a broad educational alliance, to form mature individuals capable of overcoming division and antagonism, and to restore the fabric of relationships for the sake of a more fraternal humanity. We are experiencing an era of change: a transformation that is not only cultural but also anthropological, creating a new semantics. In this transformation process, we must have the courage to place the human person at the centre and to work for the promotion of an integral ecology based on the inseparable bonds among concern for nature, justice for the poor, commitment to society and interior peace.\nWhen it comes to care for our common home and the threat posed by climate change, the international community has been galvanizing its multilateral collaboration. We saw it with the Paris Agreement in 2015. We witnessed it again in December in Katowice, with the adoption of the Katowice rulebook to implement the Paris Agreement.\nTo enhance a multilateral response, there is a particularly urgent need for a transparent framework to promote trust among nations in fulfilling the commitments made. There is a need for more effective multilateral cooperation between the developed and developing world, for example, on financing measures to curb climate change, on technology transfer, on energy issues and on how to apply the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capacities in burden-sharing. We can and must achieve the goals we set out to accomplish for the sake of future generations. As encouraged by Pope Francis at the Climate Action Summit some days ago, we have to pursue this effort with honesty, courage and responsibility.\nAs we care for our common home, we must give special attention to the Amazon, where numerous fires have devastated the region. We all recognize how important the Amazon is for the whole world and indeed for the very future of humankind. Beginning a week from tomorrow, on 6 October, Pope Francis will gather in the Vatican a Synod of Bishops from all over the world for the Amazonian region, which will be focused principally on the ecclesial and pastoral challenges of the area, with particular attention given to the indigenous peoples living there and the human, ecological, social and economic issues that are impacting the region and, indeed, humankind.\nTo ensure that no one is excluded from the benefits of economic development, there must be a multilateral commitment to prosperity for all through the opening up of economic participation to individuals and peoples. People likewise need access to the enjoyment of all their fundamental human rights, which is often denied in situations of conflict or widespread violence, disasters and institutional failure. On this year\u2019s seventieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, Pope Francis recalled that these important international legal instruments impose limitations on the use of force and protect civilians and prisoners in time of war. He urged States always to observe the limitations imposed by international humanitarian law, protecting defenceless peoples and civil structures, especially hospitals, schools, places of worship and refugee camps.\nOne particular right that the international community must ensure with greater vigilance is the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as enshrined in article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In the past year, we have seen an increase in attacks against religious believers. We appreciate the international community\u2019s calling attention to attacks on religious believers and its adoption of various initiatives to protect churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and other religious sites.\nFinally, the challenges of international migration and forced displacement demand the comprehensive commitment and action of all States. The Holy See actively supported and engaged in the intergovernmental consultations and negotiations on the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Although the outcome of a compromise, the Global Compact, together with that on refugees, is a significant sign of political will, affirming our shared responsibility to act in solidarity not only as Governments but also with people on the move. Looking ahead, the International Migration Review Forum will be central to the follow-up and review of the Global Compact. All States, regardless of their political position regarding the Compact, should take advantage of that unique Forum to address the emerging challenges and concerns that they face in making international migration more safe, orderly and regular.\nFor the Holy See, the underlying principle of multilateralism is human fraternity. In that perspective, the Holy See hopes that, as we all look ahead to the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations next year, the international community will revisit the reason why it exists and commit itself anew to the task of uniting nations, associating States and bringing peoples together as one family. The Holy See and the Catholic Church, which is a communion of peoples of all nations and races, is wholeheartedly dedicated to that challenging, noble and necessary common commitment, common work and common good."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to congratulate President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election to lead the General Assembly at this session. He can count on our full support for the duration of his presidency. I am confident that given his extensive experience, he will lead this session very successfully. I would also like to commend his predecessor, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her excellent work as President of the previous session.\nThe international community is facing myriad challenges. Many parts of the world have been experiencing more frequent and more severe effects of climate change, which has extensively affected the livelihoods of people globally. Heatwaves have swept across Europe and droughts have persisted in many parts of the world, while in others, floods have inundated residential areas and productive land. While developed countries may be more resilient to climate change and better able to adapt to it, developing countries, particularly the least-developed countries \u2014 including my own country \u2014 remain very vulnerable. In the past two months we experienced unexpected heavy rainfall throughout our country as a result of Tropical Storm Podul that inundated nearly every province, causing enormous damage to infrastructure, agriculture and people\u2019s livelihoods. It has already cost millions of dollars to rehabilitate and restore normalcy in the affected areas.\nConscious of the importance of combating climate change, the Lao Government is now focusing on the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We have already mainstreamed our nationally determined contribution, and we have integrated climate change efforts and natural disaster risk reduction into our national socioeconomic development plan. In addition, our National Assembly has approved a law on disaster management that is expected to be enacted soon. We are currently formulating a national strategy and action plan on disaster preparedness and risk reduction.\nAt the regional level, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has also made a common effort to address the impact of climate change and disaster risk management, among other things. In that connection, we very much appreciate the United Nations support to ASEAN through the implementation of the ASEAN-United Nations Joint Strategic Plan of Action on Disaster Management 2016-2020 and the World Bank Group\u2019s Climate Change Action Plan 2016- 2020. But having this legal framework in place is not enough to combat climate change. While the full and effective implementation of these instruments is key, it will require joint efforts at both the national and international levels to ensure their full and effective implementation. In that regard, as we commit to action at the national level, we call on the developed countries and all our development partners to honour their commitment to contributing $100 billion a year to support the developing countries\u2019 mitigation and adaptation needs.\nPeace and security represent another important pillar that the international community must consolidate. We are fully aware that without peace, development cannot take root and human rights cannot be upheld. That was the core objective and firm foundation of the United Nations when it was founded. Since its inception, our Organization has made significant achievements on many fronts, including important contributions to the maintenance and promotion of global peace and security, creating an environment for countries and regions around the world that is conducive to making social and economic development progress and thereby lifting millions of people out of poverty. In that regard, multilateralism and the enhancement of regional and international cooperation remain highly relevant. We therefore believe that the reforms of the United Nations and other international organizations, including the international financial institutions, should be carried out in an inclusive, open, transparent, predictable and democratic manner, with a view to addressing regional and global inequalities and challenges. Otherwise, our journey towards eradicating poverty and narrowing the development gap within and among countries will remain an uphill task.\nAgainst that backdrop, we welcome the operationalization of the repositioning of the United Nations development system so that it can respond effectively to addressing the development needs and priorities of Member States, with particular attention given to meeting the needs of countries in special situations, especially least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked least developed countries (LLDCs) and small island developing States, in order to help them deal with acute vulnerability and external shocks.\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic also continues to support the efforts of the international community to achieve the objectives of disarmament and non-proliferation, and we have therefore ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. We also welcomed the commemoration of the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, which took place here at the United Nations two days ago.\nIn the past few years, alongside existing challenges such as conflicts, terrorism, poverty, pandemics, climate change, natural disasters and trade friction, we have seen increasing confrontation and tension threaten international peace and security and erode development gains. We therefore call for strong political will and a genuine commitment to strengthening multilateralism by adhering to the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, particularly the principles of the sovereign equality of States, independence, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of others. We believe that is the best and only path to responding to and overcoming existing and emerging challenges. Yet despite the countless efforts of the international community to resolve conflicts in various parts of the world, many of them continue. In our region, ASEAN has enjoyed long-lasting peace, security and stability, creating favourable conditions for the national socioeconomic development of all its member States. In ASEAN, we continue to promote regionalism and multilateralism that emphasize the importance of inclusivity and mutual benefits and respect, forming a solid foundation for all of the essential cooperation frameworks within ASEAN.\nOn the issue of Palestine, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic reiterates its hope that the protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be resolved by peaceful means and in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. The application of unilateral measures with extraterritorial implications is not only contrary to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, it also hampers the national development of other countries. In that regard, my delegation once again calls for lifting the embargo on the Republic of Cuba so that sovereign country and its people can enjoy the freedom to participate in economic and trade relations with other countries in accordance with international law.\nThe Lao Government attaches great importance to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and is highly committed to it, with the goal of developing our economy and narrowing our country\u2019s development gap. Despite the various policy measures that we have undertaken, progress remains slow as a result of capacity limitations and funding constraints, and the development gap persists, especially between urban and remote rural areas. In that regard, regional and subregional development plans tailored to people\u2019s actual needs at the provincial and district levels are needed in order to deliver basic social services to the local population, especially in the areas of education, health care, income opportunities, better market access for agricultural produce and improving the livelihoods of people in rural areas. In order to finance those national development plans and strategies, we have mobilized the resources required from every source available, undertaking initiatives to promote domestic investment, attract high-quality foreign direct investment, carry out tax reform, diversify the economy and promote public-private partnerships in order to finance our national development agenda.\nWe firmly believe that in addition to national ownership and leadership, we need to scale up global partnerships in order to accelerate progress towards the effective implementation of development agendas such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and programmes of action for groups of countries in special situations, with the ultimate objective of transforming our world into a healthy planet so that all humankind can live in peace and prosperity. On that note, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the successful deliberations of the first United Nations High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development \u2014 and other high-level events held on the margins of this year\u2019s session of the General Assembly \u2014 since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Forum will provide strong recommendations and input for the realization of our common ambitious Sustainable Development Agenda and its lofty goals. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic stands ready to work closely with all Member States and other stakeholders to achieve a secure and prosperous world so that present and future generations can live in peace, harmony and development.\nIn conclusion, allow me to take this opportunity to announce that the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has decided to present its candidacy for membership of the Economic and Social Council for the term from 2023 to 2025, the first time ever that the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, which belongs to the vulnerable groups of both the LDCs and LLDCs, will seek membership of that important United Nations organ. The Lao Government would greatly appreciate the valuable support of all Member States for its candidacy."

        "file_text": "On behalf of Ukraine, I congratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. Ukraine supports the implementation of all the ambitious priorities on the Assembly\u2019s agenda.\nLet me be frank \u2014 all of us present here have different interests, views, values and issues. However, there is one thing that unites us all \u2014 each and every one of us once delivered a statement from this rostrum for the very first time. I ask that everyone recall the feelings they experienced at that very moment. Every one of these reputable and respectable leaders today was once a fresh-faced and, I am sure, honest politician. At that time, the cocktail of pragmatism, scepticism and a tough geopolitical reality had not yet extinguished their eagerness, romanticism and steadfast faith in their ability to change the world for the better. I ask them to recall how important it was then to convey the problems and troubles of their own countries and peoples, and how important it was then to get their message across and be heard. I am experiencing those same feelings today.\nI am going to tell a story \u2014 the story of a person for whom being heard gave his life meaning. That is because this man had a divine voice. He was considered one of the best baritones and countertenors in the world. His voice filled Carnegie Hall, here in New York; Notre Dame and the Paris Opera; and the Royal Opera House in London. Each of us here today could have had the chance to listen to his incredible singing in person, but unfortunately that is now impossible. That is because of the bullet I have with me here. It is 12.7 millimetres long, and it ended not only his career, but also his life. By the way, it costs only $10. Unfortunately, that is the price of a human life on our planet. There are thousands of such stories and there are millions of such bullets. Welcome to the twenty-first century \u2014 a century of opportunities, where instead of being heard you may be killed.\nThe man whose story I have just recounted about was Vasyl Slipak. He was Ukrainian and a soloist at the Paris National Opera who was murdered in Donbas while defending Ukraine from the Russian aggression. The war in Donbas has gone on for five years. Five years have passed since Russia occupied Ukrainian Crimea. Nowadays, when there are thousands of pages of international law and hundreds of international organizations tasked with protecting it, our nation \u2014 with arms in hand \u2014 is losing its citizens as they defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. More than 13,000 people have been killed and 30,000 wounded, while 1.5 million people have been forced to leave their homes. These awful numbers are reported here annually with only one difference \u2014 they continue to grow.\nEnding the war, recovering all occupied Ukrainian territory and restoring peace are my primary objectives, but not at the cost of the lives of our citizens, our freedom or Ukraine\u2019s right to make its own choices. That is why we need broad international support.\nWhile I realize that every country represented here has its own challenges to tackle and that the problems of others should not concern us more than our own, I understand that in the modern world we live in, there is no longer such a thing as someone else\u2019s war. None of those here will feel safe while Russia is waging war against Ukraine in the middle of Europe. The notion that none of this has anything to do them or will ever touch their interests could be fatal. We cannot think globally while turning a blind eye to small things or trifles, as some may consider them. Because that is how the foundation of two world wars was laid and as a result, millions of human lives were lost owing to negligence, silence, inaction and unwillingness to relinquish one\u2019s own ambitions.\nAs the horrible lessons begin to fade from human memory, Ukraine remembers them. Ukraine has always demonstrated to the world its readiness to ensure peace in a civilized manner and has taken specific steps to ensure international security, such as when it abandoned its nuclear arsenal, which at the time exceeded the nuclear capacities of the United Kingdom, France and China combined.\nWe appear to believe in a collective effort to build a new world in which a country\u2019s faults are heard and reckoned with, regardless of whether it possesses nuclear weapons or not, and in which a country is respected for its deeds and not for having nuclear warheads. At the end of the day, in this new world, my country has lost a part of its territory and keeps losing its citizens almost every single day. For that reason, Ukraine has earned the right to speak about the need to reconsider and review the rules that are still in force even as they are trampled upon. We are certainly not calling into question the credibility of international institutions, in particular the United Nations, but we have to recognize that the existing system is not perfect. It has begun to unravel and malfunction; therefore, it needs to be revised. Let us be candid. Are the nations indeed united nowadays? If they are, what unites them? Is it disasters, calamities and wars?\nFrom here, the world\u2019s highest rostrum, we continuously hear calls for fair changes, righteous promises and new initiatives. It is high time that those calls were supported by action. For, in a modern world where a human life is worth just $10, those words are cheapened. Let us remember that the goal when the United Nations was established in 1945 was to maintain and strengthen international peace and security. But what should we do when the very fundamentals of international security are endangered?\nEvery war today, be it in Ukraine, Syria, Libya, Yemen or elsewhere in the world, no matter the number of casualties, is the biggest threat to civilization as a whole. That is because in 2019, human beings \u2014 homo sapiens \u2014 still prefer to resolve conflict by murdering their own kind. In the course of its existence, humankind has always figured out ways to cover distances transmit information and cure diseases. The only thing that remains unchanged is that disputes between peoples and States are still resolved by missiles, not by words. Let us not imagine that war is somewhere far away. Methods of warfare, technologies and weapons have proven that our planet is no longer very big. The time I will have spent delivering this paragraph of my statement is sufficient to raze the world to the ground.\nThis means that every leader bears her or his share of responsibility, not only for the fate of her or his own country but also for that of the entire world. In my opinion, we all need to understand that a strong leader is not one who, without batting an eyelash, sends thousands of troops to certain death. A strong leader is one who cares about the life of every individual.\nLet us ask ourselves: What results do our meetings produce for humankind? For some the General Assembly is merely a political stage where they can put on an act and declare their good intentions that will later be voided by the darkest of acts. But it is not merely a rostrum or a stage, and the planet\u2019s 7.5 billion people are not merely spectators but participants. The fundamental principles of the script will be established here today, and the matter of whether life will go on depends on everyone here.\nI will admit that I hope one day that this statement will be referred to as the 15 minutes that changed the world, but I am well aware that it is impossible to change in 15 minutes what has been happening for centuries. According to behavioural theories, war is an essential part of the human being, but the world is changing and humankind is changing together the world. The fact that we once developed writing and mathematics, invented the wheel, discovered penicillin and explored outer space means that humankind still has a chance. Acknowledging all the dangers and challenges of civilization, we must create new values and fight for a new mindset free from aggression, anger and hatred.\nOn this day, 25 September, in 1970, Erich Maria Remarque died, and his novel All Quiet on the Western Front was first published some 90 years ago. Its epigraph read: \u201cIt will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped the shells, were destroyed by the war.\u201d\nNinety years ago saw the publication of another novel, A Farewell to Arms, in which Ernest Hemingway wrote: \u201cWar is not won by victory.\u201d No one has ever stopped when they were winning. The world must remember that every new crippled generation is the path to a new war that cannot be won through victories. Someone may say today that there will be no Third World War, and that the Second was last. I hope that my words reflect an understanding of the danger facing the world and are not a mere announcement from the rostrum.\n"

        "file_text": "Paraguay reaffirms its commitment to multilateralism as the most effective tool for tackling global challenges and to the importance of strengthening the international legal architecture and respecting international law and universally applicable principles and values. We emphasize the value of the United Nations in promoting justice, development and peaceful relations among the nations of the world, as established in the foundational Charter of the United Nations.\nAs they work to achieve sustainable development, landlocked developing countries face specific challenges that require special attention. In that context, the commitment of the international community, and particularly of neighbouring countries of transit and partners, is essential. We want to emphasize that the right to development protects all peoples and must be guaranteed, especially for the most vulnerable. We would like to express our solidarity with the least developed countries and small island developing States, with whom we will continue to work jointly and in coordination to ensure that the special needs of all of us are duly addressed.\nIt is Paraguay\u2019s spirit of progress that drives its participation in regional and inter-regional integration processes. We are working to use those platforms to contribute to internal and international peace and prosperity with a proactive, participatory and dynamic approach. Those efforts have resulted in the recent conclusion of negotiations for free-trade agreements between the Southern Common Market and the European Union, as well as the countries of the European Free Trade Association, agreements that represent a firm commitment to liberalizing trade and removing obstacles to free trade.\nParaguay is determined to generate inclusive opportunities for the benefit of its citizens and is working to gain control of its future by strengthening its capacities and economic competitiveness and promoting active participation in processes that will help to improve the international legal system. Through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we are seeking a new model of governance for Paraguay whereby we can ensure that social welfare reaches all of our people without discrimination. Paraguay has chosen to progress along this path towards sustainable development by implementing the valuable set of tools represented by the 2030 Agenda under the leadership of the United Nations and through State action in every area, while integrating every sector of society and working to generate a real and lasting impact in every corner of the country. However, we will not be able to achieve that without a real transformation of the paradigms currently influencing the behaviour of our citizens. Paraguay is committed to the 2030 Agenda as a fast track towards its institutional goals, and we see the Sustainable Development Goals as key to eradicating poverty, hunger, disease, ignorance, discrimination, unemployment, inequality and shortages, among the evils that afflict millions on a daily basis. In Paraguay, it is our responsibility to leave no one behind.\nWe believe that South-South cooperation should be strengthened. In line with the conclusions of the second High-level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation, we therefore want to add our offer to share good practices and lessons learned with the global space and reaffirm our commitment to continuing to institutionalize South-South and triangular cooperation at the regional and international levels.\nThis year is a very important one for Paraguay, a multicultural country that has Guarani and Spanish as official languages. Amid the celebration of the International Year of Indigenous Languages, we are warned that the hundreds of indigenous languages are dying every day. The 19 surviving indigenous languages in my country are a cultural treasure and are part of our identity. We will therefore continue to work to protect, respect and promote them.\nAs a form of Government and a way of life, democracy cannot be shaped simply by exercising the right of suffrage. It is an organized system, in which men and women can elect and be elected, where all citizens, without distinction, can access the material benefits of progress and where the rule of law prevails, without exception, for the body of society over sectarian interests.\nDemocracy cannot be interpreted. Its definition is not malleable or adaptable to the needs of tyrants or autocrats. It is a concept that does not respond to whims or opportunistic or capricious decisions. Democracy is built on legal norms and is achieved through institutions governed by law because politics cannot, and should not, be above the law. As a system of Government, democracy is achieved by empowering citizens, enforcing their rights and strengthening the institutional structure. Similarly, it is achieved by easing political and social tensions by using the tools provided for in the legal system.\nMy country has continuously demonstrated its strong will to strengthen its democracy and to preserve and keenly foster the legitimate expression of the people. The international community has played a key role in cooperating with the citizens and the Government of Paraguay, helping to preserve the democratic order and civic responsibility without disruptively interfering in internal affairs. We therefore believe in that cooperative approach, which we see as an antidote to anti-democratic upheaval.\nThat line of thought represents the basis of Paraguay\u2019s position on the tragedy experienced by the sisterly Republic of Venezuela, causing a deep regional crisis, the consequences of which are felt throughout the world. The news, reports and images that circulate through various media faithfully portray the sad reality of so many people who today suffer at the hands of a regime that openly flouts human rights and democracy.\nWe need to join forces to restore democracy in Venezuela to ease the humanitarian crisis that is severely affecting its population and to reverse the exodus that is forcing thousands of people to leave every day. The tragedy today is in Venezuela but the crisis is regional.\nAnyone who expels his fellow countrymen through hunger, poverty or oppression spreads suffering and discontent, becomes the executioner of the poor, the sick and the hungry, denies rights and eliminates any chance for a better future.\nWe need to jointly respond to the migration and humanitarian crisis that has led to the flight of millions of people who are forced to leave their homes to flee poverty, violence and extreme hardship. That has become particularly evident in Latin America, which, despite its own difficulties, has generously and magnanimously opened its arms to its brethren migrants.\nParaguay is an open-door country that believes in the ability of migration to contribute to the economic, social and cultural development of all countries. Consistent with that conviction, we call for the decent treatment of migrants, in particular children and young people in displacement.\nWe are facing difficult times for human beings and the planet. The adverse effects of climate change have an impact throughout the world. While some countries have more resources than others to cope with post-disaster reconstruction, if we continue along this path, we will reach a point of no return, where no one will be able to escape the consequences of environmental degradation.\nAs a landlocked developing country, Paraguay is severely affected by such consequences. Recently, hundreds of thousands of hectares of forests were devastated by fierce fires that destroyed much of the rich ecological diversity of the Gran Chaco Americano. I would like to thank all the countries that offered us their help in such difficult times.\nThe changes that the planet so badly needs will be achieved through joint efforts developed in global platforms, where each State will have to responsibly address the immediate and medium-term challenges in line with their capacities and resources. Strategic partnerships will also assist that effort. In that regard, in cooperation with the Green Climate Fund and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Paraguay has recently concluded negotiations to establish a special reforestation fund and to thereby combat extreme poverty, which affects the most vulnerable in society.\nSimilarly, the hydroelectric project that Paraguay shares with Brazil, known as Itaipu Binacional, is part of that initiative. It was developed to promote the benefits of shared natural resources and is a successful example of an initiative to produce clean and renewable energy.\nIn the near future, together with Brazil, we will promote a process to review the financing of Itaipu Binacional. We will work to ensure that such as exercise leads to a fair and balanced approach to economic development and well-being.\nThe Republic of Paraguay affirms its commitment to non-proliferation, disarmament, the rejection of war and the peaceful settlement of conflicts. Paraguay calls on the international community to avoid escalations that fuel tensions and threaten international peace and security, while reaffirming the need to use dialogue and diplomacy as tools for resolving disputes. In that regard, we reaffirm our belief in the principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations to those ends.\nParaguay recognizes the important role that peacekeeping operations have played, and continue to play, in helping many countries to resolve conflict situations and to protect civilians and the most vulnerable. We therefore maintain our political commitment to continuing to contribute qualified personnel trained prior to their deployment.\nWe need an effective, agile Organization that responds to the calls for peace, justice, freedom and development of all peoples of the world. We therefore strongly support the revitalization of the General Assembly, its most democratic and representative organ. It is a space that belongs to all nations, in which we can express our views, our demands and our needs on an equal footing and in a sovereign way. We support the reforms proposed by the Secretary-General, including repositioning the United Nations development system, in order to appropriately address the challenges of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other international development frameworks.\nParaguay joins States that advocate Security Council reform so as to thereby transform the Council into a more inclusive and transparent body, capable of addressing threats to international peace and security.\nBefore concluding, I wish to congratulate Ambassador Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his recent election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session and to wish him every success in his new functions. Similarly, Paraguay recognizes the work done by the former President of the General Assembly, Maria Fernanda Espinosa, and her team, who guided the work of this organ magnificently and efficiently. I commend Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who has shown great leadership and vision in continuing to promote a more efficient and transparent organization that is closer to the people it is intended to serve. As Chair of the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries, Paraguay urges for the implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-2024, which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda. Its midterm review will take place on 5 and 6 December, and we invite all delegations to participate in that review at the highest possible level.\nIn conclusion, I want to reaffirm Paraguay\u2019s unwavering commitment to multilateralism and diplomacy in support of peace and sustainable development. We will continue to work to preserve the United Nations and its tireless work for the noble and just causes of humankind. That is one of the best legacies we can offer to our current and future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the proud nation of the Kingdom of Thailand, I would like to say to the Greta Thunberg generation of the world that we have heard their heartfelt plea to preserve and protect their planet and their livelihood. In fact, it is the duty of all of us who gather in this forum to demonstrate that we are trying in good faith to do our very best and that we will continue to do so.\nThe world is witnessing a sea of change in many respects, and with it, challenges and opportunities abound. The twenty-first century is often described as the Age of Disruption. The question is whether we are all ready for it.\nGrowth and prosperity require peace. Political and economic advancements require stability. Technology requires conscience. Environmental preservation requires hard work and sacrifice. Progress requires sustainability. These tautological notions are age-old, yet their achievement remains elusive. The thorniest question is not the why, but the how \u2014 specifically, how to meet those requisites and reach the desired objectives.\nThe past few years have seen accelerating retrenchment from multinationalism to misguided nationalism, from globalization to anti-globalization, from free trade and a rising-tide-lifts-all-boats mentality to beggar-thy-neighbour policies and mercantilism. We have also been observing a worsening wealth gap, environmental degradation, segregation instead of inclusion and a winner-takes-all approach, all of which lead to conflict and confrontation. This is a great tragic irony because we are living in a world where connectivity and interconnection are the norm rather than the exception. And yet we still manage to dig in our heels in the trenches we ourselves dug, steadfastly clinging to posts that are extremely wide apart, often merely for myopic, self-serving reasons. Reaching out is considered weakness rather than strength.\nMeanwhile, the fourth industrial revolution has arrived, whether or not we are prepared for it, bringing with it an avalanche of technological advancements that will have far-reaching and weighty ramifications for all matters affecting our lives, livelihoods and future. More seriously, unlike the previous three industrial revolutions, the fourth will give us little or no time to adjust. Therefore, in addition to the worsening traditional challenges with which we are relatively familiar, we now have to overcome new, unfathomable non-traditional challenges in the realm of technology. How successful we are in dealing with them will determine the future of humankind. Nations have no choice but to put our heads together \u2014 not against one another \u2014 so as to get through this latest round of trials and tribulations and come out ahead.\nThat is one reason why Thailand, as Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year, chose the theme of advancing partnership for sustainability to be the core focus of ASEAN\u2019s goals and undertakings. Embedded in the notions of partnership and sustainability is the fundamental requirement of a mindset that calls for conflict to be turned into cooperation. These notions also entail inclusiveness and far-sightedness, through which the prisoner dilemma and lopsided short-term gain would be replaced with sustainable, long-term advancements that reflect the principles of shared interest and mutual benefit.\nAt the margins of the opening of the seventy-fourth session, our Prime Minister attended three leadership events, thereby reflecting Thailand\u2019s resolute commitment to the respective topics, namely, universal health coverage, climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For Thailand, these causes are not just abstract; we have realized them in earnest through the implementation of policies, because they matter so much to the livelihoods not only of our peoples but also of people around the world.\nThailand now ranks sixth globally in terms of our health-care system. Providing health care is not an easy task considering the countless competing demands on our resources. It requires a balanced approach to managing budgets and setting priorities. It also requires unwavering political will on the part of the leadership to remain on track despite all the distracting claims against it. Our achievements speak volumes about Thailand\u2019s commitment to the people-centric policy that aims at leaving no one behind.\nOn climate change, as Chair of ASEAN, Thailand has pressed successfully for our regional grouping to adopt, for the first time, a collective stand on one of the most critical environmental disasters, namely, marine debris. We also ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, because we believe that environmental crises are a global problem and that they therefore demand a global solution and a collaborative global effort. The acceleration of environmental degradation at rates never seen before obliges all of us to do more to right the wrongs we have committed against the environment. For so long, we have taken the sustenance of nature for granted, and nature has suffered boundlessly from both neglect and abuse. This time, nature is getting back at us, telling us this far but no further.\nAs for the Sustainable Development Goals, Thailand has adopted the sufficiency economy philosophy espoused by our late King Rama IX, as its fundamental approach to the SDGs. In fact, if the philosophy is adequately and wisely implemented, SDG 1, on poverty eradication, will no longer need to be part of the equation. In fact, as the Chair of the Group of 77 two years ago, Thailand shared this approach with the members of the Group. Striving for balance between development and progress and between social factors and coherence is inherent to the approach. Without balance, the road out of an economically deprived existence for millions of people will lead nowhere.\nThe foregoing three issues have been among the pillars of our Government\u2019s foreign policy. Equally important is our recognition that none of them can be achieved without preserving their underpinning prerequisites, namely, peace and stability. That leads us to our current dedicated efforts, which we are undertaking together with other ASEAN members, to push for partnership and turn conflicts into cooperation so that development and progress can be sustainable. This approach may sound too idealistic given the current global trend of choosing confrontation over dialogue to settle our differences, but, in fact, it is not. Essentially, it is the duty of all of us gathered in this Hall today to give partnership and cooperation a chance and prove that, with a different mindset, peace and common benefits can be achieved and sustained and that they are not mere reflections of an idealist\u2019s zeal, with no practical wherewithal or real-life application.\nThe onerous task for us is how to convince all nations, large and small, that in the face of our current tumultuous challenges, both traditional and technological, and for the sake of future generations, there is absolutely no room for winner-takes-all and zero-sum mindsets. We shall sink or swim together, not alone, and not at the expense of others drowning. It is a not such a bad cliche at this juncture to say that we are all in the same boat, all of us together.\nLastly, we have to address the rising anti-globalization movement. It is the elephant in the room that the world can no longer afford to ignore. The movement, including xenophobic populism, stems mainly from the disenfranchisement people feel from economic globalization, which in many cases leads to what the British economist William Forster Lloyd dubbed \u201cthe tragedy of the commons\u201d. Many anti-globalization activists do not oppose globalization in general; they simply want to change the way it has been allowed to run unchecked, resulting in exclusion, alienation, human rights violations, unfair trade and development that is detrimental rather than beneficial to many segments of society.\nMilitary conflicts and extreme climate change, both of which trigger ravages and mass migration, exacerbate the rising distrust and disgruntlement that has been thrown into the mix of the anti-globalism narrative and actions. That is why Thailand has been promoting its people-centric national and international policy as an essential part of our economic and social development policies. Needless to say, each nation, individually and collectively, must put the balanced improvement of the livelihood of its people at the top of its priorities. We must foster the development model that aims at leaving no one behind. It is the duty of every Government and the United Nations to create and adopt an approach to growth that gives a chance to people at large, and not just a privileged few. To do otherwise would lead to the subsidence of the economic order and widespread calamity.\nThailand is a country that geographically straddles two vast oceans \u2014 the Pacific and the Indian Oceans. Throughout time, Thailand has conscientiously maintained its centrality, while promoting partnership via regionalism and multilateralism. History has shown us time and again that the great Powers are first in line to write the rules. History has also shown us that the privileges that come with great strength do have limits. Most importantly, privilege comes with even greater responsibility and accountability.\nWithout due regard to the lessons that history has taught us, we shall remain trapped in the vicious circle that has brought this body into existence in the first place. We owe it to future generations to prevent history from repeating itself. To that end, Thailand has been trying to do its part, and we are certain that we are not alone. We would also like to believe that it is the reason why we are gathering in this Hall today. If we fail to learn from history how to conduct ourselves differently, all shall be lost, including our collective future."

        "file_text": "We are gathered here on the eve of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. Gatherings and anniversaries are usually a time of reflection and introspection. One such global occasion is the United Nations General Assembly. Here the world meets, reflects, exchanges ideas and sets goals for the future. It is a unique forum in human history.\nI believe that we must use the coming months and the seventy-fifth birthday of our Organization in 2020 not only to emphasize its accomplishments and global relevance to the spheres of peace and security, development, climate action, human rights and humanitarian assistance, but also to take a bold leap forward and reiterate our commitments. However, time is of the essence.\nThe Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, said in January, \u201c[t]he best-selling brand in our world today is indeed fear. It gets ratings. It wins votes. It generates clicks\u201d.\nIndeed, fear is present and it inhibits us from taking that step in the right direction; it is hampering our potential and our creativity. We who are gathered here should lead by example. It is incumbent upon us to fearlessly use the instruments we have at our disposal and to boldly think of new ones to advance our nations and our planet, right now. It is incumbent upon us to address the greatest challenges of the globalized twenty-first century \u2014 climate change, sustainable development, migration, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and new technologies. How do we prevent unfavourable scenarios and harvest the benefits? How do we mobilize States and joint resources to respond adequately to emerging threats?\nWe all know the answer, which is at the same time simple and ever more difficult \u2014 by joining forces. We cannot deny that multilateralism is facing challenges, the reasons for which may be numerous and complex. However, multilateralism is still our best chance of achieving our common goals. Standing alone and isolated, one fails, but many of us, together, united around common ideas and working in good faith, have the tools in our hands to succeed. Let us use the existing mechanisms, transform them for the better and make them more effective.\nNo doubt, reforms are necessary. We also need to take a deep look at our Organization \u2014 its strengths and weaknesses \u2014 and trace the path for decades to come. In that connection, I affirm Croatia\u2019s full support for the United Nations reform agenda and the Secretary-General\u2019s continued efforts. We have to revitalize the United Nations and redouble efforts to make this building a home to true global leadership and a platform for the promotion and development of the rules-based international order.\nThe goals before us \u2014 poverty eradication, quality education, inclusion and climate action \u2014 cannot be achieved without individual national efforts coupled with our common dedication and action. For its part, Croatia is doing its best to fulfil the goals we have set for ourselves.\nFirst, we are combating poverty and social exclusion and reducing social inequalities. Secondly, we believe that quality education is key to long-term social stability and economic progress. Thirdly, with regard to inclusion, the ultimate values of our constitutional order are freedom, parity, gender equality and respect for human rights. Finally, Croatia is dedicated to fighting climate change through the implementation of innovative solutions that will transform our economy and society, and remains committed to the efficient fulfilment of its obligations under the Paris Agreement.\nJust as accession to the European Union (EU) provided a blueprint for the transformation of governance, the economy and society, so does Croatia see the Sustainable Development Goals as a matrix for our future and an obligation to our citizens and the international community. We need to reinvigorate the political momentum and renew our enthusiasm for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. For us, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are guidelines for our own development and a framework for securing a better and more sustainable future, both locally and globally.\nTogether with other EU member States, Croatia strives to become a leader of sustainable development. Our focus is and will be on a green Croatia and the balanced regional development and territorial cohesion of all our geographic areas, including the sustainable development of our more than 1,000 Adriatic islands.\nI have spoken more than once at this rostrum. Together with the Assembly, I have raised many issues that trouble our nations and the world. I want to focus today on the environment, in particular our seas and oceans. They are the essence and foundation of all life on Earth. Without them, we would not be here.\nCroatia is both a Central European and a Mediterranean country, with great biodiversity. The number of known species in Croatia is about 40,000, including significant populations of many species that are threatened today in Europe and worldwide. Besides our talented people, biodiversity is our greatest treasure.\nIn that connection, Croatia pays particular attention to the environmental protection of the Adriatic Sea. We are focused on preserving and facilitating the recovery of the marine and coastal environment, protecting biodiversity and ensuring the sustainable use of the sea and coastal areas. Croatia\u2019s national ecological network covers 37 per cent of our entire land area and 15 per cent of our marine area.\nHowever, climate change and pollution threaten our natural resources, our delicate ecosystems and our Adriatic Sea. We cannot continue to neglect its severe implications for our environment and the significant economic losses we can expect in future. Marine litter is a problem of increasing concern. It threatens marine life in the world\u2019s oceans and in the Adriatic Sea, having already impacted more than 700 marine species. Croatia\u2019s coastal areas, some of the world\u2019s cleanest and most wondrous, are at times severely affected by poorly managed waste from our neighbouring countries to the south.\nThe plastic pollution in our seas and oceans is one of the greatest threats that humankind is facing today. Without the preservation of our waters and our marine life, there will be nothing to leave to future generations. About 8 million tons of plastic debris ends up in our oceans and seas every year. Plastics are found throughout the marine environment, from the surface of the water down to the sea floor.\nWe know that pollution has an annual financial negative impact measured in billions of dollars, which reflects only the immediate costs of the impact of plastic on marine life, tourism, fisheries and businesses. However, plastic pollution carries toxic pollutants into our own food chain. A recent study has revealed that, in general and on average, people may be ingesting approximately 5 grams of plastic every week, the equivalent weight of a credit card. What we throw into the sea today, we consume in our food tomorrow.\nThe renowned Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries, in Split, has been monitoring the Adriatic Sea since 1930. Its scientific activity encompasses very complex research in the fields of biological, chemical and physical oceanography, sedimentology, fisheries biology and aquaculture. More than 100 scientists and experts are diligently working on the preservation of the sea as one of our greatest assets. One of their main projects involves cooperation with fishermen \u2014 plastics and litter from the sea floor that is found in their fishing nets is collected and disposed of. A number of fishing ships are involved in the project and to date have collected more than 50 tons of waste.\nIn the Croatian part of the Adriatic Sea, 97 per cent of beach water is of exceptional quality. We do not take that for granted, nor can we allow ourselves to do so. That is why more and more local communities are organizing beach clean-ups and encouraging tourists to take part in those activities as well. From this rostrum, I encourage everyone to please stop throwing waste into our oceans and rivers. Our own future is at stake.\nI spoke last year (see A/73/PV.8) about the Ocean Cleanup project, the first feasible method to rid the world\u2019s oceans of plastic and remove 50 per cent of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in just five years. The media has named it Pac-Man, referring to a popular video game. I spoke about the inventor of this method, the brilliant young Croatian scientist living in the Netherlands, Boyan Slat. But what we need is more deeds like that, not just words. The clock is ticking.\nToday, instead of a lengthy speech, I want to use the remaining time to give real people a voice and emphasize again the need for real actions that inspire further action. In that connection, I will tell the Assembly about Zlarin, one of the 1,246 Croatian islands. It is a small island, inhabited by about 300 people \u2014 people with hearts and minds dedicated to the preservation of their environment and their home. Last year, young environmental enthusiasts gathered the entire local community to start an action called \u201cTake a break from plastic\u201d. The goal was to make Zlarin the first Adriatic island free of single-use plastic and plastic waste within a year. Their action was local, but their efforts are indeed global. Since I could not project any videos in the Hall, I kindly ask those gathered here to watch their short video message entitled HRT\u2014 An Island Without Plastic, which is subtitled in English, via the web link provided in the written version of my speech.\nThe people of Zlarin and the activists that appear in the video had the vision and courage to transform their island community. Within just one year, the island has been transformed. By signing a symbolic declaration, all residents, caterers and merchants banned disposable plastics from everyday use. Today the children on Zlarin educate hundreds of visiting tourists that plastic is not welcome on their island. Those children are our future, and they deserve recognition for what they have been doing.\nWe in this Hall are running out of excuses for not following the example of the people of Zlarin and doing the same globally. Let us make all of our communities as responsible as the people of Zlarin. Let us not hesitate or be discouraged by past and present failures, but rather provide strong leadership for our common success in the future. Fear steals time, and time is scarce. In the words of Saint John Paul II, \u201cBe not afraid\u201d.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a special pleasure for me to offer, on behalf of the President of the Gabonese Republic, His Excellency Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, my congratulations to President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as head of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I would like to assure him of the support of my country throughout his mandate.\nI would also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her outstanding commitment and the diligence with which she led our work during the seventy-third session of the General Assembly. Allow me also to convey my congratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, on the scale of the reforms that have been undertaken and committed to in order to render our Organization more efficient and able to address the challenges facing our world today.\nThis session is being held at a time when the world is suffering the terrible effects of climate change. The devastation of Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in southern Africa and, more recently, Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas and on the east coast of the United States, to mention only those recent cases, remain a tragedy of grim memory that demonstrates the extreme vulnerability of our planet to the unprecedented scale of evidence of climate change.\nAs the people of Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe struggle to recover from the dreadful damage and trauma of those destructive disasters, our conscience must be to recall the need and urgency to act together against that threat, to which no one is immune. In saying that, I have in mind and pay tribute to former French President Jacques Chirac, who has just departed from us and who used to so aptly say: \u201cOur house is burning and we are looking elsewhere\u201d.\nThe theme of our discussions is particularly relevant and topical. How can we galvanize multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion in an international context in which multilateralism is tested more than ever and in which terrorism and violent extremism continue to spread death, fear and insecurity in many parts of the world? It is a context in which famine, malnutrition, endemic diseases and social exclusion prevail as predators of human dignity and an international context marked by an unprecedented migration crisis, which requires the international community to be even more united in order to ensure an inclusive and united response to a phenomenon that jeopardizes the well-being of the life force of our nations.\nMore than ever, the diverse threats and dangers that jeopardize our civilization challenge us as much as the harsh reality that the destiny of future generations will depend on our ability to make bold decisions today.\nThe theme of our work highlights our interdependence, our interconnection and humankind\u2019s common destiny given the global threats that transcend both the illusion of national borders and the barriers of social classes and human inequality. We are bound more than ever before to act collectively to reconcile development with lasting peace and the preservation of the environment for current and future generations. This is the place to reaffirm the expectations and needs of Governments to see the United Nations respond to the ongoing tireless legitimate calls of the peoples of the world for a lasting peace, for greater justice and for respect for human dignity.\nIt is four years since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), followed by the signing of the Paris Agreement. Yet we note with regret the limited results in combating climate change, which remain well below expectations. Worse still, some actors continue to clearly doubt the relevance of climate change and operate in a contradictory dynamic. Despite that distressing observation, we must not wait any longer to translate our various commitments into concrete action to accelerate the pace of their implementation. It is now more than ever the time to measure the progress made and to understand the difficulties encountered, while taking into account the new challenges that sometimes require us to adapt our strategies.\nIt is undeniable that the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals requires a significant mobilization and pooling of both human and financial resources and a greater mobilization and involvement of the private sector. The pooling of our efforts is all the more crucial given the fact that the ongoing fluctuating and depreciating prices of oil and a number of other raw materials have greatly weakened the economies of the producing countries, such as my country, Gabon. High budgetary dependence on oil revenue has led to a worsening of the public deficit and a significant slowdown in public investment, particularly in the social dimension.\nIn that respect, from this rostrum President Ali Bongo Ondimba launched a solemn appeal for international solidarity and robust and coordinated actions for the benefit of developing countries towards the effective implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (see A/72/PV.11).\nIt is therefore urgent to meet the commitments made towards developing countries, particularly in the areas of clean technology transfer and improving people\u2019s access to renewable energy, to accelerate their transition from a traditional polluting industry to a low-carbon, environmentally friendly one.\nIn the light of that requirement, we welcome the recent convening of the Climate Action Summit, while commending the interest in and the amount of the pledges made, which were in line with our aspirations and needs. It is now up to us to go beyond solemn commitments and formal announcements to realize the developed projects in order to further protect biodiversity. Similarly, it is essential to ensure the effectiveness and greater prominence of the financing and resource mobilization strategy so as to more specifically support the implementation of our initiatives. That support must take into account the specific national characteristics and particular needs of each State.\nIn the same vein, it is appropriate to assume our common but differentiated responsibilities, in line with our respective contributions, and to determine a governance model that not only incorporates regional parity and the participation of all stakeholders but also enhances consistency among the key bodies dedicated to protecting the environment.\nFor Gabon, climate change action is based on three pillars, namely, improving living conditions, implementing climate adaptation projects and protecting biodiversity. That bold choice, in view of the scale of the challenges, has already earned my country\u2019s recognition by our development partners, which have just declared us the very first African country to benefit from international funds to continue our efforts in the fight against deforestation.\nDevelopment cannot be sustainable without peace and stability. Yet peace continues to be harshly tested in several regions of the world. Ongoing terrorist attacks show us that no nation is immune to the threat, to which our response must be collective. We unequivocally condemn those many acts of barbarism and reiterate our full solidarity and our support to the countries and peoples who fall victim to them.\nThe cost of instability due to terrorism and the fear of armed groups is particularly high for many African countries that are forced to devote significant resources to such phenomena, which are maintained by the trade in small arms and illicit trafficking in fauna and flora, among other things. It is clear that the good intentions and concern of the international community are no longer enough to combat those sources of instability and poverty in several parts of Africa. A comprehensive and united approach is essential and must be achieved by eliminating the root causes of such phenomena as well as the awareness that the threat against one nation is a threat against all.\nMy country, Gabon, advocates a concerted approach to peace. In the light of that vision, we remain resolutely committed to working alongside the United Nations, in particular to promote stability and peace in the Central African Republic. We believe that besides the inclusive nature of the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic, negotiated in Khartoum by all the parties involved in the crisis, a lasting solution depends on strengthening the State\u2019s capacities. That is why Gabon advocates for completely lifting the arms embargo still in force in the Central African Republic. In Gabon\u2019s concerted approach, led by President Bongo Ondimba, we have consistently worked to promote dialogue in most of the areas of tension at a subregional level, together with our peers in the Economic Community of Central African States, which Gabon currently chairs. This is also the place for us to welcome the announcement of a national dialogue in Cameroon, which shows our neighbour\u2019s willingness to find a lasting solution to its challenges. Incidentally, my country denounces the separatist tendencies in African States, which not only help to weaken the social fabric but distract from our progress towards development.\nGabon, like many oil-producing countries, has been hit hard by the impact of the drastic drop in commodity prices, a situation that has led to a slowdown in economic activity. In that context, the Government has initiated a series of recovery measures aimed at reducing imbalances that include adjusting the budget, developing infrastructure and promoting the private sector, so as to diversify and transform our economy. The main objective of the economic recovery plan we have implemented is to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth capable of profoundly transforming our economy and boosting investment. Today we can welcome the encouraging signs emerging from the three-year evaluation of the implementation of the recovery plan, particularly in terms of balancing public finance and mobilizing and controlling expenditure and debt. As a result of this improved growth, thanks to the economic reforms, the Government is gradually regaining the margin it needs to finance the areas where investment is most urgently needed, particularly quality education, an area for which the President has just announced a major reform, aimed at optimizing the education system in order to align it better with the demand for excellence and to meet a real need in the labour market.\nInclusion is a major policy concern for Gabon. Our President emphasized how crucial it is in a recent address to the nation in which he reiterated his call for involving all sectors in building a stronger and more prosperous country. That is definitely the purpose of our equal-opportunity programme, which is the guiding principle of the Government\u2019s actions promoting more equitable development and which focuses particularly on women, young people and the disabled in order to ensure that no one is left behind.\nSpeaking of international solidarity and inclusion, I would once again like to call from this rostrum for the total lifting of the decades-long embargo imposed on the Government and people of Cuba, in order to remove the obstacles to their achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, which is a legitimate aspiration for all the peoples of the world.\nIn conclusion, on behalf of Gabon, I want to call for a reform of global governance characterized by greater justice and fairer sharing of responsibilities between North and South. The best expression of that would be reform of the Security Council whereby the African continent is represented based on the African common position, as outlined in the Ezulwini Consensus. Such a reform, which we all hope for, will have the advantage of bringing the world into line with the demands of the times and above all with the values that are the foundation of our common faith in order to forever banish the spectre of war and raise high the flag of peace. Given those values, we cannot deprive more than 1 billion people of the right to have a say in the direction of the global agenda.\nFinally, I would like to reiterate Gabon\u2019s commitment to multilateralism, to which we believe there is no credible alternative in our common desire to confront the increasingly complex challenges of sustainable development and in our quest for appropriate solutions to the challenges and threats facing humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "We would be either presumptuous or dangerously indifferent if we did not assess the impact of the renewed call from the world\u2019s youth about our climate emergency and failed to respond to it with speed, ambition and effectiveness. Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande is well aware of our young people\u2019s importance. The African continent, which he is honouring as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, is the only region in the world whose population under the age of 24 continues to grow. Those young people behind the movements in support of our planet are quite rightly driven by an unprecedented anxiety about the future but above all by an immense hopefulness that should push us to make real change. We must reflect those messages in our policies if we are to respond bravely and with determination.\nThis year\u2019s Climate Action Summit, which was so well organized by the Secretary-General with the support of Special Envoy Luis Alfonso de Alba, enabled us to showcase the mobilization and creativity of all the actors in our societies. For its part, the Principality is firmly committed to carbon neutrality by 2050 and plans to take the steps needed to achieve that ambition. Our energy transition mission, established in 2016, is redoubling its efforts to accelerate the transition of multiple stakeholders to run on low carbon. Our national energy transition pact will enable everyone \u2014 individuals, public and private companies and associations \u2014 to commit to becoming actors and partners in making the changes in our lifestyles that must inevitably result.\nOnly proactive policies will enable us to grapple with the strains on a country that welcomes more than twice its permanent population on a daily basis. In that regard, we are paying particular attention to aligning policies combating climate change and preserving air quality in order to safeguard health, in line with the commitments under the BreatheLife campaign, coordinated by the World Health Organization, the United Nations Environment Programme and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition. Monaco has also joined the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action with a view to making progress in implementing economic and financial policies supporting the global transition to a low-carbon economy. Beyond measures at the national level, Monaco will be taking its full share of responsibility with regard to the collective goal of mobilizing $100 billion annually between now and 2025 for climate action in developing countries. In that regard, the Principality will participate in the first replenishment of the Green Climate Fund.\nMonaco is committed to the nature-based solutions coalition with a view to maximizing the major contribution of natural capital to climate action. Climate change and the collapse of biodiversity, far from being isolated crises, are two alarming symptoms of the anthropocene age that we must respond to together. Based on that belief, the Government of Monaco is committed to attaching the same degree of importance to the preservation of biodiversity and the fight against climate change. Starting in 2020, for example, Monaco will be increasing its international funding aimed at preserving and regenerating biodiversity, while mitigating and promoting adaptation to climate change and improving the resilience of vulnerable populations.\nThe protection of forests and the essential services that they do for human communities, especially as carbon sinks, is of course fundamental. That is why the recent devastating fires in various parts of the world constitute a real ecological disaster. It will also be crucial to preserve the seas and oceans, whose key role in climate balance and extreme vulnerability to global warming we have been made aware of thanks to advances in science. In that regard, the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was the subject of a meeting concluded yesterday in Monaco, is damning. It is therefore up to us to take full account of its conclusions and of the recommendations made by many scientists so that we can translate those findings into the political decisions we will take next year in the areas of climate change, conservation and the sustainable use of oceans and biological diversity. Monaco has historically chosen to support science. The fact is that it is essential that the policies we implement be based on the most reliable scientific knowledge possible.\nThe commitment of so many of us to standing with the Secretary-General is testament to our support for his leadership and our recognition of his unwavering commitment to the multilateralism that the United Nations embodies. Nevertheless, international institutions and civil servants, however dedicated, cannot be held responsible for our inaction or failure.\nWe are aware of the many challenges that we face, and we know perfectly well that we will either deal with them together or succumb to them individually. Our common future depends on regularly adapting our guiding light, which is the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Summit, which today launched an ambitious \u201cdecade of action\u201d, lists ten priority areas that we should focus our efforts on. In the Global Sustainable Development Report, scientists speak of a tipping point or critical point for certain ecosystems, which means that we are reaching a level of degradation from which there can be no return to a normally functioning state. The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2019, from the Secretary-General, and the Global Sustainable Development Report on the first cycle of SDG implementation, by the group of independent experts mandated by Member States, show that progress has been made in some key areas and that there have been promising developments, in particular the reduction of extreme poverty and a decline in the under-five mortality rate.\nHowever, despite those advances, the reports urge us to redouble our efforts urgently. The natural environment is deteriorating at an alarming rate. Sea levels are rising, ocean acidification is accelerating, the last four years have been the hottest on record and 1 million plant and animal species are threatened with extinction. At the same time, the number of people suffering from hunger continues to increase, more than half of the world\u2019s population still lacks essential health services and too many children still lack adequate reading and mathematics skills. That is why the direction I have set for my Government since 2005 combines the vision of a world that prioritizes progress and well-being with the implementation of activities to protect the environment, fight for peace, respect justice and sustainable development, defend the underprivileged and work for a more just and harmonious planet. In this way, every part of the Principality\u2019s Government action must adhere to the requirements of sustainable development. Economic progress must foster social progress while also respecting the environment.\nThe transition to a more sustainable way of life cannot be achieved without creating a more inclusive and fulfilling society for individuals. Women and girls therefore cannot be excluded from those efforts at a time when we are preparing to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. In October, in order to reaffirm its commitment to the defence of women\u2019s interests, my Government established a committee for the promotion and protection of women\u2019s rights. It is a deplorable fact that in today\u2019s world, our women, mothers and daughters are among the first victims of the wars and conflicts that continue to rage and are also particularly vulnerable when populations are forcibly displaced.\nThe fourth industrial revolution is under way. Artificial intelligence brings hope, but also poses risks that must be comprehensively addressed. The digital revolution is leading us into a movement of creative destruction that is neither linear nor predetermined. We hold the keys to it and it is our responsibility to shape the way forward. We must seize the opportunities that arise, but we must also guard against threats caused by our societies\u2019 uncontrolled development, particularly where security and worsening inequality are concerned. The speed, scale and scope of the changes that have already begun should encourage us to lay the foundations for dialogue.\nIn the face of those challenges, Monaco has reached a technological turning point and launched a digital transformation that is both an economic necessity and a way to honour our commitments in the area of sustainable development. The launch in April of our Extended Monaco programme has put us on the road to a digital transition of unprecedented scale, while giving particular emphasis to the concepts of responsibility and sustainability. As part of its digital transition strategy, the Government therefore plans to use the assets that technological innovation offers in the fields of health, education and the economy, as well as to make Monaco a model for smart cities.\nIn an interconnected world, the spirit of good neighbourliness mentioned in the Charter of the United Nations and to which \u201cnations large and small\u201d must adhere should take on special meaning. That is the path to follow in a world where we have all become each other\u2019s neighbours and where notions of time and space have become more relative. We owe our capacity to transcend adversity and establish norms for managing our interdependencies to the multilateral institutions that we have created, and the sovereignty of all of our States will emerge the stronger from that.\nAs we follow one another onto this rostrum, we are beginning the countdown to the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations in 2020. This Hall has seen so many debates, confrontations, promises and advances, and yet so many dashed hopes as well. But we are still here, because when we adopted the Charter, we decided to pool our efforts to achieve these goals \u2014 saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, proclaiming our faith in the dignity and worth of the human person and promoting better standards of life in larger freedom.\nOver the past three decades in this General Assembly Hall we have travelled together along a path that is certainly strewn with pitfalls, but we have nevertheless taken important steps. We have adopted, amended and corrected many texts and created mechanisms, processes and frameworks for addressing new challenges. From disarmament to human rights, from the preservation of the environment to major pandemics and from the fight against terrorism to social development, our strength has always resided in our unity and ability to compromise when we are dealing with the best interests of the peoples for whom our Organization was founded. Paradigm shifts and the funding that they require are beyond the reach of individual Member States, but they are not impossible if we strive for them in solidarity in the service of humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me pleasure, at the outset, to sincerely congratulate the President and his country, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I reiterate my country\u2019s support and full confidence in his able leadership of the Assembly towards achieving the desired goals.\nI also his predecessor, Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her valued efforts during her presidency of the Assembly at the last session.\nI also express my deepest appreciation to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his concrete efforts to solidify the foundations of security and stability and to attain the noble objectives of the Organization in all domains. In that respect, I commend the multiple and important initiatives launched by the Secretary-General, notably the initiative to combat violence based on religion, the United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech and the initiative on protection of sacred sites throughout the world.\nUnder the leadership of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain and with the support of the Prime Minister, His Royal Highness Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, as well as the Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander and First Deputy Prime Minister, His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the robust and growing partnership between the Kingdom of Bahrain and the United Nations and its specialized agencies has produced successive accomplishments, illustrated by the initiatives and steps taken by the Kingdom of Bahrain towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, notably the signing of the Strategic Partnership Framework Agreement between Bahrain and the United Nations, which is the first of its kind in the region.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain also has maintained its position in the very high human development category, as reflected in the report Human Development Indices and Indicators: 2018 Statistical Update. In May, the World Health Organization (WHO) honoured His Royal Highness Prince Khalifa Bin Salman Al Khalifa and granted him the Global Leader in Health Care award, the first-ever such award in the history of the Organization, thereby confirming the high esteem of His Royal Highness and reflecting the international community\u2019s recognition of the role played by the Kingdom of Bahrain in achieving the goals set by WHO.\nWe were also immensely pleased by the General Assembly\u2019s adoption of resolution 73/329, which declared 5 April as the International Day of Conscience, on the initiative of His Royal Highness the Prime Minister.\nThe election of Ms. Fawzia Zainal as Speaker of the House of Representatives is one of the proudest achievements of Bahraini women in recent decades. She is the first woman to hold that high position in the country\u2019s history, following parliamentary elections with a high turnout of 67 per cent. The turnout was the result of the reformed approach of His Majesty the King, which embodies the strength of democracy, the steadfastness of our popular will, the level of social awareness and the keen interest of our people to serve their national duties.\nThose achievements were also coupled with a great emphasis on education. A few weeks ago, my country celebrated the centenary of its formal education system, becoming a high performing country in its pursuit to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, according to UNESCO\u2019s Education for All Global Monitoring Report.\nIn its development endeavours, the Kingdom of Bahrain is committed to promoting rights and freedoms and has maintained its advanced position in the area of combating trafficking in persons for the second time in a row. My country occupies a tier one ranking among the most successful countries in that regard, based on a report by the United States Department of State, thereby becoming the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to attain such status. My country has also been elected as a member of the Human Rights Council for the period 2019 to 2021, for the third time in its history.\nThe two main objectives on the international community\u2019s agenda and at the heart of our discussions today are the achievement of peace and the elimination of terrorism. We are all deeply convinced that what happens in any part of the world inevitably affects us all, as proven by the crises that have taken place in many countries, such as the Syrian Arab Republic, the Republic of Yemen and Libya. The instability afflicting those countries has led to a weakening or complete collapse of State institutions.\nThat instability has also exacerbated the problem of migrants and refugees and provided fertile ground conducive to the emergence of various terrorist groups that are supported by both States and non-State groups. Those terrorist groups pose a threat to the security of the region and the stability of its peoples, thereby making collective action an urgent necessity in order for peace to prevail. That can happen only by abiding by the Charter of the United Nations and its purposes of non-interference in the internal affairs of States, as well as a commitment to good neighbourliness, mutual respect, the peaceful settlement of crises and upholding United Nations resolutions in order to preserve the sovereignty of States and their national institutions, as well as their unity and territorial integrity, and to safeguard the dignity and stability of their peoples. Most important among those resolutions are those related to the Palestinian question, which must be dealt with first and foremost as a political issue, one that is related to occupation, sovereignty, land and rights. It should not affect relations between peoples or provoke clashes among religions, nor should it impede positive and constructive interaction among them.\nIn order to achieve peace, the international community must fulfil its responsibilities by obliging Israel to abide by international resolutions. Israel must halt its policies of annexation and its unlawful confiscation of land, as well as its violations of international law and efforts to obstruct the realization of a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian question. Such a solution would enable the creation of an independent Palestinian State within the borders of 4 June 1967 and with East Jerusalem as its capital, based on the two-State solution stipulated in the Arab Peace Initiative and the relevant international resolutions.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain will spare no effort in striving to enable the peoples of the region, especially the brotherly Palestinian people, to grow, prosper and enjoy a better future across all spheres. In June, my country hosted a workshop on peace and prosperity in partnership with the friendly United States of America, representing a qualitative effort and an important initiative to promote development and provide a better life for the peoples of the region.\nIn view of the keen interests of the Kingdom of Bahrain to support security and stability, we wish to emphasize our solidarity with the continuous efforts being made by the sisterly Kingdom of Morocco to reach a political solution to the issue of the Moroccan Sahara, in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions and in the context of the Kingdom of Morocco\u2019s sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity. We commend the outstanding efforts by the Secretary-General to resolve that issue, as well as his efforts to establish security and stability in the Syrian Arab Republic, which culminated in the recent formation of the Constitutional Committee, which we hope will contribute to finding the desired political solution in Syria.\nWe also reiterate our support for the sisterly Republic of the Sudan in adopting measures with a view to achieving development and prosperity and enhancing security and stability there. We welcome the formation of the Transitional Government, headed by His Excellency Mr. Abdalla Hamdok. We support the demands to remove the Sudan from the list of State sponsors of terrorism so that it can collaborate with economic institutions with a view to transcending this important and delicate phase in its history. This is about our vision of peace.\nThere is another challenge on which we focus, namely, terrorism. As the Assembly is aware, this threat has taken on unprecedented forms in the history of countries, putting our world into a difficult period of instability. That has been shown by the decades-long terrorism perpetrated by Iran. The Iranian regime and its terrorist Revolutionary Guard has a bleak record of violating international instruments and resolutions, whether it be through establishing and supporting terrorist militias, attempts to provoke chaos and sedition and interfere in the internal affairs of many States in the region \u2014 including the Kingdom of Bahrain \u2014 or its unjust occupation of the three Emirati islands of the United Arab Emirates, namely, Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, and the direct threats emanating from that ongoing occupation.\nWe wish to reiterate that, in collaboration with our brothers in the Arab coalition to support legitimacy in Yemen \u2014 under the leadership of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \u2014 we will continue to pursue efforts to save Yemen and restore security and stability to the country. We urge all Yemeni national parties to unite their efforts with those of their legitimate Government in order to confront the Iranian-backed Houthi militias and all other terrorist groups, which threaten the security and stability of Yemen. That will allow for a peaceful resolution of the crisis, based on the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism, the outcomes of National Dialogue Conference and Security Council resolution 2216 (2015). That will also put an end to all forms of Iranian intervention, which are considered the main threat to the unity and territorial integrity of Yemen as well as its regional neighbourhood.\nWe would also like to commend the efforts of the Iraqi Government to confront the outlaw armed factions of the Iranian regime, which constitute a real threat not only to Iraq but also to the diplomatic missions in the country. They also constitute a threat to neighbouring countries and make Iraq a springboard for their terrorist targets.\nIt is no longer possible to overlook the dangerous role played by Hizbullah terrorists in spreading extremism and terrorism, inciting hatred and serving the Iranian agenda designed to perpetuate tensions and crises in the region. We underscore the need to deter that terrorist party and eliminate its danger from our region.\nSupport for transnational terrorism from the Iranian regime created networks of terrorist organizations and extremist militias in numerous regions around the world, such as Syria, Yemen, North Africa, countries of the Sahel and the Sahara and South America, among others. That compels us to step up our efforts and enhance collective cooperation to eliminate them once and for all. In that context, we applaud once again the firm approach adopted by the friendly United States of America to counteract Iran and its proxies in the region by exerting maximum pressure and imposing severe sanctions on them. We reiterate our support for drying up the sources of terrorism and putting an end to the destructive policies of the Iranian regime.\nInternational energy supplies and maritime navigation in the Arabian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz and the region as a whole face grave dangers due to the behaviour of the Iranian regime as it repeatedly targets commercial vessels in that region. For nearly 35 years, countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council have been drawing the attention of the international community to that threat. We appealed to the Security Council, which adopted resolution 552 (1984), on Iranian aggression against commercial vessels in the Arabian Gulf. However, Iranian terrorism continues unabated to this day, and in a more dangerous manner, posing a threat to a region of strategic importance for international peace and security and for the stability of the world economy.\nWe reiterate our condemnation of the abject terrorist aggression that targeted oil facilities in the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for which Iran is responsible. That aggression represented a grave threat to global oil supplies and the world\u2019s economy. We reaffirm our unwavering and total support for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which represents the main pillar of stability in the region in all its actions to preserve security and stability. We request the international community, notably the Security Council, to shoulder its responsibilities in maintaining international peace and security and to take a firm stance against Iran\u2019s repetitive criminal acts. We welcome the joint communique issued by the United Kingdom, the French Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany holding Iran responsible for that attack and reflecting the need to review the agreement concerning the Iranian nuclear programme, as it does not serve the purposes of peace and security in the region.\nConsistent with its sense of responsibility to establish stability in the region and the entire world, and in line with its historic role and commitment to joint action with its brothers, allies and international partners to address international and regional challenges, as well as combating terrorism and piracy in the Arabian Gulf, the Kingdom of Bahrain joined the International Maritime Security Construct at this critical and important period to safeguard the most important international strategic maritime lanes, which are vital for commerce and energy. In that vein, the Kingdom of Bahrain hosted an important international military meeting in July to discuss ways and means of intensifying international cooperation to enhance the security of the region. We are now preparing to host yet another international meeting in Manama next month on the safety of maritime and air navigation, in cooperation with the United States of America and Poland and with the participation of more than 60 countries. The meeting will be in follow-up to the international conference to support peace and security in the Middle East held in Warsaw last February.\nThe picture is now clear. Some priorities can no longer be delayed and must be addressed promptly. The two main objectives we seek to attain are achieving peace and eliminating terrorism. They require strong, collective work, support for all actions towards peace and a firm stand against countries that seek to perpetrate sabotage and use terrorism and violence to obstruct our Organization from achieving its desired goals.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain is this year celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the accession to the throne of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa \u2014 an era that began with reforms and inclusive renaissance as well as pioneering achievements at all levels in a State of law and institutions built on the cultural heritage of a society of coexistence with solid foundations guaranteeing rights and freedoms while seeking to promote peace among peoples and cultures. We reaffirm that the Kingdom of Bahrain will persevere in its balanced foreign policy of cooperation and interaction with all the countries of the world, based on an approach of collective action and joint defence with responsible States, respect for the principles on which the United Nations is founded, fruitful partnerships to achieve security and prosperity for all while living in a sound environment \u2014 an environment of common interests that allows our countries and nations to enjoy lasting security, sustainable development, progress and prosperity."

        "file_text": "I would like to begin this address to the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session by congratulating you, Sir, on your election as its President and by recognizing your wisdom in choosing the theme for this session, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d.\nPreparations will soon begin for the celebration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, a great assembly of all the peoples of the world that was born with the primary aim of preventing violent conflicts between countries after two devastating world wars. A few years after its birth, the United Nations expanded its scope and began to focus on improving people\u2019s living conditions, and if we review the themes of the last few sessions, we will realize that the issue of development has become a key element of the multilateral agenda. I say \u201cof the multilateral agenda\u201d, not just the agenda of the United Nations, because the 17 Sustainable Development Goals have the virtue of aligning the priorities and lines of action of various regional and sectoral forums. For example, the Principality of Andorra has assumed the Pro Tempore Secretariat of the Ibero-American Summit for two years under the slogan \u201cInnovation for sustainable development \u2014 Target 2030\u201d.\nReturning to the theme of this session of the General Assembly, the idea is to mobilize multilateral efforts in favour of development and sustainability in every area. In order to achieve sustainable development, joint action by all actors in society is essential. For that reason, Andorra recently adopted a national strategic plan for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, an inclusive document that will speed up our implementation of the Goals set forth by this Assembly.\nWithout an improvement in people\u2019s living conditions, any policy aimed at preventing violent conflict would be a weak one. In the words of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of this Organization from 1997 to 2006, \u201c[i]f war is the worst enemy of development, healthy and balanced development is the best form of conflict prevention\u201d. This notion of healthy and balanced development is what we now call \u201csustainable development\u201d. Similarly, sustainable development cannot be understood without the prior existence of just and peaceful societies. And there are no just and peaceful societies without effective respect for human rights. In that regard, Andorra once again reiterates its full support for the International Criminal Court as one of the main independent and impartial bodies fighting impunity for the most serious crimes. A year ago, we welcomed the expansion of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction over crimes of aggression, and we will continue to resolutely support the extension of its jurisdiction.\nPoverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion are the four objectives that probably best address the challenges that the international community is currently facing. The case of poverty is paradigmatic, because all our global challenges are related to it. Mass migrations and forced displacement are caused by extreme poverty and war; the consequences of global warming are felt with greater intensity in the poorest communities; the reach of digitization, which can be an opportunity to reduce inequalities and alleviate the lack of infrastructure in various parts of the world, varies greatly depending on the degree of development; and such persistent problems as violence, terrorism and violent extremism feed on poverty and marginality.\nThe second of the development goals that the President of the General Assembly has set as priorities is quality education. There is no question that there can be no better weapon for empowerment and overcoming poverty than expanding access to quality education. This is an issue that has been the focus of much of Andorra\u2019s action in multilateral forums over the past few years. That is undoubtedly because ours is a small country with few natural resources. A country that depends almost exclusively on the strength and talent of its people knows very well the positive impact that quality education can have. In Andorra three public, free and freely chosen education systems \u2014 French, Spanish and Andorran \u2014 have co-existed for three decades and have shaped a multilingual society prepared to cope with globalization. Andorrans are traditionally trilingual, as we speak Catalan, our own language, along with Spanish and French. Furthermore, we have long since incorporated English as an international language, and the large community of persons of Portuguese origin living in our country means that the Portuguese language is increasingly significant. It is not uncommon to find young people in our country capable of speaking five languages fluently, our own and four others, which opens doors for them to communicate with hundreds of millions of people around the world.\nMoreover, we understand that in order to face the challenges of an increasingly globalized world, we must make a firm commitment to education to create a democratic citizenry that respects human rights, cultural diversity and the environment. In recent years, Andorra has promoted inclusive educational policies aimed at providing our young people with the tools they need to develop their potential in a multicultural and global world. That is why today I reaffirm my country\u2019s commitment to working together with the international community to advance all the efforts we need to promote quality education as a tool that guarantees equal opportunities.\nAction on climate is a multilateral action par excellence. In a global world, no great challenge can be met without cooperation among countries, and no great goal can be achieved unilaterally. But while we can make significant progress in reducing inequalities or promoting education at the national level, it is utterly impossible to address the issue of climate change from a purely unilateral perspective, because the environmental policy of a single country, however ambitious it may be, is totally ineffective without action at on a global scale. An example that I know well is that global warming is a direct threat to the delicate ecological balance of a high-mountain country such as Andorra. It jeopardizes the long-term survival of the ski sector, which is one of the pillars of our economy. But no matter how hard we try, Andorrans alone cannot reverse that trend \u2014 not Andorra nor any other country, no matter how big or powerful.\nI realize that implementing effective measures to combat climate change can be difficult and costly, especially for the major industrial Powers. But major global challenges require major global commitments. If I may draw a parallel, I would like to remind the Assembly that 10 years ago a severe financial crisis forced us to lay the foundations for new international rules of the game, and many financial centres such as Andorra had to make great efforts to advance their transparency and cooperation in fiscal matters. It has not been an easy path for us or for any other small country similar to ours. But if we were able to commit to that task a decade ago and fulfil those commitments, the large industrialized countries should now also be able to deliver on the agreements we have all signed.\nThe world is urging us to act decisively and forcefully in the face of our climate emergency. Every Friday, hundreds of thousands of young people around the world are demanding that we safeguard their future \u2014 not their economic progress or the benefits of the welfare state, but their future in the most literal and basic sense, the very existence of human life on Earth.\nIt seems to me that we are at a critical juncture, when the debates on the scientific evidence of climate change have ended and the discussion about who has a greater responsibility to act has been set aside. We have a road map, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which was solemnly signed in this very Hall in April 2016. All that remains is therefore to implement the content of the Agreement at the national level, which, I would like to point out, is not an optimal agreement but a minimal one, with a scope that I am sure will have to be expanded in the future.\nOver the past two years, Andorra has begun to implement an ambitious plan to convert our development model into a sustainable one that contributes to limiting global warming. In our country, the two main sources of carbon-dioxide emissions are transportation and heating. That is why we have deployed a direct incentive plan to replace our car fleet with electric vehicles, implemented a ride-sharing programme and renovated our public transportation network to make it more sustainable. From 1 January next year, all buildings in Andorra must have virtually zero energy consumption. At the same time, we have launched an ambitious public and private investment plan to increase national electricity production, which currently covers only 20 per cent of the demand, with the aim of covering 33 per cent by 2030 and 50 per cent by 2050. On top of that, our goal is for at least 75 per cent of our own electricity production to come from renewable sources.\nThe Andorran Government also intends to forge partnerships with civil society in order to restructure linear production models into circular economy models that do not generate waste or negative externalities. Specifically, we want to engage private actors to demonstrate that sustainability does not hinder economic development but rather provides an opportunity to drive new sectors of activity, expand the industries dedicated to recovery, repurposing and recycling, and generate wealth and jobs. It is not a question of having to choose between economic development and sustainability. We have moved beyond that. The point is to understand that in the long term the only possible economic development is sustainable development.\nWhen the theme for the Assembly at its seventy-fourth session was selected, we were also urged to mobilize multilateral efforts for inclusion. Unlike poverty reduction, quality education or climate action, inclusion is not in itself a Sustainable Development Goal but rather a goal that cuts across the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In my opinion, inclusion is even more important because it is inherent in the concept of sustainability \u2014 no action, policy or institutional order is sustainable if it is not inclusive. Inclusion is like trust. It is a kind of cement that holds societies together.\nMany of the countries represented in this Hall are representative democracies that are based on parliaments and executive branches that represent the diverse wishes of their citizens by channelling and structuring the will of individuals into Government programmes that respond to people\u2019s desires and needs. The General Assembly is the fullest expression at the international level of the idea of representative democracy because the activities of the United Nations also serve to channel and structure the intentions and lines of action of its various Member States. Yet that idea, the idea of representative democracy, is in danger and has been besieged by anti-democratic and populist movements that challenge multilateralism and appeal to underdeveloped direct democracies. The response to the crisis of the representativeness of institutions does not have to mean less representativeness or fewer institutions, but it does require institutions that are truly effective in responding to people\u2019s needs and in which people can see themselves reflected. Very often, those who most criticize institutions for being unrepresentative are precisely those who most weaken them through their actions.\nThe response to the crisis of representative and multilateral institutions does not have to be an anti-institutional reaction. Let us ask ourselves. Was the world a better place before the United Nations came into existence? Was Europe a better place before the existence of the European Union? Were our countries better off before national parliaments came to be? The answer is obvious. Given the institutional crisis, what we need is to improve our institutions, not further incapacitate them. Reforming or adapting democratic institutions to make them more representative is a challenge at both the national and global levels, and it has always been a challenge. This year, Andorra celebrates 600 years of the uninterrupted existence of the General Council, the Parliament that has represented the will of the Andorran people since 1419. Over those six centuries, our institutions have made many changes to better reflect the reality of our country. Some changes have taken hundreds of years, while others have evolved much faster. Only 25 years ago, just one of the 28 members of our Parliament was a woman. Today half of Andorra\u2019s parliamentarians are women.\nOur history shows that institutions endure better when they are flexible rather than rigid. That is why we support the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative implementing a double reform of the United Nations, making it both more flexible and more effective. We also have a road map to measure our effectiveness. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals would address most of the concerns and aspirations of the vast majority of the world\u2019s inhabitants.\nOne of the great challenges of our time is to respond to the many people who feel excluded from representative democratic institutions and development processes. In Andorra we are working to promote inclusion. We are implementing our recently enacted law on equality and we are working on a law on effective equality between men and women, which directly and constantly combats the wage gap and glass ceilings, since the workplace is the real battleground for equality and inclusion, not only for women but also for traditionally disadvantaged groups such as people with disabilities or young people who have not completed secondary school.\nDespite a unilateral and nationalist retreat in various parts of the world, the real response to the great questions of our time is effective and inclusive multilateralism \u2014 effective, so that we can move forward on a path of sustainable development on the economic, social and environmental fronts, and inclusive, because progress that works for only a few becomes unsustainable and the institutions that represent the will of only a few become weak. Andorra, committed to a path towards peace, harmony and integrated diversity, will always support the United Nations in building a multilateral order that ensures sustainable development and inclusion.\n"

        "file_text": "I warmly congratulate the President on his election and wish him every success in steering the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I also thank his predecessor for her contribution to our joint efforts. And I again encourage the Secretary-General to continue his efforts in support of Member States.\nWe are called upon at this session of the General Assembly to energize multilateral efforts to eradicate poverty, promote high-quality education, take action against climate change and foster inclusion. Those challenges are major and topical. But for the millions of victims of war and terrorism, the main challenge is existential: that of living in peace and security.\nIn the Sahel, terrorist groups continue to sow death on a daily basis, causing thousands of people to become refugees or displaced persons and destroying basic social services. As a troop contributor to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), Senegal stands in solidarity with the members of the Group of Five for the Sahel and the partners of the Alliance for the Sahel.\nBecause threats transcend borders, they should not be addressed in a fragmented manner. Peace, security and stability in the Sahel are part and parcel of peace, security and stability in the world. In accordance with the conclusions of the Extraordinary Summit of the Economic Community of West African States on the issue of combating terrorism, held on 14 September, Senegal remains committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries such as Mali against any separatist intent. We call on the Security Council to provide MINUSMA with a robust mandate and adequate equipment to combat terrorism in the Sahel.\nTerrorism is the absolute negation of humanity and must be fought in all its forms and manifestations. That is why our country has joined the initiative launched by France and New Zealand in Paris in May \u2014 the Christchurch Call to Action to Eliminate Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content Online \u2014 following the 15 March attack on the Christchurch Muslim community. We must firmly reject populist rhetoric, which manipulates minds, fosters hatred and, ultimately, trivializes racism, xenophobia and violent extremism.\nIn contrast, African wisdom extols peaceful coexistence and respect for diversity, through conciliatory efforts establishing a regime of openness and peace, where every human being lives in peace with themselves and with their neighbours. According to this wisdom, a rainbow owes its beauty to the various hues of its colours. That also means that peace is also diversity, that there can be no superior hub of civilization that would dictate to others how to be and act and that all cultures and civilizations are equal in dignity. Senegal has therefore decided to erect the Goree Memorial to commemorate the dark days of slavery and for the peaceful coexistence of peoples in respect for their diversity.\nThe state of peace that inspires the ideals of the United Nations is certainly more compatible with the human condition than the state of war. But peace is not just the absence of war. It is also the state of mind that soothes and makes accommodations. In that spirit, Senegal strongly calls for reconciliation between Palestinians and Israelis and for the fulfilment of the right of the Palestinian people to a viable State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side by side with the State of Israel in peace and within safe and internationally recognized borders.\nDialogue is the essence of the United Nations \u2014 our common house. On the ashes of war, this house was built to improve multilateralism, which is conducive to cooperation and peaceful coexistence among peoples. In the face of global threats and the challenges that transcend the nation-State, this Organization is where our concerns are expressed and where our ideas and proposals intersect to solve our common problems. This is where our hopes for compromise converge to achieve our shared goals, as called for by the Charter of the United Nations.\nFaith in multilateralism thrives only in compliance with agreed rules and commitments. When those rules and commitments are challenged, that faith is shaken and the ideals of United Nations are undermined. As a result, Senegal reaffirms its commitment to multilateralism and a reformed and inclusive governance for a more equitable representation of Africa in the Security Council.\nIn my capacity as Chair of the Steering Committee of the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development, I welcome the dynamic of partnerships, old and new, with Africa. We support another vision of relations with the continent \u2014 free of prejudice and based on renewed partnerships that are mutually beneficial. Africa does not need stewardship. Africa needs partnerships.\nWe want fairer trade that does not exaggerate the perceived risk of investing in the continent, pays fair prices for raw materials, protects both host-country rights and investor interests and promotes the creation of local value chains. We call for a reform of the international tax system, so that taxes are paid where an activity creates wealth and profit, and for stronger action against tax evasion and avoidance, money-laundering and other illicit financial flows, which cost Africa more than $100 billion a year.\nWe call for the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, including the target of $100 billion per year in support of energy transition and climate-change adaptation. We call for the fulfilment of the commitments made at the third Global Partnership for Education Financing Conference, held in Dakar in February 2018, to mobilize $3 billion over three years for education and training.\nMore inclusive global governance, more balanced trade, international taxation reform and the fulfilment of commitments \u2014 those are, in Africa\u2019s view, the real challenges of multilateralism today. They are the real challenges that we must tackle together if we are to energize multilateral efforts to eradicate poverty, promote quality education, address climate change and foster inclusion.\nIn doing so the destiny of the people lies first and foremost in their hands, which is why Senegal is pursuing with determination its 2035 development objective through the Emerging Senegal Plan. During the first phase of the Plan, between 2014 and 2018, we carried out several development-infrastructure projects through public investment. The second phase, spanning the period 2019 to 2023, was launched in December 2018 and includes a priority action plan with a sharper focus on private investment in such strategic sectors as agriculture, livestock and fisheries, transport infrastructure and services, energy, education, training and the digital economy, health, hotel and tourism infrastructure, and housing, including a five-year programme to build 100,000 homes. Those efforts have gone hand in hand with the streamlining of public administration and spending and with better mobilization of internal resources.\nAt the same time, we have been translating the Senegal for All vision into public policies on social inclusion and territorial equity, including the emergency community-development programme, with its components on water, electricity, access roads and equipment for rural women; universal health coverage; the national family-security grants programme for the most vulnerable groups; and the Fast-Track Entrepreneurship Delegation for women and youth.\nIn the light of the ideal of peace and human brotherhood that brings us together in this Hall, Senegal is delighted to host the ninth World Water Forum, to be held in 2021, and the fourth Youth Olympic Games, to take place in 2022 and the first in Olympic history to take place on the African continent. We hope that those two events will contribute to strengthening peace and fraternity among peoples and to building a better, more welcoming world for all. We invite the entire United Nations family to attend.\nI wish the General Assembly every success at this session.\n"

As the smallest nation State ever to accomplish that historic feat, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines gives assurance to all small States that they too can sit as equals among much larger, richer and more powerful Member States and ensure that their voices are heard on matters affecting global interests and security.\nI want to convey my warmest greetings to everyone here from the grateful people of the Commonwealth of Dominica. We are profoundly thankful for all the attention and support from the Organization and its Member States and specialized agencies in the aftermath of the massive devastation inflicted on us by the category 5 Hurricane Maria in September 2017. Two years ago, when Dominica lay in ruins after being ravaged by Maria, our Prime Minister, Mr. Roosevelt Skerrit, stood at this rostrum a mere five days later to address the Assembly and indicated his resolve to set Dominica on a path to becoming the first climate-resilient nation in the world. Our Climate Resilience Recovery Plan is nearing completion, our new implementing agency is fully operational and the work of building resilience has begun. Thousands of homes have been repaired or rebuilt and hundreds more are contracted to be built. New resilient housing units are being constructed all over the island. The public utilities have all been restored. All children have been back in school since January 2018, although some schools still have to be rebuilt. The road network has been vastly improved, and most of the damaged or destroyed bridges have been repaired or are being rebuilt to higher standards. The rivers and watercourses have been dredged and the greenery has returned to our hills, valleys and mountains.\nPractically everyone visiting Dominica in recent times has described the country\u2019s transformation after Maria as miraculous, and indeed it is. But we acknowledge that we have not done it alone. We are doing it together. The global community, including non-governmental organizations and faith-based organizations, many of which are still hard at work in Dominica as I speak, is playing its part. All of Dominica says thanks, and we recognize that we owe the global community an everlasting debt of gratitude. We also hasten to say that the task is far from complete. Building resilience is a momentous and expensive task. One of the deficiencies of the international system is the long gestation period between pledges and commitments and the delivery on those promises. We urge those who have pledged to support us in creating this new, climate-resilient nation to deliver. Time is of the essence.\nAs we meet, more and more evidence is emerging that a new chapter is being written by the forces of nature, and the evidence is right before our eyes. That chapter speaks to the catastrophic effects of climate change, and as we are deliberating this week, many countries are reeling from its devastating effects. For many island States, and particularly the smallest, the message being sent is that rising sea levels, violent tropical storms and hurricanes, periods of severe drought alternating with floods and forest fires, new plant diseases, and vector-borne diseases such as chikungunya and Zika present an existential threat. The time for action is now.\nCompetent scientific authorities are now advising that the rate of global warming is progressing faster than was originally believed. The effects of climate change are cross-cutting, affecting every sector and every facet of life on earth. Despite the commitments they have made to take action to slow the rate of global warming, too many countries continue to pursue the same policies that are contributing to nature\u2019s angry response to our overindulgence and reckless exploitation of our planet\u2019s resources. If the devastating effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria did not convince us in 2017, we can look to the calamity of Hurricane Dorian in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas just a few weeks ago. Dominica stands in solidarity with the people of Abaco and Grand Bahama, two of the island communities of the Bahamas archipelago whose lives and livelihoods have been devastated by the destructive forces of the category 5 Hurricane Dorian, which inflicted total destruction and considerable loss of life.\nAs experts predicted, such tropical storms are becoming more frequent and more intense, and sea temperatures are rising. What they did not predict is that a storm of such ferocity could virtually sit over an island, wreaking incalculable havoc for some 40 hours. We are left with no choice but to accept that category 5 hurricanes may become the new norm. We therefore have to go back to the drawing board to reassess national approaches to risk mitigation and disaster preparedness.\nIt is not only on small island States, however, that climate change is having an impact. We are seeing heart-wrenching reports and disturbing images of flooded cities and severe droughts that are driving millions from their traditional homes and occupations. The results are homelessness, starvation and mental anguish. Soon the phenomenon of climate refugees will also be a new norm. Then there is the problem of forest fires, not just in Brazil and the Amazon but here in the United States, in Europe and in the Far East. When fire strikes a neighbourhood, we do not hold a meeting to determine whether our neighbours are insured. We call out the fire brigade. That is what we need now \u2014 urgent action. Our planet is on fire and we must take immediate steps to quell it.\nDominica reaffirms its commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and once again pleads for the resources pledged to be released, so that we can implement actions designed to reduce risks and mitigate the impacts of climate change. We applaud the leadership shown by the Government of the United Kingdom in assisting countries such as Dominica in building greater resilience to the effects of climate change. We thank the nations that have recently committed to doubling their pledges and increasing contributions to the Green Climate Fund, as well as to making further resources available to small island developing States to help us adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change. However, the issues of accessibility and timely disbursement of funds must be addressed if our urgent needs are to be met.\nIn pursuit of its vision of becoming the world\u2019s first climate-resilient nation, we have prepared a national resilience development strategy, which is a broad framework providing a road map and guidelines to enable Dominica to reach climate resilience by 2030. The targets, and our plans to achieve them, are articulated in greater detail and precision in the sector strategies. The strategy is a live document that will be adjusted and updated every four years, based on annual monitoring and evaluation exercises and on data emerging from new studies and surveys.\nFollowing Hurricane Maria, which caused damage and loss estimated at 226 per cent of our gross domestic product, urgent priority was assigned to rebuilding the country and to building back better. However, experience had taught us that a new approach to project management and implementation had to be adopted if our intended targets were to be met in a timely manner. To help us to overcome that potential challenge, in 2018 the Government established an execution agency to enable Dominica to develop its Climate Resilience Recovery Plan, coordinate reconstruction work and facilitate the smooth and efficient implementation of projects. My Government is most appreciative of the support provided by the bilateral partners who worked with us in setting up the execution agency, and we are especially grateful to the British Government, operating through the Department for International Development, to Canada and to the World Bank for their support in its establishment and operation.\nDominica is by any measure an insignificant contributor to greenhouse-gas emissions. Notwithstanding that, we believe our actions must match the spirit of the climate conventions we have signed. We have therefore developed a low-carbon, climate-resilient development strategy that emphasizes the development and use of renewable energy both to fuel our development and as a means of earning export revenue. Our recently completed resilient and sustainable energy plan confirms that Dominica is in a position to generate about 90 per cent of the country\u2019s electricity needs by 2029 using renewable, primarily geothermal, sources; realize a reduction in the annual cost and volume of diesel fuel used for electricity generation by 94 per cent; and reduce the total cost of generating electricity between 2020 and 2038 by at least 44 per cent.\nSerious initiatives to exploit the country\u2019s geothermal potential began in 2008, with financial support coming mainly from the European Union and the Government of France. Following extensive geothermal exploration, it was confirmed in 2012 that the reservoir in the Roseau Valley, the subject of exploration, had a potential of 120 megawatts, which would not only satisfy domestic needs but could potentially produce electricity for export to the neighbouring French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, thereby reducing their carbon footprint as well. That painstaking work, conducted over six years, is an example of the arduous effort involved in developing a renewable resource such as geothermal power in order to reduce the associated risks and cause a bankable project to emerge. Notwithstanding fiscal challenges along the way, the Government stuck to its commitment to providing initial funding for the project. As the project stands today, a financing package totalling $27 million has been signed with the World Bank for the construction of an initial 7 megawatt geothermal plant. Construction will most likely begin early in the new year.\nDominica, like all the CARICOM countries, is committed to the principle of preserving the Caribbean as a zone of peace. It is inevitable that from time to time differences will arise between and among various interest groups within a State. While we will always be available to act as mediators in resolving internal conflicts, we believe in and will forever adhere to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. We hold that to be a universal principle, not one to be selectively employed and discarded when ideological differences arise. Wherever there are uneasy tensions among States and differences in interpretations of the Constitution within a State that trigger civil unrest, we call for restraint and resorting to the negotiations table and dialogue to resolve such differences. The other options only serve to prolong and intensify human misery and suffering and violate the principles on which this august body was founded.\nThe climate is at war with our States Members. Let us not aggravate the situation by creating hostility and war among ourselves, particularly in this hemisphere.\nWe support the One China policy and call for dialogue to achieve the peaceful reunification of China. We support dialogue and negotiations to bring about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. We support dialogue and negotiations to resolve the disputes in the Middle East, including the possibility of a nuclear arms race.\nWe once again call for an end to the unjustified continued economic blockade against Cuba in order to free up the vast potential of the Cuban people so that they can take up their rightful role in the global economy and trade system. We also call for an end to the unilateral sanctions imposed against Venezuela, which we believe are serving no useful purpose and rather serve to cause misery and suffering to the Venezuelan people. We continue to call for dialogue and for countries to support peaceful mediation among the disputing parties within Venezuela to achieve an outcome that will serve the best interests of all Venezuelans.\nLet us all adhere to the provisions of Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations, particularly in this hemisphere, where we should aspire to become a zone of peace and development.\n"

        "file_text": "First, I wish to thank the General Assembly for the honour bestowed on the Government and the people of Nigeria by electing our national, His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, to the presidency of the General Assembly at it seventy-fourth session. It is indeed a great honour to our country. Nigerians are truly grateful and shall endeavour to live up to the expectations and responsibilities thrust upon us. Ambassador Muhammad-Bande is an experienced and seasoned diplomat, and I am confident that he will prove to the international community that he is most suitable for this most demanding assignment.\nLet me also offer my sincere thanks to the outgoing President, Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her skill, resourcefulness and bottomless reservoir of patience in piloting the seventy- third session of the General Assembly. In the same vein, may I commend the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his tremendous energy and the genuine international outlook exhibited in his leadership of the United Nations.\nThe theme of the current session of the General Assembly is \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d. These are prime areas calling for collective action that will benefit national and global interests.\nToday the world is at a critical juncture. This year marks the first anniversary of the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace. This year also marks the centenary of the founding of the League of Nations, which led eventually to the establishment of the United Nations as a part of the post-Second World War international order.\nArticle I, paragraph 4 of the Charter of the United Nations calls for the Organization to be \u201ca centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends\u201d, which include international peace and security, prosperity and social justice, respect for human dignity and protection of the environment. Multilateralism, symbolized by the United Nations system, has brought immense benefits to the people of the world. It has saved lives, prevented wars, restored peace and stability and generated economic and social progress in many countries.\nWe must admit that as the world grows richer there are regrettable signals in the world economic and political order. Millions in Africa and around the world remain in abject poverty. Furthermore, we are witnessing a backlash against multilateralism in the form of a rising tide of racism, xenophobia, resurgent nationalism, populism and tendencies towards protectionism and unilateralism. The pristine principles of the United Nations, I fear, are threatened.\nUpon the cessation of hostilities after the Second World War, the United States, in one of the greatest selfless undertakings in history, decided to revive Europe through the Marshall Plan and to lift up and restore Japan economically. Those generous policies catalysed a great global economic revival that not only benefited Europe and Japan but the United States as well, through vastly improved trade and cross- investment. The United States and Europe have become friends and allies since the end of the war. The United States and Japan have also become friends and allies.\nThose examples can be replicated with respect to Africa. A developed Africa will not be antagonistic to industrialized countries but will become their friends and partners in prosperity, security and development. A prosperous Africa will mean greater prosperity for the rest of the world. A poor Africa would be a drag on the rest of the world. Is that what the international community wants?\nA coordinated multilateral effort should be set in motion to utilize and maximize the use of the enormous resources on the African continent for the benefit of all nations. Investment partners will be able to recoup their investment overtime. Current attempts by industrialized countries to help develop Africa are uncoordinated and plainly incremental. We have the skills, the manpower and the natural resources but in many instances lack the capital, hence my plea for industrialized countries to take a long-term view of Africa. We request them to come and partner with us to develop the continent for the benefit of all. Africa charges them with the singular task of initiating the effort we are calling for.\nThe United Nations has processes in place for promoting collective action to combat global threats. No threat is more potent than poverty and exclusion, which are the power source from which common criminality, insurgency, cross-border crimes, human trafficking and its terrible consequences draw their inspiration. Poverty in all its manifestations remains one of the greatest challenges facing our world. Its eradication is an indispensable requirement for achieving sustainable development.\nIn that regard, Nigeria has developed a national social investment programme that works as a key that targets the poorest and most vulnerable households in the country. Under that initiative, easy access to financial services is provided to traders, artisans, market women and cooperative societies. That type of initiative can help lessen and eventually eliminate mass poverty in Africa. At the core of our efforts to build an inclusive society are other programmes that focus on youth and human empowerment and aim to ensure the participation of women and youth in governance, industry, climate action and agriculture.\nOn the international scene, the United Nations has new opportunities to take the lead on issues that continue to cloud the prospects for international peace and prosperity, in particular with regard to the right of the Palestinian people to have their own country free of occupation. From resolution 242 (1967) to the present day, the international community has spoken on the right of the Palestinian people to have their own land and live in peace in it.\nSeparately, I would mention the risks associated with nuclear proliferation and unfair, unjust trade practices, notwithstanding World Trade Organization rules and precepts.\nWith respect to the looming danger of climate change, Nigeria stands resolutely with the international community as we observe the agreed carbon emission targets that I signed in 2015. We have since issued two sovereign green bonds and have added an additional 1 million hectares of forested land, taking our total forest coverage to 6.7 per cent through collective national efforts.\nAs we advocate and strive for inclusion within our societies, we must also ensure, as members of the international community, our participation in collective action, which is why we support the expansion of the Security Council to reflect the diversity and dynamics of the twenty-first century.\nFrom Asia to the Middle East and from Africa to South America, violence and the threat of conflict continue to imperil the lives of too many people. Our own country is no exception. Nigeria is a nation of nearly 200 million people made up of many diverse groups. Our diversity is a source of our strength, which is why in the elections this year our people backed the forces of tolerance, inclusion and community over the politics of protest and division. Our election promises emphasized political stability, freedom and prosperity, tackling poverty, schooling our young and providing them with the tools to build better lives. We are placing special emphasis on the role of women in our female-gender advancement programmes. Our progress and delivery are deliberate, purposeful and measured.\nWe clearly appreciate that there are no quick fixes to complex challenges. In particular, the challenge of education in Africa is enormous. On 3 December 2018, the General Assembly adopted resolution 73/25, which proclaimed 24 January as the International Day of Education. The resolution, which was spearheaded by Nigeria and co-sponsored by 58 other States Members, marked a watershed in the recognition of the fundamental role of education in building modern societies.\nIn order to ensure access to education for all, our Government has introduced the Home Grown School Feeding Programme to address the challenge faced by out-of-school children and children who have been forced out of school. That social intervention programme is aimed at encouraging increased school enrolment through the provision of free school meals. The benefits extend beyond the school environment. In addition, we have introduced mainstreaming and the implementation of safe schools declaration laws and policies across all educational institutions in Nigeria.\nThe world was shocked and startled by the massacre in New Zealand by a lone gunman taking the lives of 50 worshippers. That and similar crimes, which have been fuelled by social media networks, risk seeping into the fabric of an emerging digital culture. Major technology companies must be aware of their responsibilities. They cannot be allowed to continue to facilitate the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages capable of inciting whole communities against one another, leading to the loss of many lives. That could tear some countries apart.\nOrganized criminal networks, often acting with impunity across international borders, present new challenges in response to which only collective action can deliver genuine results. That is also true of the battle against violent extremism, the battle against trafficking in people and drugs and the battle against corruption and money-laundering. The current Nigerian Government is facing the challenges of corruption head-on. We are giving notice to international criminal groups through the vigorous prosecution of the scam by the firm of Process and Industrial Development in its attempt to cheat Nigeria out of billions of dollars.\nAs a young man and a soldier, I witnessed first- hand the terrible legacy of destruction and broken lives that conflict leaves in its wake. As the seventy- fifth anniversary of the end of the Second World War approaches, I wish to pay tribute to the sacrifices made by the many millions of people across the globe in defence of freedom, tolerance and the rule of law. In Nigeria, we have made significant strides to put our own house in order. We will work tirelessly to uphold due process. The rule of law remains the permanent, unchanging foundation of the world order. Freedom, tolerance and the rule of law are universal values and underline the best that the General Assembly represents and that binds us all.\nIn conclusion, I reaffirm Nigeria\u2019s commitment to promoting international peace and security and sustainable development. We are also committed to strengthening partnerships and cooperation with international and regional organizations for the benefit of humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me pleasure to address the General Assembly on behalf of Iraq, a founding Member of the United Nations. I wish the General Assembly every success at its current session, particularly as we note that our priorities in addressing the challenges of climate change, health care and sustainable development represent a constructive step that we hope to make towards finding common international ground in reaching the solutions that the planet and humankind need.\nSince its establishment, the United Nations has pursued the principle of partnership among nations to achieve the noble values that would lead to implementing its objectives, ensuring international peace and security, resolving conflicts peacefully and enshrining human rights as a superior value and ultimate purpose. The long journey of implementing these endeavours has been full of achievements at the international level, as well as obstacles and setbacks. Millions of people around the world still place their hopes in the Organization to enhance dialogue and enable mutual partnerships to address the crises of poverty, health care, education, security and development that continue to cast a heavy shadow over the world.\nI address the Assembly today at this important meeting to speak about the hopes of our people and their aspirations to confront and defeat terrorism by ensuring a life of freedom and dignity for our citizens, strengthening security, providing services and achieving economic growth and sustainable development not only in Iraq but throughout the Middle East.\nTerrorism has ravaged our country, which has gone through difficult and dangerous times. There were some who expected worse than that. The terrorist Da\u2019esh plan was an evil quest to destroy Iraq and the region. Our people and the armed forces \u2014 the army, the popular mobilization forces, the Peshmerga and others \u2014 made great sacrifices to secure freedom and resist terrorism, with the help and assistance of the international coalition and other friends, whom we thank and appreciate. History will testify that the Iraqis, through their unity, steadfast resolve and the significant role played by the higher religious authorities, have succeeded in defeating the takfiri plan and in protecting the world from its evil.\nIraq now is on the verge of important positive developments in the security, political and economic spheres. There is a positive trend of transformation in Iraq that we have not seen in years past \u2014 a trend that fills us with hope for a promising future. Given the current security and stability, we must assess and build on those positive developments, bearing in mind the suffering of Iraqis for 40 years owing to oppression, campaigns of genocide, such as the Anfal genocide, mass graves, the use of chemical weapons in Halabja, the draining of its marshes, environmental degradation, wars, siege, the ravages of terrorism, the destruction of infrastructure and corruption. Perhaps no other country has endured what Iraq suffered during that period. The stability achieved is an important accomplishment that must be preserved, not forsaken.\nWe also note the current positive climate in dealing with the accumulated problems between the federal Government and the Kurdistan Regional Government pursuant to the Constitution. We note the important role of the United Nations office in Baghdad, especially with regard to the issues of Kirkuk and the disputed areas, in helping us to find solutions commensurate with our Constitution.\nDespite what I have just said, challenges remain. The gains of our victory over the total elimination of terrorism still require regional and international cooperation to combat this dangerous scourge and to address the conditions that gave rise to an environment conducive to its growth and proliferation. Measures towards rebuilding the areas damaged by the war and ensuring the return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) are still at their early stages. There is an international role and responsibility in that regard, some features of which were determined during last year\u2019s Kuwait International Conference for the Reconstruction of Iraq, and we are striving to activate them with the assistance of our brothers and friends.\nWe must not allow ourselves to be distracted from the need to confront terrorism in all its manifestations. While a military victory against Da\u2019esh is important, we must be aware that there are still terrorist remnants who are trying to reorganize themselves. We also note the existence of dangerous terrorism and extremism hotspots in Syria and other States, not to mention the tensions and conflicts in the region, all of which constitute dangerous factors and create an environment that gives terrorism room to come back. Terrorism takes advantage of security and political vacuums. We must work together to fill those vacuums.\nThe Middle East region suffers conflicts and wars year after year. We must seriously unify our efforts in order to turn the areas of conflict into areas of renaissance. The ongoing tragic situation in Syria, coupled with an environment that is favourable to terrorism and extremism, requires effective efforts to allow Syrians to arrive at a permanent political solution that will achieve stability and security and guarantee the rights of Syrians to peace, security and freedom and enable them to determine their own future without any guardianship or interference.\nWe emphasize the need to work seriously to reach a just and comprehensive solution for the Palestinian question, in accordance with international resolutions and in a manner that guarantees the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. We reiterate our solidarity with the Palestinian people, their suffering and their legitimate right to establish their independent State on their territory. However, the recent announcements to annex the Jordan Valley and northern Red Sea are a blatant violation of international law and an exacerbating factor that will only prolong the crisis and deepen the wound that threatens the future of stability in the region and the world.\nThe continued war in Yemen is a source of great concern in the light of the security and humanitarian repercussions that are affecting the region. In view of those current dangers, supporting Yemenis in arriving at a comprehensive political solution that restores peace throughout the country is a necessity. Attempts to target the security of the Gulf and our sister country the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia constitute a dangerous development. We in Iraq are concerned by that tension and escalation. Our security is tied to the security of the Gulf and the region. The international community must offer serious assistance in containing such escalation, which could have disastrous repercussions on the security of the region and the world.\nThe situation in the region is dangerous and threatens to bring about disastrous consequences that we must contain. We have had enough wars. We do not need a new war in the region, especially since the most recent war on terrorism has not yet been settled definitively. Our position is firm: it is important to give precedence to dialogue over tension and escalation. That position is based on facts and a desire to defend the interests of the peoples of the region. We believe that combating terrorism and extremism and achieving economic transformation in order to offer work opportunities to our unemployed youth take precedence over current disagreements.\nThe solution starts with a comprehensive understanding based on the concepts of non-interference in the internal affairs of the countries of the region and mutual respect for their national sovereignty. It also lies in upholding the values of human rights. There is common ground between us that we all agree upon \u2014 we all desire a better tomorrow for our children. Let us work to calm the situation and work constructively. Despite the disagreements in the region, the stability of Iraq is of common interest to everyone and could be a launching pad from which to establish important common ground.\nThe absence of Iraq was a source of tension and instability throughout the region. Iraq is now recovering, and we are determined to move the country towards permanent stability. Iraq plays a pivotal role in the region and has many geopolitical, economic, cultural and religious considerations. Iraq is the cradle of our prophet Abraham, peace be upon him. Iraq has Muslim and Arab neighbours. It is a meeting point of great nations in the region, be they Arabs, Persians, Turks or Kurds. This mix of different components \u2014 Shiites and Sunnis, Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen, Muslims, Christians, Sabaeans, Yazidis and Shabaks \u2014 makes Iraq a contributing factor in help establish peace and understanding among countries. It also allows my country to be an active part of all efforts to undertake reconstruction, make progress and be innovative.\nFor a very long time, Iraq was a battleground for others. We and the region have paid a very high price because of the instability in Iraq. Our interests and those of the region make it imperative for Iraq to become a bridge to build understanding between its brothers and neighbours. From this rostrum, we emphasize our call to establish a joint security system in the region and a system of economic integration and political and security coordination so as to uproot terrorism and ensure stability.\nIraq\u2019s approach to the crises in the region is based on fundamental principles. We neither want our country to be part of any regional or international conflict nor an arena for settling regional and international scores. Our people have paid a high price for wars and conflicts, and Iraq will not be a part of any war against another party. We have had enough wars. We do not want a new war. We do not want any people to suffer the ravages of war, as we have suffered. Iraq will not be a launching pad for aggression against any of our neighbouring countries. We hope that our country will become an arena for building and stability, not for tension and conflict.\nOur interests and the security of the region are contingent upon a good neighbourly relationship between Iraq and its surrounding countries. Iraq\u2019s policy today is contrary to that of the former regime in terms of dealing with its neighbours militarily. Our relationship is strengthened by our common Arab and Gulf roots. We insist on growing those relationships and developing them as an important part of our stability and security. We also care about our relationship with our neighbour Iran, with whom we share cultural and religious ties, as well as mutual and cross-cutting interests. We care as well about our neighbour to the north, Turkey. We are making efforts to raise the level of bilateral relationships with those two neighbours in order to achieve more development in different spheres.\nA federal, democratic and stable Iraq will present a chance to join together all of our brothers and neighbours in the region and to enhance understanding and agreement among the countries of the region to create a regional system that is based on economic integration and common security.\nThe stability achieved in Iraq is valuable and important. We must not take it lightly; rather we must work on entrenching it. We expect our neighbours and the international community not to make Iraq pay for their own disagreements and conflicts. Our hands and hearts are open to all. We hope that there will be more understanding for Iraq\u2019s situation and for our desire to complete our victory over terrorism, rebuild what previous wars destroyed, return displaced persons to their homes and offer work opportunities to our young people.\nWe need a consensus both internationally and regionally in order to ensure continued stability and combat extremist ideologies and terrorism. However, the most important task at hand is that of enacting the reforms necessary to secure good governance for our citizens, combat corruption and offer our young people job opportunities. Those are urgent challenges that we are addressing, and we believe that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will be an important framework for our efforts. Advancing education, health care and sustainable development is the right way to put us on track towards combating extremist ideology and uprooting terrorism, by raising generations capable of building a better future.\nThroughout history, Iraq\u2019s civilization, history and religious, national and sectarian pluralism has made us a beacon of tolerance and cooperation and religious and intellectual brotherhood, as well as a platform for disseminating thought, culture, literature and science. The Mesopotamian civilization, one of the oldest in human history, represents an important and impregnable barrier to the growth and spread of extremist ideology, whether religious, sectarian or nationalistic. The Iraqis are continuing their battle to achieve the renaissance that they deserve, and to combat corruption, empower young people and women and achieve sustainable development. Those challenges continue and come on top of those of returning IDPs and rebuilding ruined areas.\nA few days ago, the Iraqi Government drafted a law establishing a council for reconstruction, and together with our Prime Minister, we will submit it to our Parliament in hopes that it will be enacted. The reconstruction council will investigate rebuilding our infrastructure through the joint efforts of the Government and the Iraqi and foreign private sectors. Iraq needs comprehensive reconstruction, and we hope that such projects will provide the legal and administrative environment we need to encourage private investment and meet Iraqis\u2019 desperate need for services and employment opportunities. Iraq is a promising market. Given the needs of Iraqis and our natural and human resources, we can transform our country from an arena of conflict and violence into an economic hub in the region. Some may think that this is a far-fetched dream, and I admit there are great obstacles and challenges involved, but I am confident that it is both necessary and possible at the national level, in Iraq itself, and also at the regional and world levels.\nTerrorism and corruption are two sides of the same coin. We believe that efforts to defeat terrorism must be accompanied by effective efforts to eliminate corruption, which is the political manifestation of violence and the main source for financing terrorism. Without drying up the sources that finance terrorism and preventing public funds from being diverted from their proper goal of funding education and services to funding social, political and security crises, we cannot take firm steps towards stability. The world must take serious action to establish an international alliance, similar to the international alliance against terrorism, combating the corruption networks that smuggle and launder money and drying up their sources of financing. That will enable Iraq to regain its stolen assets and eradicate this dangerous scourge.\nMesopotamia is the cradle of civilization and has done great service to human civilization, just as it has suffered and witnessed many disasters. We read the message of peace in the faces of our mothers and fathers and in the smiles of our sons and daughters, whose childhoods have been scarred by war. We see it in the eyes of our young men and young women, in the alleys and streets of our cities that have been beaten down by conflict. We all read the message of peace in our consciousness as a ray of hope for future generations and all humankind. I salute our citizens, our young people and the families of our martyrs, as well as the victims of oppression in mass graves and of the Anfal genocide. I salute their legitimate aspiration to live a life of freedom, dignity, peace and stability. It is our duty to support and meet those aspirations. We have serious challenges ahead of us, but with our will and determination, alongside the support and backing of the international community, we will prevail, God willing.\nI salute our citizens, our young people and the families of our martyrs, as well as the victims of oppression in mass graves and of the Anfal genocide. I salute their legitimate aspiration to live a life of freedom, dignity, peace and stability. It is our duty to support and meet those aspirations. We have serious challenges ahead of us, but with our will and determination, alongside the support and backing of the international community, we will prevail, God willing.\nPeace is the greeting of Islam and the essence of Islam throughout history. Peace is the message of Moses, Christ, the messengers, the prophets and of good people. It is the basis of all religions and great human doctrines. We start with the call for peace and with the call for peace we end. Peace be upon us all with God\u2019s mercy and blessings.\n"

        "file_text": "We can describe today\u2019s world in many ways \u2014 interdependent, aware and diverse. Yet it is also polluted, isolationist and unequal. We have never been so close together and yet so far apart. We are living in an era when individuals are at the centre of the decision-making process and yet the decisions that are being taken are not necessarily people-centred. Contradictory situations and outcomes are the order of the day.\nWe cannot just accept all of that as inevitable. We are fortunate enough to be living in an age when we are not only aware of the changes that are happening around us, we are also part of them. We are duty-bound to ensure that these ongoing changes and transformations leave no one behind. Transformations should be used to benefit our peoples, not to create divisions between the haves and the have-nots or those on the outside and those on the inside. Economic prosperity does not mean social injustice, and being a patriot does not equate to isolating a nation. The future should be equal. It is our responsibility to show the value of all peoples, irrespective of their age, race, sexual orientation, gender, creed and ability. Diversity is an enriching factor for any society. Firm in this belief, our country has embarked on a journey of conviction to fight social marginalization and address the needs and rights of those who for decades were considered to be the daughters and sons of a lesser God.\nFrom marriage equality to gender-neutral markers, the advancements made by Malta in the field of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI) community are described by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights as the global gold standard. It is a privilege and a responsibility to be seen as a world leader on such an important matter. With a rating of 94 per cent on the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association Rainbow Map, Malta is now consistently the leading European country in protecting people\u2019s rights in the areas of equality and non-discrimination, hate crime and hate speech, legal gender recognition and bodily integrity, civil-society space and asylum. All of that was achieved in just a few years, thanks to a strong bond between Government and civil society. Our experience has taught us that empowering citizens and ensuring that they have a voice in addressing and resolving issues that concern them and affect their lives is an important part of our success as a country. And yet in spite of our success, there is still a long way to go.\nOur ambition is clear. We want not only to provide the necessary legal platform but to contest social norms that abet stigma and discrimination. Legislation alone does not guarantee social change. We are working fast and actively on this aspect and our efforts are starting to bear fruit. The latest European Commission Eurobarometer survey on LGBTQI equality ranked Malta first in acceptance of gender-identity recognition. It also showed positive results in social acceptance of LGBTQI people and the need for inclusive educational curricula in schools. On the other hand, we note that we need to do a lot more to ensure that certain issues, such as family acceptance, have a more holistic approach.\nAutonomy and empowerment are values that our legislation and practice seek to mainstream, while ensuring appropriate support for persons who could find themselves in more vulnerable situations. That is why we have also enacted cutting-edge legislation in the area of gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics and why we are currently working to follow up on United Nations recommendations in other areas.\nThe future is female. We need to understand that we cannot succeed when approximately half of our global population is being held back. For centuries, women have played an important role in society, both in communities and, for the past decades, in the workplace. Yet this role has been under-appreciated, insufficiently acknowledged and at times even unrecognized. I firmly believe that the strong worldwide momentum pushing for women\u2019s rights should inspire leaders to review the pace of progress and ensure that Governments commit to achieving gender equality in our lifetime.\nOn a national level, Malta has been promoting numerous initiatives that underscore the country\u2019s commitment to the gender-equality agenda and the promotion of equal opportunities for all. We replaced our passive-benefit system, with its underlying poverty trap, with an active system that puts people back to work. We were not willing to continue to accept a situation in which we allowed thousands of lives to be spent in situations of unnecessary inactivity, in which families and individuals, mostly women, were trapped in a life on the edge, scraping through and marginalized at the edges of our society. This is why we introduced the tapering of social benefits, so that, when someone finds a job, they lose their benefits after a period of years, not immediately. Liberated from the excessive tax burden, those on social benefits \u2014 mostly women, once again \u2014 responded. The number of those on social assistance in our country has been cut in half in the past three years.\nOn the other hand, until a few years ago, working parents, mostly mothers, faced staggering childcare costs if they opted to go off to work. Their wages ended up financing childcare costs. We in Malta therefore introduced universal free childcare for all working parents. The result was essentially a silent social revolution. The female employment rate grew from 52 per cent to 63.4 per cent.\nYet that is not enough. We firmly believe that gender balance in politics would benefit not only women and female politicians, but also parties and society. Our country\u2019s record in female representation in the taking of political decisions is meagre, to say the least. In this regard, and aware of the persistent underrepresentation of women in Parliament, we launched a reform proposing affirmative action that can help us bridge the gap.\nAn individual\u2019s contribution to society and the relevance of one\u2019s thoughts and capabilities should not be affected by gender. We have to come to terms with the fact that social advancement has always been equated with empowerment and that therefore discrimination ultimately affects a nation\u2019s resilience and standing.\nWhen I think about the future, my mind instantly goes to my daughters. Considering that this year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, we should not be reflecting on the milestones achieved in its implementation, but, more importantly, we should be seeing that the areas that need to be addressed, such as including children\u2019s perspectives in all policies and decisions, are actually being made. Malta is currently working to fully incorporating the Convention into its legislation to enhance the full realization of children\u2019s rights, making them portable and fully accessible.\nGood health, well-being and quality inclusive education are fundamental human rights and indispensable for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the realization of what we all agree upon. In this vein, all children \u2014 boys and girls \u2014 should have access to good quality health care and education to ensure their well-being. Our objective is to equip all children with the appropriate environment and tools that allow them to acquire all of the necessary skills and talents for citizenship and employability in the twenty-first century and beyond.\nWe are committed to providing an education through which our children develop their personal and social potential to the fullest and acquire the appropriate knowledge, competencies and attitudes through a curriculum that is oriented around such values as equity, social justice, diversity and inclusiveness. Such inclusion will result from ensuring that the educational environment is accessible in every way.\nWhile striving to implement a mainstream approach to education, including through the adoption of a national inclusion policy, Malta also recognizes the importance of working to achieve equality in outcomes for all. In this regard, we believe that such an approach should be complemented by individualized and tailored supports, for example, for children with disabilities, to ensure, in the spirit of the SDGs, that no child is left behind.\nWe should therefore be committed to continuing to provide the best for our peoples for an improved quality of life and a brighter future. Sustainable development is all about current and future generations, not just about specific economic sectors or social strata. A \u201cgeneration\u201d implies that we are all involved, and that therefore we are all expected to contribute to defining our own future and to leaving a better world for future generations \u2014 a future that we hope will be equal.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour and privilege to address the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. It is indeed my sincere belief that the General Assembly is vital in galvanizing multilateral efforts and actions for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and the promotion of inclusivity in all its forms in order to advance our global agenda for people-centred development, common progress and prosperity. We, in this Assembly, more than ever before must realize, and work towards ensuring, that no one and no nation is left behind in the pursuit of progress and prosperity in this age of interdependence and interconnectivity.\nThe Government of the Federal Republic of Somalia warmly welcomes this year\u2019s theme of the General Assembly, which reminds us all of the importance of stepping up our efforts through greater international cooperation in order to ensure that we, as nations, individually achieve the Sustainable Development Goals of reducing poverty, improving the quality of education, addressing the adverse effects of climate change and promoting partnerships and inclusivity in all our actions at home. Partnerships in all their forms are essential if we are to overcome the greatest common challenges of our time, including security, poverty, climate change and sustainability. In this globalized world, no nation, no matter how wealthy, strong or prepared, can individually stand alone against the tide of global challenges, which requires common action and coordinated multilateral responses. We must strive to create the conditions for individual fulfilment and common prosperity in line with the vision of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nI am grateful to be here with our valuable partners, many of whom are represented in this great Assembly today, on account of the constructive role that they are playing in Somalia\u2019s successful journey to full recovery from a very difficult past. We are also grateful for the role that the United Nations has played and continues to play in Somalia\u2019s development journey on the ground.\nWe are committed to working with the United Nations to advance our inclusive national development agenda. Indeed, Somalia, which has benefitted from the support of both the United Nations and the bilateral support of its States Members, is a great example of the importance and success of the international multilateral system. Somalia\u2019s road to recovery, led by its resilient people and Government has come a very long way, and yet we cannot remain silent about or be blind to the discontent with the rising inequality, poverty and division caused by the unfair globalization that has become dominant in the world today. It goes without saying that inclusiveness in all of its manifestations must come to the fore if we are to succeed in galvanizing multilateral efforts for global security, poverty eradication, quality education and climate action, alongside the other development priorities.\nSomalia is also playing a key role in the Horn of Africa\u2019s socioeconomic development, and we are confident that the cooperation between the Horn of Africa countries will enhance economic development, political stability, social and cultural connectivity, and most importantly, security cooperation among the countries of the region. The Horn of Africa region has the potential to offer unrivalled opportunities for economic development and growth for its people if we can further strengthen the political, social and economic ties between our countries and our global partners. Horn of Africa States are not alone in working together towards a better future for their countries and people; we have many friends who are supporting us along the way in the interest of peace and security in the wider world. We thank them.\nSomalia promotes economic integration in the region and encourages its business community to invest in countries in East Africa and beyond. Somali communities continue to invest in the Republic of Kenya, which, indeed contributes to that country\u2019s growth and economic prosperity. Somalia and Kenya, which are neighbours on the Indian Ocean coast of East Africa, enjoy peaceful and friendly relations. We owe much to Kenya for the steadfast support it has given to Somalia\u2019s people over the years. While our overall relations are excellent, our maritime boundary has never been delimited, which has made it a source of disagreement between us. Bilateral negotiations in the past have not led to an agreement.\nIn order to obtain a peaceful and equitable settlement, in 2014, in accordance with international law, Somalia instituted proceedings before the International Court of Justice, the highest legal authority of the United Nations. We are very pleased that the Court found that it had jurisdiction to resolve the dispute and that the final hearing on the merits of the case is scheduled for the first week of November. As a State Member of the United Nations and a State party to the Statute of the Court, Somalia is committed to seeing the judicial settlement process through to its end. Somalia has pledged to comply with the Court\u2019s final judgment and to accept the boundary that is delimited by the Court. As a matter of international law, the Court\u2019s judgment will be binding for Kenya as well. We trust that when that judgment is issued and the boundary is established, a lasting settlement to this long-lasting dispute will finally be achieved. In addition, on 3 September, the African Union Peace and Security Council concluded that the African Union is not empowered to intervene in the case before the Court.\nI would like to further report that at the margins of this session of the General Assembly, precisely on the evening of 24 September, President Al Sisi of Egypt, who is also the current Chairperson of the African Union, convened and chaired a meeting between President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya and me. The meeting was very fruitful. We agreed to restore our good brotherly relationship and strengthen our diplomatic and political cooperation. We further agreed to leave the maritime dispute between our two countries to resolution by the International Court of Justice. Somalia is committed to maintaining a good relationship with Kenya.\nThe Somali Government is strongly committed to its ambitions in enabling a peacebuilding and State-building agenda. We are making clear strides towards achieving inclusive politics, strengthening democracy and constructing the very rights-based national institutions that are the pillars of strong societies. I can proudly report that we have held successful regional elections in some federal member states in the run-up to the planning of our national parliamentary and presidential elections in 2021. We are determined to facilitate the success of this process through an inclusive electoral bill that will focus on voter registration and better public awareness of the importance of inclusive politics and national progress.\nFrom all the foregoing, it is clear that Somalia is a historic example of reform, resilience and people-driven progress and recovery. Today our national discussions focus on how to deliver inclusive politics, public services, financial and economic reforms, economic growth, good governance and expanded regional cooperation as well as how, working together with our valuable partners at home and abroad, to finally defeat the threat posed by the different factions of the Al-Shabaab terrorist group. Security has been the focus of our Government and its greatest public expenditure since I took office because everything else, including poverty eradication, quality education and climate action depends on it.\nAlongside our international partners, we are tirelessly working to rid Somalia of the last pocket of violent extremists and their terrorist activities. This task is by no means easy because of the violent, cowardly and opportunistic guerrilla tactics that Al-Shabaab terrorists use, including bombing innocent civilians and private businesses. Nevertheless, through our holistic strategy comprising deradicalization, successful military offensives, recovery of territory from Al-Shabaab and strengthening of the Somalia National Army and its security capabilities, we are confident that our joint efforts with the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and other international partners will bear fruit for Somalia and its people as well as for regional and global stability.\nWe are building a well-trained armed force and accountable, rights-based security institutions that can take over the responsibility of securing Somalia. In partnership with AMISOM and other key international supporters, our Government is working hard to achieve this objective through its transition plan, in line with the national security architecture. In this regard, I wish to thank the brave men and women of the Somali security forces, all the troop-contributing countries of the African Union within AMISOM, and all our international partners that support the security operations in various important ways. These comprehensive reforms have by no means been easy, but through commitment and absolute determination, we have undertaken the biometric registration of the entire Somalia National Army.\nFurther, the human resources audit of the wider security sector, including biometric registration of all personnel, will be completed shortly. Biometric registration has enabled the Government to eliminate ghost workers, assess the operational readiness of the security personnel, and cut costs so that the savings can be used in other initiatives to further strengthen the security of the Somali people. I am convinced that Somalia\u2019s successful security-sector reforms will provide us with the best possible security apparatus to safeguard the well-being and progress of the Somali people.\nQuality education liberates, empowers, instils hope and unleashes the great dreams, ambitions and innovations that will create a better world for all of us. All development is anchored in education, and it is clear that galvanizing our multilateral efforts for any development anywhere must start with national and international support for education in all its forms.\nIn Somalia, a key symbol of our national recovery has been the enormous expansion of education services across the public and private sector for all stages of learning. We fully understand the need to encourage, support and build on the existing public- private partnership model of education delivery with strong oversight by the federal Government. Despite our difficult past, the design and delivery of quality education today as well as its governance and delivery framework is the most crucial education objective we have set as a Government. It is critical for our young generation to catch up and possibly even leapfrog over us to be able to compete in a globalized economy and benefit from and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\nGiven the importance of quality education to Somalia\u2019s peacebuilding and State-building processes as well as to its overall development, our Government has embarked on an ambitious reform programme that aims to expand access to education for children, adolescents and youth, including those from such marginalized communities as persons with disabilities and girls and women. We are intently focused on improving the quality of learning outcomes for all learners, especially at early-grade levels. We are also committed to increasing enrolment rates, ensuring the market relevance of learning opportunities to sustainably growing the economy, creating much- needed jobs and instilling further confidence in our people and their country\u2019s prosperity and prospects.\nOn a practical note, the Somali Government is in the process of developing an inclusive and relevant national curriculum alongside rehabilitating old public schools, while working diligently to establish technical vocational schools and investing in the next generation of teachers and school leaders. For five years running, Somalia has successfully held the national exam, and most of our students, including those with such disabilities as blindness, participated and were successful. We are proud of them all and will continue to work to improve their learning opportunities and employment prospects through better policies, stronger partnerships, accessible facilities and educational leadership. To strengthen quality education globally, we must all share good practices, transfer successful policies and make the necessary link between education, opportunities and international peace, security and development.\nSomalia is very committed to improving the country\u2019s natural environment and to promoting community resilience for the sake of both present and future generations. Somalia has taken major steps in instituting environmental-management authorities to implement changes at the national level. The establishment of the Directorate of Environment and Climate Change within the Office of the Prime Minister, for example, is a step in the right direction, and we are confident that this Directorate will effectively lead the development and implementation of environmental regulations and policies. This is evidence of our commitment to climate action for a better, cleaner and more inclusively prosperous environment.\nIndeed, climate change threatens to increase the frequency and severity of environmental shocks, and Somalia, with the longest coastline in continental Africa, is already experiencing the effects of rising sea levels and a rising average temperature, which are exacerbated by the effects of degraded lands and deforestation. The 2017 drought in Somalia had a significant impact on the environment, economy and natural-resources sector, with ecosystem losses and damages estimated at an equivalent of more than $600 million. The loss in productivity of our natural capital points to difficult times ahead for the livestock- based Somali economy, all the more so because as much as 93 per cent of pasture resources have been decimated or destroyed in some regions of the country. This has directly and indirectly affected the lives and livelihoods of the 6.2 million people, about 60 per cent of the population, who depend on pastoralism.\nOwing to this vulnerability, Somalia\u2019s economy could take much longer to recover than otherwise might be the case, given that it continues to suffer the repetitive occurrence of climate-related hazards. The drivers of vulnerability and fragility in Somalia are complex and therefore require comprehensive and long-term solutions for integrating sustainable natural-resource management and a global environmental agenda into Somalia\u2019s recovery and national development plan. The lessons learned from our experience is that climate action is urgently needed to reverse the catastrophic environmental damage that poses an existential threat to our collective future.\nLet me assure the Assembly that my Government is fully committed to the outcomes of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and, equally, to other multilateral environmental agreements that are dedicated to protecting our planet and safeguarding the future for all. In this regard, we strongly urge the full implementation and enforcement of Security Council resolution 751 (1992), which requires all Member States to take the necessary measures to prevent the direct and indirect import and export of charcoal from Somalia. Implementation of the charcoal ban will not only save the environment but will also deny international terrorists a source of financing on which they depend to hurt the innocent and most vulnerable in our society.\nPoverty is one of the greatest sufferings a people and nation can experience. The people and the Government of Somalia are working hard to build a more sustainable future free from poverty and with strong social protections. Today, we are on the verge of completing an inclusive ninth national development plan, which will guide the national strategic policies and frameworks for eradicating poverty in Somalia. The process of conducting the national development plan was inclusive and participatory and promoted accountability, transparency and shared responsibility for future implementation. Our approach to eradicating poverty is to create economic opportunities for our people, and, to that end, we are engaged in an ambitious and successful fiscal and economic reform programme guided by the staff-monitored programme of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with a view to achieving debt cancellation by early next year through the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.\nAccording to the IMF, our performance to date has been strong, and we have achieved much in a short space of time. We continue to raise domestic revenue, improve national budgeting processes and make our financial system more secure and transparent, while instilling fiscal discipline in our national operations. We are working closely, both bilaterally and multilaterally, with all our key partners and stakeholders, including the Somali people and international financial institutions, to secure debt cancellation for Somalia. Achieving this end will allow Somalia to gain access to the valuable and much-needed concessionary resources that would complement our national domestic-revenue mobilization so as to cover the cost of eradicating poverty, improving public services, including quality education and security, and taking effective actions to safeguard our future against the scourge of climate change.\nAlongside economic and fiscal reforms, our Government has championed a zero-tolerance approach to corruption so that every dollar is spent on the public good. If we are to eradicate poverty, we cannot afford to lose a single cent to corruption. Accordingly, we must always ensure value for money in public expenditure and tackle corruption head on. This is why I signed the historic anti-corruption bill last week. My Government is determined to deliver on the content of this legislation for the benefit of the people of Somalia.\nLet me conclude by reiterating Somalia\u2019s strong support for galvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education and climate action in all its forms. In the current globalized age of uncertainty and common threats and opportunities, we must all join together to achieve common progress and inclusive prosperity. Our global journey towards sustainable development may be long, but every step that we take together will be rewarded with stronger societies, a more equitable and connected world and a community of nations strengthened and empowered through such collaboration.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Yemen, I sincerely congratulate Nigeria and Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- fourth session and wish him every success. I also thank his predecessor, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her outstanding endeavours during the previous session.\nI also wish to express my gratitude to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for sincerely striving to bring about peace for the benefit of all peoples. I particularly appreciate the great interest he has shown with regard to the people of Yemen and the security, stability, unity and territorial integrity of our country. I also thank his Special Envoy, Mr. Martin Griffiths, and his team for their efforts to advance peace in Yemen.\nI stand heartbroken before the Assembly today because of the situation in my country, Yemen. My country, which is known for its generosity and deep- rooted history, is the symbol of Arab civilization, prosperity and pride. But it is now a country with deep wounds as the result of a war imposed on it by dogmatic armed militias \u2014 the Houthi militias, supported by Iran \u2014 that have been carrying out acts of torture, exclusion and killing as means of achieving their objectives.\nTheir sponsor, Iran, is the primary sponsor of terrorism throughout the world, exploiting the resources of its own people to support an Iranian expansionist agenda that involves providing foreign militias and proxies with arms, money and expertise in destruction. Since 2014, with Iran\u2019s support, the Houthi militias have destroyed all that is beautiful in Yemen. They conducted a coup d\u2019etat against the State and its institutions, using armed force. They have blown up houses and places of worship, bombed innocent people and looted their sustenance. They have confiscated freedoms and kidnapped activists, as well as all those who opposed them. They have planted all forms of internationally prohibited mines in Yemeni soil and waterways.\nI can say that in just a few years the Houthi militias have destroyed the dream of all Yemeni people for freedom, equality and a dignified life. This dream had almost come to fruition, thanks to the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the outcome of the National Dialogue Conference, leading to the adoption of a new Constitution for a unified Yemen, which sought to embrace all Yemenis in all their political, tribal and communal variety while preserving freedoms, equality and the fair distribution of power and wealth. Our steadfast people will not stand for anything less.\nFifty-seven years ago, through the 26 September revolution, Yemenis destroyed the myth of divine right. The Yemenis will also destroy a worse contemporary myth and block any attempt to tear apart the homeland of the glorious and eternal southern revolution of 14 October. The revolution was strengthened when, on 22 May, the Yemenis reached consensus on a new permanent federal Yemen, which is the path that we wish to take.\nDespite all the difficulties and obstacles strewn across this path, the sacrifices made by the heroes of the Yemeni armed forces, together with the people\u2019s bold resistance, have enabled us to contain the madness of doctrinaire militias that continue to believe in their exclusive divine right to rule against all the values of democracy and human rights. This was also achieved with unprecedented support from our brothers in the coalition to support legitimacy, under the leadership of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nWe appreciate the support we have received from our brothers in the Saudi-led coalition. The firmness and sincerity of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, as well as of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, emphasize the honest brotherhood of the coalition to support legitimacy, which all Yemenis keep in their hearts. The Saudi support for Yemen came under the most difficult circumstances, in response to the solemn appeal of His Excellency the President of the Republic, Mr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi, in line with international law and the Charter of the United Nations, with a view to achieving the noble goals of confronting the Houthi militias, foiling Iran\u2019s expansionist plans and recovering the legitimate authority of the State, thereby safeguarding the security, stability, unity and territorial integrity of Yemen.\nFollowing the liberation of Aden from the Houthis in 2015, and despite the difficult political and security conditions it encountered, the Yemeni Government has sought to improve the country\u2019s economic situation and resume the development process. It has taken all measures necessary to halt the collapse of the national Yemeni currency and implement a comprehensive economic vision, enabling us to adapt to the exceptional circumstances in the country. From Aden, the temporary capital of Yemen, the Government is doing everything in its power, within its limited capabilities, to alleviate the suffering of all Yemenis facing humanitarian disaster on a daily basis.\nEven as our people resist the Imamite coup militias that dream of the return to the past, and as the coalition supports the legitimacy of the State, the so-called Southern Transitional Council, with financial, military and logistical support from the United Arab Emirates, has rebelled against the State, attacking and seizing the Government headquarters in the temporary capital Aden. This so-called Transitional Council, harbouring delusions of secession and power and imposing its decisions by armed force, is targeting the constitutional legitimacy and very identity of Yemen. Although the coalition to support legitimacy in Yemen has given fair warning, calling for the immediate withdrawal of the outlaw military groups from State institutions and barracks, these groups have nonetheless expanded into two additional governorates. Accordingly, our heroic national army has been compelled to confront the outlaws\u2019 aggression and restore the authority of the State and its institutions in Aden, the temporary capital of the country.\nUnfortunately, however, our army has come under direct military attack from the United Arab Emirates Air Force in violation of international law. These attacks have deeply affected the stability of our homeland and constituted an outright deviation from the noble objectives of the coalition to support legitimacy in Yemen. We again thank and highly appreciate the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its efforts to put an end to the rebellion and stop the actions undertaken by the United Arab Emirates in the liberated areas, as the coalition\u2019s task has not been to fend off attacks, but simply to focus the efforts to end the Houthi-Iranian coup in Yemen.\nFrom this rostrum, allow me to pay tribute to the heroes of the Yemeni armed forces, who have made immense sacrifices and shown tremendous determination to ensure that Yemen stays strong and that the Aiban and Shamsan mountain ranges will always be free.\nThe Republic of Yemen would like to thank our donor brothers and friends who have helped Yemen in dire circumstances to alleviate the humanitarian crisis by supporting the humanitarian response plans or by offering direct aid. We are particularly grateful to the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its generosity in responding to the humanitarian response plan, with a recent pledge of $500 million in support of the 2019 plan. Saudi Arabia has also provided direct humanitarian aid to Yemenis throughout Yemen through the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre, and direct support to the State treasury so as to prevent the collapse of our national currency. The Kingdom has provided bank guarantees for food and other commodities and allocated the monthly sum of $60 million in electricity and other fuel support, together with contributions from the Saudi Development and Reconstruction Programme for Yemen and the Comprehensive Humanitarian Operation Support Centre in Yemen.\nIran and its military arms in our Arab region, including the Houthis and Hizbullah, pose a serious threat to our national security. Iran is a rogue State that respects neither international law nor its obligations as a State Member of the United Nations. Iran has caused significant damage to Yemen and the Arabian peninsula. It has created, trained, armed and financed the Houthi militias that embrace the slogan of the Iranian revolution and adopt its approach based on repression, abuse and torture. The Houthi militias have even turned our territory into a platform for launching rockets, threatening the safety of neighbouring States and international navigation in the Red Sea. United Nations reports reveal and reaffirm the extent of Iran\u2019s support for Houthi militias.\nThe Houthi militias have not stopped there. Recently they claimed responsibility for the terrorist attacks on the Khurais and Abqaiq oil facilities of the Saudi Arabian oil company, ARAMCO. This reveals clear misguidance and explicit subordination of the Houthi militias to the rogue Iranian regime. We condemn this terrorist attack and reaffirm that it should be addressed and that the perpetrators must be held totally accountable for their actions. This was an attack not only on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but also on the international economy and a serious threat to international peace and security.\nWe do not call for war and destruction. We call for peace and stability. To that end, and in order to uphold our full responsibility to all Yemeni people, we have supported the United Nations peace process and the efforts of the Special Envoy for Yemen. We have actively and flexibly participated in all peace initiatives, in line with the terms of reference on peace reflected in the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council and its Implementation Mechanism, the outcome of the comprehensive national dialogue and the relevant Security Council resolutions, specifically resolution 2216 (2015).\nWe went to Sweden last year to seize every opportunity for peace, but the Houthi militias were intransigent and have continuously refused to implement the agreement reached. We have therefore made no progress in the implementation of this agreement for more than 10 months. The solution is not to neglect our agreement or turn a blind eye to the unjustified Houthis intransigence, but to induce the militias to implement their agreements and honour their obligations to the world. The Houthis need to know that peace is not empty rhetoric and slogans. Peace needs requirements to be fulfilled. The Security Council must also assume its responsibility and oblige the Houthis to implement the provisions of the agreement, including the withdrawal from the city and ports of Al-Hudaydah, and the agreement to release prisoners \u2014 all prisoners \u2014 and lift the unfair blockade against the city of Taiz.\nIn that regard, I would like to share a very touching letter that I received two days ago from the Abductees\u2019 Mothers Association in Yemen. In the letter, those mothers ask me to convey to the whole world the tragedy of losing their sons in Houthis prisons and even their use as human shields. All I can say is that we will never forget the crimes of the Houthis and we will work very seriously for the release of all abductees. I ask the mother of Anas and all the mothers of those abducted to be patient \u2014 they will soon see the dawn.\nThe Republic of Yemen reiterates its steadfast position on the Palestinian question and the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, foremost among which is the right to establish an independent State with East Jerusalem as its capital. We urge the international community to continue to support the efforts of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East in order to enable it to provide assistance to Palestinian refugees. We also strongly condemn the continued pursuit of Israeli settlement policies on Palestinian lands, as well as daily abuses against the Palestinian people and Muslim places of worship. We condemn in particular statements made by the Prime Minister of Israel regarding his intent to annex lands in the occupied West Bank and to impose Israeli sovereignty on Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea region, in flagrant violation of international law, the Charter and relevant international resolutions.\nIn closing, I hope that the proceedings of this session will be successful and that when we meet next year peace will have prevailed in Yemen. Our cause is as strong as a rock and our determination remains steadfast. We will never yield. We aspire to achieve lasting and inclusive peace based on national constants. We extend our mercy to all the free martyrs of Yemen. We pray for the recovery of the wounded and for the freedom of all prisoners and abductees."

        "file_text": "I extend my most heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session and assure him of Jamaica\u2019s full support in the work ahead. I also want to convey our deepest appreciation to Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for so ably guiding our work during the previous session.\nThe United Nations is a critical tool for building a world of peace, security and development. These are the hallmarks of multilateral collaborative activities of which we can all be justly proud. No individual country can fulfil the development aspirations of its people without working in partnership with others. We are therefore grateful to the Secretary-General, his team and all who have been the drivers behind the many successful United Nations initiatives.\nAt the same time, our global space is facing unprecedented risks, including deepening geopolitical conflicts, heightened trade tensions, terrorist attacks and security threats. There is also growing religious intolerance, increasing xenophobic behaviour and, not least, the devastating effects of climate change. Sadly, we are witnessing these phenomena against the backdrop of fears of a global recession. I therefore very much welcome the theme chosen for the General Assembly\u2019s general debate this year, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d. Now is indeed the time to redirect our focus and enable our countries to reverse these negative trends.\nJamaica is pursuing several policy and legislative measures designed to create a more cohesive society and a more resilient economy. Our major goals are the promotion of inclusive sustainable growth, economic opportunities, a peaceful society, social harmony and citizen security. We are working to make this a reality for every Jamaican. Greater investment in human capital will undoubtedly yield exponential returns for national development. Empowerment of our people will facilitate participation in the growth and development of Jamaica, our region and the broader international community.\nSpecial attention must be given to the most vulnerable in society to ensure that no one is left behind. We have therefore increased the budgetary allocation to the Jamaica Social Protection Strategy programme, which encompasses wider social and income-security imperatives associated with a range of vulnerabilities. In 2017, we revised our national poverty-reduction programme aimed at reducing the national poverty rate to below 10 per cent by 2030. We are working to ensure that persons living with disabilities, the elderly, women, children and young people are part of an inclusive, resilient and prosperous society.\nWe have made significant advances with universal enrolment at the pre-primary, primary and secondary levels of education through a strategic and integrated programme of education and training. As part of this endeavour, we are increasing emphasis on science, innovation and technology, and we are committed to creating a labour force adaptable to the new and emerging demands of the global workplace.\nWe have also launched the Housing, Opportunity, Production and Employment (HOPE) programme, which enables unattached young people to access training in life skills, character development and employment. Over the last three years, more than 26,000 young people have benefited from and have become ambassadors of HOPE. In addition to cutting youth unemployment in half over the past three years, Jamaica achieved a record-low unemployment rate of 7.8 per cent, 18 consecutive quarters of economic growth, low and stable inflation and a reduction in our ratio of debt to gross domestic product from 147 per cent to 95 per cent.\nI have shared the foregoing indicators of Jamaica\u2019s steady economic performance while fully acknowledging that the successes are not solely dependent on a strengthened domestic fiscal-responsibility framework but also on an enabling global economic and financial environment. Jamaica is determined to achieve economic independence and social equity by working collaboratively with our bilateral and multilateral partners.\nA major challenge for Jamaica is crime and security, particularly in terms of its impact on our economic development goals. Despite the strong programmes that are in place to get guns off the street and our investments in improved border-control systems and other forms of security investments, on our own we do not have the capacity to stem the flow of illegal arms trafficking. Transnational, regional and multilateral action are needed if we are to effectively tackle the malignant links between organized crime, the illegal drug trade and the illicit proliferation and trafficking of small arms. We therefore not only rely on the support of our neighbouring countries, but we also look to the United Nations to continue to play a pivotal role in supporting peace and security at all levels, including with respect to the proliferation of conventional weapons.\nThe growing geopolitical challenges and risks of global economic instability are of concern. The situation is especially worrisome for small developing countries like Jamaica that are already susceptible to external shocks. Instability and insecurity affect foreign direct investment and have implications for gross domestic product growth, revenue, employment and public spending.\nYesterday\u2019s High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development as well as the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development remind us of the pressing need for us to mobilize increased capital. Sustained progress is not achievable without the requisite quantity and quality of public and private investment to close the financing gap for climate action and the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is for this reason that Jamaica and Canada continue to spearhead initiatives through the Group of Friends of SDG Financing and to work with partners such as Denmark on the Closing the Investment Gap Initiative so as to attract greater investment in sustainable infrastructure.\nJamaica also welcomes India\u2019s offer to establish and host the Coalition for Disaster-Resilient Infrastructure to provide a framework to ensure that all future infrastructure is resilient in the face of disasters. We encourage coordination and cohesion in emerging initiatives so as to maximize the impact of our efforts.\nI am also compelled to reiterate the special challenges faced by such highly indebted middle-income countries as Jamaica and our Caribbean neighbours. Although we are poised for economic transition, our potential is seriously constrained by having to choose between high external-debt repayment and catalytic growth spending. Furthermore, the current policies that govern access to concessional-financing windows do not allow us access to sufficient, affordable long-term financing for SDG investments, and our capacity to mobilize public resources domestically is limited by our small size and vulnerability. This touches on the issue of graduation criteria, which do not take into account the range of vulnerabilities facing middle-income countries. Our economies face further challenges as a result of de-risking and the attendant problem of losing correspondent-banking relationships, which severely impedes access to essential financial services.\nIn the context of our special vulnerabilities, my delegation welcomes the midterm review of the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA Pathway), which presents an opportunity to further operationalize the mandate of the Pathway. Jamaica is committed to this process and looks forward to seeing the full support of the international community in this regard.\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that on 1 January, Jamaica successfully implemented a ban on the importation, manufacture and distribution of single-use plastic bags, expanded polystyrene and plastic drinking straws. The ban has served to sensitize the general public to the environmental challenges posed by non-biodegradable litter, especially that which ends up in our oceans. We are considering expanding the ban as we make it a priority to strengthen our waste-management systems. We also launched a national tree-planting initiative this year through which we will plant more than 3 million trees over three years, which represents a tree for every Jamaican citizen.\nWe remain committed to reducing the erosion of watersheds and its related impact on coastal ecosystems. We are partnering with others to ensure that our marine environment, on which our socioeconomic survival depends, is being sustainably utilized and managed. The High-level Panel on Building a Sustainable Ocean Economy convened by the Prime Minister of Norway, Ms. Erna Solberg, and its resulting Call to Ocean- Based Climate Action and report entitled The Ocean as a Solution for Climate Change: 5 Opportunities for Action enjoy Jamaica\u2019s full support. We look forward to the convening of the Ocean Conference in Norway next month and in Portugal in June 2020.\nThat brings me to the single most visible threat to the global environment, which is climate change. Its effects are intensifying, with coastal cities and low-lying island nations facing the greatest risk. The recent devastation wrought by Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas reinforces this reality. We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life and extensive damage to property, infrastructure and livelihoods occasioned by this climate disaster. Jamaica and other Caribbean islands have first-hand experience of the increase in the intensity of hurricanes, as well as intermittent increased rainfall and extended periods of drought. These adverse weather events have resulted in major economic loss and dislocation across the region.\nJamaica has adopted several policies and legislative measures to reduce its vulnerability to natural hazards and adapt to the effects of climate change. These include the development of a comprehensive and first-of-its-kind public financial disaster-risk monetary policy, with provisions for financial risk-protection, including budgeted contingency funds and State-contingent debt instruments. More action is needed at the national and global levels to urgently tackle climate change. I was therefore honoured by Secretary-General Guterres\u2019s mandating Jamaica to jointly lead, along with France and Qatar, the climate-finance and carbon-pricing track at the recently concluded United Nations Climate Action Summit. The success of these efforts for climate action will depend on adequate financing and transformative and scalable programmes. I look forward to building on the outcomes of the Summit and the decisions to be made at the twenty-fifth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Santiago later this year.\nThis is a seminal year for the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as we commemorate the twenty-fifth year of its entry into force, as well as the twenty-fifth anniversary of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which is headquartered in Jamaica. The ISA\u2019s contribution to the development of this constitution of the oceans and its continued relevance to the preservation of a global common resource are commendable. We look forward to successfully concluding negotiations in 2020 on an international treaty under the Convention on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.\nJamaica maintains an abiding faith in the value of multilateralism. Every State Member of the United Nations has a role to play in confronting the challenges that beset the global community. This perspective is what continues to inspire countries like Jamaica to contribute its professional and technical expertise to the multilateral process, including at the Council of the International Maritime Organization and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, in 2020. We are committed to supporting the fulfilment of our common objectives in both institutions.\nThe Charter of the United Nations commits the international community to saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war and conflict of all kinds. Jamaica therefore supports the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Envoys for Syria and Myanmar and Personal Envoy for Western Sahara. We also support efforts aimed at rapprochement on the Korean peninsula and discourage any action that would reverse those efforts. We also remain conscious of the persistent tensions in the Middle East and Africa, where the attainment of peace and security has been far too elusive. Closer to home, we further reiterate the call for the discontinuation of the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed on our neighbour, Cuba. We are equally concerned about the disarmament and proliferation landscape, particularly the gradual dismantling of long-standing disarmament treaties and its implications for international peace and security.\nWe cannot ignore ongoing conflicts in such countries as Yemen, Afghanistan and Libya, where United Nations personnel continue to provide yeoman service in peacekeeping. We commend their dedicated efforts and respectfully recall the memory of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in seeking to advance the ideals of the United Nations of global peace and security. This includes one of our own Jamaican nationals, Mr. Clive Peck, who lost his life in the service of the United Nations as a result of a bombing that occurred in Benghazi, Libya, a few weeks ago. We thank the Secretary-General and the United Nations as a whole for the support it has provided to his family at this time of bereavement.\nAs a global family of nations, our collective commitment to the rules-based international order must remain steadfast. Sustainable development for all is attainable only through concerted effort and partnership. To that end, we must act decisively and expeditiously. This seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly represents a crossroads for decision-making and action. Let us not waver in our determination to make that a reality.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly on behalf of Montenegro and to reaffirm our strong commitment to the goals, the fundamental tenets and the principles of the United Nations. In the year when we mark 100 years of multilateralism, in an atmosphere of increasingly sharp polarization, fragmentation and instability in international relations, and at a time of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, it is our common responsibility to demonstrate the true value of United Nations action and efficient multilateralism as the only global solutions to global challenges.\nThat is why I want to particularly commend the commitment of the Secretary-General Guterres to the reform and strengthening of the multilateral system. As he said, strengthening multilateralism today means strengthening our commitment to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and to the development of a more secure and just world for future generations.\nI want to assure Member States that Montenegro remains firmly committed to the approach defined by the founders of the world Organization that we accepted in 2006 after we restored our independence and became a full-fledged member of the United Nations. It is the approach of being a good neighbour, strongly and resolutely defending universal values and principles, and being a reliable partner in efforts to maintain international peace and security. I believe that every country, regardless of the figures that it records, can by its own example contribute to global solutions and be a part of them.\nThe choice of priorities of the President of the General Assembly and the theme of this year\u2019s debate indicate the key challenges with which we have continuously been faced and to which we, as a community, have unfortunately not yet been able to find an effective and comprehensive response.\nThe data show that the number of displaced persons in the world has reached the record figure of 70 million, which is the largest number since the Second World War. There are approximately 26 million refugees, half of whom are less than 18 years of age.\nLast year, a tragically high number of children were killed or wounded, most of them in Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen. A record number of very young children have died in Syria since the beginning of the war in that country, which is in its ninth year. The figures for those suffering from the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo show that children are also among the most affected. We could unfortunately provide a long list of devastating numbers from Libya, Somalia and the Sahel region, of persecuted Rohingya people and so on.\nWe can only wonder what the future of those children and of those societies may be. Can we already say that they are the lost generations or can we still do something urgently and prevent millions of children and young people around the world, deprived of their fundamental rights and the opportunities to learn and receive an education, from falling victim to various traffickers and sexual and gender-based violence, being abused for political purposes or suffering the worst forms of violence and violent extremism. The exceptional Kofi Annan talked passionately about the immense transformative power of education. He always emphasized that education is the foundation of freedom, democracy and sustainable human development. We believe that, by ensuring access to education, we are creating conditions for the development of future leaders and drivers of social change for better and more secure societies.\nSolidarity with displaced persons and refugees must not be a matter of political decision or choice. That is, above all, a matter of humanity. Montenegro states this based on its own experiences. Montenegro accepted a huge number of displaced persons during the wars in the former Yugoslavia. At one point, refugees made up a fifth of our total population. More than two decades after the end of the conflict, Montenegro is still working with the countries of the region and with the support of the international community to seek permanent solutions for those most affected by the war. A significant number of such persons remain in Montenegro. They give an added value to our multi-ethnic harmony after having integrated into Montenegrin society.\nI fully agree that the burden on host countries is too heavy. But our humanity must urge us to show solidarity and a willingness to share the burden in every situation. During the 1990s, we in Montenegro had no dilemma in accepting those who left their homes under the threat of war. Today the threats are multifold. People are running away not only from wars and persecution but also from the consequences of global warming and natural disasters. I believe that our societies, particularly our communities in the Mediterranean and Europe, will not allow our sea to become a tomb and the place of our civilization\u2019s collapse.\nThere is no country in the world that can deal with the issues of migration and forced displacement alone. Any form of long-term instability would make all of us vulnerable. We need the full implementation of the agreed global treaties on migration and refugees.\nThis week\u2019s Climate Action Summit 2019 has shown that the existing high level of international activities is not enough to achieve the goals agreed upon within the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. I take this opportunity to commend and support the initiative of the Secretary-General to accelerate international action, given how urgently we need to strengthen our global response with resolute and ambitious actions in order to implement the international commitments undertaken.\nInitial results in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development demonstrate a necessity to ensure that its transformative potential is focused on improving governance mechanisms and reforming existing development models. At all levels, our reaction has to be based on continuous engagement aimed at introducing sustainable development practices within the frameworks of complex political processes, such as the continuous generation of new ideas and actions aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Implementing the SDGs has to be based on the integrative nature of sustainable development policy. At the same time, an objective analysis of the achievements is equally important, both in national and global contexts.\nWithin the constraints of its own capacities, Montenegro will continue providing maximum support for the transformation of development based on accelerating the implementation of the SDGs and their targets with a view to achieving continuous, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, protecting natural resources, improving human resources and strengthening of social inclusion. We believe that in this way we are strengthening the institutional system of our independent State and stable economy, striving to make choices that will ensure long-term security. This has resulted in our NATO membership and the ongoing process of integrating into the European Union (EU). Although we have recorded significant progress in achieving the global goals, we need further efforts to reduce the risk of poverty in a more dramatic way and to eliminate disparities in regional development. We are aware that the basis for the improvement of human rights lies in reducing inequalities. As a new member of the Economic and Social Council, Montenegro will commit to working on accelerating the comprehensive implementation of the key multilateral development treaties.\nAn increasing number of conflicts and growing threats to international peace and security demand changes in present global practices and require a holistic and coordinated prevention-based approach within the United Nations system. Prevention of conflicts and a focus on concerted efforts are particularly important for a sustainable peace agenda. In that regard, we should not neglect the importance of synergy between the Security Council and the General Assembly and the important prevention capacity of the Human Rights Council. As an active participant in the work of the Human Rights Council, we are fully aware of its achievements and its contribution to the system for early warning and prevention of violence and mass atrocities. Unfortunately, we can see that these mechanisms are not used in the proper way and that we keep repeating, or risk repeating, dangerous mistakes from the not-so- distant past.\nIntensification of tensions and renewal of rhetoric from the Cold War-era, cruel civic and regional conflicts, an increase in the activities of armed non-State actors, an increase in spending on arms, as well as the use of hybrid warfare instruments, all call for exceptional caution, an urgent return to dialogue and restoration of trust among key international relations stakeholders.\nThe abandonment of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty has put us before a situation where we have to face a security issue that requires the establishment of a strategic dialogue. The world without the INF calls for taking responsibility, not avoiding it. The uncertainty regarding the preservation and full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on the Iranian nuclear programme raises additional serious concerns. Any spillover of conflicts, particularly in the Middle East, would contribute to the development of humanitarian and security crises that would have an impact on the wider region and global relations, becoming the source of additional insecurity and unpredictable consequences.\nMontenegro is firmly committed and determined to make an active and constructive contribution and support collective efforts to preserve international peace and security. We will continue to provide strong support for global efforts to control arms, disarmament and non-proliferation, and especially for the Secretary General\u2019s disarmament agenda. At the same time, Montenegro will continue its active participation in United Nations, EU and NATO-led peacekeeping operations, remaining aware that only a safe neighbourhood can guarantee our security and prosperity.\nAt a time when the universal nature of human rights is being questioned and we are faced with exhausting discussions about the relationship between human rights, development and the responsibility of the State to protect the rights of its citizens, Montenegro remains permanently committed to democratic values and the rule of law and to the fight against impunity for violations and abuses of human rights.\nWe strongly believe that equality and non-discrimination are values that we can never take for granted. They require permanent attention, struggle and willingness to respond to the challenges brought forth by those who attack or jeopardize them in any way. We are alarmed by the increase of intolerance, xenophobia, racial and religious intolerance, hate speech and anti-Semitism.\nImproving and supporting the integration of human rights and gender perspective in all aspects of the United Nations work and preserving the universal nature and independence of the human rights system remain our absolute priorities. We will continue to provide particularly strong support for the efforts towards preventing sexual violence and abuse, as one of the cruellest forms of violation of rights and denial of freedom and dignity, as well as to the implementation of both the women and peace and security agenda, and the youth, peace and security agenda.\nOur vision of the future and humankind relies on a strong and efficient Organization that is up to the challenges of the new era and is capable of adapting to new realities. As a country that started using the Delivering as One integrated cooperation model in 2009 and is directly experiencing its benefits, we support the processes initiated by the Secretary-General to reform the Secretariat and the entire system,\nOnly through the full implementation of the required steps for reform, an integrated and coherent approach and sustainable financing can the work of our global Organization be more efficient and effective. Preconditions for a successful United Nations lie in flexibility, understanding and respecting the needs of all countries. We should work further on them.\nMontenegro today is a multi-ethnic democracy with dynamic economic development, a member of NATO and far advanced in the negotiations for European Union membership. Montenegro is, above all, a good and responsible neighbour whose role is recognized as an important factor for regional stability in the Western Balkans, and whose secure future is possible only through its full integration into the European Union. A United Europe is a precondition for the security and global competitiveness of Europe.\nOur national and foreign policy priorities consist of the development and strengthening of a legally efficient, institutionally strong and economically sustainable State that is based on democratic principles, the respect for human rights and freedoms and preservation of cultural, ethnic and religious diversity. We aim to implement those priorities with clear vision, determination and consistency. That is what we are recognized for. We believe that we can be reliable on the global level and act as a strong member of the international community only if we are responsible to ourselves and act as a credible partner in the region. In that regard, Montenegro will continue to provide an active contribution to the achievement of the goals of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to congratulate Mr. Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I would also like to use the opportunity to thank Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, President of the General Assembly at its previous session.\nI would like to emphasize the importance of the current moment. Amid quite complex political and geopolitical circumstances, next year we will celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. The Organization has faced numerous challenges in the past. I believe that the General Assembly sessions have always been an opportunity to bring together leaders of different countries in order for them to share their opinions and views on the world situation and, in particular, to find optimal solutions to contemporary global challenges and problems.\nIn that respect, the United Nations has also faced the escalation of conflicts in different areas in 2019, including a major migrant and refugee crisis, followed by terrorism and violent extremism, as well as other forms of violence perpetrated by various extremist groups. There is also the issue of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which will also be discussed during this session.\nThe United Nations established the high-level political forum on sustainable development as a platform where political leaders agree on recommendations regarding sustainable development matters. This year\u2019s session of the forum was held in July, where my country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, for the first time presented its voluntary national review as part of monitoring the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the country, thereby sharing our experiences in accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nBy adopting the 2030 Agenda, Bosnia and Herzegovina has committed itself to initiating a systematic monitoring and supervision process for the implementation of that global agenda that integrates the social, economic and environmental dimensions of development. Bosnia and Herzegovina takes the view that the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda requires an agreement on foreseeable, coherent and sufficient funding to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\nFor those reasons, we believe that the achievement of the SDGs should strongly and qualitatively contribute to the eradication of poverty, the reduction of world hunger, the protection of the environment and dealing with the evident climate change. Bosnia and Herzegovina sees the United Nations 2030 Agenda and its transformative nature as an opportunity and a mechanism of change seeking to comprehensively promote the social, economic and environmental aspects of the life of the population. We therefore hope that the review of implementation activities for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Bosnia and Herzegovina will be finalized by the end of 2019 and submitted to the high-level political forum to be held in the coming years.\nBosnia and Herzegovina believes that the present time offers a special opportunity to change the course of development by creating a self-sustaining environment that will benefit everyone. It is a great honour for Bosnia and Herzegovina to be a part of that transformational agenda as a sovereign country and provide our contribution within the global family of nations. Successful cooperation with the United Nations encourages our implementation of the 2030 Agenda, which presents an opportunity for Bosnia and Herzegovina to share its own experience and lessons learned, as well as challenges and practices, on important life issues with the other United Nations Member States and contribute towards the strengthening of the international cooperation.\nActivities related to the Euro-Atlantic integration process in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the alignment of the Bosnia and Herzegovina sociopolitical system with the European Union acquis, are at the centre of political developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the country is committed to continuing its activities to stabilize the situation and accelerate the reform processes initiated. The European Commission\u2019s Opinion on Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s application for membership of the European Union is a very accurate record of all the reforms required.\nSome reforms require the voiding and annulment of the existing systemic discrimination against the citizens of my country, which is unfortunately set out in certain provisions of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as those of various legislative acts. Bosnia and Herzegovina will have to undergo a process of development in order to reach such a political level that those necessary reforms can be implemented without major sociopolitical tensions.\nFurthermore, Bosnia and Herzegovina actively contributes to regional security efforts in our region. In that regard, I would like to affirm that Bosnia and Herzegovina is a reliable, serious and determined partner of the United Nations, the European Union and NATO. We are particularly determined to strengthen the European security area. We are committed to fighting organized crime, combating terrorism and violent extremism, as well as illegal migration, and to protecting the security of national borders in terms of migration management. With regard to the international challenges of the modern times, Bosnia and Herzegovina particularly emphasizes its commitment to the global efforts to combat terrorism and violent extremism.\nIn addition to internal reforms, Bosnia and Herzegovina also focuses on strengthening regional cooperation, particularly with regard to infrastructure projects in the communications, transport and energy sectors. At the international level, Bosnia and Herzegovina is active within the United Nations and organizations such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the Central European Free Trade Agreement and other various regional initiatives. We would like to emphasize that over the previous period Bosnia and Herzegovina had a prominent and active chairmanship of the South- East European Cooperation Process regional initiative and the Migration, Asylum, Refugees Regional Initiative, where it invested additional efforts and provided an active impetus to the regional approach to facing current challenges.\nBilateral relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the neighbouring countries are at the top of our foreign policy priorities. That should be the foundation for the continuous improvement of cooperation based on mutual interest and the principles of equality, respect for one another and respect for State sovereignty and territorial integrity. The aforementioned may lead to the conclusion that the relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the neighbouring countries are good and strong. However, due to particular policies of our neighbours, we occasionally see their activities seeking to realize their own political interests within Bosnia and Herzegovina. That causes unrest and produces a degree of destabilization in my country, which is neither good nor does it contribute to the development of the desired good-neighbourly relations.\nThe United Nations has the primary responsibility for world peace and security. One should not lose sight of the interactive interdependence and complexity of the relationship between peace and security, development and cooperation and especially the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. With the increasing number of conflicts becoming progressively more complex, we are aware that the United Nations faces a number of challenges, particularly on the African continent and in the Middle East. In order to find an adequate solution to the numerous crises, Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the United Nations efforts to strengthen the preventive diplomacy sector within the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs. It is of particular importance that all disputes be resolved peacefully, as stated in Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations, which expressly requires that disputes be resolved peacefully and with the goodwill to resolve them. General Assembly and Security Council resolutions represent one form of support for such peaceful settlement of various disputes between countries.\nBosnia and Herzegovina continuously monitors such phenomena and, to the best of its ability, strengthens its capacities in the fight against terrorism, international crime and narcotics production and trafficking, as well as trafficking in human beings occurring within the framework of migration movements. Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly condemns violent extremism and terrorism in all its forms and finds all acts of extremism and terrorism, regardless of their form, motivation and perpetrators, to be criminal and unjustifiable. Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to the full implementation of all Security Council resolutions aimed at bringing persons involved in the financing, planning, preparation or commission of terrorist acts to justice.\nBearing in mind the direct correlation between security and sustainable development and the central role of the United Nations in the process of peacebuilding and the creation of basic conditions for the development of post-conflict societies, I would like to emphasize that Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the United Nations direct activities in stabilizing post-conflict societies by building and strengthening institutions, especially those in the field of the rule of law, the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, security and reintegration and reconciliation processes.\nBosnia and Herzegovina expresses its concern about the ongoing escalation of violence in the world, particularly in the Middle East. I take this opportunity to call for an end of combat activities and for the finding of peaceful solutions. Bosnia and Herzegovina is of the principled view that the protection of civilians, respect for human rights and humanitarian law are necessary priorities in international relations.\nBosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s foreign policy is focused on maintaining and promoting lasting peace and security in all parts of the world. The activities of Bosnia and Herzegovina in terms of international relations are based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, the Helsinki Final Act and other Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe documents, as well as generally accepted principles of international law. Bosnia and Herzegovina has either ratified or successively adopted the most significant international documents in this field and is ready for full cooperation with other countries, both within relevant multilateral organizations and initiatives, as well as bilaterally, in order to effectively combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of deployment.\nBosnia and Herzegovina also advocates all general positions in terms of promoting and supporting all realistic and effective ideas that will lead to the ultimate goal, which is a world without nuclear weapons. In accordance with the obligations arising from the provisions of the Security Council resolution 1540 (2004), regarding preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of transport, Bosnia and Herzegovina focuses on fulfilling its commitments, with an emphasis on strengthening dialogue and non-proliferation cooperation on mass destruction, as well as various forms of regional cooperation.\nBosnia and Herzegovina explicitly opposes providing any support to non-State actors and entities seeking to develop, procure, produce, possess, transport, transfer or use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their means of transfer. Furthermore, we actively and directly contribute to United Nations peacekeeping missions, one of the most visible components of the United Nations. As a sovereign country that attaches particular importance to peacekeeping missions, Bosnia and Herzegovina best demonstrates its participation and commitment to peacekeeping through its involvement in United Nations and NATO peacekeeping missions. Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomes the commitment of the United Nations to supporting the participation of women in peacekeeping missions. I would like to point out with particular pleasure that we are one of the few countries that has been fulfilling its stated goals for a long time, that is, more than 20 per cent of women participating in peacekeeping missions.\nI would particularly like to point out that the Agreement on the Suppression of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse was signed on 10 January between the United Nations and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Agreement obliges my country to hold everyone responsible, civilian or uniformed, for all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations peacekeeping or other humanitarian operations, including support for a zero-tolerance policy towards such type of deviant behaviour.\nThe international legal framework is the starting point to exercise the rights of a child, and the international Convention on the Rights of the Child is the fundamental instrument to determine the legal framework and policies of the countries that are parties to the Convention, which focus on addressing the issues of the rights of a child. The country programme 2015- 2019 between UNICEF and Bosnia and Herzegovina is particularly important, as it further contributes to the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as well as the development agenda beyond 2015.\nRacial discrimination, as well as other forms of discrimination, is insufficiently regulated by the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, such deviant phenomena are referenced through several features of criminal offences within the criminal legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as lower levels of Government. That clearly demonstrates the commitment of the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to respect the human rights of all citizens who live there, as well as permanently resident aliens or aliens granted temporary residence on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with respect to all principles of mutual tolerance.\nHowever, as I said earlier, certain provisions providing for systemic discrimination remain in the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as established in the four judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, in the Sejdic-Finci, Zornic, Pilav and Slaku cases, as well as the European Commission\u2019s Opinion on Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s application for membership of the European Union.\nBosnia and Herzegovina must provide for constitutional reforms as well as reforms of various laws in order to meet the European standard, which is the equality of all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in all aspects of life. Such action will require the agreement of domestic political actors to remove obstacles to the continuation of the process of integration into the European Union.\nIn the area of trafficking in human beings, a comprehensive and multidisciplinary action plan to combat trafficking in human beings in Bosnia and Herzegovina for the period 2016-2019 aims to improve the support system for combating trafficking in human beings in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We will further modernize the plan and prepare a new one for the coming period.\nThe rule of law and international law are firmly established in the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, which is the very foundation of the Organization. Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to promoting the rule of law at all levels, national, regional and international, and firmly committed to contributing towards the building, strengthening and full respect of international law, including human rights and international humanitarian law. I would therefore like to affirm that Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to respecting its international obligations. That is very important for our contribution to the comprehensive development, preservation and maintenance of peace and the promotion of human rights, fundamental freedoms and sustainable development.\nBosnia and Herzegovina fully cooperates with the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, which has taken over functions from the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, including judicial functions, the enforcement of sanctions, the relocation of released individuals and the protection of victims and witnesses. The authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina remain committed to ensuring that all persons suspected of war crimes on the territory of the former Yugoslavia be brought to justice.\nBosnia and Herzegovina hereby reaffirms its commitment to continuing negotiations on United Nations reform in accordance with the final document of the 2005 New York World Summit of Heads of State and Government (resolution 60/1). Reform of the United Nations system is necessary but such reform must be carried out with extreme care and the broadest consensus of Member States. Bosnia and Herzegovina shares the view that developing countries are underrepresented in the Security Council, which is an appropriate point to hear and discuss the specific issues and problems of developing countries.\nGiven the sensitivity of the issue, Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to reaching a compromise solution. Given that the number of Eastern European countries has more than doubled, we expect the reformed Security Council to be expanded, with additional seats for non-permanent members of the Group of Eastern European States. Bosnia and Herzegovina also supports the greater representation of African countries, as well as small and medium-sized developing countries, including the small island developing countries.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, it is my pleasure to sincerely congratulate the President and his friendly country, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, on his election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, and to assure him of our full support in facilitating his work. I also want to take this opportunity to express our appreciation for his predecessor\u2019s outstanding efforts during her presidency of the previous session and to pay tribute to the enormous efforts of the Secretary-General in leading our deep-rooted Organization.\nAnyone who has studied the work of the United Nations over the past seven decades and more has arrived at an essential conclusion, which is that the United Nations has been able to address many of the serious challenges and chronic crises that the world has faced. It is the safe haven that works to put an end to differences and ensure a logic of peace based on diplomacy in order to save succeeding generations from the scourge of conflicts and wars.\nSince its inception, the State of Kuwait has maintained a foreign policy based on the foundations of peace. As Kuwait\u2019s recent non-permanent membership of the Security Council drew to an end, we concluded that through our direct involvement and interaction with the overall issues, both chronic and urgent, we became more aware of the importance of reinforcing dialogue and pluralism in order to address global challenges. The United Nations is the ideal place for addressing such issues. In that regard we reiterate Kuwait\u2019s position, which supports the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations with a view to ensuring the continuity of the work of the Organization and the effectiveness of its output and, in turn, guaranteeing the implementation of its ambitious mandate for the maintenance of international peace and security.\nThis year the Arab Gulf region has been hit with a series of acts of terrorism and subversion that have threatened freedom of navigation in that vital region of the world and undermined the flow of energy supplies. They include the recent attacks on 14 September on the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and particularly those that targeted its vital installations. We once again strongly condemn those terrorist attacks and reaffirm Kuwait\u2019s full support for all the measures that Saudi Arabia is taking to preserve its security and stability. We also once again urge the international community to assume its responsibilities for ensuring and protecting freedom of navigation in this important part of the world and committing to compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. That in turn would help to maintain international peace and security.\nThe Palestinian question occupies a central and pivotal place in the Arab and Islamic worlds. If it continues to go unresolved, it will increase the tensions and instability in the region. It is therefore vital that we continue making every possible effort to relaunch serious negotiations within a specific time frame aimed at achieving a just and comprehensive peace that is based on the principle of a two-State solution, the terms of reference of the peace process, the resolutions of international legitimacy and the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative.\nIt is also crucial to end the Israeli occupation and establish an independent Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, within the pre-1967 borders. Furthermore, all of Israel\u2019s practices violating the sanctity of religious sites, and all of its settlement activities on occupied Palestinian territories, must come to an end. At the same time, we emphasize that any settlement, deal or unilateral solution outside the framework of those terms of reference will only prolong the Palestinian question and exacerbate its consequences.\nThe developments in the Syrian crisis, which has entered its ninth year with all its human suffering, are a true testament to the lack of an international consensus on the issue and the absence of a dialogue between the parties. That has been the main reason for the protraction of this bloody conflict. From this rostrum, we reiterate our firm position that there can be no military solution to the crisis and stress the importance of working on a political settlement in line with the relevant Security Council decisions, particularly resolution 2254 (2015), and the Geneva communique (S/2012/522, annex), in order to meet the aspirations and ambitions of our brother people of Syria.\nThe continuing crisis in Yemen represents a remarkable indication of the reality of how to deal with the relevant resolutions and outcomes of the Security Council. However, despite the resumption of the negotiations among the parties to the crisis and the conclusion of the Stockholm Agreement at the end of last year, the stalemate and the non-implementation of the Agreement still prevail. We want to emphasize that there can be no military solution to this crisis, either. We support the efforts of the United Nations to facilitate the political process and reiterate our readiness to host our Yemeni brothers for another round of consultations in Kuwait under the Organization\u2019s auspices, with a view to reaching a comprehensive and definitive political agreement, which should be based on the three agreed terms of reference \u2014 the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism, the outcomes of the National Dialogue Conference, and the relevant Security Council resolutions, specifically resolution 2216 (2015) \u2014 in order to end the crisis and preserve the security, stability and territorial integrity of Yemen.\nBased on the principle of consolidating good-neighbourly relations as promoted in the Charter of the United Nations, we once again call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to undertake serious confidence-building measures aimed at starting a dialogue built on respect for the sovereignty of States and non-interference in their internal affairs in order to reduce tensions in the Gulf region and maintain the safety of maritime navigation. That could help to establish relations based on cooperation and mutual respect, reflecting the aspirations of all the States of the region to live in security and stability and ensure their peoples\u2019 welfare and development.\nThere can be no doubt that the growing problem of terrorism and violent extremism is one of the most formidable and dangerous challenges facing the international system. The Middle East in particular has suffered from the subversive acts of terrorist groups, foremost of which is Da\u2019esh, which has used Islam as a cover for its destructive intentions. That has been a direct reason for the appeals to the international community to intensify its efforts to combat that very real threat in all its forms and manifestations, to cut off its resources, eliminate its funding and implement international and regional conventions on combating terrorism. In the light of that imminent danger\u2019s potential for worsening in several countries of our region, particularly Yemen, Libya, Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan, we should consider the experience of our brother country of Iraq, which suffered the most from Da\u2019esh\u2019s atrocities, and where such efforts had a concrete impact on eliminating the terrorist group from Iraqi territory. The international community played a major role in that regard, in cooperation with the Iraqi Government.\nFour years ago, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, one of the most remarkable and important achievements of the United Nations and a complement to the Millennium Development Goals. It is people-centred and aimed at enabling countries to achieve the desired outcomes. In taking on its international responsibilities in that regard, the State of Kuwait submitted its first voluntary national review for 2019 regarding the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals during the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. It is a demonstration of the political will of the leaders of our country, as specifically instructed by His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, to strengthen our commitment to international partnership and solidarity as part of our Government\u2019s policies in the short-, medium- and long-term. The aim is to achieve the highest possible levels of sustainable development and to objectively link them to Kuwait\u2019s Vision 2035 and the 2030 Agenda.\nWe in the State of Kuwait strive to create an environment conducive to attracting high-quality investments from all over the world. We are extremely pleased with the remarkable progress that has been achieved over the past years. That progress is the result of intensive effort and the enactment of a number of laws and measures undertaken by Kuwait. They have yielded the desired positive effects. We look forward to promoting the State of Kuwait\u2019s position through international indicators, including the ease-of-doing-business index issued annually by the World Bank Group.\n"

        "file_name": "NAM_74_2019.txt",
        "file_text": "We are gathered here as leaders of the global community, as we have done for the past 74 years, since the signing of the Charter of the United Nations in San Francisco. The United Nations has been a beacon of hope for those who yearn for freedom, independence, peace, decent livelihoods and dignified lives. It has been a daunting task to deliver on the hopes of all the world\u2019s people. Although there have been shortcomings, we have avoided a return to the darkness that necessitated the birth of this Organization. Through multilateralism, we have consistently steered the world away from the precipice of calamity by placing a premium on peace.\nPeace is a deep-rooted commitment to the principles of liberty, justice, equality and solidarity among all human beings. It is also a harmonious partnership of humankind with the environment. Those statements emanate from the International Congress on Peace in the Minds of Men, held more than 30 years ago at the initiative of UNESCO, when the people of the world anticipated a twenty-first century in which the ethos of international solidarity and harmony would reach a crowning moment.\nToday, as we debate our theme, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, we see a need for introspection. Considering the realities of the world today, we must ask ourselves if we can eradicate poverty, act consequentially on climate change or achieve socioeconomic inclusion without peace. We must ponder those burning questions as we look ahead to celebrating the seventy-fifth anniversary of our Organization next year.\nMr. President, you hail from a sister country of ours whose principled and generous contribution to Africa\u2019s decolonization process is unquestionable. I want to congratulate you and your country, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, and to assure you of Namibia\u2019s support and cooperation during your tenure. I also want to express Namibia\u2019s appreciation to your predecessor, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her sterling stewardship of our Organization during her term of office.\nI would like to commend the Secretary-General for his excellent stewardship of our Organization, which, under his able leadership, continues to be at the forefront of safeguarding the welfare and security of the people and nations of the world. The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2019, his detailed discussion of progress towards the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, indicates that poverty is still on the rise worldwide, compounded by multiple factors, including natural disasters. That threatens the economies of our nations and jeopardizes the aspirations of developing nations, exacerbating inequalities and plunging our people into further poverty and despair.\nDespite those realities, Namibia is making inroads into eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities in income and wealth. Our Government allocates a high percentage of resources to the social sectors, including universal access to education and a highly subsidized health-care system, with the aim of reversing the effects of a skewed economy. Those investments have attained a measure of success. Within a period of 22 years, poverty in Namibia declined from a 70 per cent baseline to 18 per cent in 2016, with 400,000 of our citizens lifted out of poverty since our independence. According to the June 2017 World Bank report Does fiscal policy benefit the poor and reduce inequality in Namibia?, Namibia\u2019s gradual decline in poverty is attributable to a targeted policy framework that includes \u201ca well-developed programme of cash transfers to vulnerable segments of the population\u201d. The administration of social safety nets has been a cornerstone of our multi-pronged fight against poverty.\nNamibia remains one of the most unequal societies in the world, which attests to the deeply embedded structural nature of the problems we inherited from apartheid oppression. The status quo is not sustainable, and Namibia is taking steps to build a more inclusive society. At this juncture, I want to draw attention to the difficult situation that so-called higher-middle-income countries are encountering. That classification is based on a country\u2019s gross domestic product, which in Namibia\u2019s case, when divided by our small population, results in a high per capita income and our labelling as a rich country, ignoring the fact that a majority of our people, however, are still suffering from the hangover of apartheid. It is therefore a flawed formula that requires urgent reconsideration.\nThis year has brought the reality of climate change to the shores of every continent. We have witnessed numerous weather events around the world that have caused immense destruction and human suffering. We want to express our solidarity with all the people whose lives have been upended by these adverse events. Namibia is currently in a state of emergency owing to a severe, widespread and prolonged period of drought that has had a damaging effect on the livelihoods of our people. I declared the emergency, and I would like to thank all the countries that have responded and come to our assistance. With that in mind, Namibia hereby reiterates its commitment to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities should guide our commitment to tackling global environmental challenges.\nIn the quest for global peace, the African Union (AU) and the United Nations are solid partners in conflict resolution. That cooperation has helped to silence the guns in many parts of Africa. Those efforts are informed by our understanding that without peace our ability to realize the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 and the recently launched African Continental Free Trade Area will be undermined.\nWe cannot talk about leaving no one behind when we live in a world in which the people of the Western Sahara and Palestine have indeed been left behind. Informed by the anti-colonial struggle in our region and the international solidarity extended to us during our struggle, the Southern African Development Community convened a solidarity conference in March in South Africa for the Polisario Front and the people of Western Sahara, at which we reiterated our unwavering commitment to the people of Western Sahara\u2019s right to self-determination and freedom. Similarly, the people of Palestine have a fundamental right to self-determination and independence. We must achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, with the establishment of two States that coexist in an atmosphere of peace and security.\nWith regard to Cuba, we are disappointed that we have regressed from the thawing of relations that we witnessed a few years ago. We renew our call for the lifting of the outdated economic and financial embargo on Cuba and further call for lifting the sanctions on Zimbabwe, in support of its pursuit for economic development, unity and prosperity. We also want to express our solidarity with the Government and the people of Venezuela and to commend the Kingdom of Norway\u2019s mediation efforts in that regard.\nThe seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations next year will present an opportunity for concluding the reform of the Security Council. In order to reposition the Council to effectively address the new and emerging challenges of international peace and security, we must conclude the intergovernmental negotiation process. In that regard, Namibia reiterates the African common position on Security Council reform, as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, and extends its appreciation to the Member States that have embraced it.\nI have a deeply held conviction that inclusivity spells harmony, while exclusivity spells conflict. If we exclude one group or one race, there will be conflict, and if we are inclusive in governance and other areas, there will be harmony. We therefore cannot afford to leave out the majority of the world\u2019s population in our pursuit of prosperity. Without the full involvement of women and young people, we are missing an opportunity to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. It is that understanding that guides Namibia\u2019s commitment to reaching gender parity at the highest levels of governance and leadership. I want to state from this rostrum that following our upcoming elections on 27 November, we hope that our Parliament, which is currently 47 per cent women, will reach a 50/50 gender balance. Moreover, as I hope to be re-elected and form a new Government, I also want to say from this rostrum that my Cabinet will also have to achieve a 50/50 percentage. We are approaching the twentieth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security, which was originally adopted under Namibia\u2019s presidency of the Security Council (see S/PV.4208). As we prepare to assess the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda, we welcome the increased participation of women in United Nations and AU peacekeeping operations.\nA few days ago, young people converged here to demand consequential climate action that can safeguard the planet. They presented innovative ideas and expressed their desire and commitment to spearheading the process of finding lasting solutions to this existential threat. Their actions reflect their concern for the future of this planet. The process of finding solutions must be inclusive in order to leverage the participation of young people. We heed the call of those young people. The future is in their hands. Next year we will gather here to commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the establishment of this global parliament of the people. It is my hope that the outcomes of those deliberations will galvanize concrete efforts to arrest and reverse the existential threat of climate change. Namibia is a country that can attest to the effects of climate change, as it is indeed a reality in our country. Let us draw inspiration from the poignant words of Martin Luther King, Jr., who said, \u201cIf we are to have peace on earth, our loyalties must ... transcend our race, tribe, class and our nation; and this means we must develop a world perspective.\u201d\nWe have a responsibility to establish a world that transcends racism, tribalism and nationalism. We must bequeath to our children a world that is more peaceful, inclusive and prosperous, a world in which they can access opportunities to employ their gifts and talents, each according to his or her ability. The future hinges on their participation, and we must ensure that they are no longer on the fringes of decision-making, but instead at the forefront in galvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion.\nIn conclusion, as I have said, the future is in the hands of our young people. They should not attack us, because we are working together, as we are doing now. We are taking care of this world in order to leave it in their good hands.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate the President on his well-deserved election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, and to wish him and the Secretary-General good luck and every success.\nAt the outset, I want to commemorate the freedom-seeking movement of Hossein and pay homage to all the seekers of freedom of the world who do not bow to oppression or aggression and who tolerate all the hardships of the struggle for rights, as well as to the spirits of all the oppressed martyrs of terrorist strikes and bombings in Yemen, Syria, occupied Palestine, Afghanistan and other countries, including Iraq.\nThe Middle East is burning amid the flames of war, bloodshed, aggression, occupation and religious and sectarian fanaticism and extremism, a situation in which the oppressed people of Palestine are the biggest victims, as acts of discrimination, the expropriation of land, settlement expansion and killings continue against them. The plans that the United States and the Zionists have imposed on them, such as the deal of the century that recognized Beit Al-Maqdis as the capital of the Zionist regime and the addition of the Syrian Golan to the other occupied territories, are certainly doomed.\nIn the face of issues such as the destructive plans of the United States, the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s regional and international assistance and cooperation on security and counter-terrorism have been quite decisive. That approach is clearly exemplified in our cooperation on the Syrian crisis with Russia and Turkey in the Astana format, and our peace proposal for Yemen, based on our active cooperation with the Special Envoys of the Secretary-General, as well as our efforts to facilitate reconciliation talks among the parties in Yemen with four European countries, which resulted in the conclusion of the Stockholm Agreement on Al-Hudaydah port.\nI come from a country that has resisted the most merciless economic terrorism and defended its right to independence and the development of science and technology. While imposing extraterritorial sanctions and threats on other nations, the United States Government, has tried very hard to deprive Iran of the advantages of participation in the global economy and has resorted to international piracy by misusing the international banking system. We Iranians have been pioneers for freedom-seeking movements in the region while seeking peace and progress for our own nation as well as our neighbours. We have never surrendered to foreign aggression or imposition. We cannot believe in an invitation to negotiations from people who claim to have applied the harshest sanctions in history to the detriment of the dignity and prosperity of our nation. How can one believe in that in the face of the silent killing of a great nation and efforts to exert pressure on the lives of 83 million Iranians \u2014 particularly women and children \u2014 by United States officials, who pride themselves on such pressures and have become addicted to exploiting sanctions against a spectrum of countries that includes Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, China and Russia? The Iranian nation will never forget or forgive those crimes and criminals.\nThe attitude of the current United States Administration to the nuclear deal, otherwise known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), not only violates the provisions of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015) but also constitutes a breach of the sovereignty and political and economic independence of all the world\u2019s countries. Despite the United States withdrawal from the JCPOA, for a full year Iran remained fully faithful to all of its nuclear commitments under the agreement. Out of respect for the Security Council\u2019s resolution, we provided Europe with the opportunity to fulfil its 11 commitments in compensation for the United States\u2019 withdrawal. Unfortunately, however, we heard only beautiful words and witnessed no effective measures. It is now clear to all that the United States reneges on all of its commitments, and that Europe is unable, indeed incapable, of fulfilling its commitments. We even adopted a step-by-step approach in implementing paragraphs 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, and we remain committed to our promises in the deal.\nHowever, there is a limit to our patience. When the United States does not respect the resolutions of the Security Council and Europe cannot act, the only option left is to rely on national dignity, pride and strength. They call us to negotiations while they run away from treaties and deals. We negotiated with the current United States Administration at the negotiating table with the Security Council permanent five, Germany and the European Union, but it failed to honour the commitment made by its predecessor. On behalf of my nation and State, I want to announce that our response to any negotiations conducted under sanctions is negative. The Government and people of Iran have remained steadfast against extremely harsh sanctions in the past year and a half and will never negotiate with an enemy that seeks to make Iran surrender with the weapons of poverty, pressure and sanctions.\nIf members of the General Assembly require a positive answer, the only way for talks to begin is to return to commitments and compliance, as declared by the leader of the Islamic Revolution. If there is sensitivity to the name the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, there should be a return to its framework and compliance with Security Council resolution 2231 (2015). Stop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations.\nI would like to make it crystal clear: if the minimum is satisfactory, we will also content ourselves with the minimum, on either side. However, if more is required, more should also be paid. If members stand by their word that they have only one demand for Iran, that is, the non-production and non-utilization of nuclear weapons, that could easily be attained under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency and, more importantly, with a fatwa of the Iranian leader. Instead of a show of negotiation, there should a return to the reality of negotiation. Memorial photographs are at the last stage of negotiations, not the first.\nDespite all the obstructions created by the United States Government, we in Iran remain on the path of economic and social growth and prosperity. In 2017 Iran\u2019s economy registered the highest economic growth rate in the world. Today, despite fluctuations emanating from foreign interference in the past year and a half, we have returned to the track of growth and stability. Iran\u2019s gross domestic product without oil has again become positive in recent months and the country\u2019s trade balance remains positive.\nThe security doctrine of the Islamic Republic of Iran is based on maintaining peace and stability in the Persian Gulf and on providing freedom of navigation and safety of movement in the Strait of Hormuz. Recent incidents have seriously endangered such security. Security and peace in the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz could be provided with the participation of the countries of the region and the free flow of oil and other energy resources could be guaranteed provided that we consider security as an umbrella in all areas for all the countries.\nIn line with the historical responsibility of my country in maintaining security, peace, stability and progress in the Persian Gulf region and the Strait of Hormuz, I should like to invite all countries directly affected by the developments in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz to the coalition for hope within the Hormuz Peace Endeavour. The goal of the coalition for hope is to promote peace, stability, progress and welfare for all residents of the Strait of Hormuz region and to enhance mutual understanding and peaceful and friendly relations among them. The initiative includes various areas for cooperation, such as the collective supply of energy security, freedom of navigation and the free transfer of oil and other resources to and from the Strait of Hormuz and beyond.\nThe coalition for hope is based on important principles, such as compliance with the goals and principles of the United Nations, mutual respect, an equal footing, dialogue, understanding, respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, the inviolability of international borders and the peaceful settlement of all disputes, as well as, more importantly, the two fundamental principles of non-aggression and non-interference in the domestic affairs of each other. The presence of the United Nations seems necessary so as to establish an international umbrella in support of the coalition for hope. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran will provide more details of the coalition for hope to the beneficiary States (see S/PV.8626).\nThe formation of any security coalition or initiative under any title in the region with the centrality and command of foreign forces is a clear example of interference in the affairs of the region. The securitization of navigation is in contravention of the right to free navigation and the right to development and will escalate tensions, further complicate conditions and increase the mistrust in the region while jeopardizing regional peace, security and stability.\nThe security of our region will be realized when American troops pull out. Security will not be provided by American weapons and intervention. After 18 years, the United States has failed to reduce acts of terrorism. However, the Islamic Republic of Iran managed to terminate the scourge of Da\u2019esh with the assistance of neighbouring nations and Governments. The ultimate way to achieve peace and security in the Middle East involves inward democracy and outward diplomacy. Security cannot be purchased or supplied by foreign Governments.\nThe peace, security and independence of our neighbours are our peace, security and independence. America is not our neighbour. It is the Islamic Republic of Iran that is the neighbour, and we have long been taught that neighbours come first, then comes the home. In the event of an incident, the international community and we will remain alone. We are neighbours with each other, not with the United States.\nThe United States is located here, not in the Middle East. The United States is not the advocate of any nation, neither is it the guardian of any State. In fact, States do not delegate the power of attorney to other States and do not bestow custodianship on others. If the flames of the fire of Yemen have today spread to Hijaz, the warmonger should be sought and punished rather than levelling allegations and grudges against the innocent. The security of Saudi Arabia will be ensured through the termination of aggression against Yemen rather than by inviting foreigners. We are ready to exert our national strength, regional credibility and international authority.\nThe solution for peace in the Arabian peninsula, security in the Persian Gulf and stability in the Middle East should be sought inside the region rather than outside it. The issues of the region are too great and important for the United States to be able to resolve. The United States has failed to resolve the issues in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria and has been the supporter of extremism, Talibanism and Da\u2019eshism. Such a Government is clearly unable to resolve today\u2019s more sophisticated issues.\nOur region is on the brink of collapse \u2014 a single blunder could fuel a conflagration. We will not tolerate the provocative intervention of foreigners. We will respond decisively and strongly to any transgression against, or violation of, our security and territorial integrity. However, the alternative and proper solution for us is to strengthen consolidation among all the nations with common interests in the Persian Gulf and the Hormuz region.\nThis is the message of the Iranian nation: let us invest in hope towards a better future rather than in war and violence. Let us return to justice, peace, law, commitment and promise and, ultimately, to the negotiating table.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my honour and privilege to address the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. The breadth and depth of the deliberations held over the past week has reminded us of the unique importance of the General Assembly. No other platform affords the full expression of such a diversity of voices and views. No other venue brings the world together like this.\nThe challenges we face today are systemic and global. They know no national boundaries. No single State, no matter how big or how strong, can succeed by acting in isolation or even bilaterally. Moreover, it is also now clear to most people that Governments acting alone cannot deliver the benefits of multilateralism themselves. Public policies and public resources, although absolutely essential, are insufficient to tackle challenges like climate change and inequality or to fully achieve sustainable development.\nIn order to deliver results to people everywhere, multilateralism must be more inclusive and innovative than ever. We must break out of our silos. Strengthening multilateralism means involving all stakeholders. Governments should indeed lead, but the ideas and participation of youth, women, indigenous peoples, entrepreneurs and other members of civil society are critical in fostering the kind of innovation we need to succeed as a global community. This is not simply because our challenges are common, but rather because the potential solutions and gains are all collective. To realize them, we need to work together.\nWhat took place at the United Nations last week brings hope. It was all about diversifying the voices around the United Nations and about fostering innovative partnerships. This high-level week began with youth from all over the world sounding the alarm over climate change and demanding urgent action, leadership and accountability. We heard young people from Tuvalu, Kiribati, Marshall Islands and places across the Pacific describe living in constant fear, not knowing whether their homelands will still be capable of supporting human life by 2030. These young men and women travelled thousands of kilometres with a simple message: \u201cSave the Pacific, save the world\u201d. I want them to know that Canada has heard their message. The message echoed loudly in Montreal and throughout Canada on Friday when hundreds of thousands of young people went on strike and marched in the streets during the largest protest of its kind ever held in our country.\nAt the Climate Action Summit, we heard that the power to change course lies in our hands. Readily available solutions exist here and now, which, if pursued, could eliminate 70 per cent of global emissions.\nDuring the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, we heard loud and clear that all our efforts must be channelled towards fulfilling our shared objectives of people, planet and prosperity for a world that leaves no one behind. At the Small island developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway mid-term review, we were reminded of the special vulnerabilities of small island developing States and how they are at great risk. At the high- level meeting on universal health coverage, we heard about the powerful impact that health care can have on prosperity, not just for individuals but for entire nations. A lack of coverage keeps people in poverty and away from achieving their economic potential.\nCanada was proud to co-facilitate the High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development, together with our close partner, Ghana. Through this process, we learned how the poorest and most vulnerable countries are confronting unsustainable levels of debt, and we learned how the decline in correspondent banking relationships poses an existential threat to the nations of the Caribbean and the Pacific. We learned how the scourge of illicit financial flows continues to rob developing countries of the financial resources they need to invest in their peoples\u2019 future. But we also learned that the world has more than enough financial resources to make the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) a reality. The problems are coordination and connection. We need urgently to address the discrepancy between where the financial resources are and where they are needed most.\nSolving this mismatch must be a collective priority, here at the United Nations and at home. Doing so is the key to achieving all of what we have set out to accomplish this week \u2014 from climate action and universal health care to the vision of the inclusive, people-centred sustainable prosperity that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development seeks to establish. Together with Jamaica, Canada founded the Group of Friends of SDG Financing because we are committed to finding ways to mobilize the necessary resources from the public, private and philanthropic sectors in order to achieve the SDGs by 2030.\nThat is why Canada and Jamaica teamed up with Denmark, the United Nations Development Programme and the University of Maryland to launch the Closing the Investment Gap Initiative, which is focusing on helping developing countries to build sustainable infrastructure faster. It is working: nine developing- country investment teams have brought forward 13 high-priority, sustainable infrastructure projects representing an aggregate capital investment of approximately $4.3 billion.\nIndeed, Canada has been working vigorously with partners to generate momentum for financing sustainable development, and we are starting to see the result. New actors are entering the space, including banks and impact investors that are increasingly willing to work with public financing and philanthropists.\nAs the general debate at this session draws to a close, Canada continues to reflect on all that we have heard over the course of the past week. We want our fellow Member States and the global citizens who journeyed here to know that we listened and that we heard them. We listened to President Macky Sail of Senegal say that Africa does not need tutoring; Africa needs partnerships (see A/74/PV.4). We hear him, and we agree.\nWe listened to President Taneti Maamau of Kiribati say that the real measure of the United Nations is not the number of resolutions, but how many disadvantaged people are better off as a result (see A/74/PV.6). That is the reason we gather here. We hear him, and we agree.\nWe listened to Prime Minister Joseph Muscat of Malta say that women\u2019s roles in society have been underestimated, underacknowledged and at times even unrecognized (see A/74/PV.8). We hear him, and we agree.\nWe listened to you, Mr. President, when you said that evidence abounds that we can do great things if we are courageous, steadfast and show empathy (see A/74/ PV.3). We hear you, and we agree.\nWe listened when our Secretary-General reminded us that we are here to serve. We heard him call on each of us to restore trust, rebuild hope and move ahead together (ibid.). We hear him, and we agree. We are all here to serve our citizens and the planet and to move ahead, together \u2014 united as nations and as partners. A strong United Nations is to everyone\u2019s advantage, as is an effective Security Council capable of adapting and responding to twenty-first century challenges. Canada wants to do its part in support of this goal.\nNowhere is the need more urgent than in those places where fragility and violence directly affect millions of people. The General Assembly knows very well where political solutions are desperately needed to stop mass atrocities and to bring durable solutions to protracted crises so generations of people can return, in safety and dignity, to their homes, so they can have hope and prosper and thrive.\nPeople in Syria, Yemen, Venezuela and countless other places rightly look to the blue-and-white flag of the United Nations with hope, but, too often, also with frustration and even anger. We have a responsibility to serve them. We need to do more to help. All hope, however, is not lost. We should acknowledge with admiration and respect that the United Nations can act, and is acting, as a force for peace in many parts of the world.\nThe high-level events convened last week by the Governments of Burkina Faso, Mali, Somalia and the Sudan demonstrate a genuine desire for partnership in support of peace. It is in the interest of the Organization and its Member States to respond to their legitimate expectations. We should accompany them in their pursuit of sustainable peace and prosperity for their peoples.\nCanada is prepared to do its part. We want to help develop forward-looking approaches to the world\u2019s toughest problems. We want to bring our uniquely diverse experience to bear in support of truly global solutions while fully respecting local leadership. We hope to contribute to a new multilateralism where benefits are distributed more broadly, more evenly and more fairly; where commitments are fulfilled; and where implementation is achieved and the results experienced by the people. We intend to do this by earning a seat on a Security Council that truly serves the interests of all Member States.\nShould members choose to elect us, Canada can be counted on to do what it has always done: ask the tough questions, actively listen to the answers, stand up for what matters, be clear and consistent, and unite rather than divide. We are fully committed to bringing innovative ideas to prevent and respond to crises, and we firmly believe in the power of multilateral solutions and partnership to address the most intractable of global challenges.\nAs a member of the Security Council, we will focus on five priority areas.\nThe first is to sustain peace, together. We support the Secretary-General\u2019s vision in this regard \u2014 full stop. Prevention and peacebuilding are essential components of an effective approach. A Canadian, former Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, was at the heart of the creation of the first United Nations peacekeeping force, more than 60 years ago. Since then, more than 125,000 Canadians have served abroad in support of United Nations peacekeeping operations.\nWe are the longstanding chair of the Working Group of the Whole of the United Nations Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, bringing troop- and police-contributing countries, financial donors and host States together to improve the vital collective endeavour that is twenty-first-century United Nations peacekeeping. We will continue to drive innovation in this space, just as we did with smart pledges and the Vancouver Principles.\nWe have served as a member of the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission and Chair of the Sierra Leone configuration for more than a decade. Our ongoing support in this capacity for Sierra Leone\u2019s nationally led recovery and development has contributed to sustainable peace in that country.\nWe are proud of our record, but we have also drawn inspiration from the work of many, many others. We are grateful for Jordan\u2019s prescient efforts in 2015 to establish a new, and necessary, agenda on youth, peace and security. We support Equatorial Guinea in drawing the Security Council\u2019s attention to the African Union\u2019s critically important Silencing the Guns initiative. We pay tribute to Kuwait for successfully bringing forward the first-ever Security Council resolution on missing persons in armed conflict, and to Poland for having expanded the Council\u2019s protection-of-civilians agenda \u2014 which Canada spearheaded 20 years ago \u2014 to also include persons with disabilities in conflict. These action-oriented initiatives demonstrate what can be accomplished by elected members of the Security Council working together.\nCanada\u2019s second priority is to address climate change, together.\nClimate change is the defining issue of our time, an existential threat like no other. It is an environmental issue, an economic issue and, as it endangers the lives and livelihoods of citizens around the world, one of the greatest security challenges of the twenty-first century.\nFor that reason, we listened carefully to the views expressed during the open debate organized by the Dominican Republic under its recent presidency of the Security Council on addressing the impacts of climate-related disasters on international peace and security (see S/PV.8451). Like most Member States, we, too, are convinced that climate change is a risk amplifier for security. It is a cause of conflict and unrest, and as it worsens, it will leave millions of people displaced, hungry and vulnerable to disease and weather-induced disaster. The Security Council needs to lead the rest of the world in recognizing the urgency and necessity of acting.\nAs a country bordering on three oceans, affected by climate change and with a longstanding tradition of contributing to solutions to non-traditional security challenges, Canada brings much to the table. We hope to harness the energy, partnerships and results generated by the Sustainable Blue Economy Conference we co-hosted with Kenya and Japan in support of this goal as well.\nThirdly, Canada will use its seat on the Security Council to promote economic security, together. Investing in people and in countries to foster prosperity and equal opportunity is essential for maintaining international peace and security. Haiti is a striking example. A few months ago, I led a delegation of States Members on the Economic and Social Council Ad Hoc Advisory Group\u2019s annual visit to Haiti. We heard compelling and irrefutable evidence that exclusion and economic inequalities are the root causes of Haiti\u2019s political instability and deteriorating security situation. There can be no peace and security in Haiti when 25 per cent of the population is hungry. We shared what we learned with the Secretary-General and members of the Security Council and called on them to take the economic dimensions of Haiti\u2019s ongoing transition into greater consideration in the evolving United Nations approach. It was the right thing to do and the new special political mission will be better for it.\nThe situation in the Sahel is another striking example. Young people have too few opportunities, which in turn makes them more susceptible to extremism and to criminal and terrorist networks. As most conflicts are deeply rooted in the lack of economic opportunities, focusing on the prevention and peacebuilding agenda means looking through an economic-security lens. As a member of the Security Council, Canada will call attention to the vital links between sustainable and inclusive economic growth, job creation, conflict prevention, peacebuilding and security. We will continue to break down the silos between security and development, between Governments and the private sector, between North and South, between traditional and non-traditional partners and between United Nations organs like the Security Council and the Peacebuilding Commission, so that they can work better together, for all people.\nCanada\u2019s fourth priority is to promote gender equality together. Despite important gains, gender inequality is still widespread. Impunity, including for sexual and gender-based violence, remains a common and unacceptable feature of conflict. We know that achieving sustainable peace will only be possible through women\u2019s meaningful participation in United Nations peace operations, peace processes and peacebuilding. But progress on this front has been too slow. Canada has decided to take action, along with other donors and UN-Women, to create the Elsie Initiative Fund for Uniformed Women in Peace Operations. This new fund supports partners to substantially increase the representation of women overall and in positions of authority.\nAs we prepare to mark the twentieth anniversary of the landmark resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security, which my country closely supported while we were last on the Security Council, Canada is aligning all of its peace and security, humanitarian and development policies and programmes to truly turn a corner in relation to gender equality. We are heartened to see so many other countries also trying to make positive changes in this regard.\nCanada is proud to have a feminist foreign policy. It means we will always speak up for women\u2019s rights, everywhere in the world, even when speaking up is difficult, and we will back up our words with action. From the Elsie Initiative to working with Group of\nSeven partners to secure a $3.8 billion investment for the education of women and girls in fragile or conflict- affected countries to naming Canada\u2019s first ambassador- level position for women, peace and security and introducing a feminist international-assistance policy that brings a gender lens to almost all of Canada\u2019s international development work, we believe that the economic and political empowerment of women and girls is critical to building a safer, more prosperous and inclusive world.\nFinally, as a member of the Security Council, Canada will work with its partners to strengthen multilateralism. Over the course of almost 75 years, multilateralism has delivered impressive gains. The system of treaties, laws, norms and cooperative arrangements that have been developed to guide global affairs has prevented wars and improved lives and livelihoods. But we also know that the rules have not been evenly applied, nor have their benefits been evenly distributed. Implementing commitments remains a perennial challenge, as does translating decisions into tangible progress for people on the ground.\nMore than 70 years after their establishment, our multilateral institutions need to adapt so that they can serve all countries. Our approaches also must reflect the new realities of the world we live in. With a population of 36 million people, Canada needs and understands the importance of the rules-based international system \u2014 one in which might is not always right and in which more powerful countries have to treat smaller ones in accordance with standards that are internationally respected, enforced and upheld. That is why we are working to reform them and make them fit for purpose in the twenty-first century.\nCanada has always been a responsible global actor and strong humanitarian donor. We see the potential for positive change, at home and abroad, and are committed to working hard with others to attain it. We seek genuine partnerships with other States, the private sector and all parts of civil society, including faith leaders, academics, activists and youth. Several former Canadian Prime Ministers and special envoys from different political parties came to New York last week, together with many Canadian business leaders and investment executives. Our diverse, high-level, joint public and private sector delegation sat down with over 100 Member States and, in so doing, identified new opportunities in relation to trade and financing for development.\nCanada\u2019s multilateral engagement will continue to be characterized by a capacity to take advantage of diversity. Canadian identity is based on the fundamental principle that our differences are an asset, not an obstacle. We are home to people from over 200 ethnic origins, including many indigenous peoples with distinct and vibrant cultures. Over 200 languages from every corner of the world are spoken in Canada.\nFor that reason, we feel very much at home at the United Nations. Our country boasts a similar degree of diversity: nearly 50 per cent of the people living in Toronto, our biggest city and home to my family, were born outside Canada. The same is true of Vancouver. We treat others as friends, with respect. We believe in helping everyone to realize their full potential. But like all States, we remain a work in progress. As noted in Canada\u2019s national statement to the Assembly two years ago (see A/72/PV.12), we have much work to do to advance the rights of indigenous peoples in Canada. The path to reconciliation is hard and will take time, but we are fully committed to it.\nAlthough our record is far from perfect, we acknowledge our faults with humility and will strive to improve, including by listening to every one of us here today and learning from their experiences. We do so because we see our future as intertwined with that of the world as a whole. Canadians value the spirit of community. We bring people together and we understand that opportunities lie in the connections we share with others. We bring this hopeful energy to the United Nations \u2014 it is simply who we are.\nWe can be counted upon to keep listening to the diversity of views around the table. We can be counted upon to always make room at the table for others, irrespective of their size or stature. A voice is a voice is a voice; all should be heard. Canada is here to serve and to move ahead together \u2014 united as nations and as partners. That is the kind of Security Council member Canada would be: inclusive, innovative, open, honest and reliable, working together with all Member States for all Member States. We hope to earn the support of the Assembly to apply these principles."

        "file_text": "I have the honour to bring the warm greetings of Yokwe on behalf of the people and Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\nI congratulate the President on his election and I rest assured that he will continue the strong efforts of his predecessor.\nI also want to express my deep condolences to the people of the Bahamas and all the victims of Hurricane Dorian. They should know that, as fellow islanders, the people of the Marshall Islands stand with them.\nThe United Nations must be the platform for the voices of the most vulnerable peoples and Governments of the world. Yet we are all at a time in global politics when countries are being driven to look inwards, at the very moment when we all need to be doing the opposite. We risk the tragedy of overlooking those most in need.\nThe Marshallese people know that from our own experience. Our history with the Organization extends to its foundation and Charter of the United Nations. As a former United Nations Trust Territory, we approached the United Nations twice \u2014 in 1954 and again in 1956 \u2014 to stop the testing of nuclear weapons on our shores, and twice the United Nations disregarded our petitions, in place of resolutions authorizing nuclear detonations. Twice our voices went unheard, and twice larger political concerns overruled the protection of our human rights. As a Human Rights Council special rapporteur affirmed in 2012, this is not just a gravely difficult legacy, but a contemporary reality that continues to impact our human rights.\nI am drawing the attention of the Assembly directly to that chapter of the Marshall Islands\u2019 history to illustrate the global importance of human rights, because ours is far from the only moment at the United Nations when we, as Member States, have failed our solemn obligations to our peoples and to take meaningful and effective action to address the core human rights of those most in need, and when larger politics have so clouded our vision that the world has too often acted too little, too late or sometimes not at all.\nWe know that from our own perspective in the Pacific, but it is also a common cause embodied in the core human rights treaties and commitments that we all share. In the Marshall Islands, we have built up our own protection of human rights, not just by joining treaties but by working steadily to turn words into action. Yet we still have much to do to ensure a resilient future.\nWhen I entered politics years ago, the Marshall Islands was in its youth as a newly independent nation. We were truly nation-building. But now, as an atoll small island developing State, a nation only one metre above sea level, with no higher ground, the climate crisis now forces us to engage in nation-saving. That is not academic \u2014 it is real; it is now; and it imperils our future, security and core human rights.\nFor those reasons, the Marshall Islands will stand in two weeks\u2019 time for election to the Human Rights Council. Our experience has taught us to be not only a bridge-builder and a careful listener, but also a nation unafraid to take a strong stand when it is needed, even if it is unpopular. I truly hope that we will be judged on the strength of our conviction, the merits of all that we have accomplished on our own human rights record and all that we have committed to pursuing, and not be judged on the size of our gross domestic product or the number of chocolates that we have handed out.\nAs the Marshall Islands, we are presenting to the General Assembly what we do have: ourselves, our stories, our independent voice and our passionate belief that everyone must be held to account.\nThe Pacific Islands region is a steward of global oceans and sustainable fisheries. My own country is more than 99 per cent ocean, and, as such, for some what is a distant and obscure policy issue is for us our livelihood and identity. We look forward to concluding negotiations next year on a robust new treaty for biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction under the Law of the Sea, which provides coherence among sectors. As I reported to the Human Rights Council earlier this year, the members of our regional Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency have also recently issued a declaration to ensure that human rights are protected in our fisheries sector, including aboard foreign vessels that dominate our waters.\nFisheries in the Pacific are often a proxy for security and influence. As my President told the Group of Seven leaders last year, illegal fishing is not only an economic menace but also a threat to our sovereignty. We welcome current assistance and urge a more intensified focus on the part of our partners and the international community on combatting illegal fishing in our region. Not only does it benefit our own regional security, but it also helps to preserve global food security.\nWe welcome partner efforts to help us achieve a free, open, democratic and secure Indo-Pacific region. Our island nations worked hard to achieve independence, and maintaining our stability, sovereignty and security is a clear priority. Further, we welcome the recent issued made by the United States during the recent Pacific Islands Forum:\n\u201cThe United States recognizes that addressing environmental degradation and climate change is a priority in the Pacific... due to the threat posed by sea-level rise and the region\u2019s vulnerability to natural disasters.\u201d\nI suggest that the significance of that statement is underrecognized and that it could spur a vital and much-needed dialogue on climate change with our region.\nOur Pacific Islands Forum stands united in our leaders\u2019 adoption of the Boe Declaration as the defining regional security framework. The recent recorded vote this summer on General Assembly resolution 73/332, entitled \u201cCooperation between the United Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum\u201d, was a sad moment for both the Pacific region and the United Nations. The Member State that called for that recorded vote seems to have no shame in publicly bullying the smallest and most vulnerable nations in the world. The wider implications of that should be of grave concern to any democratic nation.\nOur health is vital. We face communicable diseases such as the ongoing nationwide dengue fever outbreak, which is worsened by climate impacts. We also face non-communicable diseases, including one of the world\u2019s highest incidence rates of diabetes. We welcome the partnership with the World Health Organization and other organizations and call urgently for greater efforts to collaborate on island-tailored strategies. We have the political will at the highest levels, but we lack the capacity and resources needed to protect our population. In that regard, we welcome the ongoing collaboration with UNICEF and the World Bank to help us study, understand and address childhood stunting and the root causes of that problem, which has hindered the physical growth, education and well-being of generations of Marshallese children. Improving childhood development in the first 1,000 days of life will have a dramatic and lasting impact on our future generations.\nThe Pacific Islands region has made positive strides but still has substantial work ahead to more effectively address gender equality. This is not just a matter of policy tools and capacity but also of political will. Even with recent legal and legislative improvements in my nation, the rates of domestic violence remain unacceptably high. Our island region has the lowest rate of women in Parliament in the world. As the nation with the first woman leader in the independent Pacific, the Marshall Islands believes that it is important for UN-Women to continue to strengthen its focus in our region and collaborate to address the root causes of gender inequality, and to do so while working within our cultural contexts.\nThere was once a time when small island nations were not recognized within the United Nations. As the meeting yesterday on the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway made clear, island nations are now well recognized as global leaders and innovators within our own right. Yet we all still have much to do in turning words into action. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a groundbreaking achievement in their use of indicators to benchmark progress towards clear targets. However, our challenge is that our small island Government is simply overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the nearly 250 SDG statistical indicators at hand. Clearly, that structure was not designed to fit the structure and capacity of small island nations, and as a result, global participation is limited to a one-size-fits-all structure. We have therefore realized in the Marshall Islands that the SDGs are a springboard and a tool to get to island-tailored strategies. We want the United Nations to work for us, and not the other way around. More targeted assistance by the United Nations system, including with regard to the statistical capacity of line ministries, is urgent.\nWe join our region in thanking the Secretary-General for his initiative in undertaking meaningful and effective United Nations system reform and his drive to succeed where others have fallen short. In particular, we emphasize the importance of the Secretary-General\u2019s advocacy in proposing to establish a new United Nations multi-country office in the North Pacific. Despite strong efforts, the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations Multi-Country Office in Fiji cannot effectively serve 10 diverse and remote nations from a single Office. Our northern subregion is missing out on existing assistance opportunities within the United Nations system because of those disconnections.\nWe are still facing challenges from the impacts of nuclear-weapons testing, and our experience should be a global lesson of the humanitarian consequences of nuclear detonation. We have been left with a devastating footprint on our health, well-being and environment and the rights of our population. That is a result of contamination that we did not cause and which we lack the capacity to fully understand, let alone address. Our recent establishment of a national nuclear commission, as well as the progress that it has made towards a work plan, are historic steps forward. But we cannot do it alone, and we call for the assistance of the Secretary-General to define a structured work plan by the United Nations system with a defined focal point within the management team at United Nations Headquarters. Accountability within the United Nations system is needed to help answer the joint call by the leaders of the Pacific Island Forum for unique and targeted assistance in addressing remediation.\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands strongly affirms its close relationship with Taiwan. The lasting friendship between our free and democratic nations is truly unstoppable. Indeed, this past month our Parliament strengthened those ties through a unanimous resolution. Further, Taiwan should play a clear role within the United Nations system that includes meaningful participation in the relevant specialized agencies and mechanisms, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the World Health Assembly and the International Civil Aviation Organization. If we as a world and the United Nations are truly serious about leaving no one behind, we should recognize the participation and assistance of all relevant sources, and thus appropriately recognize Taiwan\u2019s partnership and engagement with my own nation and others.\nFor those unfamiliar with the geography of atoll small nations like my own, coral atolls are formed by the sinking of extinct volcanoes, leaving us with thin, low-lying and narrow islands. That demands a perfect sea-level balance \u2014 one that is now upset by sea-level rise. Warming waters are leading to an increased and near-constant bleaching of coral, the survival of which, globally, is now at risk by mid-century. My nation is literally being eaten away. But we share the sentiment that we are not sinking, we are fighting. We are not helpless victims; rather, we are pushing forward our own policy tools to define the future. But will anyone respond to our dire need for assistance at scale?\nWhen I was a young boy in the Marshall Islands, the unavoidable sound of ocean waves crashing upon our coral reefs was, to me, a natural symphony. But to my grandchildren, that same sound is rapidly becoming, to them, a threat of inundation. Do they not share my same right to live in their ancestral homes? In response, I can only quote our national Constitution, that\n\u201cAll we have and are today as a people, we have received as a sacred heritage which we pledge ourselves to safeguard and maintain, valuing nothing more than our rightful home on the[se] islands.\u201d"

        "file_text": "The Kingdom of Morocco serves as a link and a meeting point for cooperation between Africa and the countries of the Islamic world, between Europe and the rest of the globe. This is due in particular to its stability and security in a region in turmoil at the political, social and security levels, and owing to the fact that we have adopted policies of economic openness and democratic values, as well as to our willingness to engage practically in addressing international challenges.\nWe are aware that the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly is taking place in an international context marked by great challenges resulting from of ruthless competition and heavy-handed strategies that provoke retaliation, instead of creative, forward-looking responses. Nevertheless, despite today\u2019s difficulties and challenges, the current situation presents opportunities for cooperation and coordination.\nWe are convinced that multilateral action is the most effective means of addressing the challenges facing today\u2019s world, which no one country has the capacity to tackle alone. Combating climate change, achieving sustainable development, coping with migration flows, addressing security challenges, fighting terrorism, countering violent extremism and human trafficking are all challenges that require cooperation through a multilateral approach. We therefore hope for the creation of an innovative system that supports the work of the United Nations and regional organizations through greater harmony and coordination as a springboard for addressing these challenges and promising a better future for humankind.\nThe multilateral action that we aspire to must also guarantee to Africa the place it deserves on the international stage. His Majesty King Mohammed VI has called time and again from this rostrum for our Organization to make Africa a high priority so that it can realize its ambitions and benefit from available opportunities. Morocco\u2019s return to its institutional family, namely, the African Union, in January 2017, is a logical culmination of this conviction alongside bilateral and regional partnerships that Morocco has established through decades with its African environment in the context of productive, effective and solidary South-South cooperation. Those partnerships include various fields at the economic, development, culture, religion and environment levels as well as combating security challenges.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco allocates two thirds of its foreign direct investment for Africa itself. We are the second largest African investor in Africa. We encourage the private sector within Morocco to draw up projects in Africa to help with technology transfer and keep up with African economies. As a signatory member of the convention on establishing African free-trade zone, Morocco is convinced that such a convention will open up new promising horizons for the African economy, making the African continent the largest free-trade market in the world.\nMultilateral action has the power to adapting to new developments and speeding up addressing challenges through first, combating security threats, including terrorism. We can do this by active and practical cooperation in a number of different ways. The action of the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum is important in this regard. My country jointly chairs the Forum together with the Netherlands since 2016. Co-chairing the Forum is a recognition of our efforts in this area.\nWe have developed a global multidimensional strategy that is in harmony with the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy while also including cultural, religious, social, human rights and security aspects. This national strategy extends across the continent as Morocco, with lofty instructions from His Majesty the Commander of the Faithful, has reached out to our brethren and friendly countries which expressed their desire to benefit from the Moroccan experience to help ensure the training of religious leaders to practice the principles of coexistence, openness and moderation.\nSecondly, migration problems should be resolved through the interaction and coordination of various countries because no one country can face the challenges of migration alone. Morocco has been regionally a pioneer by adopting a national migration policy, which is humane, comprehensive, realistic and responsible.\nIn Marrakech, and for the first time in the history of the United Nations, the Global Compact for Migration was ratified in December 2018 as a founding document for organizing migration. The purpose was not to give lessons or level accusations, but rather to establish a pluralistic system based on joint vision where each party could find its interests represented without racism, stereotypes and narrow interests. A vision with more social governance, more humane and more just guided by a sense of joint responsibility. The Marrakech charter has therefore become an international reference for multilateral action on immigration, and we should all work together to implement this document.\nMorocco has also been committed to migration as part of King Mohammed Vi\u2019s vision as an African leader on issues of migration. Accordingly, in Rabat, the capital of the Kingdom of Morocco, an agreement was reached between Morocco and the Commission of the African Union to establish an African institute to follow up on the phenomenon of migration with objective analysis and to look into its future developments through scientific ways.\nThirdly, regarding climate change, Morocco hosted the twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 22) in 2016. It is another example of our commitment to facing the impacts of this phenomenon that threatens the future of humankind. It is a commitment to mobilize the efforts of the international community to meet its great aspirations, especially in our African continent. In this regard, the first African Summit convened on the margin of the COP 22, under the royal presidency, led to establish and activate three climate initiatives in order to enable the African countries to coordinate among each other amid best circumstances and address climate challenges as serious and realistic challenges facing the world.\nOne of those initiatives is the sustainability, security and stability initiative (3S) headed by Morocco in partnership with Senegal, which brought together 14 African States in order to practically respond to three major challenges. That would be done through land reclamation of vast areas of 10 million hectares while providing 2 million work opportunities which ensure stability and good life for the inhabitants of these areas.\nFourthly, concerning human and sustainable development, the multilateral system which takes into consideration variations between countries and parties is in total harmony with the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The United Nations 2030 Agenda is an integrated approach that allows countries to achieve their development objectives thus strengthening effective cooperation among each other. Cognizant of the importance to achieve national objectives, His Majesty King Mohammed VI launched a new dynamic development model in Morocco with the aim to achieve social justice that leads to further reduce differences between various categories and regions while building more developed economy which ensures that Morocco joins the club of emerging States. Morocco has also made an appeal at the continental level to build capacity for sustainable development within Africa. We are stressing the effectiveness of South-South cooperation in favour of achieving joint development on our African continent.\nThe multilateral system that we aspire to is also represented by strengthening the maintenance of international peace and security which is the main task of the United Nations and which symbolizes the commitment of the international community to collective security. Maintaining peace and stability is an established part of our Kingdom\u2019s vision embodied in supporting practical measures. Since Morocco became independent, it has been committed to support United Nations efforts for peacekeeping through participating in 15 peacekeeping operations around the world on four continents in difficult circumstances. In the last two decades, that participation was strengthened by contributing many units of the Royal armed forces to peacekeeping operations, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. With the same zeal, Morocco supports the long-awaited transition from reaction to preventive action which requires more efforts to build the Organization\u2019s capacities in the areas of risk assessment and conflict prevention. This approach needs a comprehensive structural reform of the strategy and structures of the United Nations pertaining to international peace and security. Morocco has backed up this choice at the regulatory and financial levels. As Chairman of the African Union Peace and Security Council in September, Morocco will spare no effort in prioritizing African concerns at the United Nations.\nThe lack of promising avenues in the relaunching of the Palestinian-Israeli peace process is a major source of concern for the Kingdom of Morocco and another cause of instability and tension in the Middle East. The Kingdom of Morocco is honoured to stand side by side with the Palestinian people, especially given that His Majesty King Mohammed VI is chairing the Al-Quds Committee of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.\nMorocco rejects any changes to the nature or status of the holy city. We also reject the settlement policy, and we are convinced that there can be no just and lasting peace if the Palestinian people cannot realize their legitimate right to their own independent State, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nMultilateral action is not just an organizational structure of international relations; it is also a state of mind. We therefore must use it to fight hate speech, racism and the rejection of others, which seriously run counter to established values, foremost among which are coexistence, respect for human dignity and pluralism.\nMorocco values its deep-rooted identity, which has multiple tributaries. We do not hesitate to address hate speech and Islamophobia, the bases of violent extremism of all kinds. Ninety States Members of the United Nations sponsored a draft resolution submitted by Morocco and adopted unanimously by the General Assembly at its seventy-third session entitled \u201cPromoting interreligious and intercultural dialogue and tolerance in countering hate speech\u201d (resolution 73/328). That initiative demonstrated the role of multilateral cooperation in building bridges of tolerance and dialogue among religions and cultures.\nIn this respect, I would recall the historic visit made by His Holiness Pope Francis to Morocco in March. It was strongly symbolic of Morocco\u2019s valued contribution in the area of promoting religious and cultural dialogue. On the occasion of that visit, His Majesty King Mohammed VI, as Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, along with his Holiness the Pope, signed a joint appeal on Jerusalem confirming the special religious status of the city as a meeting place of the monotheistic religions and as a symbol of peaceful coexistence and harmony.\nMorocco, having a deep-rooted belief in its historical, legal and sovereign rights, is working seriously on the issue of Moroccan Sahara, which is one of ensuring the territorial integrity of the Kingdom, which considers that its full sovereignty on its southern regions is absolutely non-negotiable. Every State has the right and duty to defend its citizens, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. Morocco is committed to this principle in its foreign policy\nThe Kingdom of Morocco reiterates from this rostrum that the autonomy initiative that has been considered by the Security Council in all of its resolutions since 2007 is serious and credible and puts a definitive end to this contrived conflict. In this regard, we appreciate the efforts made by the Secretary-General to help make progress towards a political solution that is realistic, practical and sustainable based on consensus, as set out in Security Council resolution 2468 (2019), adopted in April.\nThe deplorable situation of the inhabitants of Tindouf camp is a source of constant concern for us. We once again call on the international community to encourage the host country to shoulder its legal and humanitarian responsibilities and to carry out a census in the camp and respect the basic rights of its inhabitants, which are systematically violated every day.\nFor seven decades now, the United Nations has been making progress in the areas of peace, development and human rights. Nonetheless, many serious challenges remain. It is the responsibility of all of us to provide our Organization with the mechanisms necessary to ensure its continuous adaptation to a complex international reality and to mobilize our potential and capacities to reform and strengthen it. We cannot maintain an old system amid the realities of a new world. Instead of attacking the bases of the multilateral system in order to weaken it, there is a need to strengthen it by developing it further so as to move towards a world order that is more just, fair, human and characterized by greater solidarity, a world that is not based on a superficial understanding of reality and does not impose a unilateral vision of a normative authority. Rather, it should be a renewed world of multilateral action in which account is taken of the differences among actors and the multiplicity of challenges; a balanced world that enables Africa to take its rightful place in the international arena; a practical world that adopts successful experiences of integration; and a realistic world that attaches importance to preventive diplomacy and the peaceful settlement of disputes. These are our ambitions and goals. The Kingdom of Morocco will continue, as always since its independence and joining the United Nations, to make efforts to achieve these noble objectives.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I am pleased to congratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, Permanent Representative of the sisterly State of Nigeria, on assuming the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session and I wish him every success in his new tasks. I want also to express my sincere thanks and gratitude to Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for the high efficiency and professionalism with which she steered the previous session of the General Assembly. I also pay tribute to the great efforts and continued endeavours of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres regarding the reform and management of our Organization for the sake of international peace and security.\nEach session of the General Assembly is an opportunity for States to go beyond their individual situations and debate the common destiny of humankind with a view to establishing guidelines and adopting programmes, plans and strategies that ensure a prosperous and sustainable future for our planet and people. In that respect, at its seventieth session in 2015, the General Assembly launched the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes a group of interlinking goals aimed at addressing major global challenges concerning the environment, climate, health care and education, as well as security, stability, development and others, for a better, more sustainable and more comprehensive future for humankind.\nIn the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, we are committed to these goals and have incorporated sustainable development into our development strategy.\nWe have made considerable achievements in this domain by focusing on renewable energy \u2014 both solar and wind energy. We have thereby achieved 40 per cent clean energy out of the total energy consumed. We are working continuously to increase that percentage because we are aware of the importance of clean energy, its positive impact on the environment and its great contribution to reducing pollution.\nMoreover, along with other States of the Sahel, we have launched the Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative to counter the negative impact of desertification and climate change on our environment and agricultural resources. The aim is to bridge the gaps in our production systems and to compensate for the economic and social harm caused by these negative impacts.\nWe have also made considerable progress in the fight against desertification while reclaiming for future use large surface areas that have been affected by desertification, complementing our efforts within the Permanent Interstate Committee to Fight against Drought in the Sahel. We have also made gradual progress with regard to rationally use our maritime resources and have been able to restore our magnificent biological diversity.\nWe are currently working with 10 States of the Sahel within the Desert to Power programme launched by the African Development Bank with the aim of making the Sahel one of the most productive regions in the world in terms of solar energy. The initiative will provide over 29 million people with access to clean energy in the short and medium terms. Like other Sahel countries that benefit from it, we attach great importance to the initiative, which will certainly have a positive impact on the environment and development in our region.\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania is determined in its tireless pursuit to establish the principle of mandatory education and accomplish gender equality in this domain, as well as to build schools for future generations to be educated while upholding the principles of liberty, equality, tolerance and openness based on the characteristics of our culture and civilization. We are also working continuously to improve the quality of education in both of its components, scientific and vocational, in line with the need of our national economy to keep pace with globalization. We have also made significant achievements in this domain, as reflected in the major indicators of our educational system, including access, total coverage and proactive capacity ratios.\nWith a view to ensuring that all of our citizens , particularly those in vulnerable circumstances, have access to basic services, we have managed in Mauritania to considerably improve our total health coverage by strengthening health infrastructure \u2014 hospitals and equipped medical centres \u2014 and by investing in human resources, including high-level medical personnel.\nIn the context of the fight against poverty, and within the framework of our strategy for accelerated growth and shared prosperity, we have focused on addressing social inequalities by targeting vulnerable sectors, supporting disadvantaged groups and promoting social solidarity. We are currently working to launch a series of ambitious projects within a variety of programmes that include supporting purchasing power and access to such basic services as electricity, drinking water, health care and education.\nWe have also made great efforts to accelerate the pace of economic growth and to improve the business climate, while supporting partnerships between the public and private sectors, as well as developing processing industries, so as to liberate our economy from being exclusively dependent on the export of raw materials. We have also focused on training and rehabilitating our young people through an approach aimed at enabling them to access the labour market and contribute to the development of the national economy. We have also enabled woman to play their role by becoming strongly involved in political life and public affairs.\nOur work to achieve sustainable development would be essentially in vain if we were not also to consolidate the rule of law, reinforce good governance, safeguard human rights, promote democracy and champion both individual and collective freedoms. To that end, our country has chosen transparency as a comprehensive approach to managing public affairs. We have resolutely fought against all forms of corruption and bribery and have developed legal and regulatory mechanisms to eradicate those development scourges. At the same time, we have also worked to strengthen the rule of law and consolidate public freedoms, particularly the freedom of the press, to develop democracy and to guarantee flexibility and transparency in the work of public institutions that oversee political life.\nThat general approach culminated recently in the holding of transparent presidential elections, in which the outgoing President did not participate, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, which does not authorize more than two consecutive terms for the same President. The handover of power between the two democratically elected Presidents took place smoothly and calmly.\nAware of the fact that security and development are linked, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania has established an effective strategy to combat terrorism and all forms of extremism. The strategy follows a comprehensive approach that takes into account the security, intellectual, economic and social dimensions. Our country, hand-in-hand with the fraternal Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel) and through its participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations, has contributed to restoring peace and security in the Sahel region and the African continent in general. We are consistently committed to the policy of good-neighbourliness and to distancing ourselves from conflict. In that context, Mauritania has provided a haven of safety and security for more than 50,000 refugees from the sisterly country Republic of Mali. We welcome them while we await the restoration of peace in their villages and towns in the north of Mali, despite the considerable pressure that has been placed on our population and economy, especially in the eastern part of the country.\nOur country has steadfastly defended just causes in all international forums. We reiterate our unflagging commitment to the right of the Palestinian people to dignity and sovereignty within a viable, independent State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative and the relevant international resolutions. We also denounce the continued Israeli violations of human rights in Palestine and the rest of the occupied Arab territories.\nIn Libya, we support international efforts aimed at establishing peace in that fraternal country and ensuring its territorial integrity and sovereignty.\nTurning to the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, we reiterate the need to work seriously to find a political solution that would preserve the unity of that fraternal Arab country and safeguard its independence, the dignity of its people and its right to live in peace and security. We welcome the formation of the consensual Constitutional Committee with a view to drafting a constitution sponsored by the United Nations.\nConcerning Yemen, we affirm our support for legitimacy in that country and we call for the adoption of a peaceful solution that is in line with Arab initiatives and relevant international resolutions. We also condemn the terrorist attacks targeting the national security of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We welcome the political agreement concluded by the sisterly Republic of the Sudan and we call for its name to be removed from the list of State sponsors of terrorism. We also strongly support the Government of Somalia in its efforts to restore security and stability.\nWe reiterate our full commitment to achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. May God help the people of the world to achieve sustainable and comprehensive development that preserves the future of our planet and provides every human being, wherever she or he may be on the face of the Earth, with a decent life while ensuring his rights, freedom and dignity.\n"

        "file_text": "Right at this very moment, as I begin my address here, a young pregnant woman from the Sahel is boarding an overcrowded plastic raft, risking her life to cross the sea in search of a better future. She knows that the end of the journey is not assured, because the Mediterranean has sadly become the world\u2019s largest watery grave. She is fleeing hunger and drought, but she has no other choice. On the other side of the Atlantic, a Central American family crosses northern Mexico on foot, because they are so desperate that no wall, however high, could stand in the way of their quest to find peace, food and shelter for their children.\nRight at this very moment, even as I address the Assembly, a robot is operating with pinpoint accuracy on a patient in a Tokyo hospital, saving him from what years ago would have been a certain death. In the waiting room, on the other side of the operating theatre wall, the patient\u2019s loved ones are staring at the TV, watching a Wayapi family cry inconsolably because their homes and their villages, in the heart of the Amazon rainforest, are being consumed by flames.\nAt the same time, in the bustle of the city streets, one of the thousands of couriers working in Manhattan, London or Madrid is receiving an order that someone has just placed from their mobile phone. The courier will be paid mere pennies for each minute of the journey, but even so he will get on his bicycle, make the delivery and hope to receive another message soon and so continue his working day. He has no other choice.\nWhat I am describing to the Assembly could easily be an excerpt from the screenplay of one of the many dystopian series on television these days. But no: these are the real stories of real people who are crying out for us to take action. These are clear examples of the magnitude of the global challenges that we face today: the climate emergency, hunger, migratory pressure, the technological and digital revolution, social and gender inequality and hate speech, which is so prevalent today.\nGathered here today are representatives of the almost 200 countries that make up the United Nations. I want to take advantage of the privilege that it is for me to be standing here at this rostrum to send a simple but resounding message: we must act. We must act now because the Earth is bleeding. We must act now because the problems of our peoples simply cannot wait. We must act now because the challenges of this millennium are exceeding the limits and capacities of our nation States.\nWe must act so that the Assembly can make a real difference. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has asked of us that we make fewer speeches and offer more plans. We must replace grandiose speeches with clear commitments. What our citizens want from us is action. Never before in the history of humankind has the need to elaborate a shared world project been so critical and so urgent. It is our imperative responsibility to determine our vision for the future.\nAllow me to ask a few questions: are we clear about the problems we are discussing here today? Have we all reached the same conclusion? Do we know the kind of world we want to leave our great-grandchildren? Have we decided what our role in this change is going to be? I would like to believe that we know the answers to these questions. In this spirit, allow me to answer them from Spain\u2019s perspective and describe the contribution of the country that I have the honour to lead.\nFirst, it is abundantly clear to me, as the President of the Government of Spain, that the most urgent challenges are precisely those faced by the protagonists of the stories I have just told the Assembly: hunger, the climate emergency, the digital revolution, economic and social inequality, gender inequality, access for the disabled, the violence of war and, without a doubt, discrimination.\nSecondly, Spain advocates concerted global action. That is why every time we come here we invoke the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That is why we signed the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\nThirdly, we know exactly what kind of world we want to leave our descendants. We want a world that is just, sustainable and egalitarian. We want an international community that is committed to a new global social contract, the 2030 Agenda. We want Governments that share a sense of responsibility and that are committed to the conservation of our planet, to sustainable development and to the expansion and reaffirmation of democratic values.\nLastly, we are very clear on the role that Spain wants to play: that of a committed, compassionate and conscious society \u2014 a society that takes the lead and wants to be at the forefront, along with other countries, of major transformations.\nOn the eve of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, in 2020, Spain, which was one of the world\u2019s first modern States, was not, however, one of the founding States of this great institution: the United Nations. Spain was not one of the founding States for one simple reason: Franco\u2019s dictatorship, which held our country hostage for 40 years and collaborated with the Nazi regime during the Second World War \u2014 a fact that was incompatible with our becoming part of an Organization that was created for the opposite reason: to promote peace and democratic values.\nSpain later embraced democracy, emerging from that dark dictatorship 40 years ago, and has succeeded in building a prosperous and free country, a decentralized State committed to diversity. Spain has one of the best health-care systems in the world; it is also one of the world\u2019s safest countries; and it is internationally considered to be one of the world\u2019s strongest democracies, protected by robust safeguards. It is the world\u2019s preferred travel destination and one of the best countries in which to live.\nToday, 24 September, is a very important day for Spain. Today an announcement has been made that is very important to Spanish society. We have symbolically closed the democratic circle, as the Spanish Supreme Court has authorized the exhumation of Franco the dictator\u2019s remains from the public mausoleum in which he was buried with State honours. This is a major victory for Spanish democracy. On this day, 24 September, we are therefore closing a dark chapter of our history, and work is beginning to remove Franco the dictator\u2019s remains from where they had lain \u2014 indefensibly \u2014 for far too long, because no enemy of democracy deserves to lie in a place of worship or of institutional respect.\nThe Spanish people chose peace, freedom and democracy, and with these tools we are going to continue building the future. Today we want to share the achievements we have made in the past 40 years and our transformative spirit.\nIn our country, a great revolution is brewing that will forever change our vision of the world; I am speaking here of the fourth wave of feminism. I can say with pride that, in Spain, the momentum of equality is unstoppable. There are two dates on our calendar that exemplify this perfectly: 8 March, International Women\u2019s Day, and LGBTI Pride Day.\nThe strong voice of Spain\u2019s women can be heard loud and clear in every corner of the country and of the planet. Machismo is not just a Government concern but a daily concern shared by the general public. The LGBTI community has given us a true lesson on human rights, as there is no better flag than that which embraces diversity as a source of human wealth.\nSpain is today a geostrategically significant power with an international vision, a committed democracy that has been actively participating for decades in United Nations peace missions and that is implementing at the national level policies to further democracy and expand the rights and freedoms promoted here at the United Nations.\nAs a full member of this Organization, Spain is also calling for a change. The historic contributions of the United Nations are many and undeniable, but our peoples expect even more from us. It would seem that our reflexes are slow and that our response capacity is at times sluggish, and we are not going to be able to rise to the challenges facing us if we are not able to give the best of ourselves. Now is the time for action.\nWe are living in paradoxical times, times of great contradictions, times in which poverty, hardship and social exclusion coexist with technological transformation and the digital revolution \u2014 times in which we are increasingly aware of what lies ahead of us and of how what happens on the other side of the world can have consequences in our own environment. Yet we do not seem to be able to summon up the courage required to sit down together and forge the agreements necessary to address our problems.\nIt is clear that global challenges call for coordinated actions at the international level. They are expressions of a true change in era and of a new stage in the history of humankind. Major transformations without a doubt represent threats, but they can also represent major opportunities. That is why all responses based on maintaining the status quo or on returning to a past that was idealized, if we look at it objectively, are doomed to failure. Those who shut themselves away behind protectionism or ultranationalism, that is, the narrative of fear, are profoundly mistaken. Looking back to the past will not make the future disappear; we will only succeed in erasing ourselves from the future. The changes I have mentioned are not going to stop, nor are they going to respect borders or any sort of wall, no matter how high that wall may be.\nOn the contrary, we must be aware that this future can be won only if we approach it with empathy, courage, cooperation and leadership, and only if we are ambitious and aware that multilateralism has no realistic alternative in today\u2019s world. The future will be what we want it to be. It is in our hands, and this Organization, the United Nations, has much to say about it. It is possible. Let us therefore act.\nThe Paris Climate Agreement and 2030 Agenda, inter alia, contain the diagnosis, the objectives and the road map. We have worked hard over the years to give them shape and to achieve consensus, and it has not been easy. But we did it, and we did so because we need a future that includes everyone, that leaves no one behind \u2014 no country, no region and no human being.\nOur task now is not to continue reflecting or continue debating, but to turn the Sustainable Development Goals into reality. The decisions we take now will affect the future of the next generations. Consequently, not acting is no longer a matter of choice; it is in fact an enormous irresponsibility.\nI have just referred to 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, and I would like to underline the operative word, which is, in my opinion, essential for the world in which we live, namely, \u201csustainable\u201d. Nothing that is not sustainable is acceptable any more. And this, as the Assembly knows, is not an ideological opinion, but \u2014 even if some may find it hard to admit it \u2014 a forceful and obvious scientific fact. We need to save our planet, and no one is exempt from that responsibility. It has been said from this very rostrum \u2014 we are facing a climate emergency that will not brook any kind of excuses. This emergency requires us to transform the way we think, produce, consume, in short, live.\nLet us act now to respond to the climate emergency and let us do so from a multilateralist point of view. I say this because Hurricane Dorian in the United States, the cold drop in Spain a few weeks ago and the desertification of Senegal are the symptoms of the same evil. Much-needed local solutions and national solutions are not enough. Let us therefore act. Let us act, for example, to recognize some ecosystems as global public goods with their own special status.\nSpain is making a great effort to be part of the group of countries driving the climate agenda. It is one of the central axes of my Government\u2019s programme, and we want to demonstrate our firm commitment with deeds. We have set out to decarbonize our economy by 2050 in a socially just, supportive and efficient manner, without leaving anyone behind. To this end, we have approved and presented an ambitious strategic framework for energy and climate.\nWe set ourselves the challenge of climate change as a great opportunity \u2014 and not as a great threat \u2014 to transform our economic model, modernize our labour market, create quality employment, gain in energy security and innovation, improve citizens\u2019 health and position our country, Spain, at the forefront of the technologies that will dominate the next century.\nThe climate emergency also requires the mobilization of financial resources at all levels. For this reason, I announced at the Climate Action Summit on Monday that Spain will contribute \u20ac150 million to the Green Climate Fund over the next four years. We will also ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal, and we will contribute \u20ac2 million to the Adaptation Fund.\nI think all of us in this Hall have seen the recent photo of dogs pulling a sled over the thawed waters of Greenland. It was not an edited photo; the temperature of the waters in that area has risen by five degrees in just one year. That is a real alarm, as is watching the Amazon burn before the impotent gaze of the indigenous populations.\nWhy have we not acted forcefully enough? We already have examples of good practices that I would like to champion: for example, decades-long joint efforts under the Montreal Protocol are bearing fruit \u2014 they have been effective \u2014 and we are regenerating our ozone layer. We also have good ideas. Let us get the Green New Deal going. The climate emergency is the great threat of our age, but we have alternatives. What is important is that we take action.\nIn addition to sustainability, we need much more social justice. The so-called millennials and centennials today are 20 per cent less likely to be middle class than their parents. They also have fewer options to work at what they are qualified for. Online delivery companies, for example, are today full of university graduates.\nThe inequality gap does not stop growing: some recent reports point out that, in 2030, 1 per cent of the world\u2019s population will accumulate two thirds of our planet\u2019s total wealth. While being a dramatic figure, it is not the worst figure of all: according to data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, more than 800 million human beings on our planet are suffering from hunger.\nThe concepts of sustainability, justice and human dignity cannot be understood without the necessary and tireless fight against hunger, poverty and precariousness. All these concepts are enshrined in the 2030 Agenda and require us to transform our societies in depth, in a structural way. But we will not really be able to talk about progress if we do not put the human being at the centre of our policies. I say this because the issue of progress must be met with a progressive response.\nGlobalization must be based on rights, freedoms and actions to curb inequality and environmental degradation. Everything is ultimately interconnected: industrial relocation generates unemployment in the departed region but also causes environmental impacts in the destination region. Global warming affects the livelihoods of the countries of the South and also provokes migratory movements towards the North. The rich countries of the North are seduced by racism and hate speech and blame the migrants for their so-called first-world problems. Inequalities in the welfare state are a breeding ground for illiteracy and pandemics in developing countries.\nLet us act. Spain assures the Assembly that it is doing so. Accordingly, I would like to make two important announcements. The first of them is that Spain will contribute \u20ac100 million over five years to the Joint Sustainable Development Goals Fund. The second announcement is that Spain will return to the donor community of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria by making a contribution of \u20ac100 million over the next three years.\nLet us also talk about technological transformation and changes in the world economic order. As the Assembly knows, the technological revolution has already profoundly transformed our societies, and it will continue to do so without us being able to see their limits, their potential and also the risks that they bring. Our systems of production, consumption, health, transport and even of socialization and security are changing radically. As just one example, the mobile technology we all have in our pocket is superior to that used to send us to the Moon for the first time. We are also seeing previously unimaginable new phenomena that could undermine States: cyberattacks and fake news are different manifestations of the use of technology as a transnational weapon of attrition.\nNevertheless, big data, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things are concepts \u2014 terms \u2014 that only a part of the world can experience. Not everyone can be operated on by a robot. Inequality includes technological inequality. Fighting technological inequality is also a Sustainable Development Goal.\nFaced with the disruptive nature of this revolution, we in the public sphere must ensure that progress is at the service of human beings. The jobs of the future will be different. As is often said, we do not know exactly what the work of our children and grandchildren will be. But what we have to be very clear about is that, while these jobs may be different, they also have to be dignified.\nThe transport of the future will be faster, but it must be sustainable, affordable and accessible also for people with disabilities. The future we want must also be able to create wealth and distribute it fairly. However, trade tensions represent a major threat to prosperity. The stability of the world economy is ultimately at stake.\nIn the face of mistrust and dirty wars, bridges need to be built. An example of this is the new trade agreements reached recently by the Southern Common Market and the European Union, which are committed to opening up the economy to trade, while protecting labour, social and environmental rights.\nThe outbreak of a trade war with unpredictable consequences can and must be avoided. It is up to us to abandon unilateral actions and resolve our differences in the framework of the rules-based multilateral trading system, centred on the World Trade Organization, which should of course be reformed.\nLet me reiterate that my vision of a just world cannot be understood without a key basic principle \u2014 that of gender equality, equality between men and women. I have said it on more than one occasion and I reaffirm it today. I am a feminist President and I have the honour to be part of a feminist Government. My commitment in that area is absolute.\nThat is why Spain will promote the fight against male violence against women here at the United Nations and at the European Union, incorporating the recommendations of UN-Women and promoting the European Strategy on Gender Equality at the European Union. That Strategy must be binding for each and every country of the European Union. We will work towards a joint definition of femicide and homogeneous legislation on the subject.\nWe will continue to lead the women and peace and security agenda. Together with Finland, we promoted the initiative Commitment 2025 on Women\u2019s Inclusion in Peace Processes, including the ambitious commitment to ensure that in five years\u2019 time, the inclusion of women in peace processes will be the rule and not the exception.\nDuring the current session, we will mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. We will firmly uphold the consensus forged for more than two decades. We cannot roll back progress in such areas as universal access to sexual and reproductive health services. We cannot stand by and allow women to be tricked into boarding small boats by sexual exploitation mafias. We cannot stand by and allow forced marriage or female genital mutilation to take place. We cannot stand by while the rights of half the human race continue to be violated in every corner of the planet. We must act.\nMigration is part of the human condition and is an extraordinarily complex phenomenon in today\u2019s societies. That is why we have an obligation to regulate it. When migration is safe, orderly and addressed in a comprehensive manner, it enriches all those involved. Spain firmly supports close cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination.\nWe must say no to crude and simplistic policies that are born of hatred and rejection. We must continue working towards a joint and coordinated response to the humanitarian challenge of migration. We must fulfil our commitments under international humanitarian law and the Marrakech Compact on Migration and live up to our responsibility as countries of refuge. We must overcome the current dynamic of short-term solutions. We must wake up and seek a compassionate global response.\nI am concerned about conflicts on the international stage and the consequences of war and geopolitical tensions that end up affecting, as always, the weakest and most vulnerable, in particular women and girls. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees continues providing alarming statistics: 70 million people are forcibly displaced, of whom nearly 26 million are refugees. That is unacceptable.\nI am concerned about the regional impact of the crisis in Libya. The Sahel is also a source of instability. However, for a country like Spain, Africa is, first and foremost, synonymous with hope and opportunity. In spite of the major challenges faced by Africa, six out of every 10 countries with the highest rate of growth in the world are in that continent. That is why we will become directly involved in contributing to the full development of its capacities and transformation into a democratic and peaceful continent of opportunity.\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains unfinished business for the international community. Spain firmly supports the two-State solution. We call for respect for and application of the gains made by the United Nations. Israelis and Palestinians have the right to live in peace and security in their own States and the international community must support them in the process of reaching an agreement.\nThe situation in Western Sahara is also on the agenda. The Government of Spain defends the central role of the United Nations and wishes to contribute to the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to achieve, pursuant to Security Council resolutions, a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution, according to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\nI am concerned about escalating tensions in the Gulf and the possibility that the wrong response could trigger a conflict with extremely serious consequences in the Near East. We call on parties and stakeholders in the region to act with restraint and we applaud the mediation efforts.\nThe dismantling of the nuclear deal with Iran would be a major international failure. It is a key element in the fight against nuclear proliferation and an essential milestone for the security of the region.\nThe situation in Syria is one of the most tragic and the Government of Spain is very concerned. Eight years of conflict have led to chilling statistics \u2014 more than 400,000 deaths, 5.6 million refugees, 80 per cent of the Syrian population below the poverty line and 11.7 million people with humanitarian needs. The United Nations can offer a way out of the civil and humanitarian conflict. The utmost pressure must be exerted and Spain pledges its full support to the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General.\nThe global threat of terrorism still looms. Returning foreign terrorist fighters are a source of concern for Governments. It is essential to promote international judicial cooperation, control their movements, obtain evidence and ensure the proper treatment of prisoners \u2014 all without forgetting to show solidarity with the victims of terrorism.\nI must also mention the situation in the brotherly country of Venezuela. Spain hopes that Venezuelans themselves will freely decide their country\u2019s future. We believe that it is essential to hold presidential elections, which must be free, democratic and transparent, with all the necessary safeguards. That is the only way to return to democratic and institutional normalcy in that country.\nThere is another international event which, although not violent in nature, concerns me. The United Kingdom has decided to withdraw from the European Union. I respect that decision, although as I have said publicly on many occasions, I regret it profoundly. I hope that the United Kingdom will withdraw in an orderly manner that benefits British and European citizens, as well as the economic stakeholders that require legal certainty. The deadline is looming large and we must spare no effort in attempting an orderly withdrawal.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union will of course have consequences for Gibraltar. I hope that, with respect to the United Nations position with which Spain aligns itself fully, we will be able to develop an area of prosperity that encompasses Gibraltar and the neighbouring Campo de Gibraltar and achieve social and economic convergence for the entire region.\nI will end my statement by reiterating what I said at the start of it. To achieve the world we want, we need a method for action. We need to strengthen multilateralism. It is the only tool that offers a solution to the challenges we have listed \u2014 hunger, the climate emergency, the digital revolution, economic and social inequality, gender inequality, the violence of war and discrimination.\nIt troubles us to see certain parties questioning the most basic points of consensus in those areas. Retreating behind protectionism and ultranationalism threatens the norms that contribute to peaceful coexistence, progress and global prosperity. That is why we must equip multilateralism with the capabilities necessary to ensure that it is active, inclusive and effective. In that regard, we support the Secretary-General in his efforts to reform the Organization.\nAs I speak, some of the migrants who fled poverty will have realized their dream of achieving a better future. I hope that, thanks to the response we decide on today to address the climate emergency, the soil of their native lands will again become fertile so that no one else is forced to leave ever again. In the past few minutes, a patient has been cured thanks to artificial intelligence. I hope that technology continues progressing to improve the lives and well-being of all people \u2014 not only of some but of all people. In the past few minutes, many couriers have arrived on their bicycles at their destinations and have delivered their orders. I hope that in the future they will all again have decent working conditions.\nWe must ensure that the United Nations plays a lead role in the world we want. We, the representatives of 200 countries, must ensure that the United Nations acts now.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to convey the warmest congratulations of the President of the Republic of Haiti, His Excellency Mr. Jovenel Moise, to Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session and to assure him of the full support of my delegation in the conduct of our work. I would be remiss if I did not congratulate his predecessor, Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for the excellent work done during the General Assembly at its seventy-third session.\nI also commend the outstanding work of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the helm of our Organization, particularly in his undeniable efforts to focus the attention of all on the pressing need to arduously work to satisfy the needs and aspirations of all peoples of the planet. I strongly encourage him to continue to work for the mobilization of the financial resources necessary, within the framework of renewed and strengthened multilateralism, to avert the various threats to international peace and security and to promote the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The future of humankind depends on it. For if we do not respect the many commitments we have freely made in recent years, the world may not be the one that we, the United Nations, have called for since the adoption of the Charter.\nOn the eve of the commemoration of the seventy- fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, I consider it essential that we reaffirm our collective responsibility. We must all remain mobilized in pursuing these aims, principles, pillars of action and objectives, bearing in mind that future generations will judge us on our sense of responsibility and solidarity.\nI am pleased to note that this session\u2019s general debate has been strongly characterized by the hallmark of promoting multilateralism, as proven by the central theme of this session, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d. The theme reminds States Members of the United Nations and all stakeholders, should they need reminding, of the path they should follow in order to achieve sustainable development and world peace. I therefore note with great satisfaction that the high- level meetings convened by the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly form part of the process to promote the implementation of commitments made in the light of the Sustainable Development Goals, including ensuring universal health coverage, the imperative of finance for development and providing support for small island developing States. I hope that we all understand the need to make solemn declarations and implement concrete actions and initiatives that are commensurate with current and future challenges.\nI would like to draw the Assembly\u2019s kind attention to the worrying increase in the number and magnitude of fires and forest fires in recent years. I wish to take this opportunity to renew my deep and sincere solidarity with the countries and populations most affected by those fires and offer my unconditional support for concerted initiatives aimed at preventing fires. That would be to the benefit of our general well-being and would contribute to the preservation of our planet.\nCloser to home, on 1 and 2 September, Hurricane Dorian inflicted death, desolation and heavy destruction on the people of the Bahamas archipelago, particularly on the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama, which are home to many migrants from my country. This brotherly country faces the most serious humanitarian emergency in its history. I wish to reiterate my full solidarity with the authorities and people of the Bahamas and call for greater support from the international community for the efforts being made by the Bahamians.\nWe would also mention the recent floods that struck the Haitian cities of Gonaives and Petit-Goave, leading to a considerable loss of life and property damage. The Haitian Government is doing its utmost to continue to provide necessary assistance to the victims and address the root causes of this phenomenon. In this context, special attention should be given to small island developing States, which do not have sufficient resources to combat natural disasters and preserve the environment. My country is eager to contribute to multilateral efforts with a view to combating this phenomenon.\nIt is no coincidence that the eradication of poverty in all its forms and all over the world represents Sustainable Development Goal 1 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is unfortunate to note that the efforts being made at the global level to implement this core objective are far from keeping up with current needs. Still today, a large percentage of the world\u2019s population is suffering from poverty and hunger. We will not be able to reverse this sad trend without the extensive mobilization of financial resources. There is still a striking discrepancy between the commitments we have made and the actions being undertaken to eliminate poverty across the world. As a small island developing State, Haiti will spare no effort, despite its deficiencies and limited resources, in resolutely tackling the root causes of poverty and hunger.\nOur debate also has the merit of focusing attention on the need for a greater commitment to quality education. My delegation believes that quality education accessible to all is essential for economic development and social progress. In our view, this is the main area in which the guiding principle of the 2030 Agenda \u2014 leaving no one behind \u2014 should apply the most. It is especially through education that we can concretely guarantee respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for everyone, as well as the economic and social progress of all peoples. We believe that public policies aimed at sustainable development should give urgent priority to education, development and employment for the benefit of young people, who are the true builders of the future.\nWe must pay greater attention to combating the various forms of inequality that are continuing to take root all over the world. These inequalities move us further and further away from the purposes and principles of our Organization. Promoting inclusion is without a doubt one of the fundamental requirements in the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Inclusion undoubtedly implies the participation of all peoples and stakeholders in making collective efforts to bring about a better world. With that in mind, the Republic of Haiti wishes to see greater consideration given to the repeated requests of the Republic of China, Taiwan, to participate in the activities of the United Nations system.\nWe are 11 years away from the deadline set for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Many countries have already made considerable progress in that direction. Others, in contrast, despite their efforts, are still lagging behind, which runs contrary to the \u201cno one should be left behind\u201d principle of the 2030 Agenda.\nIn Haiti, emergency needs, recovery and long- term development remain significant and require massive investment in various areas. Given the current circumstances of my country, pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals remains a major challenge. We must make enormous and sustained efforts in such priority areas as essential infrastructure, quality education, health coverage, the mobilization of foreign direct investment, reforestation, environmental protection, reviving agricultural production, supporting productive initiatives and gaining access to modern energy sources and loans.\nIn that connection, Haiti is proud to have hosted last May a delegation from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to explore financing tools that would enable Haiti to diversify its economy and to help it meet its development needs through private-sector projects.\nThe government of the Republic of Haiti is fully aware of its responsibility to provide the conditions required for the security, stability and long-term development of the country. Unfortunately, my country has for several months now been grappling with a complex political crisis that is compounding an already tenuous, decades-old socioeconomic situation. The President of the Republic, aware of his heavy responsibilities, has therefore extended a hand to all of the nation\u2019s stakeholders with a view to safeguarding our democratic gains, enabling peace, stability and calm to be restored, and facilitating the broadest possible participation of our citizens in public life.\nThat was precisely the spirit of the message he delivered on Wednesday, 25 September, in which he called for a constructive and inclusive inter-Haitian dialogue intended to lead to the establishment of a national unity Government. By the same token, our Head of State is continuing to hold the necessary consultations with all national institutions in a position to facilitate dialogue among the executive branch and the political, economic and social sectors of our country, geared towards a political agreement leading to social peace, the holding of free, fair and democratic elections and the strengthening of democratic institutions and the political, economic and social stability of the country.\nThe President of the Republic intends to do everything in his power to find a way to mobilize the main national and international stakeholders around those efforts essential for placing the country irreversibly on the path towards stability and progress. However, the Republic of Haiti cannot get back on its feet without substantial, sustainable, coherent, well-coordinated and effective support from the international community.\nSeveral United Nations missions on the ground, especially those of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti, recently took stock of the enormous, multidimensional challenges facing the Republic of Haiti. That is the backdrop for the gradual withdrawal of the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti and the transition towards the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti.\nWe take note of the mandate of this new mission, which essentially will consist of advising the Government of the Republic of Haiti on ways to promote and strengthen its political stability and good governance. It is our strong wish to see this new United Nations mission endowed with all the resources necessary for the full accomplishment of its main tasks. It is important that there be enhanced coordination among United Nations entities in Haiti and that all their efforts be deployed in accordance with the priorities established by the Government of Haiti. It is therefore essential that the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti keep a sustained focus on Haiti\u2019s economic, social and environmental public policies.\nStability in Haiti will require a genuine inter-Haitian dialogue, an improvement in the security situation and the promotion of private investment, democracy, justice, human rights, the rule of law and sustainable development. My delegation wishes to share with the peoples of the United Nations Haiti\u2019s aspirations to a better world, with peace, harmony, stability, progress and well-being for all.\nThe fact remains that there will be no ideal world without the adoption of a new paradigm for international cooperation that must absolutely involve an in-depth reform of the structures of the United Nations and the way in which it functions. Such reform must take into account the new realities of the contemporary world. Indeed, United Nations structures must be made more flexible, more open and more pragmatic, so that the Organization can be more proactive and more effective, both in its decision-making and in the implementation of the decisions it takes. We are a case in point; during the cholera epidemic in Haiti, which killed tens of thousands of people across the country, swift and responsible action by the United Nations would have made it possible to limit the harm done and spare the affected populations a great deal of suffering.\nIt must be acknowledged, however, that encouraging progress has been made recently in the fight to rid Haiti of cholera thanks to the efforts made by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General and all concerned stakeholders in Haiti. We call on the United Nations to redouble its efforts with a view to mobilizing sufficient and predictable financing for the effective implementation of a strategy to tackle cholera in Haiti.\nIn closing, on behalf of the President of the Republic of Haiti, His Excellency Mr. Jovenel Moise, I would convey his most sincere gratitude to all partners and friends of Haiti that support our efforts to improve living conditions for all sectors of the Haitian population.\nPeace is a universal good, and we must all strive for peace, so that our plans to promote the welfare of humankind do not remain simply a wish but become a reality."

        "file_name": "CZE_74_2019.txt",
        "file_text": "Thirty years ago, my country, the Czech Republic, and the entire region of Central Europe, regained freedom. This year we are celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the Velvet Revolution. Vaclav Havel, whose name has become known to the whole world, grew to be the symbol of that revolution. In 1989, we were under the rule of a foreign empire. Our country, once known for its strong industry, was struggling. Its landscape and nature were being destroyed, and its political system was unresponsive to citizens.\nYet, 10 years later, our country was able to join NATO, and, in 2004, the Czech Republic became a member of the European Union (EU). The communist regime was replaced by a democracy that now boasts a thriving civil society and a booming economy. For 30 years now we have enjoyed the freedom to elect our representatives, express our opinions, exchange our ideas and partake of a free and independent media.\nThe Czech people have forged a great nation. We are talented, hardworking, and we do not give up easily. We are very proud of the heritage of the First Czechoslovak Republic, which was established in 1918. In fact, between the two world wars, the Czech Republic was among the most advanced and prosperous countries in the world. Our automotive, engineering, food, textile, footwear and military industries ranked among the best in the world. Such companies and brands as Bata, Skoda Auto, JAWA Moto and the Czechoslovak arms manufacturer Zbrojovka CZ have remained famous to this day.\nUnfortunately, after the collapse of communism, our inexperienced elite made mistakes and wasted a lot of time and resources when it could have been learning from other countries. But we got back on track thanks to the efforts and goodwill of our citizens, our small and large companies and our entrepreneurs and workers. Today the Czech Republic is the seventh-safest country in the world. Our economy is growing fast, we have the lowest unemployment rate in the EU, our economic growth is well above the EU average, and the ratio of our public debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is the fourth-lowest in the European Union. Our public finances are in very good shape, and in many respects we can serve as an example. The Czech Republic is ranked seventh among the countries listed in the 2019 SDG Index in The Sustainable Development Report 2019. In the 2019 Social Progress Index\u2019s latest assessment of 149 countries, the Czech Republic ranks twenty-fourth in terms of quality of life, which is an improvement by two places compared to last year. The most recent Allianz Euro Monitor ranks the Czech economy as the fourth most stable in the EU. All of those successes confirm both our ambitions and our skills.\nWe have a clear vision for 2030 that is based on ensuring major support for research, development and innovation. Accordingly, as a Government, we approved an innovation strategy under the motto \u201cCzech Republic: the country for the future\u201d. Under that motto we will present a national economic strategy in which we will link science, industry, energy and education and include the application of the most advanced technologies, from the full digitization of the economy to the implementation of artificial intelligence in many sectors. By the way, the very word \u201crobot\u201d is a Czech invention, coined by the Czech writer Karel Capek back in 1921. Our goal is to become a European leader in innovation and artificial intelligence and a country that can serve as an example to the rest of the world.\nThirty years after being liberated from the communists, the countries of Central Europe have become great neighbours. Our regional group, the Visegrad Group, of which the Czech Republic currently holds the presidency, represents 65 million citizens from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. We share common values and understand one another\u2019s problems, and therefore have been successful in promoting our interests and positions within the EU. I strongly believe that our region can make a major contribution to making Europe stronger. We want to be more active in addressing Europe\u2019s major challenges. We want a strong and united Europe. The European Union is the second largest economy in the world and has essentially become its most successful peace project. I am very fond of the idea of making war unthinkable and materially impossible, despite the fact that the notion is more than 60 years old. Unfortunately, the European Union is not very efficient at the moment, and I would like to change that. In my view, we should be more active in addressing foreign policy, international trade, and migration from the Middle East and Africa. More precisely, all Member States, not just the largest, should actively engage with the President of the European Commission, as has been the case in the past five years.\nIn future, the EU\u2019s highest political body, the European Council, where European Presidents and Prime Ministers meet, should act as a European coalition Government. It should seek solutions and give very clear guidance on the EU\u2019s major challenges. Those challenges include, first, the issue of Brexit, for which a fair and functional deal between the United Kingdom and the EU must be found. The second is trade relations, specifically with the United States, and in my view it is regrettable that the previous trade talks between the EU and the United States, which is a natural ally of ours, have led nowhere. I believe the EU needs a major new trade agreement with the United States as soon as possible, similar to the one that President Trump promised the United Kingdom in his address to the Assembly (see A/74/PV.3). The third issue is the completion of the EU internal market, where the potential for European GDP growth is 1.7 per cent, the equivalent of \u20ac235 billion. Fourthly, we must address external security, and specifically the issues of regaining control over migration flows \u2014 including migration from the African continent \u2014 relations with Turkey, the situations in Syria and Libya and our relationship with Russia. We also need a strategy for further integration of a broader Schengen Area and the enlargement of the EU. As a key global player in recent years, the EU must work more efficiently and strive to be more functional.\nWe all realize that in the near future the consequences of climate change may affect our countries more than ever before. The effects will be not only environmental but also economic, social and ultimately political. We have a huge task ahead of us. Like all EU countries, the Czech Republic fully supports the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and we will fulfil our commitments. We are significantly reducing our greenhouse-gas emissions and this year, for example, we hosted the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in Prague for the first time and adopted the Prague Declaration, which emphasizes scientific cooperation for a better understanding of how climate change works and how we can deal with it. The Czech Republic is also fully committed to the quest for a long-term strategy for achieving carbon neutrality.\nAs a whole, the European Union is ready to substantially change its economy to achieve carbon neutrality, but it cannot solve that burning issue without the help of the rest of the world. Europe cannot remain alone as the most ambitious actor in its struggle to adapt its economies to imminent climate change. We have only one planet, and its protection must be a common endeavour shared by all. Those who contribute the most to the environmental pollution that leads to climate change must find the political courage to participate in the solution. At the same time, we cannot and will not harm the very best of our economies. Although the EU has half a billion inhabitants, on its own it cannot be the solution in a world in which more than 7.5 billion people live. And soon there will be many more. The EU is leading by example and must therefore say loud and clear that other nations must take the necessary political decisions. The main economic models for the European Union\u2019s plans to reduce emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 estimate the average annual cost to be at least $1.4 trillion. The cost of significant emission reductions is extremely high because we are dependent on fossil- fuel alternatives such as solar and wind energy, which are generally not efficient enough.\nIn that respect, therefore, the young protesters are right. The world is failing to tackle climate change. But their approach, which emphasizes even greater commitments to reduce carbon emissions, will also fail, because green energy is still not ready. The sun and wind currently provide less than 1 per cent of the world\u2019s energy and already require $129 billion annually in subsidies. The world should invest more in green- energy research and development so that the price of renewables falls below that of fossil fuels and naturally encourages an energy transition. We must also be open-minded in looking into other zero-carbon sources such as nuclear energy. My country\u2019s only other option is the nuclear one, and we must keep the sovereignty of our energy mix intact.\nClimate change is a popular topic around the world these days, and the arguments are correct in many ways. Greta Thunberg has made many interesting observations, but I am not sure that emotional displays, hysterical theatrics and sometimes even aggressive speech lead to a rational discussion, and it is an unfair generalization to say that nobody is doing anything. That is not true. Many of us are doing what we promised in our commitments, and Greta Thunberg should differentiate more carefully between them, because otherwise, she is not being helpful. We should keep in mind that while Europe decreased its carbon-dioxide emissions by 20 million tons in 2018 and Europe\u2019s share of global carbon-dioxide emissions is only 9 per cent, the rest of the world increased its carbon-dioxide emissions by a factor of 52, to 1.02 billion tons. Recent analysis has shown that only a few of the 185 States that ratified the Paris Agreement in 2015 are actually fulfilling their commitments. It is crucial that nations honour their commitments, and as members of the United Nations, we have a joint responsibility for our planet.\nHowever, as leaders of our respective countries, we also have a responsibility towards our own citizens and economies. It is unfortunate that in our discussions we sometimes forget that the European economy is very dependent on its industry. Our citizens have given us a mandate to ensure that we maintain prosperous economies and protect our environment. Our citizens also expect us to provide them with productive and sustainable jobs that they will not lose due to decreased competitiveness, which will occur if our countries adopt tougher, more ambitious measures to combat climate change than the rest of the world does. After all, we cannot ignore the fact that in many cases, reducing emissions simply means exporting jobs to other countries. That is unacceptable. The economy of the Czech Republic is heavily dependent on industry, and although we are investing a great deal in new technologies, decreasing our dependency on coal and strengthening low-emission energy sources, we must consider technological, economic and sociological factors as well as environmental ones.\nAdapting to climate change and working on mitigating its negative effects is the main task ahead of all of us. But we must also focus on other challenges, which are complex and interconnected. Let us not forget that more than 800 million people are still starving this year. Approximately 785 million people lack basic access to drinking water. This year alone, more than 5.5 million children aged under five are going to die. Around 750 million adults are illiterate, two thirds of them women, and around 250 million children still have no opportunity to attend school. People living in extreme poverty make up 8.6 per cent of the global population.\nThe whole area stretching from North Africa to the wider Middle East is a region rife with conflict and instability. Wars in Syria and Yemen, conflicts in Afghanistan and Libya, and civil strife in Africa and Latin America all result in terrible suffering and hardship for an enormous number of people. Those problems affect us all and cannot be ignored. In that regard, the United Nations has a unique responsibility, and it is especially true for the Security Council, which is responsible for maintaining peace and security around the globe. The question is, of course, whether the Council is fit for the task, as its current practices are sometimes slow and do not provide a flexible response.\nToday migration is the one of the main issues worldwide. Since the large migration crisis in 2015, it has been a major political issue for the European Union and for my country. Although we have reduced the second wave of migration by deepening our cooperation with Turkey to try to decrease the influx of migrants from conflict zones in the Middle East and Afghanistan, it is definitely not a systemic solution to the problem. It is not enough to tackle the consequences and effects of these crises. Above all, we must address and eliminate their causes. Refugees must be motivated to return home, and that will only happen when their homes give them hope again. That is why we support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. They will help us to eradicate the reasons that lead people to flee war zones or leave economies that are unable to provide them with decent lives.\nThe problem of migration must be addressed at its roots. We want people to have a better and safer life at home. We therefore support the long-term direct stabilization of turbulent areas, through rapid humanitarian aid and continuing development cooperation, which the Czech Republic provides in many places around the world. That is also why we support open and free international trade, which is a source of economic growth and the best instrument for reducing poverty.\nWe are now engaged in Africa much more actively than before. The Czech Republic has opened an embassy in Bamako, and we are helping to stabilize the security situation in Mali, although unfortunately many people incorrectly think that we care only about our interests in Central and Eastern Europe. We have introduced a new financial programme for our entrepreneurs, which makes it much easier to invest in developing countries, because investment is the key to employment and development.\nFor a long time we have been active in Syria, where we were the only EU country to maintain an open embassy headed by an ambassador throughout the conflict. To date, 5.6 million people have left Syria and 6.2 million have had to leave their homes. I think that Europe must find a common language for discussion with President Erdogan. It is important to encourage him to pursue a concrete plan for refugees from Syria, and it is essential to establish peace in the region and make the region liveable again by building apartments, hospitals and schools instead of refugee camps. We must begin discussions with Turkey to that end. I am fully aware of President Erdogan\u2019s recent statement that he will release 1 million Syrian refugees to Europe if there is no buffer zone in northern Syria. I personally support his plan for a secure corridor in Syria. I think we can improve the situation if we in the EU continue to discuss the issue with President Erdogan. And we cannot forget that we have to be able to speak to Syria.\nOne of the main slogans of our 1989 revolution was \u201cBack to Europe\u201d. Thirty years ago, the Czech Republic returned to where it historically belonged. Today it is therefore playing its part within the United Nations and globally. I hope we can work on that together.\n"

        "file_text": "It is indeed a distinct honour to address, for the first time, the General Assembly, which is entrusted with the responsibility of charting the way forward on the wide array of issues that impact our collective development. On behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, I extend sincere congratulations to Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. We look forward to the excellence that he will demonstrate and thank him for the steady hand of leadership he brings to that high office. Allow me also to extend our gratitude to his predecessor, Her Excellency Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces of Ecuador, who served with great distinction as the first female from the Latin American and Caribbean region to be elected President of the General Assembly.\nAs we approach the seventy-fifth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations, a challenging road lies ahead unless we collectively do what is necessary to alter the current trajectory of global events. We continue to note with alarm the number of persons living in poverty, the innumerable threats posed by the effects of unmitigated climate change and the continued exclusion of the most vulnerable in our societies with respect to access to education, social protection and health care. Migration, violent extremism, the scourge of terrorism, the threat of violent conflict and the spread of communicable diseases \u2014 such as the recent resurgence of Ebola and measles \u2014 are pressing challenges that transcend the borders of individual countries.\nWe have witnessed extreme flooding, droughts, coral bleaching, rising sea levels, heatwaves and devastating hurricanes with increasing strength and frequency in many parts of the world. In that regard, it was with profound sadness that we witnessed, just a few weeks ago, the horrific destruction of our Caribbean Community (CARICOM) neighbour by Hurricane Dorian, which sat on the small islands of the Bahamas for almost 30 hours. I join with other speakers in offering our deepest condolences to the Government and the people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas on the loss of life and extensive destruction of property and livelihoods as a result of that unprecedented weather event. Trinidad and Tobago stands in solidarity with and strong support of our brothers and sisters in the Bahamas.\nAs a family of nations, the challenges we face require us to place emphasis on multilateral approaches rather than unilateral ones. We should be strengthening our partnerships through mutual respect and cooperation. That approach would allow us to regain some ground in reversing the current patterns of growing inequality and insecurity and transform current circumstances for the benefit of all humankind. It is against that backdrop that I welcome the opportunity to share the perspectives of Trinidad and Tobago on the appropriately selected theme of this general debate, namely \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d.\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, our citizens have been central to our development since 1956 and, in fact, our people remain our greatest assets. We must create a society in which all basic needs are met and each individual is valued and given the opportunity to participate and contribute. That means that we must ensure food security and eradicate poverty, inequality, discrimination and disease, and address the lack of access to health care as well as substandard and inhumane living conditions. We must build a society that shares the principles and cultural norms of trust, goodwill, honesty, respect, tolerance, integrity, civic pride, social justice and community spirit. Accordingly, Trinidad and Tobago has adopted an integrated national poverty-reduction strategy that is collaborative, sustainable and meaningful for all stakeholders involved.\nThe consolidation of our economic stability and capacity to remain effectively integrated into the global financial and trade architecture remains a priority for my Government as we continue the quest for measures to strengthen our fiscal resilience through diversification. Our national development ambitions should be buttressed by an enabling international economic environment through international trade, development cooperation, business activity and finance.\nWe are well aware that financial services play an important role as contributors to economic growth and international trade and investment. It is in that context that we express grave concern regarding the unilateral insertion of some CARICOM member States, including Trinidad and Tobago, on the list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions by a number of our international partners. The label of non-cooperative tax jurisdiction has the potential to inflict irreparable damage to the reputations and economies of small island developing States such as ours. Trinidad and Tobago therefore calls upon its international partners to adopt a more collaborative, just and fair approach in addressing that issue.\nTrinidad and Tobago also remains deeply concerned about the progressive decline in correspondent banking services by international banks. That is particularly problematic for CARICOM member States, as it threatens our financial stability, impedes our efforts to alleviate poverty and limits our achievements with respect to socioeconomic growth and development. Further, the withdrawal of correspondent banking services undermines the region\u2019s efforts to consolidate a global partnership that will achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Trinidad and Tobago joins with other CARICOM member States in calling for international banks to engage collaboratively with affected member States to restore mutually acceptable financial relationships.\nWe welcome the observation by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the CARICOM Conference of Heads of Government in July that eligibility for official development assistance and other forms of concessional financing should include vulnerability criteria. Trinidad and Tobago therefore takes this opportunity to reiterate its call for the international community and international financial and development institutions to consider the formulation of new, multidimensional parameters in determining access to concessionary financing. We continue to endorse the view that the United Nations development system should be driven by a multidimensional approach to development assistance, which is more appropriately suited to each country\u2019s specific needs and national priorities.\nWe remain troubled at the fact that, even as we approach the third decade of the twenty-first century, women, girls and persons with disabilities in many parts of the world are unable to enjoy basic human rights and freedoms. In our effort to combat that challenge, Trinidad and Tobago reaffirms its commitment to delivering improved health care, the continued enhancement of the educational system and increased accessibility and support to persons with disabilities. Women and girls must also be equal partners in our collaborative efforts to build peaceful and sustainable societies and promote and protect human rights. The promotion of gender equity and equality is essential in that regard. It is equally important to consolidate an integrated social protection system that improves living conditions and creates opportunities for women and girls so that they can achieve their full potential.\nWe have no doubt that climate change represents a very real threat that jeopardizes our pursuit of sustainable development. In the circumstances, my Government is moving towards the deployment of a multi-pronged approach to adapt to and mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. Trinidad and Tobago recognizes that climate change adversely affects all countries, regardless of how much they contribute to global emissions. In that respect, I wish to reiterate my Government\u2019s unwavering commitment to addressing the adverse impacts associated with climate change through a combination of collaborative approaches, improved partnerships and networking with stakeholders in order to meet our international obligations, in line with our national laws, policies and priorities.\nFor us in Trinidad and Tobago, the marine environment and its resources remain critically important to the livelihoods of our people, our cultural and social identity and our sustainable development ambitions. Trinidad and Tobago therefore remains hopeful that the adoption of an international legally binding instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdictions, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, may become a reality in the not-too-distant future. We maintain that that agreement would establish a platform for both the achievement of sustainable development and the protection of the common heritage of humankind for this and future generations.\nThe foreign policy of Trinidad and Tobago is guided by the tenets of respect for the sovereignty and sovereign equality of all States, non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and respect for and adherence to international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. As a small island developing State, we remain fervent in our conviction that despite existing in a world where the well-established principles of multilateralism are under threat, our right to be heard ought not to be diminished or dismissed.\nFor us in the Caribbean region, our sustainable growth and development hinge on the maintenance of peace and security. In that context, I wish to turn to the situation facing our closest neighbour, Venezuela, which is located only seven miles off the coast of Trinidad. Earlier this year, Venezuela became the epicentre of a global stand-off that saw the threat of the use of force by external forces against the country. As that worrisome development continued to escalate, Trinidad and Tobago joined with fellow CARICOM member States to push for an urgent de-escalation of tensions and build a platform for dialogue and negotiations, with a view to achieving a peaceful resolution of the situation. Arising out of CARICOM\u2019s non-interventionist stance and diplomacy of peace, the Prime Ministers of Barbados and Saint Kitts and Nevis and myself, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, met with Secretary-General Guterres, the Permanent Representatives of several influential Member States and other stakeholders \u2014 as mandated by CARICOM \u2014 to underscore our concerns about the volatility of the Venezuelan situation, the safety of the citizens of Venezuela and the stability of our region.\nWe remain resolute in our conviction that for our region to remain a zone of peace, dialogue is critical and indispensable. Trinidad and Tobago therefore remains in full support of the Montevideo Mechanism and any other suitable initiatives that seek to bring about a peaceful resolution through meaningful and constructive dialogue. In that regard, I wish to make special mention of the Norwegian Government and applaud its efforts so far in bringing both sides to the negotiating table, most recently in Barbados. We recognize that in order to achieve meaningful progress, the negotiation process requires time and patience, and all parties must engage in good faith. We therefore urge external forces not to further engage in unilateral intrusions, which could potentially undermine the negotiations and ultimately cause further hardship for the Venezuelan people. The objective of the international community should be to ensure that both parties are allowed to arrive at conditions of progress in Venezuela, with the ultimate aim of achieving political stability, peace and economic well-being. The initiatives of the Norwegian Government, CARICOM and the Montevideo Mechanism are worthy of support to that end. We are saddened by the recent withdrawal of one party from that sane and sober initiative, but we trust that that development will be temporary, because only Venezuelans can take proper ownership of their situation, and we in the Organization can only help them along the path to security and economic stability.\nFor us in Trinidad and Tobago, our sustainable development would be difficult to attain without successfully managing irregular migration. Trinidad and Tobago has not been unaffected by the influx of migrants from Venezuela. To manage that situation, my Government implemented a migrant registration framework system for both documented and undocumented persons who have entered our country. The aim of the framework is to safeguard the human rights and humanitarian needs of Venezuelan nationals within our borders, while also safeguarding national interests such as national security. Those registered have been granted approval to work for one year, in the first instance. It should be noted that the registration process has afforded those persons the opportunity to be self-funded through employment during their stay in Trinidad and Tobago.\nAs a responsible member of the family of nations, the Government and the people of Trinidad and Tobago recognize our duty to assist our neighbours in their time of distress. We are undertaking to do that for just over 16,000 of our neighbours from Venezuela, despite our small size and very limited resources. Experience has shown that there are both opportunities and challenges with respect to migration. Our policy is rooted in the human attributes of respect and dignity and ensuring that empathy shines through as a beacon to the destitute.\nThose challenges are magnified for countries like Trinidad and Tobago, with limited resources and other capacity constraints. We note with concern that criminal activity has moved from random acts of criminality to criminal networks, the activities of which are being carried out in an organized, highly sophisticated and technological global environment. It is Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s experience and that of the Caribbean Community as a whole that these compounded challenges represent a threat to our socioeconomic well-being, the rule of law and our peace and security.\nWhile it is important to tackle violent extremism from a security perspective, the threat and effect of the phenomenon should be neither overlooked nor dismissed. The global threat of young people being lured by extremist groups remains a major concern. In that regard, Trinidad and Tobago reaffirms its commitment to joining the international community in building an alliance for a strategic, collective security architecture that addresses the conditions that give rise to violent extremism. That framework ideally ought to be buttressed by a robust international legal system that allows all people to live freely and in dignity, with equal protection before the law and without fear of persecution or xenophobia.\nHistory has taught us that the maintenance of international peace and security cannot be separated from sustainable development. In that regard, we maintain that the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba, a Caribbean nation, which has been in place for almost six decades, undermines the country\u2019s potential to achieve sustainable development and economic growth. Trinidad and Tobago further maintains that the imposition of unilateral coercive measures against Cuba under the Helms-Burton Act is inconsistent with international law and the Charter of the United Nations. Trinidad and Tobago thus reiterates its call for the unconditional lifting of the economic, commercial and financial embargo on Cuba.\nTrinidad and Tobago supports the mandate of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is to help put an end to impunity for perpetrators of the most heinous crimes of concern to the international community, as well as to contribute to the prevention of such crimes. As a country that advocated for the establishment of the ICC through the pioneering work of the late Arthur N. R. Robinson, former President and Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, we remain resolute in our commitment to support the mandate of the Court. Despite its detractors and other challenges, the ICC continues to be a ray of hope for all victims who are seeking justice for crimes falling under its jurisdiction. For that reason, we continue to encourage those countries that have not yet submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court to do so, sooner rather than later, so that it can aptly and fully fulfil its mandate as a universal court.\nTrinidad and Tobago maintains that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons constitutes a crime against humanity and a violation of international law, including international humanitarian law and the Charter of the United Nations. Lamentably, we have witnessed in recent times the elimination of restraints on nuclear weapons at both the bilateral and the multilateral levels. Trinidad and Tobago, as part of the Caribbean Community, participated in the 2017 United Nations conference to negotiate a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination, and welcomed the adoption of the historic Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. In that regard, I am proud to announce that yesterday, 26 September, Trinidad and Tobago signed and deposited its instrument of ratification for the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\nThe reform of the Security Council continues to be an area in which CARICOM remains actively engaged in advocacy for early and comprehensive reform. We look forward to the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform at the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly, building on the work done at the seventy-third session. We therefore reiterate our call for all Member States to work collaboratively in the spirit of compromise to reform the Security Council in a manner that would effectively address its functioning and credibility, making it more relevant to the United Nations and better equipped to fulfil its mandate in today\u2019s context.\nAs CARICOM, one of our positions for the reform of the Security Council has been to advocate for the guaranteed representation and inclusion of small island developing States through a dedicated seat to be rotated among SIDS across all regions. While we remain hopeful that such a proposal will eventually find favour among Member States, at this moment it is with great pride that we congratulate CARICOM nation Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on becoming, earlier this year, the smallest nation ever to secure a seat on the Council. This historic achievement has convincingly demonstrated that our small islands remain indomitable as we continue to make noteworthy contributions in all spheres. At this juncture, I would like to assure the General Assembly of Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s continued dedication to the maintenance of international peace and security, as evidenced in our candidature for membership in the Council for the period 2027-2028, for what could be the second time in our nation\u2019s history.\nAs the United Nations stands on the threshold of celebrating its seventy-fifth anniversary, Trinidad and Tobago is pleased to recommit itself to the purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. As States Members of the United Nations, we need to recalibrate our efforts towards ensuring that our Organization is effective, relevant and fit for purpose and that no one is left behind. I am confident that we possess the inherent desire, the will and the impetus to achieve those goals.\n"

        "file_text": "I am deeply honoured to address this supremely important Assembly on behalf of the President of the Republic of Botswana, Mr. Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi, and of our people.\nAllow me, on behalf of my delegation, to join previous speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. We are confident that we will benefit during your tenure of office from your able leadership and wealth of experience. You can count on my country\u2019s support in the discharge of your mandate. Let me also take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to your predecessor, Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, for her sterling stewardship throughout the seventy-third session, which has just drawn to a close. She leaves behind a legacy we are convinced you will carry forward.\nBotswana fully endorses the theme of the seventy-fourth session, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d. It is both relevant and timely, as it reaffirms the key role of the multilateral system as the ultimate framework through which we can collectively transform our societies. This theme further challenges us as the global community to recommit to the noble goal of leaving no one behind, and to do our utmost to reach those furthest behind, which usually includes the vulnerable in our societies, such as women, youth and people with disabilities. My delegation is particularly pleased that the theme embodies the priorities you, Mr. President, have identified. We therefore concur that we should redouble our efforts to effectively tackle poverty and all forms of inequality. Inequality remains a problem in developing countries, including middle-income countries such as my own. Inequality and exclusion are threats to peace, therefore requiring that we all come together to urgently address them.\nAt the same time, we wish to acknowledge the pivotal role of quality education and the need to invest more in this sector to enable us to step up implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In that regard, we applaud your commitment, Sir, to leveraging high-level meetings \u2014 such as the summits on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), climate action, universal health coverage and financing for development \u2014 to galvanize political commitment to urgently address the most pressing global challenges affecting our people and the planet. Such high-level engagements, involving as they do world leaders from Government, the private sector, academia and civil society, provide a unique opportunity to build and reinvigorate partnerships around our common development objectives.\nWe note with satisfaction that 2019 has been a significant year for SDG implementation, with a number of countries presenting their voluntary national reviews, indicating their status of implementation against the Goals. Botswana presented its review in 2017. We view the process as a valuable accountability mechanism to monitor progress towards the attainment of the SDGs, and we encourage its continuation.\nBotswana, like many States Members of the United Nations, is facing many challenges, including extreme poverty and inequalities. In that regard, our Government continues to direct significant resources towards inclusive development and economic growth. Consequently, we have in place various policies and poverty-eradication programmes to support the most vulnerable in our society, such as orphans and people living with disabilities. The national voluntary review process was indeed instrumental in identifying the gaps and major challenges that still hinder our full implementation of the SDGs. Those challenges include youth unemployment, poverty, increasing social and economic inequalities, climate change and unsustainable patterns of consumption and production. The process further identified financing gaps. In that regard, we view public-private partnerships as critical for mobilizing resources for the implementation of the SDGs. It is equally important that we continue to work together to create an enabling global environment to ensure that all countries can participate in a fair and rules-based global trading system.\nAs already indicated, Botswana recognizes the importance of quality education, that is, education that empowers, fuels prosperity and positions citizens to be globally competitive. In recognition of that, Botswana has invested significantly in all levels of education. Indeed, we are pleased to report that we have successfully attained gender parity in access to education. However, much remains to be done. We must address issues including large class sizes, underresourced schools and institutions, old infrastructure and insufficient and outdated technologies. Those challenges are significant because it is only with quality education that a country can be a participant in, and beneficiary of, the fourth industrial revolution.\nClimate change is indeed one of the greatest challenges we face today. We therefore commend the Secretary-General for convening two summits on climate change at the present session of the Assembly, involving world leaders and the world\u2019s youth. They provided an opportunity for deliberations on climate change-related actions, addressing the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions and achieving the target of net-zero emissions by 2050. The science is very clear: unless there is urgent action, climate change will reverse the many gains we have made in key sectors of our economy.\nBotswana, like others African countries, is already experiencing the effects of climate change, including desertification, heat waves and recurrent droughts. As I address the Assembly today, Botswana and some of our neighbours have declared 2019 a drought year. Crops have failed and livestock are dying. Moreover, our neighbours Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe suffered catastrophic impacts from Cyclone Idai, which resulted in significant loss of life and massive destruction of infrastructure and property. We take this opportunity to commend our subregion and the international community for the timely response they rendered in support of the countries affected by the cyclone. We note that rebuilding lives and livelihoods will take time, and therefore urge that support continue to be directed to those countries.\nWe also reiterate our deepest sympathies and condolences to the Government and the people of the Bahamas in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian. It is clear that we need to adopt permanent mitigation and adaptation measures, as well as put in place robust response systems to collectively support affected countries.\nBotswana remains fully committed to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, in which we have anchored our national development objectives. In that regard, as part of our mitigation and adaptation drive, we have developed a climate change policy and strategy. Furthermore, in our intended nationally determined contribution, Botswana has committed to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 15 per cent by 2030, based on the 2010 baseline. We therefore appeal for concerted global action to support our efforts through the provision of technology, financing and capacity-building in order to achieve our intended nationally determined contributions.\nAllow me to address an equally pressing environmental issue of major concern to Botswana. I must say, as we collectively grapple with finding prudent and innovative ways of managing our environment and its ecosystems for sustainable use, human-wildlife conflict is a serious challenge for Botswana and our subregion. Our elephant population has grown to unmanageable proportions and is now exceeding the carrying capacity of its designated area of habitat. Elephants are now aggressively encroaching on many human settlements around the country. Elephants outside national parks invade homes and farms, kill people and destroy property. Moreover, elephants within parks are destroying their own environment because of overpopulation.\nBotswana has an outstanding track record in the conservation and protection of its wild flora and fauna. In that context, 40 per cent of our land is reserved as protected areas for wildlife and conservation. That demonstrates our steadfast commitment to protecting wildlife and curbing the illegal trade in wild species. That commitment comes at a huge cost and sacrifice. A multifaceted response with the support and understanding of our international partners is urgently required.\nWe fully concur that, as espoused in the founding principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), people and States should and must be the best protectors of their own wild fauna and flora. In that regard, Botswana, together with the Southern Africa subregion, has been working tirelessly to find sustainable solutions.\nAs I already intimated, Botswana firmly believes that part of the solution lies in working with the very communities that live in, or are adjacent to, protected areas. Those communities must be supported to effectively coexist with wildlife and to enable them to contribute to anti-poaching efforts. That is indeed critical as competition for food and land between people and animals intensifies.\nIn an effort to bolster our elephant conservation and management efforts, Botswana and the countries of the subregion recently presented a proposal to allow a one-off sale of ivory from countries whose populations are currently listed in CITES appendix II. That prudent approach was regrettably rebuffed, despite our best efforts to demonstrate that revenues accruing from such sales of ivory stockpiles would be used in conservation efforts, just as in the past. We were therefore disappointed that much of the discussion at the eighteenth Conference of the Parties to CITES focused on increased restrictions on wildlife trade, when the fundamental purpose of the Convention is to regulate and facilitate international trade. Equally disheartening were attempts to extend the scope of the Convention in a manner that would infringe upon sovereign matters. That proposal, which did not succeed, sought to close all domestic ivory trade.\nI cannot emphasize enough that, in order to deliver on our development aspirations to live in harmony with nature and ensure the sustainable use of our natural resources, we must facilitate the implementation of pragmatic natural resource-management plans that contribute to our national development agenda.\nBotswana welcomes the convening of the High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development. In that regard, the United Nations should continue to pay special attention to the unique needs of least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing States (SIDS), middle-income countries and countries emerging from conflict.\nWe welcome the convening of the High-level Meeting to Review Progress Made in Addressing the Priorities of Small Island Developing States Through the Implementation of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway. That review will afford us an opportunity to reassess priorities, build on lessons learned and develop meaningful and transformative solutions.\nEqually important is the high-level midterm review on the implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action on Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-2024, which will be convened in December. The review will provide an opportunity for us to take stock of the progress made and to address challenges to the implementation of the Programme. At the national level, we consider the Programme to be a vital framework to further drive our development agenda through trade facilitation and greater access to global markets.\nBotswana is of the view that South-South and triangular cooperation is a fundamental platform for enhancing cooperation among all countries for mutual benefit. We recognize its importance for sustainable development and that it is complementary to North-South cooperation. To this end, Botswana has developed a South-South and Triangular Cooperation Strategy. The Strategy will facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experiences, as well as leverage appropriate technologies to bolster national capacities to accelerate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nAs a global leader in diamond mining, we stand firmly behind the Kimberley Process, an international mechanism set up to stem the flow of conflict diamonds and promote the legitimate diamond trade. We therefore look forward to chairing the Kimberley Process in 2021, and will work with all other members to strengthen its mechanisms. Furthermore, our priorities will include capacity-building for members of the Kimberley Process, especially those emerging from conflict.\nAs part of our commitment to a peaceful world order, Botswana recently became a State party to the Arms Trade Treaty. We have also just signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. That speaks to our commitment to contributing to global peace and security through complete disarmament by eliminating the illicit trade in conventional and nuclear weapons. Humankind should invest not in its own destruction but in its own prosperity.\nThe scourge of terrorism threatens to reverse hard-earned peace and security gains. We should spare no effort in the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We note with satisfaction that the new Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact will, among other things, provide capacity-building and technical assistance for developing countries, particularly in Africa. Similarly, we welcome the efforts of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism to address these challenges.\nBotswana remains fully committed to combating all acts of terrorism and to resolutely confronting associated bad practices, such as illicit financial flows and money-laundering. However, we wish to caution that the de-risking approaches taken by Governments, correspondent banks and other financial institutions should take into consideration the unintended consequences of such measures, including discouraging the use of banking facilities, limited access to banking facilities and the possible collapse of small banks and economies. Moving forward, though, we will remain engaged with all relevant stakeholders to eliminate any deficiencies in our anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism strategies.\nAs we strive for world peace and prosperity. I wish to affirm that Botswana aligns itself with the statement delivered on behalf of the United Republic of Tanzania, Chair of the Southern African Development Community, regarding the lifting of sanctions on Zimbabwe (see A/74/PV.10). There is no doubt that those prolonged sanctions gravely undermine the economy of Zimbabwe and inflict severe hardship on the ordinary people of that country. We also wish to note that sanctions against any country negatively affect not only the target country but also its neighbours and trading partners. The case of Zimbabwe is no exception.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that our multilateral system is under serious threat. We cannot deny that we are experiencing an unprecedented deterioration of the very common values that bind us together in the United Nations family, as enshrined in the Charter. It is imperative that we marshal our collective resolve to revive the culture of diplomacy, tolerance and mutual respect and fully embrace the strength of our diversity for the survival of our multilateral system. We therefore call for a restrengthening of the rules-based world order, anchored in the principles of international law and geared towards strengthening international cooperation for the prosperity of all nations, large and small. Botswana remains committed to the multilateral order and believes in a strong and effective United Nations as an Organization that is people-centred, representative, harmonious, accountable and anchored in the sovereign equality of nations.\nAs we look forward to the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, we must seize the opportunity to reconfirm that it remains as relevant today as it was at its founding in 1945.\nOnce again, I take this opportunity to reaffirm my Government\u2019s commitment to attaining the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union Agenda 2063 and to creating a better world characterized by shared prosperity and where no one is left behind."

        "file_text": "Seneca said that none of us love our homeland because it is great. We love it because it is ours.\nI thank Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for having successfully presided over the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I also congratulate the President of the Assembly, Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, who is already promoting a highly proactive global debate.\nGuatemala is a strong advocate of the rule of law and democratic ideals. In that spirit, this year we are holding free elections that are based on international standards of electoral democracy. It is important to also highlight that for the first time in Guatemala\u2019s political history we implemented voting from abroad, which sets a precedent for guaranteeing the right to vote outside our borders. Guatemala now has stronger institutions with technical capabilities to be able to fulfil its role in society.\nIn the area of education, the average number of full school days was increased from 163 days, in 2015, to 198 full school days, this year, which is also unprecedented in Guatemala\u2019s recent history. Educational coverage was also increased to include 3,122,000 students, and I can proudly say that we quadrupled our investment per day in school meals. For that, we rely on the parents of each school, who guarantee the transparency of the programme, focusing on the education and health of our children.\nFor the first time ever, the State provided over 1,000 schools with technological equipment in a single year and fully complied with the delivery of educational materials and school texts in Mayan and Spanish, something we have never done before. Over time, financial resources have also been transferred to all educational programmes and we have guaranteed access to free Guatemalan education. In addition, we implemented the Acompa\u00f1ame a Crecer programme, which seeks to aid development in early childhood for children from zero to age 4 who have not previously been in public education. Moreover, for those who have been unable to study in the regular education system, a certification-of-skills system was initiated that recognizes and certifies the knowledge and skills of people who work in a trade learned throughout their lives, both for Guatemalans in Guatemala and those living in the United States of America.\nOn another area of development, we prioritized the Open Government Partnership for the period 2016 to 2018, which resulted in a national policy on transparency and combating corruption. My Government Administration has focused on fostering a culture of transparency and good governance. We launched the Presidential Commission for Open Public Administration and Transparency, which goes hand in hand with the Government\u2019s fourth national open action plan for the period 2018 to 2020.\nIn terms of security, we have taken firm steps that have led to highly positive indicators. We have reduced the homicide rate for every 100,000 inhabitants, which has maintained the most favourable downward trend of the past 20 years. That was possible thanks to a cleanup of our security forces and ensuring their greater professionalism and efficiency.\nThe national civil police managed to dismantle dangerous criminal gangs that were engaged in extortion, kidnapping, vehicle theft and property crime. This year the number of police officers increased from 31,000, in 2015, to 42,000 national civil police, who are now better equipped and have higher wages.\nIn the area of infrastructure, we inherited a collapsed road network, with 60 per cent of roads in poor or terrible condition. However, after solving budgetary, administrative and judicial problems, which plagued a large number of contracts, today we can say that 72 per cent of road surfacing has a rating of good to optimal, according to the assessment carried out by the national competitiveness programme. We hope to end this year with more than 85 per cent of roads in optimal condition, which would allow the next Government to not only reach 100 per cent but also to build the many more roads that the country still needs.\nIn terms of the environment, we have increased the protection of our forests, which are part of the world\u2019s lungs. We are planning to reforest 1.2 million hectares of trees by 2032, in which my Government has invested $50 million per year, the equivalent of $200 million in forest incentive programmes. I want to take this opportunity to express our dismay at the recent fires in the Amazon rainforest.\nAs the Assembly is aware, Guatemala has vast water wealth and we have therefore formulated a process to protect and decontaminate our rivers, lakes and seas. We now represent a benchmark for the world in this area, thanks to the creation and implementation of biofences \u2014 handcrafted tools that stop large amounts of floating debris. There are currently 196 biofences installed throughout the country. If anyone is wondering what a biofence is, they are simply handmade pieces of mesh made from plastic waste that serve as a barrier to waste floating in water currents. We have found the invention to be effective, and countries on ours and other continents are now extremely interested in cooperating with Guatemala in that area. The Assembly can rest assured that we will not hesitate to support other members, because we are committed to preserving natural resources. That tool is one of Guatemala\u2019s legacies to humankind.\nSpeaking of legacies, I wish to share with the Assembly that we recently released the results of the twelfth national population census and seventh housing census to the people of Guatemala. After 17 years of waiting, we settled a historic debt with Guatemala that translates into real statistics for engineering our development model. The twelfth population census is one of the first in the region to be conducted and framed within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It was carried out using the United Nations Population Fund\u2019s international standards.\nIn matters of foreign policy, Guatemala and Belize concluded the peaceful process of submitting Guatemala\u2019s territorial, insular and maritime claim to the International Court of Justice. That is a historic milestone for Guatemala, Central America and the world, which has resulted in a peaceful and definitive solution to the years of dispute between Guatemala and Belize. The peoples of Guatemala and Belize conducted popular and peaceful consultations with positive results and a desire to finally resolve the dispute before the International Court of Justice. Relations between Guatemala and Belize have never been better, and we are determined to continue strengthening them. I extend my deep and sincere thanks to the group of friendly countries that supported Guatemala and Belize in the process, where dialogue \u2014 the basis of true democracy \u2014 prevailed.\nI am also pleased to share with members that, in November last year, Guatemala successfully held the twenty-sixth Iberoamerican Summit of Heads of State and Government in Antigua. It was one of the best attended in history and enabled us to develop cooperation policies under the slogan \u201cA Prosperous, Inclusive and Sustainable Iberoamerica.\u201d\nAt the international level, Guatemala believes that all countries, in particular those that embrace democracy and the principles that gave life to the United Nations, have the right to belong to this great Organization. We believe that the experience and capabilities of the Republic of China on Taiwan can contribute to strengthening multilateralism from this Organization and its specialized agencies.\nThe Guatemalan Government reaffirms its commitment to migration policies that place human beings at the centre of development and prosperity. We are eager to collaborate with comprehensive immigration governance that respects the human rights of migrants at all times. We firmly share the ideals of safe, orderly and regular migration. For that reason, we are coordinating efforts with different countries to mitigate the actual causes of such migration. However, in order to mitigate irregular migration, we must assume that shared responsibility in a responsible manner, because all countries have a role to play in today\u2019s reality, and only by working together can we take firm steps to safeguard our nations.\nOur presidential Administration has been based on a strategic plan, which is scheduled until 2032. That trajectory for the country aligns our general Government policy for the period 2016 to 2020 with the 2030 Agenda, and every one of our public policies involves fulfilling the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\nIn the view of the State of Guatemala it is essential to maintain peace, the nation\u2019s security, sovereignty and respect for the rule of law. A culture of respect for States\u2019 sovereign decisions must prevail. That applies to the same Secretariat that violated our democratic principles of self-determination.\nThe reason for the existence of the Organization is to maintain world peace and global harmony and to strengthen modern States. However, the Secretariat of this great multilateral Organization polarized Guatemalan society through the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). The Commission violated the principles of national sovereignty, disrespected the laws of our country, undermined institutional autonomy, put social peace at risk and challenged the governance of the nation. However, the saddest and most worrisome fact is that it did it with the consent of the United Nations, under the guise of fighting corruption and impunity. That gave it the perfect discourse to politicize justice and judicialize politics, which we Guatemalans do not allow; we have been a free, sovereign and independent country since 1821.\nMoreover, when speaking of independence and national sovereignty, I wish to inform the Assembly that although the mandate of CICIG has ended, the consequences of its actions in Guatemala must be thoroughly investigated. Under the leadership of Ivan Velasquez Gomez, the Commission used the image of the United Nations for political purposes in Guatemala. Ivan Velasquez Gomez turned criminal prosecution into a tool of selective persecution and political harassment, violating universal rights, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Convention on Human Rights, as well as violating the political Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala. Moreover, he disregarded the principle of presumption of innocence, the right to self-defence and the judicial guarantee of due process, abusing the honourable position entrusted to him.\nMy first question to the Assembly is: was CICIG a United Nations body? The answer is no. I quote the agreement that gave rise to the CICIG, \u201cas a non-United Nations organ, functioning solely in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.\u201d\nI must therefore ask once again: to whom was CICIG accountable? To the Secretariat, donor countries or the Guatemalan Government? Interestingly, the agreement does not state to whom it was accountable. To answer that question, we must therefore reflect on the following. When the country where CICIG operated submitted its concerns about the abuses committed by CICIG to the Secretary-General, why were those concerns ignored, given that Guatemala is a founding State and Member of this Organization? Who is to blame for those human rights violations in Guatemala, seeing that several people died as a result of CICIG, many others were unjustly imprisoned and others remain in custody without having given their provisional statement? It is worth clarifying that the closure of CICIG will have no repercussions on the judicial processes in which it participated, since all proceedings that were initiated will continue at the request of the legally competent authorities in Guatemala.\nI am clarifying these facts because the former head of CICIG has unfortunately dedicated himself to discrediting my country, with success, taking advantage of the international position he held to promote an agenda full of political and ideological interests that are alien to the principles of the United Nations. His actions divided the Guatemalan population, however, above all, he betrayed the confidence that our country placed in him to fight criminal structures, supposedly his main task. Instead, he turned CICIG into a criminal structure that co-opted Guatemalan justice.\nIt is most unfortunate and very worrying that international officials who serve States, are devoting themselves to discrediting our country before the international community. That is disloyalty. Guatemala opened its doors to the United Nations in order for it to support us to better fight corruption and impunity. However, the low morale and unprofessionalism of the former CICIG Commissioner led him to commit a series of actions that upstanding Guatemalans are not willing to tolerate or forget. His thirst for power compelled him to move from the judicial field to the political sphere, to which I can attest, while publicly supporting former prosecutor Thelma Aldana, a presidential candidate in our most recent elections. Incidentally, former prosecutor Aldana is currently a fugitive from justice for several reasons. It was she who said that no one is above the law, and so we hope that she soon returns to Guatemala. No one should ever be able to take advantage of the position they hold to promote personal interests, even more so when they represent the United Nations or its actors, which must ensure the independence, impartiality and objectivity of justice.\nWith regard to the role of the press in my country, I will limit myself to respectfully citing His Holiness Pope Francis, who recently said: \u201cWe need a journalism that is free, at the service of truth, goodness and justice; a journalism that helps build a culture of encounter.\u201d\nGuatemala appreciates the valuable support of the international community, but wishes to make it known that not a single penny donated to CICIG was administered by the Guatemalan Government. For the sake of transparency, we believe that it would be appropriate for the Secretariat to provide the Assembly with detailed information about every single penny of its resources that was spent, from CICIG\u2019s establishment in Guatemala until its closure. To guarantee transparency, it would be worth hiring one of the world\u2019s most prestigious auditing firms. I am sure that such accountability before Member States would be very positive and highly valued by the friendly donors who relied on an unprecedented United Nations effort that failed in Guatemala.\nWho will provide explanations to the relatives of the CICIG victims? Some individuals died in jail as a result of abusive pre-trial detention; others were deprived of their freedom for years and then acquitted for lack of evidence. That is a serious matter. However, there is something even more serious and extremely critical that we must not forget: the use of false witnesses and media slander, which are despicable and condemnable acts \u2014 even more so when they came from this Organization, which promotes respect for human rights.\nThose are all serious violations of the human rights of Guatemalans, which should not remain unpunished, much less so because they were committed by a Commission that fought against impunity. Nor can those facts weigh heavily on donor countries, whose good faith was betrayed. Accountability should not only apply to Member States, but also to CICIG and any agency, commission or authority operating under the auspices of the members of the Assembly.\nLast August, Ivan Velasquez Gomez submitted a report that was completely devoid of truth from the start. Given that the country\u2019s national and international laws were violated, as well as the human rights of its citizens, I therefore urge the Assembly to produce an objective and exhaustive report of the actions of CICIG in Guatemala, with the participation of countries that can guarantee its accuracy. As Jesus of Nazareth said, the truth will set you free.\nAgainst the backdrop of fighting organized crime and drug trafficking in Guatemala, a terrorist act was perpetrated in my country on 3 September. Three members of the Guatemalan armed forces were massacred in a northern community of the country. Following that incident, we made the decision to decree a state of siege in 22 of the country\u2019s municipalities. In that regard, I wish to express the rejection by the Republic of Guatemala\u2019s Government of an attempt to promote an independent investigation by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). We believe that such action is another example of the abuses that United Nations agencies have committed in my country. In that context, the Guatemalan Government wishes to express to OHCHR that it will not allow it or any other United Nations agency to carry out activities outside of their mandate. I would ask the Assembly to take note of those abuses committed in Guatemala. The investigation and clarification of that terrorist act is the strict responsibility of the Office of Guatemala\u2019s Public Prosecutor through the corresponding prosecutor\u2019s office, with the help of Guatemala\u2019s security forces and legal system.\nI now turn to an extremely important issue \u2014 that of coffee, which is of paramount importance to Guatemala, as a producer. I take this opportunity to propose the creation of more favourable mechanisms for this commercial activity. We also advocate for better conditions, prices and access to more fair markets for the well-being of our economies. We urge the International Coffee Organization to comprehensively, transparently, respectfully and fairly address that issue.\nAt the regional level, the worrisome crisis that persists in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela compels us to consider and support the various efforts to restore democracy in that South American country. As a member of the Lima Support Group, we have strongly supported efforts to search for dialogue among all parties, in order to guarantee the rule of law in Venezuela.\nIt has been a great honour for me to have spoken to the Assembly, and I thank God for giving me the opportunity to strengthen Guatemala\u2019s multilateral relations with the rest of the world. I wish all members the best, and our country will continue to play its historic role by faithfully complying with the Charter of the United Nations.\nI conclude, as I began, with Seneca, who said that none of us love our homeland because it is great; we love it because it is ours.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and the people of the Sudan, it gives me pleasure to express my sincere wishes that the deliberations of the General Assembly during this session will be successful, and to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to lead the Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, along with the other members of the Bureau. I would also like to express my appreciation for the efficiency and experience shown by Ambassador Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces of Ecuador during her presidency of the seventy-third session.\nThe great people of the Sudan have revolted in order to rebuild and restore our country\u2019s values of human coexistence and social cohesion, as well as to end three hateful decades of repression and oppression, discrimination and infighting. They have sought to open a new chapter in their history written in their blood and sacrifice. For more than three months, starting in December of last year, unarmed men and women of the Sudan confronted one of the cruellest terrorist regimes in history with unparalleled courage. They had no weapons apart from their desire to uphold their peaceful revolution, their unity and their determination to advance towards the future.\nThe flame of the revolution continues to burn as a guarantee of the achievement of its goals. While the great French Revolution in the eighteenth century adopted liberty, equality and fraternity as its slogan when it sought to liberate the people, the revolution of the Sudanese people in the twenty-first century adopted the slogan of freedom, peace and justice, thereby reviving the principles of that great revolution in order to free the Sudanese people from the shackles of oppression and indignity. The goal is to enable them to build their homeland and contribute, along with other nations, to the advent of a prosperous world that can accommodate us all, a world that befits the human race and the human conscience everywhere.\nWe are confident that what made our revolution victorious is the direct support of the international community, as represented by the Security Council, the General Assembly, the African Union, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the European Union and the troika of the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Norway, as well as our brothers in Ethiopia, Egypt, South Sudan, Chad, Eritrea, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar. I would like to thank them all. We also thank all our friends and partners that have been supporting us.\nI stand before the Assembly today representing the will of my dignified people, whom I am proud to see marching resolutely towards the future as a friend and partner on equal footing with all peace-loving nations. After three decades, the people of the Sudan are seeking to begin a new phase by reaching out to all our neighbours and to all the countries of the world, guided by the principles of humanity and our own wisdom. We are determined to implement the principles of international law and human rights law along with the efforts of the judiciary in order to eliminate discrimination, exploitation, injustice and inequality. We are also committed to effective participation in establishing and promoting the relevant instruments and conventions. We commit ourselves as well to all diplomatic and international norms of good-neighbourliness and respect for the fundamental principles of friendship and cooperation among nations, namely, respect for the sovereignty and independence of other States as well as non-interference in their internal affairs. We remain principally committed to effectively maintaining international peace and security. We in the revolution\u2019s transitional Government believe that relations among nations must be based on mutual and common interests, as well as positive cooperation, for the good of the people. Our world, with its resources and its wealth, is large enough for all of us to live in prosperity and peace.\nWith our glorious revolution, the Sudan seeks to put an end to a dark era of regional and international isolation that led to the Sudanese Government inheriting a long list of international sanctions and penalties, most prominent of which is the inclusion of the Sudan on the list of State sponsors of terrorism. Let me say it to the Council loud and clear: the Sudanese people have never been a sponsor or a supporter of terrorism. It was the regime that our people revolted against and toppled. Those sanctions have caused tremendous suffering to the people of the Sudan. We in the transitional Government call on the United States of America to remove the Sudan\u2019s name from the list of State sponsors of terrorism and to stop punishing the people of the Sudan for the crimes committed by the very regime that harmed them, of whose evils we have rid the world. We hope that our just request will be urgently met so that we can accelerate the reconstruction and development process in the Sudan in order to eliminate the effects of the three decades spent under the former regime.\nWe fully understand the daunting challenges facing our country, foremost among which is the need to end the war and to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting peace. To that end, we are well aware that we must achieve comprehensive justice by addressing the root causes that led to the war in the first place, including economic marginalization and cultural, ethnic and religious discrimination. Moreover, we need to restore social cohesion and promote peaceful coexistence, as well as a culture of peace and tolerance among all the constituents of the Sudanese population. We are determined to build a State based on the rule of law, citizenship and balanced development, one that can safeguard the rights of the Sudanese people and their interests both in their country and around the world. We also stress the need to address the situation of internally displaced persons and refugees while compensating them for the war damages incurred. Improving the standard of living and ensuring a better and dignified life, especially in the regions affected, will be a priority for achieving peace in the Sudan. Managing the ethnic, cultural, religious and linguistic diversity of the Sudanese people as a source of strength and national pride rather than of strife and division will bolster the pillars of lasting peace and provide the environment necessary for the development, interaction and prosperity of Sudanese cultures.\nDuring the transitional period, the Sudanese Government will seek to ensure that the Sudan makes great strides on the path to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. We support the theme of the current session, \u201cGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion\u201d, and have launched a comprehensive national development plan based on promoting economic governance, combating corruption and committing to transparency and integrity, as well as judicious planning in terms of natural resources in order to ensure self-sufficiency, better exchanges and smart partnerships with the countries of the region and the world. We are also committed to supporting health and education services while providing drinking water as well as other social services. These are not merely services and obligations towards our people; they are also an investment in their future and that of their children and youth.\nAddressing those challenges requires support from the international community, especially in the upcoming short-term period. In this context, we refer to the accumulating foreign debt of the Sudanese State, exacerbated by the policies of the former regime, which overlooked its international commitments and mismanaged its financial dealings with both local and various international parties. This is an urgent issue that must be addressed at the international level, taking into account the current living conditions in the country, which require the State to continue providing the necessary social services and meeting basic needs. The civilian Sudanese Government that resulted from the glorious Sudanese revolution, in which all male and female Sudanese participated, will leave no one behind and will ensure that, despite all the challenges, everyone can benefit from the development process launched by the revolution.\nI would like to pay tribute to the women and men of the Sudan, especially the kandaka women, who have shown unparalleled courage in their active participation in the Sudanese revolution. I want to announce from this rostrum that during the transitional period the Government is committed to eliminating all forms of institutional and social discrimination against women. We have already begun taking practical measures to do that. Today two of the 11 members of the Sovereign Council are women, one of them a Coptic Christian from a small community. We are very proud that for the first time in our modern history we have a woman Foreign Minister.\nYoung men and women, who make up a majority of the Sudanese people, were the most affected by the Sudan\u2019s overall collapse during the past three dark decades. They were left to die in death boats on unregulated migration routes in their quest for ways of salvation and forced to participate in civil wars. It is time to end that situation forever. The young men and women of the Sudan brought about this revolution and they will create their own future according to their own desires, and the State will be there to help them.\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate that we are committed to achieving the goals of our revolution and translating our legitimate aspirations into solid reality so that in the coming years the Sudan can regain the status that it naturally deserves, one befitting our peoples\u2019 civilizations and glorious history. With an open mind, we call on the international community and all States Members of the United Nations to join us in building a new world of prosperity, peace and love among the peoples of the world, in line with the slogan of our glorious revolution \u2014 freedom, peace and justice.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my distinct honour and privilege to take the floor during the general debate at the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of the Republic of Mozambique, who is unable to attend this august gathering owing to national imperatives and a complicated schedule.\nI would like to take this opportunity to warmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on his election as President of General Assembly at the current session. We offer him Mozambique\u2019s unequivocal support during his term. We also hail Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, President of the Assembly at its seventy-third session, for her work and the progress achieved during her term, particularly in mobilizing the international community to fulfil international commitments and implement actions that enhance the United Nations as a more relevant space for multilateral coordination on multiple challenges and global commitments.\nI would convey our warm gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his selfless efforts aimed at strengthening the United Nations system by reforming the international peace and security architecture and repositioning the development system to better respond to the aspirations of Member States, with a particular emphasis on implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe seventy-fourth session takes place at a time when the world faces a surge in political, geostrategic and trade tensions, the devastating effects of climate change and an increase in inequality among States and in access to quality basic social services that are essential to sustaining a decent standard of living. Sub-Saharan Africa, where Mozambique is located, is an example of this reality, as we remain the region with the largest number of disadvantaged people facing such multidimensional deprivations as low income and reduced access to education, health, food, water and sanitation, as well as the inadequate provision of socioeconomic infrastructure that drives sustainable development.\nIn that context, the focus of this session\u2019s theme on eradicating poverty is timely, as the issue of poverty challenges all of us and drives agendas all over the world, particularly the 2030 Agenda. To this end, Mozambique reiterates the relevance of the principle of shared but differentiated responsibilities, the need to adhere to that principle and the importance of partners respecting the commitments undertaken under the framework of the internationally agreed development goals, including the predictability of aid flows from our partners in accordance with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.\nIn an environment characterized by growing mistrust among nations, the world continues to be plagued by inequality, tensions and debilitating divisions that challenge the role of multilateralism as the preferred mechanism to debate ideas, coordinate and reach consensus. In keeping with the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, the Organization\u2019s central mission is to forge lasting solutions to put an end to prolonged insecurity caused by political instability and internal and external conflicts involving States and other actors, particularly in the African continent and the Middle East. The prevalence of acts linked to fundamentalism and violent extremism, as well as arms proliferation and trade, particularly in weapons of mass destruction, small arms and light weapons, threaten national, regional and global peace and security and are added causes of concern for our country.\nIn that regard, and under the framework of our peace policy, we support all global initiatives and partnerships, including actions focused on dialogue through international disarmament mechanisms and on combating fundamentalism and related activities, violent extremism and all forms of terrorist acts. Accordingly, Mozambique reiterates its full support for the Secretary-General in his efforts aimed at reforming the United Nations development system as well as his peace and security initiatives to promote dialogue as the fundamental tool in an agenda based on conflict prevention.\nMozambique considers Security Council reform to be a fundamental goal in the framework of the conflict- prevention and management architecture. We reaffirm our wish for the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform to move more quickly so that the Council can achieve greater credibility and legitimacy and better reflect reality in the twenty-first century through a wider membership and broader action.\nIn the light of international law and the United Nations Charter, Mozambique again joins other States in calling for adherence to the United Nations road map for the peaceful resolution of the dispute in Western Sahara through a referendum on the self-determination of the Sahrawi people.\nWe remain concerned about the prevailing situation in the occupied Palestinian territories. In this regard, we reiterate our appeal for a negotiated lasting solution to the Palestinian issue based on dialogue, through which the two States accept to live side-by-side as neighbours in keeping with the principles of peaceful coexistence and international law.\nMozambique reiterates its appeal for the normalization of the political, diplomatic, economic and financial relations between Cuba and the United States of America. The economic blockade against Cuba has no justification in a world that we wish to be more harmonious and committed to a global development agenda devoid of exclusion. We also call for the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and dialogue to help the leaders of both States to find fertile ground and that the legacy of peace, harmony and coexistence be cultivated and transmitted to future generations.\nIn a similar vein, we join the Foreign Minister of Tanzania in his plea for lifting the sanctions against Zimbabwe (see A/74/PV.10). We believe that the people of that country should coexist successfully and harmoniously within the global village.\nMozambique has incorporated the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals into its national governance programme, which gives priority to agribusiness, economic and social infrastructure networks, the expansion of the electric grid\u2019s coverage and ecotourism, which, combined with other cross- cutting efforts in socioeconomic fields, will drive our eagerly desired sustainable development.\nGalvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion is an appeal to our collective responsibility to leave no one behind. In this regard, the Government of Mozambique has adopted an approach focused on protecting and respecting human rights, promoting gender equality and equity, and building the capacity of women, young people and other vulnerable social groups, while keeping in mind the need for Mozambican society to secure a demographic dividend.\nDue to its geographic location, Mozambique is considered by some scientists as the country in the world the second-most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The two extremely severe tropical cyclones \u2014 Cyclones Idai and Kenneth \u2014 which devastated vast regions of our country in March and April, attest to that assertion, with a toll of 689 deaths and the destruction of the economic and social fabric in the central and northern regions of our country, while the south continues to suffer from the effects in 2018 of drought and Cyclone Dineo.\nWe wish to take this opportunity to reiterate our gratitude to all bilateral and multilateral cooperation partners, the Secretary-General and the United Nations system of funds and specialized agencies for their multifaceted support during our emergencies and in the process of rebuilding infrastructure and the socioeconomic fabric affected by the cyclones. Aware that the effects of two cyclones was beyond our country\u2019s capacity to respond, we convened an international donor conference in the city of Beira in May, in coordination with cooperation partners, which resulted in commitments in the amount of $1.2 billion, which is a portion of the $3.2 billion required, according to the estimates of the post-disaster needs assessment.\nThe new Government continues to make efforts aimed at securing resources to fill the reconstruction-financing gap. I once again wish to express our profound gratitude for the pledges of support and solidarity and reiterate our continued readiness to work with our partners to accelerate the process for the disbursement of the pledged aid.\nWe are also committed to strengthening adaptation and resilience measures in line with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which we signed in June 2018, as we are aware that natural disasters driven by climate change have become recurrent phenomena. On behalf of our country, we take this opportunity to express our solidarity with and condolences to the families of the victims of Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas.\nActions to manage the effects of climate change on our country also include strengthening the early- warning system for natural phenomena and mapping vulnerable areas in order to prevent natural disasters and mitigate their consequences. Our actions also include the establishment of risk-response and management structures, the activation of the Mozambique Emergency Relief Fund and joining the risk pool of the African Risk Capacity Insurance Company Limited, a specialized agency of the African Union for assisting participants in recovering from natural disasters.\nIn that regard, we thank the Secretary-General for his wise and timely decision to convene the Climate Action Summit this week so as to mobilize the international community in boosting its ambitions towards achieve the goal of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, with a view to reversing the harmful consequences of global warming, which is a major threat to our planet and humankind.\nWith respect to integrated rural development and the sustainable management of biodiversity, ecosystems and natural resources, Mozambique has made efforts to preserve biodiversity by creating conservation areas covering approximately 25 per cent of the 800,000 square kilometres of its national territory. These actions have been reinforced by the continued increase in the use of cleaner and renewable sources of energy \u2014 natural gas, wind, solar and hydroelectric \u2014 so as to provide energy for all of our citizens by 2030.\nOn 6 August, in Maputo, we signed the Peace and National Reconciliation Agreement, which reflects the success of our internal dialogue and creates the conditions necessary to galvanize the Mozambican development agenda. With that positive step behind us, we express our utmost recognition to the international community, particularly the dialogue facilitators and the contact group, coordinated by the Swiss Ambassador with the support of the United States Ambassador in Maputo, for that historic accomplishment, which cements the consensus reached around the administrative decentralization and military affairs agenda. The disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process currently under way covers aspects related to the command structure and direction of our national defence and security forces in order to achieve that goal.\nWe recognize that the accomplishment of this important process requires a robust technical and financial capacity. For that reason, we take this opportunity to reiterate our appeal to the international community for continued support and assistance in implementing the agreement, particularly in maintaining dialogue as the key platform for resolving disagreements.\nWe wish to share our great happiness at having received, from 4 to 6 September, His Holiness Pope Francis, the Head of the Catholic Church, whose visit, under the theme of \u201cHope, peace and reconciliation\u201d, strengthened our conviction and hope in relation to the consolidation of national unity, peace, harmony and common well-being through continued dialogue among Mozambicans.\nThe full implementation of the agreement will allow our country to further strengthen democracy and hold presidential, legislative and provincial elections on 15 October, motivated by a spirit of peaceful democratic coexistence.\nThe successes we have achieved in our internal dialogues are a positive development in our agenda of achieving permanent peace. However, this positive development was marred by negative forces in the province of Cabo Delgado, in the north of Mozambique, who continue to be a source of concern as they sow death, destroy the socioeconomic fabric and create instability in areas of that region. The Government has vigorously carried out its constitutional duty to protect its citizens and their property as well as the economic and social infrastructure.\nThe restoration of peace in our country bolsters and consolidates our efforts to create an increasingly attractive and favourable environment for public and private investment, both domestic and international. The fiscal and monetary reforms under way in Mozambique have led to an effective recovery of our macroeconomic stability. It was in that context that the city of Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, became the African business capital when it welcomed the twelfth United States-Africa Business Summit, with the participation of African Heads of State and Government, senior representatives of the United States Government, and business leaders from the African continent and the United States of America. We would further highlight the convening of the international \u201cGrowing Blue\u201d conference in Maputo, which focused on the sustainable use of the oceans and seas under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These and the other events that we have hosted are part of the economic diplomacy that we are pursuing, which we wish to make more active and intensify in order to bring tangible benefits to our country and the entire nation of Mozambique.\nI will conclude my remarks by reaffirming Mozambique\u2019s trust in the United Nations as a privileged platform for multilateral coordination in the quest for solutions to the common challenges facing humankind. Let us demonstrate, today, tomorrow and always, our spirit of cohesion in the noble mission of globally promoting the triad of peace and security, development and human rights for the advancement and well-being of the peoples of our wonderful planet."

        "file_text": "At the outset, it gives me pleasure to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, and to wish you every success.\nI also express our appreciation to Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces for her efforts in leading the work of the General Assembly during its seventy-third session.\nWe appreciate as well the efforts of Secretary- General Antonio Guterres to enhance the role of the United Nations and achieve its lofty goals.\nThe world is facing enormous and diverse cross- border challenges between peoples and States that require multilateral action, especially to address threats to international peace and security, environmental issues, sustainable development, asylum and migration.\nRegarding international peace and security, nothing can replace the wisdom of leaders \u2014 especially among the major Powers \u2014 who embrace the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. All that we can do is use the mechanisms adopted by the international community for collective security, deter those who violate international law, ensure respect for the sovereignty and security of States, prohibit the occupation or annexation of the territory of others by force or attempts to change their nature, and prevent armed conflict through the peaceful resolution of disputes.\nThe strategic importance of the Gulf region makes stability in our region an imperative issue at the regional and international levels. We stress our firm position that the region should be kept risk-free by resolving differences through dialogue based on common interests and respect for the sovereignty of its States. Provoking tensions and dictating conduct through the use of blockades and sanctions are not in the interests of any of the States of the region. I have previously pointed out the need to establish a regional security system that preserves the security and stability of the Middle East in general and the Gulf region in particular. Current events confirm the importance of that idea and the need to achieve it.\nThe unjust, unlawful and unjustified blockade imposed by some countries against the State of Qatar continues. The Gulf Cooperation Council was the second victim of the blockade, which paralysed it and robbed of its role in the region.\nWhen I stood here before the Assembly two years ago, three months after the imposition of the blockade, I was confident in the steadfastness of the Qatari people and that we could overcome the blockade\u2019s effects (see A/72/PV.4). I was even confident they we would take advantage of the challenge imposed on us despite the price we paid.\nI have also been confident, since the first day of the campaign of incitement and distortion which preceded the blockade, that Gulf, Arab and world public opinion would come to realize the hidden agenda of the propaganda campaign against the State of Qatar, which is driven by a tendency towards domination, a desire to impose influence and control over the potential of other States and the objective of making false accusations that are quickly proven wrong. That has indeed happened, as was the case when that approach was repeatedly exposed in the past after other States fell victim to it.\nIn line with our firm policy of respect for international law and the peaceful resolution of differences and disputes, and having endured aggression, we emphasize our position that unconditional dialogue based on mutual respect and the lifting of the unjust blockade is the only means to end the crisis. We reiterate our deep appreciation for the sincere efforts of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the Amir of the sisterly State of Kuwait, and the endeavours of sisterly and friendly countries to resolve the crisis.\nThe ongoing Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and of Arab territories in general, as well as associated unlawful practices, in particular the expansion of settlements, the Judaification of the city of Jerusalem, the unjust and repressive blockade of the Gaza Strip and the intensification of settlement activity in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights leading to a change in its nature, are taking place in overt defiance of the United Nations and its resolutions, to the extent that Israel has come to regard the airspace of the countries of the region as open to it. How long will the international community remain unable to enforce respect for itself when it comes to Palestine?\nIt has been proven that settling differences by force can only lead to occupation based on force. However, permanent peace is based on justice, which entails guaranteeing the rights of the Palestinian people whose homeland has been usurped and who have the absolute right to the establishment of a Palestinian State within the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, as well as the ending of the Israeli occupation of all occupied Arab lands, including the Syrian Golan Heights and the Lebanese territories. Qatar will continue to support any effort to realize a just peace and to provide political and humanitarian support to the brotherly Palestinian people.\nThe tragedy of the Syrian people and their continuous suffering for the past eight years has become a major scandal and a disgrace to humankind. What makes that human crisis all the more dangerous is the absence of a clear vision for its resolution, compounded by the continued killings, destruction, displacement and international indifference.\nWe are all aware that the main responsibility for the failure to impose a political solution, which we would all like to have for Syria, is the inability of the Security Council to protect civilians and make the necessary decisions to stop the bloodshed and the continued intransigence of the Syrian regime and its rejection of all regional and international initiatives. Everyone listening to me now knows that when we refer to the Security Council, we mean the major Powers.\nIt is high time for the Syrian people to enjoy security, a decent life and justice through a political solution that fulfils the aspirations of all segments of the population in line with the 2012 Geneva communique (S/2012/522, annex) and Security Council resolutions, including resolution 2254 (2015). That would preserve the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Syria, while upholding justice by holding accountable, in keeping with the international law, those who commit atrocities against civilians. The State of Qatar will continue to fulfil its humanitarian obligations by providing political support and humanitarian aid to the brotherly people of Syria in order to alleviate their suffering.\nAs for our brotherly Yemen, we stress its unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty, as well as the need to conclude the political process in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions, specifically resolution 2216 (2015).\nIn that regard, I emphasize that the outcome of the National Dialogue Conference in January 2014, in which all the Yemeni parties participated, provided equitable and fair solutions to all the issues related to the ongoing fighting, including the system of government, the State\u2019s federal structure and the issue of the south. The parties reached those solutions by way of dialogue among themselves. Until Yemenis implement the solutions they have reached without foreign intervention, there is nothing to be done but support United Nations efforts to end the war and support its humanitarian and relief efforts.\nThe latest developments in Libya threaten national unity and stability. The recent military operations against the capital Tripoli have thwarted the comprehensive National Conference \u2014 yet another failure of the collective security system in the Middle East caused by double standards and selectivity in the implementation of international law resulting from some countries supporting the military militias against the legitimate Government.\nThe militias do not hesitate to commit war crimes against civilians. We call for the perpetrators of such crimes to be held accountable and for the legitimate, internationally recognized Government of National Accord to be supported with a view to enabling it to discharge all its functions, putting an end to the suffering of the Libyan people and restoring security and stability across Libya.\nThe Libyan people have paid a high price for their liberty but have not reaped the fruits of their struggle and sacrifices and have grown tired of the chaos despite international efforts and an internationally recognized settlement. Why is it not being implemented? Because certain countries do not practise what they preach. They formally participate in international efforts while undermining those efforts by supporting warlords and terrorist militias for the benefit of their narrow interests. We call on all actors in Libya to assume their responsibilities and respect the will of the Libyan people for a peaceful solution. We caution that interference in Libyan affairs further complicates the crisis, impedes national reconciliation and goes against Security Council resolutions.\nWith the help of God, Qatar continues to provide a space for dialogue and support for reconciliation based on rational and equitable solutions to crises and armed conflicts. We hosted negotiations between the United States and the Taliban. Before the United States decided to hold those negotiations, significant progress had been made between the two sides to achieve peace in Afghanistan. We call on the international community and in particular on the States of the region to join their efforts to achieve peace and stability in that country.\nDevelopments over the past year in more than one country in our region have proven that repression and crimes against humanity, whose perpetrators have tried in vain to block the course of history, have not diminished people\u2019s aspirations for justice and human dignity or the aspirations of Arab young people for a better future. They have also proven that gradual reform is the best path to change in countries with complex societies in what is a complicated region. Had some regimes opted for reforms in response to the aspirations of their people, they would have saved themselves enormous losses and the lives of countless victims.\nIn that regard, we value the steps taken and agreements reached between the Sudanese parties. We are confident that the Sudanese people are capable of moving beyond the ongoing sensitive transitional phase. We renew our commitment and stand alongside our brethren people of the Sudan, and call on all regional and international Powers to support the Sudan in realizing the aspirations of its people for security, stability and development. I also call on the Administration of the United States to remove the Sudan from the list of States that sponsor terrorism.\nThe combination of terrorism and violent extremism has become a major threat to the entire world. The eradication of terrorism requires a comprehensive approach that includes tackling its political, economic and social roots, in addition to taking preventive and military action.\nWe reiterate our condemnation of all forms of terrorism and our support for combating them. In that regard, many countries have begun to realize the mistake of linking terrorism to a particular religion after experiencing racially or ideologically motivated terrorist acts. There is a political and moral imperative to stop confining terrorism to certain individuals and groups and to consider all crimes against unarmed civilians committed by States as State terrorism. We all know what is happening in Syria, Palestine and Libya. It is also necessary to distinguish between terrorism and resistance against occupation.\nThe State of Qatar will continue to actively participate in international efforts to combat violent extremism. In that respect, I note the conclusion of a partnership agreement between the State of Qatar and the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism and our contribution of $75 million to strengthen the capacity of that Office, as well the opening of the international centre on applying behavioural insights to preventing and countering violent extremism, as well as the partnership agreement between the Silatech institution in Qatar and the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force for capacity-building and launching projects in the Arab region aimed at preventing terrorism.\nLocally, efforts are continuing at the legislative level and so is our support for national counter- terrorism institutions \u2014 to the point where they have become a model to be followed at the regional level. Qatar is playing an active role today in implementing the counter-terrorism mechanisms adopted by the international community.\nAlthough the use of communications technology is of the utmost importance in our modern world in the security, economic, commercial and other fields, the misuse of that technology is threatening the security of States and the cordial relations among them ,and is also infringing on the private lives of individuals and causing economic damage. As the Assembly may know, Qatar News Agency has been prey to digital piracy and espionage.\nMindful of the growing importance of that issue, I renew my proposal of last year (see A/73/PV.6) in calling for an international conference to examine means of regulation in that area by international law. I would like to express the readiness of the State of Qatar to host such a conference under the auspices of the United Nations and to make every effort alongside international partners to ensure its success.\nWe are all aware that the effects of climate change are a common concern of the international community and pose an existential threat to some countries. They also have a negative impact on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the quality of human life. Despite the different situations and circumstances among countries, we need international cooperation today more than ever and must ensure the credibility of multilateral action to counter the challenges of climate change. In that connection, the State of Qatar has assumed an active role in international efforts on climate change \u2014 in partnership with France, Jamaica and the United Nations \u2014 and has led the coalition on climate finance and carbon-pricing.\nThe State of Qatar has pursued a consistent policy to protect and promote human rights on the basis of our Arab and Islamic principles and values, which affirm human worth. In that regard, we honour our commitments at the national and international levels to defend individual and collective rights and ensure respect for human rights and dignity. Qatar has made significant achievements in terms of workers\u2019 rights and work conditions, in coordination with the International Labour Organization.\nThe success of the United Nations in addressing common challenges depends on the implementation by Member States of their commitments and responsibilities. In that regard, the State of Qatar has concluded partnerships with many United Nations organs and Doha will soon host the United Nations House, which includes offices of various agencies of the Organization concerned with peace, development, human rights, the rule of law, humanitarian action, counter-terrorism and combating extremism, so as to enable them to optimize the performance of their functions.\nThe State of Qatar has recently announced its support for the core resources of the United Nations, with the allocation of $500 million in addition to the support that we have already provided. Qatar is now one of the biggest donor partners supporting the United Nations in various fields.\nIn conclusion, I renew our commitment to multilateral international action, partnership and cooperation in the interest of our peoples and the good of humankind.\nMay peace and God\u2019s mercy and blessings be upon those present.\n"

        "file_text": "I stand here deeply moved at the coincidence that I should speak following my counterpart, the Foreign Minister of Botswana, given that my grandfather, Z. K. Matthews, stood here in 1966 as the first Ambassador of the newly independent Botswana.\nI represent the President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa as I stand here today. I wish on behalf of South Africa to congratulate you, Sir, on your leadership of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. We are pleased to see a leader from our sister country Nigeria preside over the Assembly at its seventy-fourth session. I assure you of South Africa\u2019s full support as you implement your priorities and responsibilities during your term in office.\nWe thoroughly welcome the theme that you have chosen. It is indeed timely and relevant, especially given the complex challenges facing the world today. Far too many of the world\u2019s population remain poor, jobless and hopeless. It is imperative that we intensify efforts directed at fundamentally changing their lives.\nThis debate holds special significance for South Africa as it coincides with the twenty-fifth anniversary of South Africa\u2019s freedom and democracy. Our anniversary is due in large measure to the solidarity we enjoyed from most States Members of the United Nations, and it is because of this history that South Africa is also vested in the ideal of a robust and coherent United Nations as it is this Organization that has the ability to ensure that all who yearn for freedom achieve it. We know from our experience and history that it will only be through the determined efforts of the United Nations family that freedom for the people of Palestine can be achieved and only through the United Nations family that the Sahrawi people can enjoy freedom.\nAs early as 1946, shortly after the creation of the United Nations, the issue of apartheid South Africa\u2019s discriminatory policies was included as an item on the agenda of the first session of the General Assembly. It was therefore with no great surprise that a democratic South Africa eagerly pursued its new international role and enthusiastically took up its responsibilities as an active Member of the United Nations.\nWe have sought to participate in all aspects of the United Nations, including by serving in its principal organs. The principles that motivate our action derive from a firm belief in multilateralism, especially a global governance system that is fair, equitable and representative; the promotion of peace and security through global disarmament, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the promotion of good governance; the promotion of human rights; and the fight against poverty through the promotion of sustainable development. We strongly believe that a purposive system of multilateralism is necessary to deal with the global challenges we confront us. We are all interdependent in an ever more globalized world, and we can ill afford the pursuit of narrow self-interests.\nToday, South Africa is able to partner with the United Nations in addressing the injustice and imbalances that are a legacy of our past. As Government and civil society in South Africa, we respect and act on the decisions of the United Nations. This includes actions in response to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which articulate a transformative global development agenda. South Africa\u2019s National Development Plan 2030 is the policy we have adopted to execute our commitment to achieving the SDGs. Our Plan complements our efforts to support peace, development and security on our continent and the aspirations contained in Agenda 2063 of the African Union (AU).\nWe believe that, in order to achieve these goals, all Member States should establish partnerships, primarily with the private sector and civil society organizations, to ensure a joint commitment aimed at realizing a world free of poverty and underdevelopment.\nOne of the greatest obstacles to building a world free of poverty and inequality is intolerance. This includes intolerance of other nations and intolerance of our fellow human beings, as well as inadequate care for the natural environment that sustains us all. Intolerance is exhibited most gruesomely by the evidence of gender-based violence and the exclusion of women from many sectors in society. Our country, South Africa, is taking urgent steps to address the scars of gender-based violence. All of us need to act urgently to ensure that we all enjoy full access to our human rights and that all our citizens, in particular, women, enjoy bodily security. We also face an existential threat due to our intolerance and the disrespect and veritable violence we inflict on the planet on which we all depend.\nThe Organization, however, is a manifestation of the rejection of intolerance. It was created in the aftermath of a devastating world war as a global forum where nations of the world can address differences and work together for the common good of all people. Our annual gathering here in the Assembly Hall should provide us an opportunity to recommit to these important values.\nI firmly believe that we are all here because we are committed to the ideal of multilateral solutions to the world\u2019s problems, which draws on strength through diversity \u2014 diversity of perspective born from differences in upbringing and culture. By being here, therefore, we recognize that we need each other and that we need to work together. We must therefore use this opportunity to rally against intolerance of any kind so that nations can live in peace and respect each other irrespective of nationality, religion, ethnic or social origin, gender or any other status. It is through our differences that we should find strength and not division.\nUnfortunately, our country, South Africa, has not been immune from evidence of intolerance and division in some parts of our nation. The incidents of violence and looting that erupted in parts of Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces were regrettable and shameful for a nation with such a proud history of struggle and international solidarity and support. The Government of South Africa strongly condemned these tragic actions and is working hard to ensure we address the security lapses and intolerance that led to the violence. We are working tirelessly to tackle crime and lawlessness and to ensure that the arrested criminals face the full might of the law.\nWe are also committed to addressing the inadequacy of our immigration administration in order to curb illegal migration and to make sure that everyone who comes to South Africa is documented and safe. We plan to work with all countries of the continent to ensure that we implement our development strategies and use them to create greater economic opportunities for all our people so as to diminish feelings of resentment and antipathy. Working with civil society, we will build bridges allowing all who live in South Africa to reach out to each other in order to build bonds of friendship and pan-Africanism.\nI am pleased that I can honestly confirm to this important global body that South Africa has an unwavering commitment to our continent, Africa. We have made dedicated efforts to contribute positively in support of peace and development on our continent, and we will continue those efforts even as we work to address the inadequacies I have referred to.\nOur country, South Africa, has enjoyed democracy for 25 years, and in that time the leaders and the people of South Africa have consistently acknowledged the immeasurable contribution that the people of Africa rendered in support of the struggle against apartheid. Our neighbouring States in particular, and the rest of the countries of Africa made great sacrifices in support of the liberation movements and the oppressed citizens of South Africa.\nWe wish to reiterate that South Africa does not condone any form of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia or related intolerance. In fact, South Africa has embraced millions of migrants and refugees from all over the continent of Africa, and the majority of our people have warmly embraced their brothers and sisters from the continent. We are determined to ensure that it becomes a national embrace and is not a limited to some communities.\nIt is an honour for us to address the General Assembly in the first year of the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace, which the Assembly last year agreed would run from 2019 to 2028. The Decade calls on us to intensify our efforts to pursue international peace and security, development and human rights. South Africa therefore commits to use the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace to promote the strengthening of multilateralism and diplomacy as effective tools for addressing the challenges facing the world today.\nWe cannot decisively deal with the threats of poverty unless we transform the current structure of the global economy, which continues to perpetuate divisions between the global North and global South. While a few enjoy the benefits of globalization, the majority of the people of the world have not reaped those benefits. It is necessary for us all to work together and spare no effort in addressing the challenges brought by the impact of globalization and the untransformed structure of global economy.\nThe issues of global peace and security continue to be one of our foremost priorities within the United Nations family. In that regard, we welcome the United Nations efforts to address the plethora of challenges to peace and security that serve as a major obstacle to our efforts of the development of the continent.\nWe are currently serving as a member of the Security Council. The theme for our term is \u201cContinuing the legacy: working for a just and peaceful world\u201d. That is the embodiment of the legacy of Nelson Mandela and furthers the objective of silencing the guns on the African continent by 2020. We are using our tenure to promote the maintenance of international peace and security and advocate for the peaceful settlement of disputes and inclusive dialogue. We continue to encourage closer cooperation between the Security Council and other regional and subregional organizations, particularly our African Union.\nWe further emphasize the role of women in the resolution of conflict. We argue for a gender perspective to be mainstreamed into all Security Council resolutions, in line with Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, which was adopted at the initiative of our neighbour Namibia. Despite the commitments in the resolution, women remain excluded from peace processes, including in the drafting of peace agreements, and their involvement in United Nations peacekeeping is limited. We need to ensure that women are fully part of peacebuilding processes and form a part of the institutions that are established once conflict has been eradicated. In October, we will preside over the Security Council\u2019s debate on that subject. The emphasis of the debate should be to ensure the implementation of the commitments that we have made to fully implementing the women and peace and security agenda.\nAs we have consistently stated, South Africa is supportive of this global institution and a rules-based multilateral system, but we believe that the United Nations remains hamstrung by the fact that it continues to have structures that are undemocratic and anachronistic. We remain gravely concerned that 74 years after the founding of the United Nations, key decisions on peace and security are the de facto domain of only five countries. Twenty years of discussions on reform of the Security Council have yielded no movement towards a more representative and inclusive body.\nWe believe that the time has come for the broader membership to heed the overwhelming call for Africa to obtain at least two permanent seats, with all the prerogatives of permanent membership, as well as five non-permanent seats, as embodied in the Common African Position, adopted in the Ezulwini Consensus. In that regard, we must see an invigoration of the negotiations on reform at the intergovernmental negotiations, including by ensuring that we move to text-based negotiations.\nOur continent Africa has reached an important milestone with the adoption and launch of the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement. The agreement entered into force on 30 May, and we are confident that it will unleash Africa\u2019s economic potential and consolidate its position as a new frontier of economic growth and development. It is a flagship imitative of the AU Agenda 2063, and the trade opportunities it creates must be taken up by all member States and our partners. We are ready to engage in active deliberations on that bold step.\nWe wish to stress that Africa\u2019s development cannot be addressed without responding to illicit financial flows. We believe that those debilitate our efforts to generate sufficient domestic resources to support our development. We propose that we work together as the international community to establish an intergovernmental framework that would have a universal political mandate, which would serve as a basis to address those illicit flows, including speeding up the return of assets.\nThe international community stands at a unique crossroads where the shifting international order has the ability to shape international peace and security for decades to come. It is therefore a great disappointment that we witnessed the demise of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in August. Furthermore, in the prevailing international climate, successes in the field of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, are few and far between. The threats posed by those weapons are too great for the international community to ignore. We believe that only the complete, transparent, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of such weapons and their means of delivery can prevent their use in an escalating conflict.\nWe feel ashamed by the fact that for over 70 years, the people of Palestine have lived under occupation. In the past year, that occupation has worsened, with continued illegal settlement activity and further insecurity for the peoples of Palestine and Israel. As the international community, we must continue to urge for a negotiated settlement to that long-standing conflict.\nThe United Nations must remain seized by the issue of Western Sahara, for the benefit of its people and Africa\u2019s aspirations to a truly free Africa, with no country under colonial and imperial control.\nWe also reiterate our steadfast solidarity with the Government and people of Cuba, while condemning the continuation of unilateral sanctions against Cuba and Zimbabwe.\nI wish to conclude by affirming that South Africa stands ready to work with all Member States to promote the United Nations and its objectives of promoting international peace and security, development and human rights enjoyed by all, so that finally we can reach a point when all our people enjoy freedom, development and democracy."

        "file_text": "Seven decades of history have passed through this Hall in all of their richness and drama. From where I stand, the world has heard from presidents and premiers, even at the height of the Cold War. We have seen the foundation of nations. We have seen the ringleaders of revolution. We have beheld saints who inspired us with hope, rebels who steered us with passion and heroes who emboldened us with courage, all here to share plans, proposals, visions and ideas on the world\u2019s biggest stage.\nLike those who met us before, our time is one of great contests, high stakes and clear choices. The essential divide that runs all around the world and throughout history is once again thrown in to stark relief. It is the divide between those whose thirst for control deludes them into thinking they are destined to rule over others and those people and nations who want only to rule themselves.\nI have the immense privilege of addressing the General Assembly today as the elected leader of a nation that prizes liberty, independence and self-government above all. The United States, after having spent over $2.5 trillion since my election to completely rebuild our great military, is also by far the world\u2019s most powerful nation. Hopefully, it will never have to use this power. Americans know that, in a world where others seek conquest and domination, our nation must be strong in wealth, in might and in spirit. That is why the United States rigorously defends the traditions and customs that have made us who we are.\nLike my beloved country, each nation represented in this Hall has a cherished history, culture and heritage that is worth defending and celebrating, and which gives us our singular potential and strength. The free world must embrace its national foundations. It must not attempt to erase them or replace them. Looking around and all over this large, magnificent planet, the truth is plain to see. If you want freedom, take pride in your country. If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty. And if you want peace, love your nation.\nWise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country first. The future does not belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots. The future belongs to sovereign and independent nations that protect their citizens, respect their neighbours and honour the differences that make each country special and unique. That is why we in the United States have embarked on an exciting programme of national renewal. In everything we do, we are focused on empowering the dreams and aspirations of our citizens.\nThanks to our pro-growth economic policies, our domestic unemployment rate reached its lowest level in over half a century. Fuelled by massive tax cuts and regulations cuts, jobs are being produced at a historic rate. Six million Americans were added to the employment rolls in under three years. Last month, African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian- American unemployment reached their lowest rates ever recorded. We are marshalling our nation\u2019s vast energy abundance, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. Wages are rising, incomes are soaring and 2.5 million Americans have been lifted out of poverty in less than three years.\nAs we rebuild the unrivalled might of the American military, we are also revitalizing our alliances by making it very clear that all of our partners are expected to pay their fair share of the tremendous defence burden that the United States has borne in the past. At the centre of our vision for national renewal is an ambitious campaign to reform international trade. For decades, the international trading system has been easily exploited by nations acting in very bad faith. As jobs were outsourced, a small handful grew wealthy at the expense of the middle class.\nIn America the result was 4.2 million lost manufacturing jobs and $15 trillion in trade deficits over the last quarter-century. The United States is now taking decisive action to end this grave economic injustice. Our goal is simple. We want balanced trade that is both fair and reciprocal. We have worked closely with our partners in Mexico and Canada to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement with a brand new and, hopefully, bipartisan United States-Mexico-Canada agreement. Tomorrow I will join Prime Minister Abe of Japan to continue our progress in finalizing a terrific new trade deal. As the United Kingdom makes preparations to exit the European Union, I have made clear that we stand ready to complete an exceptional new trade agreement with the United Kingdom that will bring tremendous benefits to both our countries. We are working closely with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on a magnificent new trade deal.\nThe most important difference in America\u2019s new approach to trade concerns our relationship with China. In 2001, China was admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Our leaders at that time argued that that decision would compel China to liberalize its economy and strengthen protections against things that were unacceptable to us and in support of private property and the rule of law.\nTwo decades later, that theory has been tested and proven completely wrong. Not only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, but it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy State subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property and trade secrets on a grand scale.\nAs just one example, I recently met the Chief Executive Officer of a terrific American company, Micron Technology, at the White House. Micron produces memory chips used in countless electronics. To advance the Chinese Government\u2019s five-year economic plan, a company owned by the Chinese State allegedly stole Micron\u2019s designs, valued at up to $8.7 billion. Soon the Chinese company obtained patents for a nearly identical product, and Micron was banned from selling its own goods in China. But we are seeking justice.\nThe United States lost 60,000 factories after China entered the WTO. That is happening to other countries all over the globe. The World Trade Organization needs drastic change. The second-largest economy in the world should not be permitted to declare itself a developing country in order to game the system at others\u2019 expense. For years, those abuses were tolerated, ignored or even encouraged. Globalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders, causing them to ignore their own national interests.\nBut as far as America is concerned, those days are over. To confront those unfair practices, I placed massive tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese-made goods. Already, as a result of those tariffs, supply chains are relocating back to America and other nations and billions of dollars are being paid to our Treasury.\nThe American people are absolutely committed to restoring balance to our relationship with China. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement that would be beneficial for both countries. But as I have made very clear, I will not accept a bad deal for the American people.\nAs we endeavour to stabilize our relationship, we are also carefully monitoring the situation in Hong Kong. The world fully expects that the Chinese Government will honour its binding treaty made with the British and registered with the United Nations, in which China commits to protecting Hong Kong\u2019s freedom, legal system and democratic ways of life. How China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in future. We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader. The United States does not seek conflict with any other nation. We desire peace, cooperation and mutual gain with all. But I will never fail to defend America\u2019s interests.\nOne of the greatest security threats facing peace-loving nations today is the repressive regime in Iran. The regime\u2019s record of death and destruction is well known to us all. Not only is Iran the number one State sponsor of terrorism, but Iran\u2019s leaders are fuelling the tragic wars in both Syria and Yemen. At the same time, the regime is squandering the nation\u2019s wealth and future in a fanatical quest for nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. We must never allow that to happen.\nTo stop Iran\u2019s path to nuclear weapons and missiles, I withdrew the United States from the terrible Iran nuclear deal, which has very little time remaining. It did not allow inspection of important sites and did not cover ballistic missiles. Following our withdrawal, we implemented severe economic sanctions on the country. Hoping to free itself from sanctions, the regime has escalated its violent and unprovoked aggression. In response to Iran\u2019s recent attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, we just imposed the highest level of sanctions on Iran\u2019s central bank and sovereign wealth fund.\nAll nations have a duty to act. No responsible Government should subsidize Iran\u2019s bloodlust. As long as Iran\u2019s menacing behaviour continues, sanctions will not be lifted; they will be tightened. Iran\u2019s leaders will have turned a proud nation into just another cautionary tale of what happens when a ruling class abandons its people and embarks on a crusade for personal power and riches.\nFor 40 years, the world has listened to Iran\u2019s rulers as they lash out at everyone else for the problems they alone have created. They conduct ritual chants of \u201cDeath to America\u201d and traffic in monstrous anti-Semitism. Last year, the country\u2019s Supreme Leader stated: Israel is a malignant, cancerous tumour that has to be removed and eradicated: it is possible and it will happen.\nAmerica will never tolerate such anti-Semitic hate. Fanatics have long used the hatred of Israel to distract from their own failures. Thankfully, there is a growing recognition in the wider Middle East that the countries of the region share common interests in battling extremism and unleashing economic opportunity. That is why it is so important to have full normalized relations between Israel and its neighbours. Only a relationship built on common interests, mutual respect and religious tolerance can forge a better future.\nIran\u2019s citizens deserve a Government that cares about reducing poverty, ending corruption and increasing jobs, not stealing their money to fund massacres at home and abroad. After four decades of failure, it is time for Iran\u2019s leaders to step forward and stop threatening other countries and focus on building up their own country. It is time for Iran\u2019s leaders to finally put the Iranian people first.\nAmerica is ready to embrace friendship with all who genuinely seek peace and respect. Many of America\u2019s closest friends today were once our greatest foes. The United States has never believed in permanent enemies. We want partners, not adversaries. America knows that, while anyone can make war, only the most courageous can choose peace. For the same reason, we have pursued bold diplomacy on the Korean peninsula. I have told Kim Jong Un what I truly believe \u2014 that, like Iran, his country is full of tremendous untapped potential, but that in order to realize that promise North Korea must denuclearize.\nAround the world our message is clear \u2014 America\u2019s goal is lasting harmony, and not to go on with these endless wars. With that goal in mind, my Administration is also pursuing the hope of a brighter future in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the Taliban has chosen to continue their savage attacks. We will continue to work with our coalition of Afghan partners to stamp out terrorism, and we will never stop working to make peace a reality.\nHere in the Western hemisphere we are joining with our partners to ensure stability and opportunity all across the region. In that mission, one of our most critical challenges is illegal immigration, which undermines prosperity, rips apart societies and empowers ruthless criminal cartels.\nMass illegal migration is unfair, unsafe and unsustainable for everyone involved. The sending countries become depleted very fast, their young people are not taken care of and human capital goes to waste. The receiving countries are overburdened with more migrants than they can responsibly accept, and the migrants themselves are exploited, assaulted and abused by vicious coyotes. Nearly one third of women who make the journey north to our border are sexually assaulted along the way.\nYet here in the United States and around the world there is a growing cottage industry of radical activists and non-governmental organizations that promote human smuggling. Those groups encourage illegal migration and demand the erasure of national borders.\nToday I have a message for those open-border activists who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of social justice: your policies are not just; your policies are cruel and evil; you are empowering criminal organizations that prey on innocent men, women and children; you put your own false sense of virtue before the lives and well-being of countless innocent people; when you undermine border security, you are undermining human rights and human dignity.\nMany of the countries represented here today are coping with the challenges of uncontrolled migration. Every country has the absolute right to protect its borders. And so, of course, does our country. Today we must resolve to work together to end human smuggling and human trafficking and put those criminal networks out of business for good.\nOur country, I can tell the Assembly sincerely, is working closely with our friends in the region, including Mexico, Canada, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Panama, to uphold the integrity of borders and ensure safety and prosperity for our people. I would like to thank President Lopez Obrador of Mexico for the great cooperation we are receiving and for right now putting 27,000 troops on our southern border. Mexico is showing us great respect, and I respect them in return.\nIn the United States we have taken unprecedented action to stop the flow of illegal immigration. I implore anyone thinking of crossing our border illegally to please hear these words: do not pay the smugglers; do not pay the coyotes; do not put yourself in danger; do not put your children in danger because, if you make it here, you will not be allowed in; you will be promptly returned home; you will not be released into our country. As long as I am President of the United States, we will enforce our laws and protect our borders.\nFor all of the countries of the Western hemisphere, our goal is to help people invest in the bright futures of their own nations. Our region is full of such incredible promise, dreams waiting to be built and national destinies for all waiting to be pursued. Throughout the hemisphere, there are millions of hard-working, patriotic young people eager to build, innovate and achieve. But those nations cannot reach their potential if a generation of young people abandon their homes in search of a life elsewhere. We want every nation in our region to flourish and its people to thrive in freedom and peace.\nIn that mission we are also committed to supporting those people in the Western hemisphere who live under brutal oppression, such as those in Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. According to a recent report of the Human Rights Council, women in Venezuela stand in line for 10 hours a day waiting for food. More than 15,000 people have been detained as political prisoners. Modern-day death squads are carrying out thousands of extrajudicial killings. The dictator Maduro is a Cuban puppet protected by Cuban bodyguards, hiding from his own people, while Cuba plunders Venezuela\u2019s oil wealth to sustain its own corrupt communist rule.\nSince I last spoke in this Hall (see A/73/PV.6), the United States and our partners have built a historic coalition of 55 countries that recognize the legitimate Government of Venezuela. To the Venezuelans trapped in that nightmare: please know that all of America is united behind you. The United States has vast quantities of humanitarian aid ready and waiting to be delivered. We are watching the situation in Venezuela very closely. We await the day when democracy will be restored, Venezuela will be free and liberty will prevail throughout the hemisphere.\nOne of the most serious challenges our countries face is the spectre of socialism. It is a wrecker of nations and destroyer of societies. Events in Venezuela reminds us all that socialism and communism are not about justice, equality or lifting up the poor, and they are certainly about the good of the nation. Socialism and communism are about one thing only \u2014 power for the ruling class. Today I repeat a message for the world that I have delivered at home: America will never be a socialist country.\nIn the last century socialism and communism killed 100 million people. Sadly, as we see in Venezuela, the death toll continues to rise in that country. Those totalitarian ideologies combined with modern technology had the power to exercise new and disturbing forms of suppression and domination. For that reason, the United States is taking steps to better screen foreign technology and investments and to protect our data and our security. We urge every nation present to do the same. Freedom and democracy must be constantly guarded and protected, both abroad and from within. We must always be sceptical of those who want conformity and control. Even in free nations, we see alarming signs and new challenges to liberty. A small number of social media platforms are acquiring immense power over what we can see and what we are allowed to say. A permanent political class is openly disdainful, dismissive and defiant of the will of the people. A faceless bureaucracy operates in secret and weakens democratic rule. The media and academic institutions make outright assaults on our histories, traditions and values.\nIn the United States, my Administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right to free speech. A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voice of the people, and a free people must never, ever be enlisted in the cause of silencing, coercing, cancelling or blacklisting their own neighbours.\nAs we defend American values, we affirm the right of all people to live in dignity. For that reason, my Administration is working with other nations to stop the criminalization of homosexuality, and we stand in solidarity with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer persons who live in countries that punish, jail or execute individuals based upon sexual orientation.\nWe are also championing the role of women in our societies. Nations that empower women are much wealthier and safer and much more politically stable. It is therefore vital \u2014 not only to a nation\u2019s prosperity but also to its national security \u2014 to pursue women\u2019s economic development. Guided by those principles, my Administration launched the Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative. It is the first- ever Government-wide approach to women\u2019s economic empowerment, which will work to ensure that women all over the planet have the legal right to own and inherit property, work in the same industries as men, travel freely and obtain access to credit and institutions.\nYesterday I was pleased to host leaders for a discussion about an ironclad American commitment to protect religious leaders and religious freedom. That fundamental right is under growing threat around the world. It is hard to believe, but 80 per cent of the world\u2019s population lives in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger, or even completely outlawed. Americans will never tire in our efforts to defend and promote freedom of worship and religion. We want and support religious liberty for all.\nAmericans will also never tire of defending innocent life. We are aware that many United Nations projects have attempted to assert a global right to taxpayer-funded abortion on demand right up until the moment of delivery. Global bureaucrats have absolutely no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that wish to protect innocent life. Like many nations here today, we in America believe that every child, born and unborn, is a sacred gift from God.\nThere is no circumstance under which the United States will allow international actors to trample on the rights of our citizens, including the right to self- defence. That is why I announced this year that we will never ratify the Arms Trade Treaty, which would threaten the liberties of law-abiding American citizens. The United States will always uphold our constitutional right to keep and bear arms. We will always uphold our Second Amendment. The core rights and values America defends today were inscribed in America\u2019s founding documents. Our nation\u2019s founders understood that there will always be those who believe that they are entitled to wield power and control over others.\nTyranny advances under many names and many theories, but it always comes down to the desire for domination. It protects not the interests of many but the privilege of few. Our founders gave us a system designed to restrain that dangerous impulse. They chose to entrust American power to those most invested in the fate of our nation, a proud and fiercely independent people.\nThe true good of a nation can be pursued only by those who love it, by citizens who are rooted in its history, nourished by its culture, committed to its values and attached to its people, and who know that its future is theirs to build or theirs to lose. Patriots see a nation and its destiny in ways no one else can. Liberty is only preserved, sovereignty is only secured, democracy is only sustained and greatness is only realized by the will and devotion of patriots. In their spirit is found the strength to resist oppression, the inspiration to forge legacy, the goodwill to seek friendship and the bravery to reach for peace. Love of our nations makes the world better for all nations.\nI invite all the leaders present here today to join us in the most fulfilling mission a person could have, the most profound contribution anyone can make \u2014 lift up your nations, cherish your culture, honour your histories, treasure your citizens, make your countries strong, prosperous and righteous, honour the dignity of your people, and nothing will be out of your reach.\nWhen our nations are greater, the future will be brighter, our people will be happier and our partnerships will be stronger. With God\u2019s help, together we will cast off the enemies of liberty and overcome the oppressors of dignity. We will set new standards of living and reach new heights of human achievement. We will rediscover old truths, unravel old mysteries and make thrilling new breakthroughs. And we will find more beautiful friendship and more harmony among nations than ever before. The path to peace, progress, freedom, justice and a better world for all humankind begins at home.\nGod bless those present, God bless the nations of the world. And God bless America.\n"
